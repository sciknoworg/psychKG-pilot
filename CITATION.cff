abstract: >
  The psychKG-pilot repository provides scripts and instructions for extracting structured triples from psychology research papers using instruction-tuned large language models. It supports workflows using OpenAI, Hugging Face, Instructor, and Pydantic to build machine-interpretable knowledge graphs that align with the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) framework.
