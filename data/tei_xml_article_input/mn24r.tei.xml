			<abstract>
				<p>Consumers often encounter products featuring assorted components, such as bags of flavored popcorn or flower bouquets. How do they judge the quantity of each component to form overall preferences? Across twelve pre-registered studies, this article shows that spatial positioning significantly shapes judgements of relative quantity. The findings reveal a proximity-to-center bias: When evaluating products with assorted items, consumers tend to perceive a given type of item as more numerous when it appears closer to the center of the display, even when actual quantity is lower. This bias impacted both hypothetical and real choices. Consumers preferred products where the packaging positioned more of the type of item that they liked most, such as a specific popcorn flavor, closer to the center. Remarkably, this preference persisted even when the actual quantity of their favored type was lower. These results suggest that these biases are rooted in selective attention, specifically to the center of the product display. This research highlights the intricate relationship between spatial positioning, quantity judgments, and consumer decisionmaking, offering valuable insights for product design and display strategies.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In consumer decision-making, the pursuit of "more" has long been a central tenet. Aiming to get a better value for their money, consumers often gravitate toward products that offer larger quantities, especially when cost and quality are the same. To meet this preference, marketers often target consumers' perceptions of overall quantity-that is, the total amount of the product. This is evident in the widespread availability of bulk options, such as family-sized packages or supersized variants, along with packaging strategies that create the perception of greater quantity, reflected, for example, in the hollowed-out undersides of wine bottles and extra air in potato chip</p><p>bags.</p><p>Yet, in addition to assessing overall quantity, many products prompt consumers to make a different type of quantity judgment. Products like cookie platters, cheese boards, mixed trail snacks or flower arrangements often consist of assorted items. These products often display the assortment on the packaging, either through a clear window or through stylized images, helping consumers evaluate their contents (see Web Appendix A for real-world examples). In such cases, consumers evaluate not just overall quantity, but also quantity ratiosthe relative amounts of different items within the assortment. These judgments are particularly important because mixed-item products often contain items that vary in value or desirability. For instance, all else being equal, consumers might prefer a bouquet with more roses than carnations because roses are more expensive or appealing, or choose a trail mix with more nuts than raisins if they favor the former (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kurzer et al. 2020)</ref>. As a result, quantity ratio judgments can play a crucial role in purchasing decisions.</p><p>Despite the significance of quantity ratio judgments and the prevalence of products that rely on them, little is known about how consumers assess these ratios or how marketers can shape those perceptions. This research aims to shed light on this issue by applying a newly discovered perceptual bias from cognitive psychology to the consumer context. Specifically, we identify a proximity-to-center bias: In products featuring mixed items, consumers tend to perceive a given type of item as more numerous when it appears closer to the center of the display. Importantly, our findings suggest that this bias not only affects perceptions but also influences purchasing</p><p>intentions.</p><p>In what follows, we briefly review related literature and present the results of twelve preregistered studies that collectively demonstrate the influence of spatial layout on quantity ratio judgments. We conclude by discussing the practical and theoretical implications of these findings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantity Judgments in Consumer Decision-Making</head><p>Estimating quantities is a fundamental cognitive skill shared by both humans and animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brannon and Terrace 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dehaene 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ditz and Nieder 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nieder 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Nieder and Dehaene 2009)</ref> and has been studied extensively in the fields of cognitive science, biology, and education. Although the subject has received less attention in marketing, several studies highlight the importance of quantity estimation for consumers' purchasing and consumption decisions.</p><p>Prior research documents how physical features, such as product size and volume, influence quantity estimation. For example, previous studies suggest that the larger a product's size, the less sensitive consumers are to size changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chandon and Wansink 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Krishna 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">2012)</ref>. This finding aligns with the well-established psychophysics rule of diminishing sensitivity as size increases (i.e., <ref type="bibr">Weber-Fechner's law;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dehaene 2003)</ref>. Furthermore, consumers tend to be less sensitive to changes in product size when changes occur across multiple spatial dimensions (e.g., height, width, and length) compared to a single dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chandon and Ordabayeva 2009)</ref>. This is because consumers often focus their attention on one specific dimension when evaluating size, such as the product's height, while discounting changes along other dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Krider, Raghubir, and Krishna 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Raghubir and Krishna 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Studies on food consumption and obesity have also highlighted the role of perceptual properties in influencing quantity impressions and subsequent choices. Research shows that plate size, for example, influences the amount of food consumers serve themselves and subsequently consume, with larger plates leading to larger portions and increased consumption (DiSantis et al.</p><p>2013; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Freedman and Brochado 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Wansink and Chandon 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wansink, Van Ittersum, and Painter 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2013)</ref>. Additionally, dividing food into smaller pieces can create the perception of a greater quantity, leading to reduced overconsumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bajaj 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Geier, Rozin, and Doros 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Roose, Van Kerckhove, and Huyghe 2017)</ref>. Conversely, serving healthier but less desirable foods as whole pieces rather than diced cubes may make them more appealing to consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Liem and Russell 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceptual Biases in Quantity Estimation</head><p>Ample research finds that people can estimate quantities of objects quite well without counting, even when stimuli are shown very briefly (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cicchini, Anobile and Burr 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">He et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Tokita and Ishiguchi 2010)</ref>. However, quantity judgments are often susceptible to biases that can lead to suboptimal decisions. In particular, the perceptual properties of the display of an assortment of objects can impact the accuracy of observers' judgments about quantities. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ratcliff and McKoon (2018)</ref> conducted a Study where participants were tasked with determining whether there were more blue or yellow dots in an array (i.e., the blue/yellow dot task). They found that participants' judgments were biased by the surface area occupied by each color. Specifically, the color that covered a larger portion of the display tended to be perceived as representing a greater quantity, even when there were not actually more individual objects (i.e., dots) of that color. This suggests that an array of large objects can appear more numerous than an array with the same number of objects in smaller sizes because the former occupies more surface area. This tendency can be attributed to the observation that, in natural settings, larger quantities of objects usually take up more surface area than smaller quantities do. As such, this perceptual cue often serves as a valid external indicator of magnitude, providing a reliable heuristic for forming quantity impressions in real-world scenarios (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">DeWind et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gebuis and Reynvoet 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Im, Zhong, and Halberda 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Leibovich et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Vanunu and Ratcliff (2024)</ref> proposed a new cognitive framework aimed at explaining common effects in numerical judgments with the distribution of attention to various perceptual properties of the display, such as visual size and spatial position. Specifically, they employed the selective sampling account (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Vanunu, Hotaling and Newell 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vanunu et al. 2021)</ref> to reanalyze existing datasets from common numerosity-discrimination tasks, including the blue/yellow task described above. Their goal was to determine which perceptual properties of the display are most likely to capture attention and influence quantity judgments.</p><p>One of the key findings from their reanalysis revealed a novel bias in numerosity judgment.</p><p>They discovered a proximity-to-center bias, whereby dots placed at the center of an intermingled and brief display (300 ms) of blue and yellow dots were more likely to be attended to-and therefore included in quantity estimations-compared to those placed at the periphery. This is because the center of the display is richer in information, providing the optimal vantage point for processing both central and peripheral information (i.e., the central fixation bias <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tatler 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tatler, Baddeley and Gilchrist 2005)</ref>, thereby reducing the cognitive costs associated with evaluating information from the entire display, especially in a brief presentation. As a result, participants consistently demonstrated a bias in estimating quantity ratios, systematically identifying the color closer to the center of the intermingled display as having a larger quantity.</p><p>Consequently, manipulations of the spatial position of the dots relative to the central point of the display produced significant effects on numerical judgment, in some cases reducing performance levels below chance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extending Prior Findings to a Consumer Context</head><p>If a brief display of blue and yellow dots shows a proximity-to-center bias, whereby the color positioned closer to the center appear more numerous, is the same true for more complex objects, like product assortments? A limitation of many basic perceptual stimuli is realism. Simple, clean stimuli such as dots are void of meaning, association, and context, raising the question of whether attentional biases found in these settings emerge in more realistic contexts. In the marketplace, selective attention is shaped by consumer goals and visual saliency <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atalay, Bodur, and Rasolofoarison 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chandon et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Reutskaja et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Towal, Mormann, and Koch 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Vanunu, Urminsky, and Bartels 2024)</ref>. This means that beyond centrality, various properties of product assortments have the potential to attract consumers' attention and impact judgment. For instance, given that nuts have a higher market value than raisins do, consumers evaluating a trail mix may focus on nuts dispersed throughout the package rather than focusing on those shown at the central point.</p><p>Another difference between judgments in the blue/yellow dots task and quantity judgments of consumer goods is the duration of the display. In the original dots task, each display appeared for less than half a second, requiring participants make rapid judgments without prolonged scrutiny or counting. Additionally, participants were not incentivized to give the correct response. Such conditions are rare in real-world shopping contexts, where consumers typically have ample time to evaluate options, and choices are inherently incentivized-the consumer aims to purchase and consume the best option. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that when consumers are motivated to make the best decision and have unlimited time to do so, they are likely to evaluate products more thoroughly and consider factors beyond central positioning, potentially reducing the proximity-to-center bias.</p><p>Finally, even if we observe a proximity-to-center bias in this richer context of product packaging, its influence on consumer choice remains unclear. Prior research finds that consumers often hold position-based beliefs about product layouts-for example, products positioned at the center are often considered more popular (Valenzuela and Raghubir 2009)-and the same might be true for assortments shown on product packaging. Consumers may interpret the centrality of certain items as the company's attempt to highlight the most valuable components, and not necessarily represent their true quantity ratio within the package. As a result, even if greater centrality made a particular item appear more numerous on the package, consumers may interpret this as a signal of its value or popularity rather than an accurate representation of its actual quantity ratio within the package. This paper investigates whether the proximity-to-center bias extends to consumer contexts and explores its potential impact on product preferences. Namely, we examine how consumers' judgments of the relative quantities of items within a product may be biased by selective attention-specifically, toward the center of the display-and whether consumers spontaneously make quantity ratio judgments when choosing between products or estimating their value. Unlike previous research, which focused on quantity comparisons between different products (e.g., snack A vs. snack B), this novel approach explores how quantity judgments of different components within a single product (e.g., nuts vs. raisins) impact purchasing intentions and value perceptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Studies</head><p>In twelve pre-registered studies, we explore how spatial centrality influences consumers' perceptions of the relative quantities of items within a product assortment. Our findings consistently reveal a proximity-to-center bias: consumers tend to perceive items as more numerous when they are placed closer to the center of a product display as opposed to the periphery. This, in turn, may change the perceived value of an assortment and subsequent decisions to purchase it, depending on whether the more or less valuable component is centrally positioned.</p><p>Studies 1a and 1b document the proximity-to-center bias under different time constraints (i.e., limited vs. unlimited display time), and Studies 2a and 2b replicate the effect across various products.</p><p>Studies 3a-3c and 4a-4b explore downstream effects on consumer preferences and value judgments. In Studies 3a-3c, consumers favored options that featured more of their preferred type of item (e.g., a specific popcorn flavor), but even more frequently, they favored options that positioned their preferred item closer to the center of the display. This was true even when the packaging showed less of the participant's preferred type. Study 3b asked participants to explain their decision-making process, and the results suggested that most participants spontaneously estimated the ratio of their preferred item when determining which option they preferred. Study 3c extended these findings to a field setting, highlighting significant implications for real-world decisions.</p><p>Studies 4a and 4b found that a product appeared more expensive when higher-value items were positioned closer to the center. Remarkably, this effect persisted even when it reduced participants' accuracy and thereby cost them a bonus payment.</p><p>We propose that the proximity-to-center bias stems from consumers selectively attending to the center of the display when assessing the relative quantities of the components. This conclusion is supported by Studies 5a and 5b, which demonstrate that the bias can be modulated by directing participants' attention to a specific type of item, or, as shown Study 6, by guiding attention to different regions of the display (center vs. periphery).</p><p>Across all studies, sample size was chosen to exceed the average sample size of the studies that the present work builds on (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ratcliff and Vanunu 2024)</ref>. All pre-registrations, data, code, and materials for all studies are available at tinyurl.com/wtux97ya. Notes: On the left, the caramel popcorn is larger in number and closer to the center of the cover (larger-central condition). On the right, the caramel popcorn is larger in number, but the cheese popcorn is closer to the center of the cover (smaller-central condition).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 1A -1B</head><p>Participants saw a series of depictions of popcorn bags, each featuring a mixture of caramel and cheese-flavored kernels on the cover. They were asked to determine which flavor made up the majority of the kernels in each bag. Participants were able to evaluate each popcorn bag for a very brief period (Study 1a) or for as long as they desired (Study 1b), thereby loosely approximating situations where the consumer's time to evaluate products is limited or unlimited, respectively. Therefore, Study 1a aims to establish the proximity-to-center bias in settings that closely resemble the original blue/yellow task, while Study 1b seeks to extend these findings to a more realistic consumer context without time constraints.</p><p>To investigate the proximity-to-center bias, we manipulated within subjects the arrangement of popcorn kernels on the cover such that one flavor was, on average, closer to the center of the display than the other (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Additionally, we manipulated the number of kernels of each type, with one flavor consistently having more kernels than the other (and thus constituting the majority of kernels in the bag). This meant that participants' judgments could be classified as either correct (selecting the majority flavor to have more kernels) or incorrect (selecting the minority flavor).</p><p>If participants' impressions of the relative quantities of caramel and cheese-flavored kernels are biased by the kernels' proximity to the center of the display, we can expect that accuracy (i.e., the proportion of correct responses) will be higher under certain conditions. Specifically, accuracy should be higher when the flavor with more kernels is also closer, on average, to the center of the display (larger-central condition) compared to when the flavor with fewer kernels is closer (smaller-central condition). This would result from participants systematically identifying the popcorn type that is closer to the center as more numerous, extending the scope of the proximityto-center bias previously found with dots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. We recruited responses from 100 U.S. Prolific Academic workers in Study 1a (50% women; Mage = 40.84) and another 100 Prolific workers in Study 1b (50% women; Mage = 35.30). The only recruitment criteria for this and all other studies was U.S. residency and normal color vision. Studies 1a and 1b were pre-registered at https://aspredicted.org/XQ2_D82 and https://aspredicted.org/LFS_2WV, respectively.</p><p>Procedure. Participants saw a series of illustrated popcorn bags depicting a mixture of caramel and cheese-flavored kernels on the cover, represented by brown and yellow kernels, respectively (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). On each of 20 trials, participants were asked to determine if the bag being displayed contained more caramel or cheese popcorn. They responded by pressing the "z"</p><p>and "m" keys on their keyboard for caramel and cheese, respectively. In other words, all items (in this case, popcorn kernels) were programmed into arrangements that met specific criteria pertaining to quantity, size and placement.</p><p>Namely, to provide a "ground truth" about relative quantities, each bag always contained five more kernels of one type than the other (i.e., 30 caramel vs. 25 cheese, or vice versa). To control for the surface area covered by each flavor, the sizes of kernels in each display were extracted from two Gaussian distributions, with means of 60 and 72 pixels for the flavor with more and fewer kernels, respectively. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distributions was set to 10 pixels for both flavors.</p><p>Critically, to vary spatial location, each display arranged kernels in a pseudo-random fashion such that one flavor (either cheese or caramel) was closer, on average, to the center of the display.</p><p>The average Euclidean distance from the center of the display was 28 pixels smaller for one flavor (e.g., caramel) compared to the other (e.g., cheese). Consequently, the kernels of the flavor that made up the majority on the cover were on average either closer (larger-central condition) or further (smaller-central condition) from the center of the display (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). All kernels appeared on screen at the same time. Note that stimuli were created on the spot for each trial, such that no participant saw the exact same display. This is true for all studies in this paper except Studies 4a-b.</p><p>In Study 1a, each popcorn bag was only displayed for 500ms, followed by a mask intended to briefly reduce the visibility of the image. These features intended to encourage participants to form quick impressions of relative quantity rather than laboriously counting each type of kernel.</p><p>However, to better match most real-world shopping environments, participants in Study 1b could examine each popcorn bag for as long as they wished; display time was unlimited.</p><p>After indicating which flavor they thought was more prevalent, participants received feedback about the accuracy of their judgment (i.e., the words "correct" or "error" briefly flashed on the screen). This feedback component mirrored the experimental design of previous related work <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Vanunu and Ratcliff 2024)</ref>, but it is removed from all subsequent studies in order to better approximate real-world contexts.</p><p>At the end of every study reported in the present paper, we asked participants to reflect on their approach and report how often they counted the items (in this case, popcorn kernels) one-byone. A small number of participants reported counting the items at least some of the time, and across studies, this number ranged between 6% and 19%. For brevity, we include this information in the Web Appendix B, broken down by each response option ("always counted", "counted more than half the time, and "counted less than half the time"). In all studies, restricting our analyses to participants who reported "never counted" did not change the conclusions (see Web Appendix B).</p><p>Therefore, the effects reported here and in the rest of the studies include the proportion of participants who indicated they counted the items one-by-one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1a: Results</head><p>It is important to note that when using organic stimuli, such as caramel and cheese popcorn, non-spatial properties like value, shape, size or color could affect what participants pay attention to and, consequently, influence their quantity judgments. However, our primary focus here is to test how spatial centrality influences quantity estimations across object types. As such, we collapsed trials within each condition based on whether the kernels that were more centrally positioned were also more or less numerous (larger-central and smaller-central conditions, respectively). We then used paired-sample t-tests to examine if the relative centrality of each flavor of kernels influenced accuracy.</p><p>Supporting our hypotheses, we found that centrality produced sizable effects on impressions of quantity ratios. Participants were more likely to indicate that the flavor with more kernels was indeed more numerous-that is, they were more accurate-when that flavor was also closer to the center of the display (M = .68, SD = .20) compared to further from the center (M = .45, SD = .20; t(99) = 7.37, p &lt; .001, d = 0.74). Not surprisingly, accuracy was significantly higher than chance when the more numerous flavor was also more centrally positioned (t(99) = 8.99, p &lt; .001, d = 0.90). But when the more numerous flavor was less central, participants performed significantly worse than chance (t(99) = -2.67, p = .009, d = -0.27).</p><p>Notably, the observed centrality effect on quantity judgment cannot be attributed to increased clustering of one flavor at the center as a confounding factor. Specifically, in a study reported in Web Appendix C, we demonstrate that the centrality effect persists even when clustering of kernels of the same flavor is controlled for.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1b: Results</head><p>The pattern of results of Study 1b replicate those found in Study 1a. Once again, centrality mattered: Participants were more likely to correctly select the flavor with more kernels as being more numerous when those kernels were also closer to the center of the display (M = .75, SD = .20) compared to further away (M = .45, SD = .20; t(99) = 9.28, p &lt; .001, d = 0.93). Moreover, just as in Study 1a, participants performed better than chance when the more numerous flavor was more centrally positioned (t(99) = 12.72, p &lt; .001, d = 1.27), and worse than chance when the more numerous flavor was less central (t(99) = -2.37, p = .020, d = -0.24).</p><p>Taken together, the results from Studies 1a-b suggest that whether they can evaluate the product for as long as desired or must only give it a passing glance, consumers' perceptions of the relative quantities of items of different types are influenced by the items' spatial locationspecifically, their proximity to the center of the display.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 2A -2B</head><p>The next studies probe the generalizability of the proximity-to-center bias found in the previous studies. Study 2a tested the effect for a variety of food and non-food related products, each containing two types of items (e.g., cashews vs. almonds, long vs. wide screws; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> for example assortments). For added complexity, some items were differentiated by multiple properties that might naturally attract attention over and above centrality, such as brightness, shape or value. Study 2b tested the effect in a product that contained more than two types (i.e., six colored candies; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). Notes: Example displays and results for Study 2a, broken down by product and centrality conditions, collapsing across within-product items. Accuracy scores reflect the proportion of trials where participants correctly identified the more numerous type of item to be more numerous. Error bars reflect within-subject standard errors of the mean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2a: Method</head><p>Participants. Two hundred workers from Prolific Academic participated in this study (43% women; Mage = 47.81). The design was identical to that of Study 1b (i.e., unlimited display time), but instead of popcorn, we tested a variety of commonly encountered food and non-food related products. This study was pre-registered at https://aspredicted.org/TLF_NRC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure. Participants reported quantity ratio impressions for five product categories.</head><p>Each product featured two types of items arranged in a pile, and participants had to judge which type was more numerous: yellow versus green bell peppers, yellow versus blue jellybeans, cashews versus almonds, pink versus brown buttons, and long versus wide screws. Images were more realistic than the illustrations used in Studies 1a-b (example assortments are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>), and we manipulated quantity ratios and centrality in the same way. There were four trials for each of the five product conditions, blocked together, with blocks presented in random order. Each block started with instructions tailored to the type of product under consideration (e.g., jellybeans, buttons), guiding participants to make general impressions of quantities rather than counting each object individually. The interested reader may examine the Web Appendix D for specific wording used in this and all studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2a: Results</head><p>Because our primary focus was on assessing the general effect of centrality on quantity judgments, we collapsed trials across the two types of objects (e.g., yellow and green peppers) within centrality conditions and product categories, as we did with caramel and cheese popcorn in Studies 1a-b. We analyzed accuracy in correctly identifying the more numerous object type using a mixed-effect logit regression. This analysis took into account the centrality of that type, the product category (bell peppers, jellybeans, nuts, buttons, and screws), and their interaction as fixed effects. We specified a random intercept of participant.</p><p>The results are consistent with the previous studies, again revealing a proximity-to-center bias. A significant main effect of centrality (χ 2 (1) = 265.54, p &lt; .001, d = 1.20) 1 found that participants showed greater accuracy-identifying the more numerous object type as being more numerous-when the more numerous object type was closer to the center of the pile (M = .77, SD = .16) compared to when it was further from the center (M = .51, SD = .20).</p><p>The data also suggest that some perceptual properties of certain types of items might inherently attract attention and influence quantity judgments, emphasizing the importance of extending findings from simplified cognitive tasks, like the blue and yellow dots task, to real-world settings where the stimuli are more visually and semantically complex. We found a significant main effect of product type (χ 2 (4) = 37.52, p &lt; .001) and its higher-order interaction with centrality (χ 2 (4) = 40.34, p &lt; .001). Specifically, the proximity-to-center bias was smaller for the assortments of nuts and screws compared to the assortments of bell peppers, jellybeans, and buttons (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure   2</ref>). This is likely because, while all assortments differed by color, the nuts (cashew vs. almonds) and screws (long vs. wide) also varied in shape and size. It is also worth noting that for the nuts, the two items also varied in market value; cashews are more expensive than almonds and were often judged as more numerous regardless of their actual quantities or spatial position (M = .76, SD = .23; t(199) = 15.09, p &lt; .001, d = 1.13).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2b: Method</head><p>Participants. One hundred workers from Prolific Academic participated in this study (50% women; Mage = 35.04), which was pre-registered at https://aspredicted.org/8S1_8DD. Procedure. Participants judged whether there were more red or blue candies present in illustrated piles of candy. Unlike the previous studies, where each product contained two types of items (e.g., caramel and cheese popcorn, yellow and blue jellybeans, etc.), Study 2b showed six different types (red, blue, green, yellow, brown, and orange candies). Within subjects, each pile was manipulated to consistently contain 30 red and 25 blue candies, or vice versa, with one type (either red or blue) positioned closer to the center, on average. The remaining four colors always had 15 candies each, and their average distance from the center always fell within the range of the candy that was most centrally positioned and least centrally positioned (i.e., red or blue, depending on the centrality condition). Hence, the types that were closest and furthest from the center were always the red and blue candies. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A</ref> for an example trial display. proportion of trials where participants correctly identified the more numerous type of candy to be more numerous. Notably, while differences between the centrality conditions emerged for both candy types, there was a general trend to select the blue candy as being more numerous. Error bars reflect within-subject standard errors of the mean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2b: Results</head><p>A paired-sample t-test examined whether the centrality of candies influenced accuracy.</p><p>Collapsed across colors, we found that accuracy was higher when the more numerous colored candies were closer to the center of the pile (M = .53, SD = .22) compared to farther away (M = .36, SD = .24; t(99) = 5.08, p &lt; .001, d = 0.51). Echoing the results of the previous studies, these data suggest that centrality makes a type of object appear more numerous.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. B.</head><p>As noted earlier, low-level features of the stimuli may differentially attract attention and shape quantity ratio perceptions, and this may have been true in Study 2b. Participants were biased towards perceiving the blue candies as more numerous than the red candies, regardless of their centrality (M = .59, SD = .12; t(99) = 7.18, p &lt; .001, d = 0.75), possibly because of greater visual salience. Note, however, that the pattern of results indicating the proximity-to-center bias emerges for both types of candy, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 3A -3C</head><p>Studies 3a-c aimed to explore how biases in quantity ratio impressions might interact with consumer preferences to ultimately influence choice. We adapted the stimulus generation code from Studies 1a-b to display two popcorn bags side-by-side, each featuring a mix of caramel and cheese kernels that varied in relative quantity (Study 3a) and proximity to the center of the display (Studies 3a-c). Unlike the previous studies, participants were not asked to make quantity judgments. Instead, they were tasked with choosing their preferred option from the pair of popcorn bags displayed in each trial.</p><p>Importantly, across the studies, participants had to report which flavor (caramel or cheese) they liked more. This allowed us to examine whether their flavor preference influenced their choices between products as a function of the manipulated variables-specifically, the number of kernels of each type and their centrality. We reasoned that if participants spontaneously assess the relative quantity of their preferred items when evaluating products with an assortment, and if centrality influences those perceptions, they would favor an option with more of their preferred flavor positioned toward the center of the display, even when that flavor was less numerous.</p><p>Studies 3a and 3b test this hypothesis in online studies, while Study 3c extends our investigation into a real-world setting. To explore whether quantity ratios are estimated spontaneously when choosing between assortments, participants in Study 3b were also asked to reflect on the main factor that guided their choice. In a field study, participants in Study 3b evaluated the bags in-person, and they got to keep (and consume) a popcorn snack ostensibly based on whichever bag they chose.  On the left, the cheese popcorn is more numerous and positioned closer to the center of the cover. On the right, the caramel popcorn is more numerous and positioned closer to the center of the cover. B) The testing station used in the field study (Study 3c) featured two options for participants to choose from: one option displayed more caramel than cheese popcorn at the center, while the second option did the opposite. The illustrated popcorn bags, placed in sign holders, were randomly selected for each participant from a previously generated pool.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.</head><p>Participants. One hundred ninety-seven Prolific Academic workers participated in Study 3a (50% women; Mage = 44.91), which was pre-registered at https://aspredicted.org/1MG_K9V.</p><p>Procedure. On each of 12 trials, participants saw two illustrated bags of popcorn shown side-by-side and were asked to indicate which bag they preferred. Display time was unlimited. We used the same strategy as the previous studies to manipulate the relative quantities of caramel and cheese and the spatial arrangement within each bag. While both bags had the same total number of kernels, one flavor was more numerous than the other (i.e., 30 cheese and 25 caramel, or vice versa), and on average, one flavor was positioned closer to the center of the bag (i.e., the Euclidian distance was smaller by 28 pixels). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4A</ref> shows an example trial where the bag on the left depicts more cheese-flavored kernels than caramel, while bag on the right has more caramel than cheese, and in both cases the more numerous flavor is also positioned closer to the center.</p><p>Note that because centrality and quantity ratio were randomly manipulated for each bag individually, in some trials, both options had the same flavor positioned closer to the center. On these trials, the options varied only in terms of quantity ratio, allowing us to disentangle the effects of actual quantity and centrality on participants' preferences. However, this fully crossed design also meant that in some cases, both options had more of the same type of kernel (e.g., more caramel than cheese). Since our focus was on participants selecting the bag that contained more of their preferred flavor, these trials were excluded from the analyses reported here.</p><p>To explore how preferences influenced choice as a function of these manipulations, we also asked participants to indicate their preference between the two popcorn flavors on a 5-point</p><p>scale (1 -Definitely cheese popcorn; 2 -More cheese popcorn; 3 -I feel indifferent between cheese and caramel popcorn; 4 -More caramel popcorn; 5 -Definitely caramel popcorn). For analysis, we collapsed across the first and last two response options to categorize participants as either preferring cheese or caramel. Note that participants answered the preference question at either the beginning or end of the survey; the latter condition was included to reduce the likelihood that the salience of their preferences biased participants' choices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3a: Results</head><p>As per our pre-registration, we excluded participants who reported indifference between caramel and cheese (N = 37). Participants did not appear to disproportionately prefer one flavor over the other (46% preferred caramel, t(161) = -0.94, p = .347).</p><p>Because we assume participants want the option that contained more of what they like, we expected that they would tend to choose whichever popcorn bag showed more of their preferred flavor on the cover. This assumption was supported: participants chose the option that depicted more of their preferred kernels significantly more often than chance level (M = .63, SD = .19;</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">t(161) = 8.92, p &lt; .001, d = 0.70).</formula><p>More importantly, we hypothesized that central positioning would also bias participants' quantity ratios perceptions and thus influence their choices. To test this, we used a mixed-effects logistic regression to analyze the proportion of 'preference-consistent' choices-where participants chose the bag displaying more of their preferred flavor. This analysis considered the effect of centrality (whether the favored kernels were more central or not), timing (whether the preference question was asked at the start or end of the study), and their interaction, controlling for betweensubject variability with a random intercept. Although this analysis differs slightly from the preregistered version, the effect of centrality was similar between the analyses (see Web Appendix E for the pre-registered analysis).</p><p>The results revealed that the positioning of their favored kernels significantly affected participants' choices. They were more likely to choose the bag containing more of their preferred flavor if those kernels were closer to the center versus further away (M = .74, SD = .19 vs. M = .53, SD = .19; χ 2 (1) = 88.23, p &lt; .001, d = 0.54). In other words, participants were more likely to make a choice that was inconsistent with their preferences when, despite being less numerous, the favored type of kernel was more centrally positioned.</p><p>Additionally, we found that asking participants about their flavor preference at the beginning of the survey, rather than at the end, resulted in more preference- The previous studies in this manuscript suggest that central positioning makes a given type of object appear more numerous, and the results of Study 3a indicate that this bias may interact with pre-existing preferences to shape behavior. These findings suggest that participants may have spontaneously judged quantity ratios and chose the option they believed had more of their preferred flavor. This judgment was influenced by actual quantity ratios (e.g., a bag with more caramel than cheese would appeal more to someone who prefers caramel). But more importantly, judgments were also influenced by perceived quantity ratios, driven by selective attention to the center of a display (e.g., caramel-flavored kernels positioned closer to the center).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3b: Method</head><p>Participants. One hundred ninety-five Prolific Academic workers participated in Study 3b</p><p>(50% women; Mage = 35.75), which was pre-registered at https://aspredicted.org/FBF_4XY.</p><p>Procedure. Study 3b used the same basic design as 3a, asking participants to choose between two popcorn bags featuring a mix of caramel and cheese kernels on the cover. However, we introduced three key modifications. First, instead of multiple trials, participants made only one choice, mirroring real-world consumer decisions. Second, unlike the earlier studies, the bags showed an equal number of caramel and cheese kernels, differing only in which flavor was positioned closer to the center of the package. Third, after making their choice, participants were asked to reflect on the primary factor that influenced their decision in an open-ended question. The remainder of the study was the same as 3a, with participants indicating their preference for caramel or cheese popcorn, or expressing indifference, as well as reporting whether they had counted the kernels individually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3b: Results</head><p>Per our pre-registration, we excluded participants who . Preference for caramel and cheese did not differ across participants (52% preferred caramel, t(159) = 0.47, p = .637).</p><p>We also examined the factors participants mentioned as the main reasons for their choice.</p><p>Overall, 53% cited the quantity ratio of the flavors, meaning they chose the bag that appeared to have more of their preferred flavor, while 19% mentioned aesthetics (i.e., a more appealing presentation), and the rest referred to miscellaneous factors-that is, factors that cannot be categorized exclusively as either quantity ratio or aesthetics. For example, participants who simply reported their favorite flavor (e.g., "I like cheese") were categorized under miscellaneous, as it was unclear whether their choice was driven by the perceived quantity of their preferred flavor or its central placement on the package. See Web Appendix F for details on how participants' responses were categorized, along with a complete report of the responses and their categorization.</p><p>Participants who selected the bag with more of their preferred flavor at the center were significantly more likely to cite quantity ratio (56%) than aesthetics (15%) as the primary factor; χ²(1) = 27.429, p &lt; .001, d = 0.89). In contrast, participants who chose the option with their preferred flavor positioned toward the periphery were equally likely to mention either quantity or presentation (44% vs. 31%; χ²(1) = 0.86, p = .353, d = 0.27). These findings suggest that consumers often spontaneously estimate quantity ratios when evaluating assortments, and the attentional biases that arise during these estimations significantly influence their decisions. Note that participants were asked to report their preferred flavor after answering the open-ended question, ruling out the possibility that eliciting their flavor preferences influenced their earlier responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3c: Method</head><p>Participants. Study 3b recruited 399 visitors at a behavioral science museum (61% women, Mage = 31.22), which also operates as a working field lab. This study was pre-registered at https://aspredicted.org/3ZP_XCR.</p><p>Procedure. Study 3c approximates Study 3b's design in a field setting. We recruited visitors of a behavioral science museum that is owned and operated by the authors' academic institution, inviting them to participate in exchange for a caramel and cheese popcorn snack. Those who consented were led into individual experiment rooms, where they sat three feet away from two opaque bins. Each bin was accompanied by a printed illustration of a popcorn bag, displayed in an acrylic sign holder, which ostensibly represented the contents of the bin (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4B</ref>). The illustrations mirrored the stimuli used in Study 3b: both bags had an equal number of caramel and cheese kernels, but one flavor was positioned more centrally than the other.</p><p>To ensure stimulus variability, we printed 200 different layouts of popcorn kernels-half featuring more caramel than cheese at the center, and half showing more cheese than caramel at the center. After each participant's session, a research assistant replaced the printed layouts in the sign holders. This preserved the feature of all previous studies whereby no participant saw the same pair of stimuli.</p><p>Participants were told that the accompanying illustrations represented the contents of each bin and were asked to select the bin from which they would like to receive their popcorn snack.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, both bins contained the same snack options-snack-size bags from a popular popcorn brand, Cretor's-but participants were led to believe their choice would result in different outcomes. After the participant made their selection, a research assistant provided them with a snack from the chosen bin. To obscure the packaging of the bag from naive museum visitors who might wish to participate, each snack bag was put in a small paper bag and stapled at the top.</p><p>Participants then answered the question about their flavor preference, indicating whether they preferred caramel, cheese, or felt indifferent between the flavors. Additionally, they were asked whether they intended to consume the snack themselves or give it to someone else.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3b: Results</head><p>Study 3b implemented two pre-registered exclusion criteria. First, aiming for choices to solely reflect their own preferences, we excluded participants who indicated that they intended to give the popcorn snack to someone else rather than consuming it themselves (N = 75).

Preference for caramel and cheese did not differ across participants (55% preferred caramel, t(280) = 1.61, p = .107).</p><p>We hypothesized that the centrality of the participants' preferred flavor would affect their choice of popcorn snack in the same way as it affected the hypothetical choices made in Study 3a.</p><p>If, as documented in the earlier studies, central positioning makes a given type of object appear more numerous, we predicted that participants would be more likely to choose a bag from the bin whose display positioned more of their preferred flavor closer to the center of the package. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 4A -4B</head><p>In Studies 4a and 4b, we took additional steps to align the experimental design as closely as possible with real shopping scenarios. Participants were presented with photographs of two bouquets that contained red roses, white carnations, and filler plants. The bouquets were created and photographed in a flower shop where, with the help of a professional florist, the flowers were arranged and re-arranged to produce the intended stimuli. Importantly, one bouquet had more roses than carnations, the other bouquet had more carnations than roses, and we also manipulated whether there were relatively more roses or more carnations toward the center of the bouquet. In Study 4a, participants were incentivized to identify which option is more expensive. The correct response was always the bouquet with more roses (option A in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref>) because roses have a higher market value than carnations. However, participants were not informed about this inherent price difference. This allowed us to test how spontaneous inferences about relative quantities (i.e., of roses and carnations) influence consumers' impression of value. In Study 4b, if</p><p>participants indicated that they thought one bouquet was more expensive than the other, we asked them to estimate the price difference between the two. This allowed us to quantify the impact of the proximity-to-center bias on impressions of value. Notes: The displays in Studies 4a and 4b from the two centrality conditions. In both displays, option A is more expensive because it has more roses than carnations. However, in the top display (larger-central condition), roses are closer to the center in option A and further from the center in option B. The opposite is true in the bottom display (smaller-central condition).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4a: Method</head><p>Participants. Nine hundred ninety-seven Prolific Academic workers (51% women; Mage = 39.47) participated in this study, which was pre-registered at https://aspredicted.org/X56_RM7.</p><p>Procedure. Participants viewed photographs of two flower bouquets side-by-side for an unlimited time. One bouquet had 30 roses and 25 carnations, while the other had the opposite ratio (options A and B in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref>, respectively). The positioning of the bouquets on the left or right side of the screen was counterbalanced. Participants were informed that one bouquet costs more than the other, and their task was to identify the more expensive bouquet. Importantly, participants were incentivized to give an accurate responsea correct answer would earn them a 20-cent bonus, which translates to a 50% increase from their baseline participation payment.</p><p>We manipulated centrality between subjects. In the larger-central condition, the bouquet with more roses had more roses at the center, and the option with more carnations had more carnations at the center (top panel, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref>). In the smaller-central condition, the option with more roses had more carnations at the center, and the option with more carnations had more roses at the center (bottom panel, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref>). Note that both bouquets always contained the same total number of flowers. At the end of the survey, participants reported if they counted the flowers oneby-one before making their decision. They also had to indicate whether roses are more expensive than carnations, less expensive, or equal in price. Note that the design consisted of a single trial;</p><p>centrality was manipulated between subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4a: Results</head><p>Following our pre-registration, we excluded participants who indicated at the end of the survey that (a) they counted the flowers individually (N = 63), (b) carnations are either more expensive than roses (N = 76) or equally priced (N = 69). The results hold without these exclusions (see the Web Appendix G for all alternate analyses).</p><p>An independent-sample t-test compared differences between the centrality conditions in terms of accuracy (i.e., selecting the option with more roses to be more expensive). We hypothesized that participants would form spontaneous impressions of quantity ratios that were disproportionately influenced by the flowers toward the center, impacting their estimates of the bouquets' values. In this case, we expected that participants would be more likely to choose the correct option-the bouquet with more roses-if it had more roses at the center. Conversely, they would be less likely to indicate that the bouquet with more roses was more expensive if it had more carnations at the center. Choosing the more expensive bouquet (i.e., the one with more roses) and the less expensive bouquet (i.e., the one with fewer roses) was coded as '1' and '0', respectively.</p><p>Supporting our predictions, participants were more likely to choose the correct option (i.e., the bouquet with more roses) as more expensive when the roses were positioned closer to the center (M = .91, SD = .29) compared to when they appeared toward the periphery and carnations were more centrally positioned (M = .29, SD = .46; t(554.68) = 22.19, p &lt; .001, d = 1.67). Accuracy was significantly higher than chance when roses were more central (t(439) = 30.33, p &lt; .001, d = 1.45) and lower than chance when they were not (t(348) = -8.52, p &lt; .001, d = -0.46). The latter result is particularly striking: participants were more likely than chance to incorrectly select the bouquet with fewer roses-thereby losing out on a bonus payment-because those roses were positioned closer to the center.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4b: Method</head><p>Participants. Participants were 1,001 Prolific workers (50% women; Mage = 37.35). This study was pre-registered at https://aspredicted.org/CKZ_PTS.</p><p>Procedure. This study used the same set of stimuli as Study 4a and followed the same basic procedure, randomly assigning participants to evaluate one of two possible pairs of flower bouquets (as displayed in the top and bottom panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref>). Notably, however, participants</p><p>were not told that one bouquet was more expensive than the other and were not incentivized for accuracy (i.e., picking the more expensive bouquet). Instead, they could select one of the two bouquets as being more expensive or respond that the bouquets were equally priced.</p><p>Next, participants who indicated that one bouquet was more expensive were asked to estimate the price difference between the two options on a 101-point scale ranging from "$1" to $100 (or more)". We recorded the price difference as 0 for participants who indicated that the two options were equally priced. This approach allowed us to quantify the impact of centrality on value impressions. It allowed us to estimate the magnitude of the increase in perceptions of value, reflected here in monetary terms, when the more valuable components were closer to the center.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4b: Results</head><p>As in the previous study, we excluded participants who indicated that they had counted the flowers individually (N = 71), and/or who believed that carnations are either more expensive than roses (N = 32) or equally priced (N = 99). A third pre-registered criterion excluded participants who answered that the price difference between the bouquets was "$100 (or more)" (N = 2). The same pattern of results emerges without these exclusions (see the Web Appendix G for all alternate analyses).</p><p>Regressing accuracy on centrality revealed the same pattern of results as the previous study. Choosing the more expensive option was coded as '1,' the less expensive option as '0,' and stating that they were equally priced as '0.5' (i.e., reflecting chance level\indifference). Participants were more likely to indicate that the bouquet with more roses was more expensive when it featured roses closer to the center compared to further away (M = .90, SD = .27 vs. M = .39, SD = .32; t(747.99) = 24.60, p &lt; .001, d = 1.73). The proportion of participants selecting the more expensive bouquet was also significantly different than the indifference point in both cases-it was higher when roses were more central (t(408) = 30.64, p &lt; .001, d = 1.49), and lower when roses were less central (t(385) = -6.95, p &lt; .001, d = -0.35).</p><p>Importantly, Study 4b also allowed us to examine the degree to which centrality affected participants' estimates of the price differences between the bouquets. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the number of roses relative to carnations and their placement (i.e., centrality) appeared to jointly impact estimates. The bouquet where roses were both more central and more numerous was estimated to cost $26.60 (SD = 18.21) more, on average, than the other bouquet where the roses were both less central and less numerous (t(408) = 29.66, p &lt; .001, d = 1.46). In fact, centrality impacted participants' estimates more than actual quantity ratios did. Namely, the proximity-tocenter bias led participants to estimate that a bouquet that contained fewer roses, but positioned the roses closer toward the center, cost an average of $10.76 (SD = 13.73) more than a bouquet that had more roses, but where roses were less central (t(385) = 13.72, p &lt; .001, d = 0.70). These results confirm our predictions that value impressions of products consisting of assorted items are often based on spontaneous quantity ratio judgments that are susceptible to the proximity-to-center bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 5A -5B</head><p>Results from the previous studies reveal a proximity-to-center bias in quantity ratio estimations within products. Across both stylized and realistic product stimuli, we show that consumers are more likely to perceive a given type of item as more numerous when it was positioned closer to the center of a product display, thereby impacting consumer choices. In the remaining part of this paper, we aim to investigate the cognitive mechanisms behind this perceptual bias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Vanunu and Ratcliff (2024)</ref>, in their recent discovery of the proximity-to-center bias, suggested that it arises from an unequal distribution of attention across a visual display. Instead of processing all available information, people tend to selectively attend to the center of the visual display. As a result, objects positioned near the center are more likely to be noticed and factored into quantity judgments, while those at the periphery are more likely to be overlooked. In the context of product packaging and consumer choice, our findings also suggest that this effect may vary depending on the product, given that attributes like value, color, shape, or size (e.g., cashews vs. almonds, blue vs. red candy) might affect an item's ability to capture attention.</p><p>In Studies 5a and 5b, we explore whether the proximity-to-center bias is governed by selective attention. Participants saw two piles of coins, each composed of dimes and pennies. The piles were shown briefly (Study 5a) or for an unlimited time (Study 5b). We manipulated the arrangement of coins, such that one type (either dimes or pennies) was positioned closer to the center of the pile than the other.</p><p>To manipulate participants' attention to different regions of the pile, we adapted a common technique from cognitive psychology that guides attention through different task instructions. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Tsetsos, Chater and Usher (2012)</ref> demonstrated that by changing the framing of a choice problem from "accept" the best option to "reject" the worst option, participants gave more weight to the options' best and worst features, respectively. In our task, participants were either instructed to indicate which pile had more pennies (pennies-judged group) or which pile had more dimes (dimes-judged group). We assumed that participants would focus their attention on the coin they were instructed to evaluate. This allowed us to test whether selective attention would systematically increase the perceived quantity of the judged coin type, especially if it was positioned closer to the center of the pile.</p><p>This design also allows us to test whether the proximity-to-center bias persists without actual quantity differences between objects. Both piles contained the same number of dimes and pennies, unlike previous studies where one type of object was more numerous (e.g., carnations vs.</p><p>roses, caramel vs. cheese popcorn). If participants accounted for all objects in their estimations, responses should theoretically align with chance, given the equal quantities.</p><p>Instead, we expected to replicate the proximity-to-center bias, predicting that participants would be more likely to identify the coin type positioned closer to the center of the pile as more numerous. Additionally, we anticipated that selective attention to one type of coin, guided by the task instructions, would produce opposite choice patterns: participants instructed to judge which pile had more dimes would be more likely to select the pile with more centrally positioned dimes, and vice versa for those judging pennies. https://aspredicted.org/rv4tm.pdf).</p><p>Procedure. In each of 12 trials, participants were presented with two piles of coins and asked to indicate which pile contained more of a certain type of coin. Specifically, they were either instructed to judge which pile had more dimes (dimes-judged condition) or which had more pennies (pennies-judged condition), directing their attention toward the specified coin type.</p><p>Each pile showed the same number of dimes and pennies, 'stacked' in a pseudo-random fashion, with the centrality of the two coin types manipulated in the same way as in previous studies. In half of the trials-the critical trials-one pile had more dimes positioned at the center, while the other had more pennies at the center. The other half of trials were filler trials, where both piles had the same coin type (either both dimes or both pennies) positioned closer to the center.</p><p>These filler trials allowed for all possible layout combinations between the two options, producing a more organic set of stimuli that helped mask the true purpose of the centrality manipulation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 6</ref> illustrates an example display for one of the critical trials. Notes: An example trial display in Studies 5a and 5b. The pile of coins on the left depicts more pennies at the center, while the pile on the right depicts more dimes at the center. Note that both piles always had the same number of dimes and pennies.</p><p>In Study 5a, to prevent participants from counting the coins one-by-one and to simulate rapid decision-making contexts, the display time was limited to one second, followed by a mask.</p><p>In Study 5b, the display time was unlimited; the piles of coins remained on screen until the participant made a selection (i.e., without masking). This provided a conservative test of the proximity-to-center bias, as the unlimited time to evaluate options may allow additional factors, such as participants' preference for dimes over pennies due to their higher monetary value, to potentially influence how they allocated their attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 5a: Results</head><p>We used one-sample t-tests to compare the proportion of choices for the pile with more of the judged coin type at the center against chance level, as well as between the instruction groups (dimes-judged vs. pennies-judged). Filler trials, where both options had the same coin type closer to the center, were excluded from the analysis. Note that although the analysis conducted in studies 5a and 5b differed from the pre-registered analysis, the effect of centrality was consistent across tests (see Web Appendix E for the pre-registered analysis). The results from both studies are depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 7</ref>.</p><p>As predicted, quantity ratio impressions were influenced by selective attention to items that were more centrally located. Even though both piles contained an equal number of dimes and pennies, participants chose the pile where the judged coin type was positioned closer to the center as having more of the judged coin type, significantly above chance levels (M = .64, SD = .22; t(199) = 8.72, p &lt; .001, d = 0.64). In other words, participants disproportionately selected the pile where the coin type they were looking for appeared closer to the center. This effect emerged for those judging which pile had more dimes (M = .67, SD = .22; t(101) = 7.20, p &lt; .001, d = 0.77) and for those judging which pile had more pennies (M = .61, SD = .22; t(97) = 5.11, p &lt; .001, d = 0.50).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 5b: Results</head><p>Study 5b replicates the results of 5a, demonstrating a proximity-to-center bias that was specific to the coin type participants were instructed to judge. Participants consistently chose the pile with more of the judged coin type at the center, at rates significantly above chance (M = .62, SD = .24; t(198) = 6.97, p &lt; .001, d = 0.49).</p><p>This bias emerged for participants judging which pile had more dimes (M = .66, SD = .23; t(114) = 7.64, p &lt; .001, d = 0.70) as well as those judging which pile had more pennies (M = .56, SD = .24; t(83) = 2.14, p = .035, d = 0.25). However, the effect was stronger for those judging dimes, t(174.6) = 3.19, p = .002, d = 0.46). This reveals that despite being asked to judge the quantity of pennies, participants in the pennies-judged group may have focused some of their attention on dimes, resulting in a weaker proximity-to-center bias for pennies. Note that this difference was only marginally significant in Study 5a, where participants saw each pile for a limited time (i.e., 1 second) (t(197.7) = 1.73, p = .085, d = 0.24). Taken together, such results suggest that attention was influenced by the inherent difference in monetary value of dimes and pennies, a difference which may have become more salient with longer processing time.

Error bars reflect within-subject standard errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>These findings suggest that directing attention to more "attractive" items within a product-in this case, by explicitly instructing participants to judge the quantity of either dimes or pennies-increased the likelihood that they would choose the pile with more of the "attractive" items (i.e., the judged coin type) positioned toward the center. Moreover, these results reveal that the proximity-to-center bias arises even when the objects do not differ in quantity. Indeed, given that the piles had equal numbers of dimes and pennies, it is especially noteworthy that the bias persists when participants had unlimited time to evaluate the options (as in Study 5b).</p><p>In all cases, whichever coin type participants were instructed to look for (whether dimes or pennies) appeared more numerous when placed closer to the center. However, when the display time was unlimited (Study 5b), this difference was attenuated for participants who judged pennies compared to those judging dimes. Put simply, centrality mattered less when the focal coin was pennies compared to when it was dimes.</p><p>This difference might stem from dimes being inherently more appealing than pennies in the real world, much like cashews seemed to be more attractive than almonds in Study 2a. After all, dimes are more valuable than pennies. When participants had to judge which pile had more dimes, their task aligned with the natural tendency to value (and thus pay attention to) dimes over pennies. In contrast, for the pennies-judged group, the inherent appeal of dimes conflicted with the task goal to assess which pile had more pennies, leading to a more even distribution of attention between the two types of coins. This is reflected in participants' choices regressing toward chance levels, as would be expected if all coins were equally represented in their quantity impressions.</p><p>Crucially, the increased attention to dimes was strongest when participants could freely distribute their attention without time constraints, underscoring the importance of extending findings from overly stylized cognitive tasks to real-world settings involving consumer goods, which present more visually and semantically complex stimuli.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 6</head><p>Studies 5a and 5b illustrated the role of selective attention in producing the proximity-tocenter bias. Once again, the results suggest that objects placed at the center of a display are more likely to capture attention-and, consequently, be factored into quantity impressions-than objects placed at the periphery. Study 6 aimed to test this assumption by manipulating participants' attention between the central and peripheral regions of the display.</p><p>In Study 6, participants saw a single pile containing an equal number of dimes and pennies and were asked to identify which coin type was more numerous. However, instead of presenting the pile as a static image, the coins appeared sequentially, with the order of appearance manipulated within subjects. On each trial, the stacking order either started with coins at the center and ended with coins at the periphery, or vice versa.</p><p>We anticipated that displaying the coins sequentially-temporally separating the display of each coin-would encourage participants to distribute their attention across different regions of the pile. Preliminary results from a pilot study indicated that when the coins are displayed one by one, participants' attention tends to follow the sequence, focusing more on the location where the sequence ends. Therefore, if the sequence starts at the periphery and ends at the center, we anticipated replicating the proximity-to-center bias. However, if the sequence begins at the center and moves outward, we expected a reduction in the bias, as participants would be encouraged to focus more on the coins at the periphery (as detailed in the pre-registration).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedure</head><p>Our participants were 100 workers from Prolific Academic (60% women; Mage = 41.08).</p><p>This study was pre-registered at https://aspredicted.org/719_PH5.</p><p>On each of 12 trials, participants were shown a pile of dimes and pennies and were asked to judge which type of coin was more numerous. The order in which coins appeared on the screen was manipulated within-subjects. In the periphery-to-center condition, coins were sequentially placed in the pile, starting from those farthest from the center and ending with those that were closest to the center. In the center-to-periphery condition, the sequence was reversed. Note that each coin was stacked below the preceding one, meaning that the first coins in the sequence were always placed on top of the later ones. This design aimed to separate temporal order from spatial order, ensuring that the final coins did not receive more attention simply because they were placed above earlier ones. As in the previous studies, we manipulated the centrality of dimes versus pennies. Display time was unlimited. At the end of the survey, participants reported how often they counted the coins one-by-one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>As our outcome measure, we opted to use choices for pennies being more numerous; this is entirely arbitrary and simply serves as a benchmark to assess differences. A mixed-effect logistic regression analyzed the proportion of choices for pennies as a function of the coins' centrality (pennies-closer vs. dimes-closer), stacking order (periphery-to-center vs. center-to-periphery) and their interaction, accounting for between-subjects variability with a random intercept effect. The results are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 8</ref>.</p><p>Replicating previous studies, a main effect of centrality emerged, indicating that coins positioned toward the center were perceived as more numerous than those positioned toward the periphery (χ 2 (1) = 55.12, p &lt; .001, d = .66). The main effect of stacking order was not significant (χ 2 (1) = 0.14, p = .706, d = 0.04). However, a significant interaction with centrality suggests that stacking order moderated the proximity-to-center bias (χ 2 (1) = 35.80, p &lt; .001). When coins were presented from the periphery to the center, a proximity-to-center bias emerged (M = .73, SD = .31 vs. M = .33 , SD = .29; χ 2 (1) = 83.95, p &lt; .001, d = 0.88). However, when the sequence began at the center and moved outward, centrality no longer significantly affected quantity perception; that is, the bias disappeared (M = .55, SD = .36 vs. M = .49 , SD = .31; χ 2 (1) = 2.19, p = .139, d = 0.12).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>As per our pre-registration, we expected sequential display to encourage participants to distribute attention across different regions. These results suggest a notable pattern in which objects appearing towards the end of the sequence are more likely to be attended to and, therefore, to be included in quantity estimations (i.e., a recency effect). When stacking order pulled attention towards the center, thereby aligning with a natural tendency to focus attention on the center, we replicate the proximity-to-center bias. However, when the sequence moved from the center outward, attention was more evenly distributed, eliminating the bias. These findings support our earlier hypothesis that the proximity-to-center bias arises from selective attention to the center of the display. Notes: The proportion of choices for pennies in Study 6 as a function of centrality and order of appearance within the pile (i.e., stacking order). Error bars reflect within-subject standard errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Across twelve studies, we demonstrate that the spatial positioning of items within a product display-specifically, their proximity to the center-significantly shapes consumers' perceptions of the items' relative quantity, which in turn influences their perceived value of the overall product.</p><p>Items positioned closer to the center of a display were consistently perceived as more numerous, a phenomenon we term the "proximity-to-center bias" <ref type="bibr">(Studies 1a,</ref><ref type="bibr">1b,</ref><ref type="bibr">2a,</ref><ref type="bibr">2b)</ref>. This bias emerged across diverse products and contexts, such as bags of popcorn, flower bouquets, and piles of coins, and it highlights important implications for consumers' valuation and preferences. For instance, participants favored products that featured more of their preferred type of item positioned closer to the center, presumably because centrality made that item seem more abundant <ref type="bibr">(Studies 3a,</ref><ref type="bibr">3b,</ref><ref type="bibr">3c)</ref>. Similarly, products were perceived as more expensive when their high-value components were positioned more centrally (Studies 4a and 4b). Remarkably, this effect emerged even when it cost participants a bonus payment.</p><p>The proximity-to-center bias appears to result from selective attention toward the center of a display. This is supported by evidence that the bias can be influenced by the specific task instructions given to participants: when participants were directed to assess the quantity of a particular item, that was perceived as more numerous if it was positioned closer to the center (Studies 5a and 5b). Moreover, participants only showed a proximity-to-center bias when their attention was directed from the periphery to the center. When attention was pulled away from the center and toward the periphery, and thus more evenly distributed, the proximity-to-center bias was eliminated (Study 6). Additionally, participants who reported explicitly counting the items, thus attending to each object in the display, did not show the proximity-to-center bias (see Web Appendix B). These findings emphasize the role of selective attention in driving this perceptual distortion in quantity ratio judgments, which in turn influence subsequent product decisions.</p><p>The current investigation merges insights from cognitive psychology and marketing to apply a basic perceptual phenomenon to a consumer context. In doing so, this work contributes to our understanding of consumer decision-making and human perception more broadly.</p><p>Theoretically, our findings align with the concept of selective attention, suggesting that biases in quantity estimation emerge because salient properties of a display disproportionately capture attention, shaping evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Vanunu and Ratcliff 2024)</ref>. This mechanism fits within the broader framework of bounded rationality <ref type="bibr">(Simon 1954)</ref>, where people frequently rely on the most relevant or accessible information when making decisions, rather than processing all available information <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Payne, Bettman and Johnson 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tversky and Kahneman 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Vanunu et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vanunu at al. 2021)</ref>. Thus, the proximity-to-center bias can be described as a heuristic for judging quantity, where participants only evaluate a subset of information in order to reduce processing costs.</p><p>Furthermore, the proximity-to-center bias, driven by selective attention to the center of the display, aligns with past research showing that information receiving more attention is more likely to influence choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bialkova et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Florack, Egger and Hübner 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fisher 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gluth et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hsu and Yoon 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Janiszewski, Kuo and Tavassoli 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ratneshwar et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Reutskaja et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Smith and Krajbich 2019)</ref>. For instance, shelf position can affect consumer choice, as consumers are more likely to attend to (and thereby choose) products placed at the center or at eye level <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atalay et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chandon et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Jalali et al. 2023)</ref>. Similarly, a product's visual salience-the degree to which it stands out from its surroundings (Itti and Koch 2000)can impact choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Towal et al. 2013;</ref>). The present work diverges from these studies by offering novel insights into biases in selective attention within products themselves, rather than between different products.</p><p>Our research focus, examining how centrality biases judgments of relative quantity within products, necessarily limited our investigation to products containing assorted items. It is worth noting that the proximity-to-center bias might not apply to all types of products and quantity estimations. For example, existing research suggests that when consumers evaluate differences in quantity between products (i.e., the overall quantity across the different types in the assortment), a different pattern may emerge. In this context, quantity judgments might be influenced by the collective surface area occupied by the objects, known as the convex hull. An array of objects with a larger convex hull-where items are spread further apart-often appears more numerous <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gilmore et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kang and Ratcliff 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Tokita and Ishiguchi 2010)</ref>. This suggests that when consumers assess overall quantity differences between products, distributing product contents toward the periphery, rather than the center, may create the impression that the product contains a greater overall quantity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Marketing Implications</head><p>The present research suggests a compelling insight: consumers may favor products where more coveted components are positioned closer to the center. Marketers might leverage this by strategically placing popular or high-value items closer to the center of a product's packaging. This could involve manipulating visual representations on the packaging or, in the case of transparent containers, physically rearranging the contents. Such strategies may encourage consumers to perceive these products as containing more of what they want, without altering actual quantities or using overtly deceptive packaging.</p><p>Concurrently, policymakers could encourage companies to adopt packaging strategies that steer consumers toward purchasing products with smaller quantities, potentially using this insight to promote healthier consumption habits and reduce waste. This approach aligns with the concept of portioning products into smaller units to mitigate overindulgence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Marchiori et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">2012)</ref>. Implementing these subtle nudges on product packaging could lead to mutually beneficial outcomes for both consumers, by promoting healthier choices, and marketers, by appealing to preferences for moderation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, biases in quantity estimations can emerge in a consumer context and significantly influence product choices. Our findings demonstrate that for products containing assorted items, those positioned closer to the center are perceived as more numerous, impacting both product valuation and consumer preferences. This proximity-to-center bias stems from consumers' tendency to focus attention toward the center while overlooking the periphery. The current work applies a recent insight from cognitive psychology to a consumer context. In bridging these areas, we hope to invite further exploration into how perceptual biases can impact consumer decision-making and inform marketing strategies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Example Displays of Illustrated Caramel and Cheese Popcorn Bags</figDesc></figure>
