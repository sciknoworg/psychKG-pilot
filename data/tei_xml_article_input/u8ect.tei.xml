			<abstract>
				<p>Most probability problems encountered throughout life require the ability to quantify probabilities based on proportions. Recent findings suggest that young children have this ability while other findings suggest otherwise. For example, when presented with transparent jars containing mixtures of preferred and less preferred items, 10-to 14-month-olds (Denison &amp; Xu, 2014) but not 3-and 4-years-olds (Girotto, Fontanari, Gonzalez, Vallortigara &amp; Blaye, 2016) seem to rely on the proportions of objects in the jars to predict the content of samples randomly drawn out of them. Other findings suggest that 12-month-olds do not rely on proportions of objects to make predictions, but rather that their intuitions are based on an evaluation of all possible outcomes a random process can generate (Téglás, Ibanez-Lillo, Costa &amp; Bonatti, 2015). It is thus not clear whether the ability of infants have been overestimated in Denison &amp; Xu (2014), whether the ability of preschoolers have been underestimated in Girotto et al. (2016), or whether the ability to rely on proportions to estimate probabilities follows a U-shaped curve during development. In our study, we tested again whether infants and preschoolers rely on proportions of objects to estimate probabilities of random sampling events. We presented children with two boxes containing a mixture of two types of objects-one type having a higher rewarding value. The experimenter sampled one object out of each box and hid them in two cups. Children could then choose between both cups. Our results show that neither infants nor preschoolers relied on the proportions of objects in the boxes to make inferences about the content of the cups and choose the sample with a higher rewarding value. However, it is not clear why infants failed, as they also failed in a condition in which the outcomes were certain. These findings are congruent with Girotto et al. (2016) but in contradiction with Denison &amp; Xu (2014) and could indicate that infants&apos; ability to reason about proportions have been overestimated. However, more studies are necessary to explain why infants succeeded in Denison &amp; Xu (2014) and failed in our task.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Probability judgments are an important component of rationality as they help people learn and make decisions under uncertainty. An increasing number of findings suggests that young children have intuitions about probabilities that help them make predictions about outcomes of random events <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Téglás, Girotto, Gonzalez &amp; Bonatti, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Téglás et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Téglás, Ibanez-Lillo, Costa &amp; Bonatti, 2015). In addition, these intuitions seem, under some conditions, to help them make rational decisions under uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Denison &amp; Xu, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>However, within these findings, there are some contradictions about how children quantify probabilities and about how these intuitions develop during childhood. In particular, it is not clear whether young children are able to quantify probabilities based on proportions, an ability necessary to most probability problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bryant &amp; Nunes, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>For example, in a study in which 12-month-olds were shown films of four objects (three similar and one dissimilar object) randomly moving in an urn, infants looked longer when the object of the minority type suddenly exited the urn than when an object of the majority type came out of it, suggesting that they made predictions about more or less probable outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Téglás et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2015)</ref>. However, when the quantity of objects moving in the urn was increased, the effect of expected and unexpected outcomes on infants' looking time disappeared <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Téglás et al., 2015)</ref>. Authors concluded that infants make predictions about random drawing in an extensional way, that is, by imagining all possible outcomes and by quantifying these possibilities, rather than by quantifying probabilities based on proportions of objects. As a consequence, they can make precise inferences only when there is a small number of possible outcomes to track. These findings are, however, in direct contrast with other findings suggesting that infants can use proportions of larger quantities of objects to quantify probabilities of random events.</p><p>In a different study, 12-month-olds were first shown a pink and a black lollipop <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Denison &amp; Xu, 2014)</ref>. The experimenter placed both lollipops on the ground and waited for the infant to crawl to one of them. The item chosen by the child was considered as her preferred item, and the other item as the less preferred one. The experimenter then presented two transparent jars containing a mixture of both types of lollipops to the child. In one jar, there was a higher proportion of preferred lollipops than in the other jar. The experimenter also brought two opaque cups that she placed on each side of the jars. She then concealed the content of both jars with two paper occluders, closed her eyes, reached into the jar on the right, grabbed a lollipop, and while holding it concealed in her fist so that the stick was the only thing apparent, she moved it to one of the two cups. She then repeated the same action with the jar on the left. The experimenter then encouraged the child to come choose one of the two cups. Several conditions were tested: in some conditions, the absolute quantity of preferred lollipops was equal in both jars, and in others, it was higher in the unfavourable jar (i.e. the jar with a higher proportion of less preferred lollipops). For example, in Experiment 2, there were 16 preferred and 4 less preferred lollipops in the favourable jar, and 24 preferred and 96 less preferred lollipops in the unfavourable jar. This was important to rule out that children solved the task by comparing absolute quantities of preferred items in both jars instead of estimating probabilities based on proportions. Results revealed that more children than expected by chance moved towards the cup containing the sample drawn out of the favourable jar and suggest that infants rely on proportions of large quantities of objects to make inferences about random drawing.</p><p>To what these contrasting findings are due is not clear. It is possible that in the task with the virtual urn, it was harder for children to represent moving objects as proportions. It is also possible that in the study with the lollipops, children relied on an alternative strategy and not on proportions to estimate probabilities. For example, children could have had the illusion that there were always more preferred lollipops in the favourable jar, even if this was not the case, and could have solved the task by comparing absolute quantities of visible preferred items. Consider Experiment 2 again. In the unfavourable jar there were more preferred lollipop than in the favourable jar, however, it is possible that most of the preferred lollipops of the unfavourable jar (n = 24) were hidden by the high quantity of less preferred lollipops (n = 96) so that in appearance more preferred lollipops were seen in the favourable jar.</p><p>Not adding to the clarity of the picture, recent findings suggest that 3-and 4-yearolds cannot quantify probabilities based on proportions. In fact, when 3-and 4-years-olds were presented with two jars filled with preferred and less preferred objects, they seem not to rely on proportions to estimate probabilities of random sampling events <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Girotto et al., 2016</ref>).</p><p>There are different explanations that could account for these findings. The first one is were not motivated enough by the possible rewards and did therefore not invest enough thinking in the task. A third explanation is that these findings show the real abilities of children and would imply that probabilistic reasoning follows a U-shaped curve during the early stages of child development.</p><p>The current study aimed to shed light on these different possibilities to better understand the nature of probability intuitions and how they develop over age. We tested 12month-olds and 3-and 4-years-olds' intuitions about probabilities in a paradigm similar to the one used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Denison &amp; Xu (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Girotto et al. (2016)</ref> to which we made some changes.</p><p>In our study, the objects were not stacked one on top of the other in their respective containers. We selected big enough boxes so that each item could be seen separately. We also changed the nature of the objects to make them more interesting as potential rewards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Sixty-eight children were included in the final sample, which was split into two age groups: infants (n = 34, mean age = 12 months, age range = 10-14 months) and preschoolers (n = 34, mean age = 46 months, age range = 36-54 months). Thirty-five additional children (thirtyfour infants and one preschooler) were tested but not kept in the final sample because they either did not make any choice in the preference test or the test condition (n = 6), or because they did not make the expected choice in the preference trial (n = 29). Children were recruited from a database of families who had voluntarily registered and agreed to participate. They were from mixed socioeconomic backgrounds and some family were plurilingual.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials Objects</head><p>Transparent white and transparent blue Kinder eggs were used as stimuli for the experiment. To all eggs were attached thin wooden sticks of approx. 20cm in length, that allowed children to see that only one object was removed from each box and transferred to a cup. On all blue eggs were also stuck white cartoon eyes to make them more interesting. In addition, all blue eggs contained finger puppets representing different animals whereas all white eggs were empty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Boxes</head><p>Two cubical transparent boxes (length × width × height: 37,8 cm × 39,6 cm × 18,5 cm) were used as container. Two white rectangular blankets were used to cover the boxes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cups</head><p>Two opaque cups (length × width × height: 10 cm × 10 cm × 15 cm) were used as containers for the eggs sampled from the boxes. Each cup was covered by a black tissue with a hole to allow the experimenter to hide the eggs inside.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure and design</head><p>Each child was tested individually in a quiet room in presence of a family member. Children were told they would participate in a game. They sat on the lap of one parent (except for some 3-and 4-years-olds who preferred to sit alone, with the parent sitting next to them) who sat on a chair in front of a table. The experimenter sat on the opposite side of the table.</p><p>The two cups were already placed on the two extremities of the table on each side of the child and the experimenter. Parents were asked to wear opaque glasses that prevented them from seeing the experiment. They were allowed to withdraw the glasses in between each phase of the experiment. Each child would undergo a preference test, followed by a probability condition and a baseline condition (within-subject design). <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Procedure. The experimenter presented both boxes of the Probability condition, one after the other, as depicted in A). She then covered both boxes with white blankets and while closing her eyes, removed one object in the right box and hid it in the green cup adjacent to the box, as shown in B). The same was repeated with the second box. She then took both cups, approached them at equal distance from the child and encourage the child to choose a cup. The same procedure was repeated with the Baseline condition. <ref type="table">The experimenter brought from under the table a transparent white</ref>  open it. Oh, there is something inside". She closed the blue egg again. Then, always starting with the white egg, she said "Look here" and slowly hid it in one of the cups, then repeated the same with the blue egg. She finally lifted both cups simultaneously and presented them at equal distance from the child who could try and grab the one she preferred. If the child chose the cup containing the blue egg, the experimenter said: "Oh great, you found the blue egg". She opened the egg and allowed the child to play with the finger puppet for some time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preference trial</head><p>If the child chose the cup containing the white egg the experimenter said: "Oh, this egg is unfortunately empty". Only children who chose the cup containing the blue egg were kept in the final sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probability condition</head><p>The experimenter brought the two covered boxes on the table. One box contained 9 blue eggs and 3 white eggs (favourable population), the other box contained 16 blue eggs and 48 white eggs (unfavourable population). The experimenter uncovered the first box, always starting with the one on the right (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). She said "Look what is in this box" and approached the box towards the child to allow her to clearly see its content. The experimenter shook the box to make clear that the eggs could be mixed. She repeated the same action with the second box. She then covered the two boxes again and, with her eyes closed, reached in the box on the right, hid one egg in her hand and placed it in the cup adjacent to the box. She repeated the same action with the second box. She finally lifted both cups simultaneously and presented them at equal distance from the child, saying: "pick the one you want" and waited for the child to try and grab one cup. If the child chose the cup containing the blue egg the experimenter said: "Oh great, you found the blue egg". She opened the egg, and allowed the child to play with the finger puppet for some time. If the child chose the cup containing the white egg the experimenter said: "Oh, this egg is unfortunately empty".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline condition</head><p>The same procedure as in the probability condition was repeated, only this time one box contained 48 blue eggs (favourable population) and the other box 48 white eggs (unfavourable population). This condition was added to check whether children understood the procedure. If children failed in this condition, it could not be due to a lack of probability intuitions, as the outcomes of the drawing were certain. The side of the favourable sample and of the favourable population was counterbalanced between the preference trial, the probability condition and the baseline condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coding</head><p>Every session was video recorded. Children's choices were coded from the videos.</p><p>Whenever children chose the sample stemming from the favourable population, we considered it as a success and as a failure when they chose the alternative option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictions</head><p>In the probability condition, we predicted that if children rely on a comparison of absolute quantities of preferred items to make predictions, they would choose the sample drawn out of the unfavourable population at above chance level as at this age, they can discriminate 2:3 ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Xu &amp; Arriaga, 2007)</ref> and should therefore be able to distinguish that there are more blue eggs in the unfavourable population. If they rely on proportions to quantify probabilities, we predicted that children would choose the sample drawn out of the favourable population at above chance level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In the probability condition, 17 out of 34 (50%) infants selected the cup with the sample drawn out of the favourable population, no different form chance (binomial test, p = 1; 95%</p><p>Confidence interval [32,68]). Eighteen out of 34 (53%) preschoolers selected the cup with the sample drawn out of the favourable population, no different form chance (binomial test, p = .86; 95% Confidence interval [35,70], see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>In the baseline condition, 18 out of 31 (58%) infants selected the cup with the sample drawn out of the favourable population, no different form chance (binomial test, p = .47; 95%</p><p>Confidence interval [39,75]). Twenty-four out of 34 (71%) preschoolers selected the cup with the sample drawn out of the favourable population, significantly different form chance (binomial test, p = .02; 95% Confidence interval [53,85], see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>To test whether age had an effect on infants' and preschoolers' performance, we did, for each condition and each age category, a post-hoc logistic regression, with subjects' choice as response variable and age (in months) as predictor. For this we used the glm function of the R package lme4 (R core Team 2017). Results showed that age had no effect in any age category and any condition (Infants in probability condition: Estimate ± SE = 0.39 ± 0.25, z = 1.52, p = .13; Preschoolers in probability condition: Estimate ± SE = -0.05 ± 0.07, z = -0.70, p = .49; Infants in baseline condition: Estimate ± SE = 0.23 ± 0.27, z = 0.85, p = .39; Preschoolers in baseline condition: Estimate ± SE = -0.05 ± 0.08, z = -0.70, p = .48).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>These results suggest that preschoolers did not rely on proportions of objects in the boxes to make inferences about the samples in the probability condition. We can rule out that their failure was due to the procedure, as in the baseline condition they selected the correct cup at above chance level. These results replicate the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Girotto et al. (2016)</ref>. It is nonetheless intriguing that in the baseline condition only 71% of preschoolers selected the correct cup. This cannot be attributed to a weak preference for the blue eggs, as only one preschooler did not choose the cup containing the blue egg in the preference test (and was therefore not included in the final sample). It seems that something in the procedure confused some children. This confusing factor could have been the experimenter performing the drawing. In Study 3 of Girotto et al. (2016) the drawing was performed by a machine and children's performance in a condition similar to our baseline condition was better (90% success) than in Study 2 of Girotto et al. (2016; 69% success) and better than in our baseline condition, in which the experimenter did the drawing. Maybe some children expected some sort of trick to be played on them and did therefore not consider the outcome of the drawing to be certain.</p><p>One could wonder whether there was a subsample of children who were not confused by the procedure and who performed well in the probability condition. This seems not to have been the case. Among all children who succeeded in the baseline condition (n = 24), only 58% also succeeded in the probability condition (binomial test, p = .54; 95%</p><p>Confidence interval [37,78]). Our findings also indicate that infants did not rely on the proportions of objects in the boxes to make inferences about the samples in the probability condition. Infants did also not preferentially choose the sample drawn out of the box with more preferred items. They seem not to have relied on any numerical information at all. However, we cannot rule out that the procedure played a role in infants' performance, as they also performed at chance level in the baseline condition. A possible explanation for infants' failure in both conditions is that they did not have a strong preference for the blue eggs. In fact, almost half of the infants tested in the preference trial (28 infants out of 62) did not select the cup containing the blue egg and where therefore excluded from the final sample. Maybe, rather than having selected a sample of children with a preference for the blue eggs, we selected a sample of children who chose randomly between both egg colours. It is hard to explain why infants would not have a strong preference for an egg with cartoon eyes that visibly contains something when the alternative is an empty egg without eyes. It is also hard to explain why infants of similar age would have a stronger preference for lollipops, as seemed to be the case in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Denison &amp; Xu (2014)</ref>. However, note that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Denison &amp; Xu (2014)</ref> as the authors did not mention the proportion of children who chose a pink or a black lollipop, nothing except infants' good performance in the test trials indicates that children had a strong preference for any lollipops.</p><p>With only one preference trial it is in fact impossible to distinguish between a preference for an object and a random choice, if half of the subjects select one object and half select the alternative. It is also worth noting that there was a difference between our test trial and the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Denison &amp; Xu (2014)</ref>. In our test trial, we placed the objects in the cups instead of placing them visibly in front of the children. Children therefore had to keep track of the location of both eggs. However, as infants are able to retrieve hidden objects from 8-months onward <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Munakata, McClelland, Johnson &amp; Siegler, 1997)</ref> and to find different objects in different locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Feigenson &amp; Halberda, 2004)</ref> this should not explain why only half of the infants in our preference trial chose the cup containing the blue egg.</p><p>Another difference between our experiment and the experiments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Denison &amp; Xu (2014)</ref> is that in our case parents could not have influenced their child's behaviour, as they were blind to the experiment. In Denison &amp; Xu (2014) parents were not blind. They held their children until the experimenter asked them to let go to allow their children to move to one of the cups. Even if parents were asked not to interfere with the task, they might have done so inadvertently. More studies are necessary to disentangle between these possibilities. Future studies should assess children's preferences with several preference trials and should make sure that parents cannot interfere with their child's decisions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>that the ability of infants in Denison &amp; Xu (2014) was over-estimated. It could be that infants in these tasks relied on quantity heuristics and that until five years of age children only estimate probabilities in an extensional way and are therefore limited by the number of possible outcomes of an experiment. A second explanation could be that the ability of 3-and 4-years-olds have been under-estimated and that in Téglás et al. (2015) infants failed at making correct predictions about the larger quantity of moving objects because they could not represent them as proportions. It is possible that in Girotto et al.
