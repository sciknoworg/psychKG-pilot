			<abstract>
				<p>Humans show metacontrol of decision-making towards different reward magnitudes. Specifically, when higher rewards are at stake, individuals increase reliance on a more accurate but cognitively effortful strategy. We investigated whether the personality trait Need for Cognition (NFC) explains individual differences in metacontrol. Based on findings of cognitive effort expenditure in executive functions, we expected more metacontrol in individuals low in NFC. In two independent studies, metacontrol was assessed by means of a decision-making task that dissociates different reinforcement-learning strategies. In contrast to our expectations, NFC did not account for individual differences in metacontrol of decision making. These findings suggest a differential role of NFC for the regulation of cognitive effort in decision making and executive functions.</p>

Individuals show metacontrol of decision-making strategies, that is they adapt their reliance on these strategies to situational demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kool, Gershman, &amp; Cushman, 2017</ref>. The framework of Reinforcement Learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dayan &amp; Niv, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Sutton &amp; Barto, 1998)</ref> discriminates between at least two strategies. First, a model-free strategy guides decisions based on previously learnt action-reward associations. This strategy is considered to be computationally simple but can be inaccurate in dynamically changing environments. Second, a model-based strategy guides decisions by using a mental model of the environment to predict the consequences of potential decisions. A model-based strategy is usually more accurate, but requires more cognitive effort because it relies at least partly on executive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Otto, Gershman, Markman, &amp; Daw, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Otto, Skatova, Madlon-Kay, &amp; Daw, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies have shown considerable individual differences in metacontrol of decisionmaking strategies, in that people differ in how strongly they adapt decision-making strategies toward different reward magnitudes. These individual differences can only partly be accounted for by age or subclinical psychopathological personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bolenz, Kool, Reiter, &amp; Eppinger, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Patzelt, Kool, Millner, &amp; Gershman, 2018)</ref>. Here, we aim at extending our understanding of individual differences in metacontrol by asking whether the personality trait Need for Cognition (NFC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cacioppo &amp; Petty, 1982)</ref> explains how much people engage in metacontrol of decision-making strategies.</p><p>NFC reflects an individual's intrinsic motivation for cognitively demanding activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cacioppo, Petty, Feinstein, Blair, &amp; Jarvis, 1996)</ref>. Previous research has shown that individuals high in NFC need less monetary incentives to exert cognitive effort than individuals low in NFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Thompson, Chaiken, &amp; Hazlewood, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Westbrook, Kester, &amp; Braver, 2013)</ref>. In line with these findings, a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sandra and Otto (2018)</ref> reported that NFC modulates how rewards affect effort expenditure for executive functions. Specifically, while individuals low in NFC invested more cognitive effort in a high-reward condition compared to a low-reward condition of a task-switching paradigm, this reward-induced effect vanished for individuals high in NFC.</p><p>This suggests that the adaptation of cognitive effort toward different payoffs is more pronounced when the intrinsic motivation to engage in cognitively effortful behavior is low.</p><p>Based on these findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sandra and Otto (2018)</ref>, we expect that NFC explains individual differences in metacontrol of decision-making strategies. Specifically, individuals low in NFC should show more metacontrol of decision making (i.e. a stronger upregulation of model-based decision making when rewards are amplified) than individuals high in NFC. We therefore hypothesize that NFC negatively correlates with reward-related metacontrol of decision making. We tested this prediction in datasets from two studies employing a decision-making task that has been developed to dissociate model-free from model-based strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kool, Cushman, &amp; Gershman, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kool et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>For Study 1, we report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions, all manipulations, and all measures in the study (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Simmons, Nelson, &amp; Simonsohn, 2012)</ref>. The dataset and all analysis scripts can be found at osf.io/9wc4u.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>128 participants took part in this study. Sample size was determined based on considerations that it would take around 120 participants to detect a true correlation of r = .25 with a power of 1-β = .80. Data from a subset of this sample (N = 63) were already presented as part of a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bolenz et al., 2019)</ref> and for this subsample, we assessed additional measures such as cognitive control and processing speed that are not reported here. We excluded two participants from data analysis due to the following reasons: missing responses in more than 20% of trials in the decision-making task (1) and missing values in the NFC scale (1). Thus, the effective sample consisted of 126 participants (76 female, age range: 18 -36 years, mean age = 23.4 years). All participants gave informed written consent and received either monetary compensation (5€/hour) or course credit for their participation, as well as an additional monetary compensation related to their performance in the decision-making task (10 cents for every 60 points in the decision-making task). The ethics committee of Technische Universität Dresden approved the study. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The sequential decision-making task. (A) Task transition structure. Each trial offered the choice between one pair of spaceships, both leading deterministically to one of two planets. At the planet, a reward was obtained and the amount of reward slowly drifted over the course of the task. (B) Trial structure. At the beginning of each trial, a stakes condition was cued. Lowstakes trials and high-stakes trials differed in how rewards were converted into points. (C) Transition conditions (only in Study 1). In stable-transitions blocks, the task transition structure remained unchanged throughout the block of 80 trials. In variable-transitions blocks, every 6 to 14 trials, the pair of spaceships in one first-stage state swapped their destination planets.

In this task, participants collect rewards ("space treasure") by choosing between spaceships that travel to different planets. Across trials, we manipulated how rewards were converted into points (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kool et al., 2017)</ref>. In low-stakes trials, participants received one point for every piece of space treasure; in high-stakes trials, participants received five points for every piece of space treasure ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>). Moreover, we manipulated task complexity by imposing additional demands on structure learning in some trial blocks. In stable-transitions blocks, spaceships maintained their destinations throughout the entire block, while in variable-transitions blocks, one pair of spaceships switched their destinations every 6 to 14 trials <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1C)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metacontrol of decision making</head><p>We found increased model-based weights for high-stakes trials compared to low-stakes trials ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A</ref>), both in stable-transitions blocks (BF10 = 6.9 × 10 6 ) and in variable-transitions blocks (BF10 = 19.3). In line with results previously reported in a subsample of our participants and in other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bolenz et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kool et al., 2017)</ref>, this indicates that participants increased reliance on model-based decision making when rewards were amplified. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need for Cognition and metacontrol</head><p>We found considerable individual differences in how strongly participants adapted decisionmaking strategies in response to amplified rewards ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref>-C). Therefore, we next analyzed whether NFC explains individual differences in metacontrol of decision-making. We found moderate evidence against a correlation between NFC and metacontrol ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>) for both stable-transitions blocks (r = 0.00, BF10 = 0.11) and variable-transitions blocks (r = 0.12, BF10 = 0.28). Based on findings showing stronger reward-induced increases in executive function performance for individuals low in NFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sandra &amp; Otto, 2018)</ref>, we also tested the hypothesis of a negative correlation between NFC and metacontrol. We found moderate evidence against a negative correlation in stable-transitions block (BF10 = 0.11) and strong evidence against a negative correlation in variable-transitions blocks (BF10 = 0.05). These results were largely unaffected by different prior assumptions about the population correlation (see <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref> in the supplementary information). These findings speak against the idea that individuals low in NFC show more metacontrol of decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need for Cognition and model-based decision making</head><p>We also investigated whether NFC explains individual differences in model-based decision making. There was moderate evidence against a correlation between NFC and model-based weights in low-stakes trials for both stable-transitions blocks (r = 0.09, BF10 = 0.18) and variable transitions-blocks (r = 0.07, BF10 = 0.15). There was inconclusive evidence regarding a correlation between NFC and model-based weights for high-stakes trials in both stabletransitions blocks (r = 0.13, BF10 = 0.34) and variable-transitions blocks (r = 0.21, BF10 = 1.73).</p><p>Thus, our results do not show that NFC explains individual differences in model-based decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>To scrutinize the unexpected findings in Study 1, we tried to replicate these findings in an independent, larger sample. For Study 2, we report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions and all manipulations (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Simmons et al., 2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>214 participants took part in this study. Sample size was determined based on feasibility considerations. Participants completed the decision-making task and the NFC scale as part of a larger task battery, the results of which will be reported elsewhere. We excluded nine participants from data analysis due to the following reasons: missing responses in more than 20% of trials in the decision-making task (1), key repetitions in more than 95% of trials in the decision-making task (1), no or incomplete recording of the decision-making task due to technical difficulties (3), duplicate assessments with the NFC scale (4). Thus, the effective sample consisted of 205 participants (149 female, age range: 18 -32 years, mean age = 22.0 years). All participants gave informed written consent and received monetary compensation ($25 or course credit as baseline, 22 cents for every 100 points in the decision-making task).</p><p>The Human Research Ethics Committee at Concordia University approved the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision-making task</head><p>We used an adapted version of the decision-making task that was employed in Study 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need for cognition and metacontrol</head><p>As in Study 1, we observed considerable individual differences in metacontrol of decision making ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6B</ref>). We found moderate evidence against a correlation between NFC and metacontrol (r = .06, BF10 = 0.24, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7)</ref>. Moreover, we found strong evidence against a negative correlation between NFC and metacontrol (BF10 = 0.09). Consistent with our findings in Study 1, these results speak against a role of NFC in explaining individual differences in metacontrol of decision making. Bayes Factor robustness checks indicated that these findings were largely unaffected by different prior assumptions (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2</ref> in the supplementary information).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need for cognition and model-based decision making</head><p>We found inconclusive evidence regarding a correlation between NFC and model-based weights in low-stakes trials (r = .10, BF10 = 0.47). In contrast to our findings in Study 1, we found strong evidence for a correlation between NFC and model-based weights in high-stakes trials (r = .21, BF10 = 15).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General discussion</head><p>We investigated individual differences in metacontrol of decision making in two independent studies. In contrast to our expectations, NFC did not explain individual differences in metacontrol. That is, individuals low and high in NFC similarly increased their reliance on the more accurate but more effortful model-based decision-making strategy when rewards were amplified. Furthermore, we obtained inconsistent evidence of the relationship between NFC and model-based decision making. While the results from Study 2 suggest that high-NFC individuals show more model-based decision making than low-NFC individuals under highstakes conditions, this was less evident in Study 1.</p><p>Our findings suggest that NFC may have a differential role for the expenditure of cognitive effort in decision-making and executive functions. In a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sandra and Otto (2018)</ref>, participants low in NFC showed a stronger ramp-up of cognitive effort in a task-switching paradigm when rewards were amplified than participants high in NFC. Although model-based decision making relies at least partly on executive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Otto et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Otto et al., 2015)</ref>, we did not observe a similar relationship between NFC and cognitive effort expenditure during decision making. This could point to a potential process specificity regarding the role of NFC in the regulation of cognitive effort.</p><p>A possible limitation of our studies is that they were based on student samples with a distribution of NFC scores shifted above the scale mean. This restricted range could have attenuated the association between NFC and metacontrol and future studies should rely on more representative samples. However, this sample characteristic equally holds for the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sandra and Otto (2018)</ref> and we therefore think it is unlikely that this factor explains the absence of a correlation in our two studies.</p><p>The stakes manipulation used in our task (factor 1 versus factor 5) was comparable in size to the stakes manipulation in the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sandra and Otto (2018)</ref> (1 cent versus 5 cent). In contrast to our experimental design, where the stakes condition was assigned to each trial randomly, Sandra and Otto (2018) employed a blockwise stakes manipulation, keeping the stakes condition constant for several trials in a row. Thus, in our two studies, individual differences in the willingness to exert cognitive effort might have been attenuated by individual differences in the ability to adapt cognitive effort dynamically and immediately. However, since young adults can adapt behavioral performance in cognitive control tasks rapidly to changes in the reward structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Yee, Adams, Beck, &amp; Braver, 2019)</ref>, we think that this difference in task design is unlikely to explain the different patterns in our study and the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sandra and Otto (2018)</ref>. Further research is needed to better understand the temporal dynamics of metacontrol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NFC explained individual differences in model-based decision making under high rewards in</head><p>Study 2, though we did not observe a similar relationship in Study 1 and in low-stakes trials of Study 2. Thus, our findings remain inconclusive regarding a correlation between NFC and model-based decision making. While NFC generally has been associated with more cognitively effortful modes of information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cacioppo et al., 1996)</ref>, a recent study points to no relationship between NFC and basic executive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Gärtner et al., 2019)</ref> which largely mirrors the results from our studies. A potential explanation for these inconsistent findings could be that our decision-making tasklike most paradigms in experimental psychologyposes strong situational affordances and thus might reduce interindividual variability, making it more challenging to use in correlational research <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hedge, Powell, &amp; Sumner, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that NFC does not account for individual differences in metacontrol of decision making. That is, individuals low and high in NFC equally adapted their reliance on a more accurate but more effortful strategy when rewards were amplified. While some of our findings suggest that high-NFC individuals exert more cognitive effort during decision making, this relationship was not observed consistently in both studies and encourages more research on the role of personality traits in reinforcement learning.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1: Sequential decision-making task</head><p>Each trial started with an intertrial interval (black screen, 750 ms) and the presentation of a stakes cue (1000 ms). Both stakes cues (low-stakes cue = "1x" and high-stakes cue = "5x")</p><p>were assigned with equal probability to trials. After this, one of two first-stage states was presented (3000 ms) with two spaceships displayed side by side (an orange and a turquoise spaceship in one first-stage state, and a green and a blue spaceship in the other first-stage state; all spaceships were displayed equally often on the left or the right side). Participants selected the left or the right spaceship using the keys F and J on a standard computer keyboard and after a choice was made, the respective spaceship was highlighted for the remaining time of the presentation of the first-stage state. Subsequently, one of two second-stage states (a red or a purple planet with an alien) was presented and the second-stage state was deterministically determined by the choice of the spaceship. For each pair of spaceships, there was always one spaceship leading to the red planet and the other spaceship leading to the purple planet. In stable-transitions blocks, the mapping from spaceships to planets was held constant throughout the block, whereas in variable-transitions blocks, every 6 to 14 trials, one of the two pairs of spaceships switched their destination planets. Participants had 2000 ms to respond to the second-stage state by pressing the space bar. After this response window, the amount of rewards available at this planet and points received in this trial was shown. Rewards available at both planet were based on two independent Gaussian random walks (mean = 0, standard deviation = 2, reflecting boundaries at 0 and 9, values were rounded to integers).</p><p>During the task, a total point count was displayed in the top-right corner of the screen.</p><p>If no response was given during the first-stage state or the second-stage state within the respective response window, the trial was canceled, no reward was given and the task proceeded with the next trial. Trials with missing responses at the first-stage state were not included in the analysis (1% of all trials). Different to previous studies with this task, we included trials with missing responses at the second-stage state because these trials could be potentially informative for updates of the transition structure.</p><p>The task consisted of 320 trials, grouped into four blocks of 80 trials. Between blocks, the transition condition (stable vs. variable) was alternating and participants were informed at the beginning of each block about the transition condition for the upcoming trials.</p><p>In order to decrease variability between participants due to random variations in the task, we kept the reward trajectories and the sequence of first-stage states identical for all participants.</p><p>The assignment of stakes conditions to trials and of transition conditions to blocks was counterbalanced across participants.</p><p>Before starting with the sequential decision-making task, participants received a detailed instruction about the nature of the reward distribution, the transition structure and the stakes manipulation. To ensure their understanding of the task, participants had to select the spaceship leading to a planet (with 10 consecutive correct choices necessary for each planet to proceed) and to specify the number of points given a number of rewards and a stakes cue (with 10 consecutive correct answers necessary to proceed). Moreover, they performed 20 training trials for the stable-transitions condition and 20 training trials for the variable-transitions condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1: Reinforcement-learning model</head><p>The model-free learner holds reward expectations QMF(si,ai) for each action ai and state si at the i-th stage of the task. At the beginning of the task, all reward expectations are set to 4.5</p><p>(reflecting the mean of the range of possible rewards). After each choice, all reward expectations are updated according to a temporal-difference learning rule:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q MF (s , a i ) ← Q MF (s i , a i ) + × ( , ) ×</formula><p>Here, α is the reward learning rate (bounded between 0 and 1) reflecting how quickly new experiences are integrated into reward expectations. The eligibility trace e(si,ai) is set to 0 for all combinations of si and ai at the beginning of a trial; before updating reward expectations, the eligibility trace for the immediately preceding state-action pair (si', ai') is set to 1 and after the update, all eligibility traces are decayed by the eligibility trace decay parameter λ (bounded between 0 and 1). The reward prediction error δ reflects the discrepancy between experienced and expected reward and is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">δ = r + Q MF ( ′ +1 , a ′ +1 ) − Q MF (s i ′ , a i ′ )</formula><p>where r is the immediate reward obtained after a choice (note that r is always 0 after first-stage choices) and QMF(si'+1,ai'+1) is the reward expectation associated with the subsequent action ai'+1 in the new state si'+1 (note that QMF(si'+1,ai'+1) is always 0 after second-stage choices because the states that offer rewards are terminal).</p><p>The model-based learner maintains a model of the task structure represented by a transition matrix T(s2 | s1, a1) that holds probabilities for moving to a second-stage state given an action and a first-stage state. At the beginning of the task, all transition probabilities are 0.5 and after observing a transition to a second-stage state, these probabilities are updated according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( 2 | 1 , 1 ) ← ( 2 | 1 , 1 ) + × (¬ 2 | 1 , 1 ) ← (¬ 2 | 1 , 1 ) × (1 − )</formula><p>Here, η is the transition learning rate (bounded between 0 and 1) that reflects how quickly observations of transitions are integrated into the representation of the task structure. To ensure that the sum of transition probabilities stays 1, the probability for transitioning to the alternative second-stage state ⌐s2 needs to be adjusted. The state prediction error δ SPE is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= 1 − ( 2 | 1 , 1 )</formula><p>It is possible to infer the second-stage state to which the alternative, not-chosen first-stage action would have led because both actions available in a first-stage state always lead to different second-stage states. Thus, the model-based learner also updates transition probabilities for the alternative action in the same way as it does for the actual actions, using a counterfactual transition learning rate ηCF (bounded between 0 and 1).</p><p>While the model-based reward expectations at the second stage are identical to the modelfree reward expectations (because both reflect an estimate of the immediate reward), the model-based reward expectations at the first stage are computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">( 1 , 1 ) = ∑ ( 2 | 1 , 1 ) ( 2 ,<label>2 2 )</label></formula><p>At the first stage, both model-free and model-based reward expectations are combined to an integrated reward expectation Q(s1,a1) with the model-based weight ω (bounded between 0 and 1) reflecting the relative influence of the model-based learner.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">( 1 , 1 ) = (1 − ) ( 1 , 1 ) + ( 1 , 1 )</formula><p>Choice probabilities at the first stage are modeled by a softmax function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">( 1 | 1 ) = exp ( [ ( 1 , 1 ) + ⋅ ( 1 ) + ⋅ ( 1 )]) ∑ exp ( [ ( 1 , ′) + ⋅ ( ′) ′ + ⋅ ( ′)])</formula><p>Here, β is the inverse softmax temperature (left-bounded at 0) that reflects how consistently choices are guided by reward expectations. The choice stickiness π and the response stickiness ρ (both unbounded) capture perseveration (positive values) or switching (negative values) of choices (which stimulus was selected) or responses (which key was pressed) across trials. The indicator variables rep(a1) and resp(a1) are set to 1 if the same stimulus or the corresponding response key were selected in the previous trials (and are set to 0 otherwise).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1: Reinforcement-learning model</head><p>We obtained individual maximum a posteriori parameter estimates using the mfit toolbox in Matlab <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gershman, 2016)</ref> with the following priors: Beta(2,2) priors for α, λ, η, ηCF and ω;</p><p>Normal(0,1) priors for π and ρ; a Gamma(3,0.2) prior for β. To avoid local optima, the optimization procedure was started 100 times for each participant and we used the parameters of the run with the highest posterior probability. Model-based weights were estimated separately for low-stakes and high-stakes trials in both stable-transitions and variabletransitions blocks. Transition learning rates were estimated only for variable-transitions blocks and set to 1 during stable-transitions blocks. We fitted different versions of the model where the parameters λ, η, ηCF, π and ρ were varied to be free or fixed parameters and we selected the best-fitting model version based on the Akaike Information Criterion (free parameters: λ, π, ρ; fixed parameters: η = ηCF = 1).</p><p>Study 1: Data analysis.</p><p>For Bayes Factors concerning hypotheses about differences in means, we used JZS priors with scaling parameter r = √2/2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Morey &amp; Rouder, 2011)</ref> and for Bayes Factors concerning hypotheses about correlations, we used stretched beta priors with scaling parameter κ = 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ly, Verhagen, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2016)</ref> which assign equal prior probabilities to correlations between -1 and 1. We also conducted Bayes Factor robustness checks for our primary analyses, varying κ between 0.01 and 1 (see <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>).</p><p>We performed a Bayesian analogue to power analysis for a two-sided correlation test (i.e., comparing evidence for a non-zero correlation and for no correlation) and a one-sided correlation test (i.e., comparing evidence for a negative correlation and for no correlation). For different true population correlations ρ in a population of N = 1,000, we computed the proportion of 10,000 random samples of n = 126 for which a Bayes Factor would show at least moderate evidence for the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis. With our sample of N = 126 and in a two-sided correlation test, we would find at least moderate evidence with 80% probability for a non-zero correlation if the true population correlation is |ρ| ≥ .31 and for no correlation if the true population correlation is |ρ| ≤ .06. In a one-sided correlation test, we would find at least moderate evidence with 80% probability for a negative correlation if the true population correlation is ρ ≤ -.28 and for no correlation if the true population correlation is ρ ≥ -0.02.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Sequential decision-making task</head><p>We used a variant of the sequential decision-making task from study 1. Trials followed the same structure, but with a different pacing. The intertrial interval was presented for 300 ms, the stakes cue was presented for 800 ms, and both first-stage state and second-stage state were presented for 1500 ms each. The entire task consisted of 280 trials, equally distributed between low-stakes and high-stakes trials. There were no changes in the transition structure, so all spaceships kept their initial destination planets.</p><p>We excluded all trials from analysis in which no response was given during the presentation of either the first-stage state or the second-stage state (3% of all trials).</p><p>In order to decrease variability between participants due to random variations in the task, we created two independent trial sequences that determined reward trajectories and first-stage states and that were counterbalanced across participants. Within each trial sequences, the assignment of stakes conditions to trials was counterbalanced.</p><p>Before starting the task, participants received a similar task instruction as in study 1, apart from performing 25 training trials, all with a stable task structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Reinforcement-learning model</head><p>We adapted the reinforcement-learning model from study 1. Due to no changes in the transition structure in this version of the task, we set the transition matrix T to reflecting the true transition probabilities at the beginning of the task and did not model any updates of the transition matrix, thus abandoning the transition learning rate and the counterfactual transition learning rate as model parameters. Also, this model only contained two model-based weights (one for lowstakes trials and one for high-stakes trials).</p><p>Study 2: Model-fitting procedure:</p><p>We used the same model-fitting procedure as in study 1 with the following exceptions: Only two model-based weights were fitted for each participant, one for low-stakes trials and one for high-stakes trials. We fitted different versions of the model where the parameters λ, π and ρ were varied to be free or fixed parameters and we selected the best-fitting model version based on the Akaike Information Criterion (free parameters: π, ρ; fixed parameter: λ = 0).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Data analysis.</head><p>Different from Study 1, we used a scaling parameter κ = 1/3 for the stretched beta priors for Bayes Factors concerning hypotheses about correlations. Thus, more prior weight was given to correlation coefficients closer to 0, reflecting our findings in Study 1. We also conducted Bayes Factor robustness checks for our primary analyses, varying κ between 0.01 and 1 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2</ref>).</p><p>We performed a Bayesian analogue to power analysis similar to Study 1. With our sample of N = 205 and in a two-sided correlation test, we would find at least moderate evidence with 80% probability for a non-zero correlation if the true population correlation is |ρ| ≥ .23 and for no correlation if the true population correlation is |ρ| ≤ .01. In a one-sided correlation test, we would find at least moderate evidence with 80% probability for a negative correlation if the true population correlation is ρ ≤ -.21 and for no correlation if the true population correlation is ρ ≥ -0.001. <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>. Bayes Factor robustness checks for the analyses of correlations between NFC and metacontrol in Study 1.
