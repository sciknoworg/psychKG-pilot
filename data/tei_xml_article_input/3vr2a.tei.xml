<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Facial appearance is often used to verify an individual's identity. In a one-to-one matching task, the observer must determine whether two simultaneously presented images show the same person or two different people (e.g., comparing an individual to their photo ID). Despite having both images available for inspection, matching unfamiliar faces -those the observer has not seen before -is a surprisingly difficult task <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bruce et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kemp et al., 1997)</ref>. Average accuracy on standardised unfamiliar face matching tests is often between 60-80% <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Burton et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dowsett &amp; Burton, 2015;</ref>, including among professionals who perform the task regularly <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(White et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wirth &amp; Carbon, 2017</ref>). Yet, individual differences in face matching ability mean that some observers achieve perfect accuracy while others struggle to exceed chance performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bobak et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burton et al., 2010)</ref>. Due to the importance of accurate identity verification for national security and law enforcement, there have been many attempts to improve the unfamiliar face matching abilities of individuals through various training programs; however, these programs have often been unsuccessful <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Towler et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Towler et al., 2014)</ref>, or have led to only modest improvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carragher et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Towler, Keshwa, et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>While the benefits of training have been limited , one line of research that has consistently improved face matching performance involves combined decision-making. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dowsett and Burton (2015)</ref> first reported that participants achieved higher accuracy when completing a face matching task as a collaborative social pair than they did completing the same task alone. Although the authors hypothesised that this improvement came from discussions held between the paired participants, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jeckeln et al. (2018)</ref> showed that similar sized performance improvements occurred regardless of whether participants operated in real social pairs or non-social pairs, in which judgments from two non-interacting individuals were combined statistically. This "pairs advantage" is not limited to human-human interactions, since "fusing" decisions from humans and facial recognition algorithms can also lead to better performance than either achieves alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(O'Toole et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Phillips et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The pairs training effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dowsett &amp; Burton, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jeckeln et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ritchie et al., 2022)</ref> is conceptually similar to the Wisdom of the Crowd Effect (WoCE), whereby averaging the independent responses of many individuals tends to produce an overall judgement that is more accurate than that of most individuals in the crowd <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Galton, 1907)</ref>.</p><p>Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Galton (1907)</ref> first demonstrated the effect in a weight estimation task, the WoCE has been found in many domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Davis-Stober et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Herzog &amp; Hertwig, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Larrick et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Surowiecki, 2005)</ref>, including identity verification <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Balsdon et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Davis et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">White et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">White et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">White and colleagues (2013)</ref> first demonstrated the benefit of the WoCE for unfamiliar face matching, showing that aggregating the identification decisions of 20 individuals led to accuracy increases of approximately 20% when compared to their average performance as individuals. Crucially, this performance increase far exceeds the improvements achieved by training individuals to become better at the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Towler et al., 2019;</ref>, suggesting that the WoCE is a promising route to improving unfamiliar face matching performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Balsdon et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Davis et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">White et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Although unfamiliar face matching is challenging under ideal conditions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burton et al., 2010)</ref>, the task is even harder when one or both faces are obstructed. For example, the medical face masks many people now wear in public over their nose, mouth, and chin (YouGov, 2020) impair accuracy in both face recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Freud et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Thorley et al., 2022)</ref> and matching tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Estudillo et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Noyes et al., 2021)</ref>. The decrease in matching accuracy can be substantial <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Noyes et al., 2021)</ref>, with  showing declines of 13-16% when one, or both, faces in the pair were wearing masks. With a rise in the number of individuals reportedly committing crimes while wearing face masks <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ward, 2020)</ref>, developing methods to improve masked face matching performance will be vital in law enforcement and security contexts. Although a brief training course <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Towler, Keshwa, et al., 2021)</ref> has been shown to improve masked face matching accuracy by 4.9% <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carragher et al., 2022)</ref>, this improvement would not ameliorate the entire impairment caused by face masks . Across two experiments, we investigate whether the WoCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Galton, 1907;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jeckeln et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">White et al., 2013)</ref> can be leveraged to improve accuracy when matching unfamiliar masked faces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>We begin by reanalysing data from , to examine whether we can replicate the WoCE in an unfamiliar face matching task <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jeckeln et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">White et al., 2013)</ref>, and to investigate whether such an effect persists for masked faces. We predicted that while the WoCE would improve face matching performance for both masked and unmasked faces, the effect would be smaller for masked faces -consistent with previous research suggesting that the WoCE is smaller in harder tasks (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">White et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>We summarise the method of Carragher and Hancock (2020) relevant to the current study here. All participants completed the short version of the Glasgow Face Matching Test (GFMT: <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burton et al., 2010)</ref>, which consists of 40 pairs of unfamiliar faces (20 identity matches, 20 mismatches). Participants were randomly allocated to one of three mask conditions for the duration of the experiment (control, mixed, masked). Participants in the "control" condition completed the original GFMT (i.e., both faces were unmasked). For participants in the "mixed" condition, the lower half of one face in each pair was covered by a surgical face mask that was superimposed over the original image using photo-editing software. In the "masked" condition, both faces in each pair were shown wearing masks.</p><p>Participants responded whether the faces showed the "same" or "different" people, with the image pair remaining onscreen until response.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics</head><p>Experiment 1 is a re-analysis of data from . All participants had given their informed consent prior to data collection, including for their data to be used in future research. This research was approved by the General University Ethics Panel at the University of Stirling, conforming to the standards of the British Psychological Society.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Carragher and Hancock's (2020) participants lived in the UK and were recruited through the research participation website Prolific (https://www.prolific.co/). The final sample consisted of 138 participants: 53 in the control condition (Mage = 31.6, SD = 8.7), 43 in the mixed condition (Mage = 33.2, SD = 11.7), and 42 in the masked condition (Mage = 30.0, SD = 8.9).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Analysis</head><p>Whole Crowd. To investigate the conventional WoCE, we computed the majority decision of all participants in a mask condition for each face pair. Pairs answered correctly by the majority of individuals were coded as being correctly resolved by the whole crowd.</p><p>Crowd Size. To examine how the WoCE develops with crowd size, we generated 500 crowds from random combinations of participants for each crowd size between 2 and 40 members (inclusive). Every crowd created was unique. As above, trials where the average accuracy of the constituent crowd members was above 50% were classified as being correctly resolved by the crowd. When the average accuracy of even-numbered crowds was exactly 50% (3.43% of all crowd trials), we programmed a coin-flip to randomly decide whether the trial would resolve correctly (49.87%) or incorrectly (50.13%). Below, we report the average performance of the 500 crowds for each crowd size.</p><p>Measures. We only report our analysis of overall accuracy in the main text. Further analysis using signal detection measures of Area Under the Curve (AUC) and sensitivity <ref type="formula">d¢</ref>is available in the supplementary materials . The results of these analysis are highly consistent with those reported for overall accuracy, and the conclusions presented here remain unchanged. We do, however, report criterion in the main text as a descriptive measure of response bias . Positive criterion values indicate a conservative bias toward responding "different", whereas negative criterion signals a liberal response bias of responding "same".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Wisdom of the Whole Crowd</head><p>One sample t-tests revealed that the decisions of the whole crowd were more accurate than the average performance of the individuals in each mask condition, with very large effect sizes (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Thus, the WoCE can improve masked face matching performance.</p><p>To directly compare the WoCE between mask conditions, we calculated the percentage change from each individual's performance to that of the Wisdom of the Whole Crowd [((WoWC -Individual Performance)/Individual Performance)*100]. An ANOVA revealed that the WoWC did not differ between the three mask conditions, F(2, 135) = 0.41, p = .668, ηp 2 = .01.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1</head><p>One sample t-tests comparing overall accuracy [mean (SD)] for average individual performance in each mask condition (control, mixed, masked) to the level of performance achieved by the whole "crowd", in Experiments ("Expt.") 1 and 2. As "crowd" is a single measurement, there is no variance to report. The 95%CI surround the mean difference between Individual and Crowd conditions.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Crowd Size</head><p>We conducted a series of independent samples t-tests to investigate whether doubling crowd size (1 vs 2 up to 16 vs 32) continually increased performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(White et al., 2013</ref>).</p><p>The Bonferroni corrected significance level for the five paired comparisons in each mask condition is p &lt; .010. The full inferential statistics for these comparisons are reported in the supplementary materials (see <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>).</p><p>An identical pattern of results was observed in each mask condition. The difference between average individual performance (crowd size 1) and crowd size 2 was not significant 1 . Accuracy increased significantly from crowd size 2 to 4, as it did with each subsequent doubling of crowd size, with all p's &lt; .001. Finally, three one sample t-tests confirmed that the whole crowd in each mask condition (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) outperformed crowds of 32 -albeit with smaller effect sizes, as most of the improvement had already occurred. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterising Crowd Performance</head><p>Offsetting the Mask Impairment. Compared to the control condition, average individual accuracy was 16% lower in the mixed condition, and 13% lower in the masked condition. A crowd required 17 members to overcome this deficit in the mixed condition, while the masked condition did so with 7 crowd members (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c</ref> suggests that adding members to small crowds leads to rapid performance gains, which plateau as the crowd becomes larger <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(White et al., 2013)</ref>. To determine the crowd size at which the majority of the WoWC had already been realised, we calculated the cumulative performance gain at each crowd size as a percentage of the gain in overall accuracy made by the whole crowd (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). More than 50% of the eventual WoWC in the control condition had already occurred by crowd size 4, while the mixed and masked conditions both passed the same threshold with a crowd of 5</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diminishing Returns. Visual inspection of</head><p>(see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c</ref>). Thus, even though performance continued to improve up until crowds exceeded 40 members, most of the eventual increase had already occurred by crowd size 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Criterion.</head><p>The control condition initially showed a slight bias toward responding "same", which quickly disappeared as they achieved ceiling performance (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1e</ref>). In contrast, individuals in the mixed and masked conditions initially showed a bias to respond "different", which increased with crowd size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The WoCE can improve masked face matching performance, such that the impairment caused by masks can be eliminated entirely. In contrast to our predictions, the size of the WoCE did not differ between mask conditions. However, the improvement possible for the control condition was limited by ceiling performance, complicating our interpretation of this hypothesis. A second limitation to these results is that participants made binary "same" or "different" identification decisions. Consequently, even-numbered crowds often produced a split decision (accuracy of exactly 50%), which we resolved by coin-flip.</p><p>This resolution strategy prevented even-numbered crowds from improving on the performance of the preceding odd-numbered crowd. We address both limitations in Experiment 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>We sought to replicate the results of Experiment 1 in a pre-registered experiment, using a harder face matching task  to reduce ceiling effects, and a six-point response scale to reduce instances of split decisions in even-numbered crowds. Our hypotheses were unchanged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Participants</head><p>We received consent from 164 individuals recruited via Prolific who reported living in the USA. Following our pre-registered exclusion criteria, all data were removed from individuals who did not finish the task (n = 4), attempted the task more than once (n = 1), or who failed the attention check (n = 1). We deviated from our pre-registered criteria by excluding data from participants with an AUC value £ 0.45 (n = 2), rather than AUC £ 0. All participants gave informed consent prior to data collection. On average, the experiment took 6.5 minutes to complete (SD = 3.8), and participants were reimbursed £0.90 (approx. $1.11USD) for their time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Face Matching Task. Participants completed the short version of the Kent Face</head><p>Matching Test (KFMT) which consists of 40 trials, including 20 identity matches . The standardised individual accuracy data reported by  suggest that the KFMT (66%) is harder than the GFMT (81%) used in Experiment 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Burton et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Face Masks. Unlike the surgical masks that were superimposed over the stimuli in Experiment 1, we used custom written code <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anwar &amp; Raychowdhury, 2020)</ref> to fit a plain blue colour patch over the faces (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). These plain colour patches covered the same facial features as a worn mask but achieved a personalised fit to each face image (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carragher et al., 2022)</ref>. The mask was always fitted to the larger image in each KFMT pair . <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. A pair of faces that is representative of a match trial in the "mixed" mask condition of Experiment 2. The individual shown here has consented to the publication of these images, which were not used in the experiment.</p><p>Mask Conditions. Only the "control" and "mixed" mask conditions were retained for the current experiment. We omitted the "masked" condition (both faces wearing masks), since this situation might be less likely to arise in applied contexts, whereas the mixed condition represents a scenario of trying to match a masked person to their mask-free photo ID document (or alternatively, matching an unmasked individual to a masked face captured on CCTV). Compared to control, the mixed condition also resulted in a larger performance impairment than the masked condition .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The trial procedure remained the same; with the single exception being that participants gave a 6AFC response to each trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carragher et al., 2022)</ref>, which conveyed their identification decision ("same", "different") and level of confidence ("definitely", "probably", "guess").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>The 6AFC responses were recoded as numerical values, with 1-3 corresponding to "different" (definitely, probably, guess), and 4-6 corresponding to "same" (guess, probably, definitely). The original 1-6 response values allowed us to analyse these data using AUC as the dependant variable (see supplementary materials). To calculate overall accuracy, a correct response was deemed to occur when the final averaged decision value for a trial pair was the appropriate side of 3.5.</p><p>As in Experiment 1, we calculated the performance of the whole crowd by averaging across all individual responses to each trial. We then calculated the performance of the whole crowd as we did for each individual participant. To investigate the effect of crowd size, we followed the procedure outlined in Experiment 1 to create 500 random crowds for each crowd size between 2 and 70 (inclusive).</p><p>Split Decisions. The 6AFC response scale reduced the frequency of split decisions in even-numbered groups (1.04% of all crowd trials). A programmed coin-flip decided whether crowd decisions of exactly 3.5 would receive a "same" (50.18%) or "different" response (49.82%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wisdom of the Whole Crowd</head><p>One sample t-tests showed that decisions made by the whole crowd were significantly more accurate than average individual performance in each mask condition (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The size of the WoCE did not differ between the control (M = 16.86%, SD = 18.10) and mixed conditions (M = 13.88%, SD = 17.54), t(154) = 1.04, 95%CI <ref type="bibr">[-2.66, 8.62]</ref>, p = .298, d = 0.17.</p><p>Both findings replicate the results of Experiment 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Crowd Size</head><p>Like Experiment 1, we conducted a series of sequential independent samples t-tests to investigate how the WoCE develops as crowd size doubles (1 vs 2 up to 32 vs 64). The Bonferroni corrected significance level for the six comparisons in each mask condition is p &lt; .008. The full inferential statistics are reported in the supplementary materials (see <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>).</p><p>For both conditions, overall accuracy did not improve significantly in crowds of 2 (but did for the control condition when measuring AUC, see supplementary materials). In the control condition, accuracy improved with each doubling of crowd size from 2-4 through 16-32. Changes beyond crowd size 32 were non-significant. The pattern of improvement was less consistent in the mixed condition. Accuracy improved as crowd size doubled from 2-4, 4-8, and 16-32, but not between crowds 8-16 or 32-64. There was, however, a very slight improvement from the crowds of 64 to the entire crowd of 80.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterising Performance</head><p>Offsetting the Mask Impairment. Average individual accuracy in the mixed condition (M = 58.41%) represented an 11.0% decrease in performance compared to the control condition (M = 65.63%). Unlike Experiment 1, the WoCE did not entirely offset this deficit at any level of crowd size, with the highest average accuracy of 65.04% achieved by crowds of 39 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1b)</ref>. Although this level of accuracy does not surpass that achieved by individuals for unmasked faces, it would result in the same number of KFMT trials being resolved correctly (26/40). As noted in the supplementary materials, the mixed condition overcomes the mask impairment at crowd size 11 when performance is measured by AUC.</p><p>Diminishing Returns. The control condition achieved 50% of WoCE for total crowd performance (n = 76) at crowd size 5, while the mixed condition (n = 80) achieved this level at crowd size 6 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1d</ref>).</p><p>Criterion. Individuals in both conditions initially showed a bias to respond "different", which increased with crowd size (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1f</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>These results replicate those of Experiment 1. The WoCE led to large increases in face matching performance for both conditions. Despite avoiding a ceiling effect in the control condition, the size of the WoCE did not differ between the control and mixed conditions. While we created a crowd of 80 members, most of this eventual WoCE for the mixed condition had already occurred in crowds of 6, while 90% of the eventual improvement was present in crowds of 23. These data are consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">White et al. (2013)</ref> who reported that performance improvements were minor once crowds exceeded 10 observers. Our data support this conclusion, suggesting that there may be little benefit to creating such large crowds in the context of face matching tasks.</p><p>Curiously, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1d</ref> shows that the WoCE peaks around crowd sizes 40-50 and then drops slightly as crowd size continues to increase. While our investigation of this finding goes beyond the scope of this paper, our preliminary simulations show that this pattern is related to the 6AFC confidence response scale. When averaging three decisions, one confidently correct response (e.g., responding "definitely same" on a match trial = 6) outweighs two incorrect responses with low confidence ("guess different" = 3). However, most responses are relatively low confidence, meaning the average response of the whole crowd for face pairs often sits near the decision threshold of 3.5. Creating mid-sized crowds (40-50) requires that just over half the participants are sampled. Because our data include more confidently correct responses than confidently incorrect responses (19.9% vs 8.7%), there are more 'lucky' crowds in this mid-range, which contain enough confidently correct responses to pull the crowd's average response to the correct side of threshold. However, creating larger crowds requires most, and eventually all, participants to be sampled, including those who are confidently incorrect, resulting in the slight decrease in accuracy seen among larger crowds. Notably, no such decrease is seen when performance is measured by AUC, since AUC does not have a fixed decision threshold (see supplementary materials).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Face masks significantly impair our ability to both recognise <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Freud et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Thorley et al., 2022)</ref> and match faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Noyes et al., 2021)</ref>, creating a challenge for law enforcement to accurately identify masked offenders <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ward, 2020)</ref>. Across two experiments, we have shown that the WoCE can substantially improve identification accuracy for unfamiliar masked faces in a one-to-one matching task. We believe this is the first method shown to entirely overcome the impairment masks cause to identification accuracy among human observers.</p><p>Previous research reported that a brief training course improved an individual's masked face matching accuracy by an average of 4.9% <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carragher et al., 2022)</ref>, which is consistent with the improvement seen among the more successful approaches to training face matching ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Towler et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Towler, Keshwa, et al., 2021)</ref>. However, since this training course instructed participants to compare the ears and any facial markings (e.g., moles or scars) on the faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Towler, Keshwa, et al., 2021)</ref>, it would not benefit every face pair. Moreover, the reported improvement in performance would not offset the entire impairment caused by the face masks . Among the equivalent "mixed" mask condition in Experiment 1, we found the WoCE had already increased accuracy by 8.0% in crowds of 3, before eventually increasing accuracy by 22.8% among the whole crowd of 43. Even on the harder KFMT in Experiment 2, overall accuracy among the "mixed" condition had already increased by 4.9% in crowds of 5, and 11.3% in the whole crowd of 80. Compared to training individuals to become better at face matching, our data suggest that simply fusing the identification decisions of independent observers to produce the WoCE is a highly effective approach to improving masked face matching performance.</p><p>Based on <ref type="bibr">White et al.'s (2013)</ref> observation that the WoCE was smaller for harder face matching tasks, we predicted that the WoCE would be smaller in the mixed and masked conditions than the control condition. This prediction was not supported in either experiment.</p><p>Yet, the WoCE does appear to have been smaller in Experiment 2 than Experiment 1, which is consistent with the KFMT being harder than the GFMT .</p><p>Therefore, the WoCE may be smaller for harder tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(White et al., 2013)</ref> in the control condition, in which case there can be no bias. However, where performance is sub-optimal, the bias of a crowd will reflect that of the individual group members. The criterion among individuals in the mixed and masked conditions is initially positive (a bias toward responding "different"). Creating random crowds from these individuals only increases this bias. The same pattern of results is evident in Experiment 2. Therefore, even though overall accuracy improves in these conditions, further analysis reveals that there is more improvement for mismatch pairs than match pairs (see supplementary materials).</p><p>Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Galton (1907)</ref> first demonstrated that the wisdom of the crowd could be used to accurately guess the weight of a butchered ox, the effect has been observed in many domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Davis-Stober et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Larrick et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Surowiecki, 2005)</ref>, including unfamiliar face matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Balsdon et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Davis et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">White et al., 2013)</ref>. We have shown that the WoCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Galton, 1907)</ref> can also be leveraged to improve accuracy when attempting to match unfamiliar faces that are wearing masks. Our findings offer a promising solution to the challenging problem of masked face identification by humans. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Consistent with our interpretation of criterion in the main text <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1e</ref>), the mixed and masked conditions experienced greater increases in performance due to the WoCE for mismatch trials compared to match trials. We can see from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures S2 and S3</ref> that despite the larger increases in mismatch trial accuracy among the mixed and masked conditions, the pattern of improvement in all three mask conditions is very similar to that reported for overall accuracy in the main text. That is, rapid improvements are made as individuals are added to small crowds, which dimmish as the crowd becomes larger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>Deviation from pre-registered exclusion criteria</p><p>Our pre-registration stated that we would exclude participants with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) £ 0.48 (where 0.50 is equivalent to chance). However, we revised this exclusion criteria because the tail end of performance distribution in the mixed condition fell beyond this threshold (8 participants in the mixed condition recorded an AUC between 0.48 and 0.45). Since our intention was to use this criterion to exclude data from participants that might not have understood the task, rather than those who found the task difficult, the original criterion was not fit for purpose. Excluding these participants would artificially inflate the average performance of the mixed condition -ultimately reducing the performance impairment caused by masks, which is known to be substantial . A secondary data file with crowds created from individuals who met our original exclusion criteria is available in the OSF repository for transparency. As reported in the main text, we excluded data from participants with an AUC £ 0.45, which affected one participant in the control condition, and one participant in the mixed condition.</p></div>

Even more striking are the results for the mixed condition, where average individual accuracy begins at 54.9% and steadily decreases until reaching 45% among a crowd of 80 -a decrease of 18.1%. <ref type="figure">Figure S5</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Despite the change in overall accuracy (see main text) resembling that of Experiment 1, a separate examination of accuracy for match and mismatch trials reveals a different story.</p><p>Crowds in both conditions made significant gains in mismatch trial accuracy, as a result of the individual tendency to respond "different" across trials, which was exaggerated in crowds (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1f</ref>). Conversely, there was no change in accuracy for match trials among the control condition, and a surprising decrease in accuracy for the mixed condition. These results further speak to the notion that the wisdom of the crowd is not a guaranteed route to achieve ceiling performance. Rather, the benefit of the effect appears to be dependent on the characteristics of the individual responses collected.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Expt</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, but it is possible that the initial differences between mask conditions are not large enough for this effect to emerge. Although the size of the WoCE did not differ between mask conditions, Figures 1c and 1d show that the control condition crowds often required fewer members to reach certain WoCE performance benchmarks compared to the mixed or masked conditions, hinting that there may be differences in the efficiency of crowds between mask conditions.While our data show that the WoCE is an effective route to improving masked face matching performance, we would caution readers against using these data to create definitive guidelines for implementing the WoCE in applied contexts. For example, the exact crowd size needed to offset the mask impairment varies between measures (see supplementary materials), and between tasks (GFMT, KFMT). But the consistent patterns across both experiments speak to three general conclusions we can draw regarding leveraging the WoCE for face matching tasks. First, the WoCE can be substantial even in tasks with relatively poor, but above chance, average individual performance. Second, although performance generally increases with crowd size, 90% of the improvement seen among very large crowds had occurred among crowds of 23 or fewer in every condition tested. Thus, it might not be necessary to recruit such large crowds in applied settings. Finally, the WoCE is not a guaranteed route to perfect performance, since the whole control condition crowd only achieved accuracy of 75% in Experiment 2. Therefore, the decisions of a crowd should not be</figDesc><table><row><cell>considered absolute truth.</cell></row><row><cell>A less intuitive observation from our data is that averaging decisions for a crowd does</cell></row><row><cell>not necessarily moderate the response biases present among individuals; rather, biases can</cell></row><row><cell>actually become exaggerated in crowds.
