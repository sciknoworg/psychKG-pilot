<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Explaining the description-experience gap in risky decision-making: Learning and memory retention during experience as causal mechanisms</p><p>In modern life, we make numerous decisions between competing options despite probabilistic outcomes and incomplete knowledge surrounding their potential outcomes. Indeed, whether we are deciding between movies, car insurance plans, or even serious medical procedures, we frequently seek out statistics to help evaluate the probability of various good or bad outcomes. In these situations, in the absence of prior experience and where probabilities are explicitly described (description-based decisions or DBDs), people appear to act as if they overestimate or overweight low probability events. This has led to the idea that people assign weights to explicitly described likelihoods, resulting in risk-seeking choices for low-probability gains due to overweighting of rare events and risk-averse behavior for high-probability gains due to underweighting of common events <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Scholten &amp; Read, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Notably, this probability weighting bias has long been thought to play a primary role in how people evaluate real-world phenomena, including the prevalence rates for rare causes of death <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, &amp; Combs, 1978)</ref>, the value of insurance policies for rare events <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Friedman &amp; Savage, 1948)</ref>, and changes in preferences for political and economic policies (Quattrone <ref type="bibr">&amp; Tversky, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, however, it has become clear that the format in which probabilities are presented to us can dramatically affect our apparent preferences. Specifically, people act as if they underweight low probabilities when they are learned through experience (experience-based decision or EBD), a paradoxical reversal of traditional probability weighting bias now termed the description-experience gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barron &amp; Erev, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hertwig, Barron, Weber, &amp; Erev, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ungemach, Chater, &amp; Stewart, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Weber, Shafir, &amp; Blais, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wulff, Mergenthaler-Canseco, &amp; Hertwig, 2018)</ref>. Drawing from the examples above, we would expect more people to purchase rare event insurance or opt out of a medical procedure with rare harmful side effects if they are making a decision based purely on described probabilities rather than based on their previous experiences of these events.</p><p>As inference on parameters derived from computational models of both DBD and EBD tasks becomes increasingly common to assess clinical (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahn &amp; Busemeyer, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Montague et al., 2012)</ref>, social (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chung, Christopoulos, King-Casas, Ball, &amp; Chiu, 2015)</ref>, affective (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Eldar, Rutledge, Dolan, &amp; Niv, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Etkin, BÃ¼chel, &amp; Gross, 2015)</ref>, developmental (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Steingroever, Jepma, Lee, Jansen, &amp; Huizenga, 2019)</ref>, and medical decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lejarraga, Pachur, Frey, Hertwig, 2016)</ref>, it is becoming increasingly important that we identify the potential mechanism(s) that gives rise to the description-experience gap to ensure that variation in key model parameters is driven by individual characteristics (e.g., cognitive development, clinical status, personality traits) rather than task-specific design choices. Therefore, given the importance of the description-experience gap for understanding real-world human decisionmaking, we aimed to develop an explanatory cognitive mechanism linking preferences in DBDs to those of EBDs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanisms of the Description-Experience Gap</head><p>Although many explanations of the gap have been proposed, three mechanisms in particular have been the focus of much prior research: (1) reliance on small samples and sampling bias when learning probabilities (i.e., sampling error), (2) reliance on more recently experienced samples, and (3) changes in the psychological representation of probability (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fox &amp; Hadar, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hertwig &amp; Erev, 2009)</ref>. Regarding (1), the format of the tasks used to assess EBDs (i.e., sampling paradigms with optional stopping) is such that some participants either never or less frequently encounter the "rare event" when drawing samples from a choice option, which naturally leads to apparent underweighting of low probability events once making a choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hau, Pleskac, &amp; Hertwig, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hertwig et al., 2004)</ref>. Such biased sampling occurs because rare event frequency follows a binomial distribution, which is heavily skewed when few samples are drawn (i.e., n is low), meaning that the actual experienced proportion of encounters with a given outcome will often be biased relative to the true outcome probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hertwig, Barron, Weber, &amp; Erev, 2004)</ref>. For similar reasons, (2) can lead to an apparent underweighting because higher probability outcomes are more likely to be recently observed relative to lower probability outcomes in small sample settings, and people tend to place higher weight on more recent outcomes or simply ignore or forget less recent outcomes when making EBDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hertwig et al., 2004)</ref>. Finally, although less parsimonious than (1) or (2), (3) suggests that people evaluate probabilities differently between tasks, assigning less weight to low-probability outcomes in EBDs relative to DBDs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref> for a graphical example). <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ungemach et al. (2009)</ref> showed that when using an experimental design to eliminate sampling bias (by matching the experienced proportion of each outcome to its respective objective probability of occurring), cumulative prospect theory modeling still revealed underweighting of rare events in EBDs. Many studies have since followed suit, and a recent meta-analysis of over 6,000 individual participants draws similar conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Wulff et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Altogether, available evidence suggests that sampling biases and recency contribute to the description-experience gap, but also that probabilities or rewards are fundamentally different when evaluated based on description compared to experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hertwig &amp; Erev, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kellen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wulff et al., 2018)</ref>. This begs the question-how does context affect something as fundamental to preferential decision-making as the value of rewards and probabilities?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling the Gap</head><p>In one of the first studies of its kind, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">GlÃ¶ckner et al. (2016)</ref> examined differences in CPT valuation parameters between description and experience tasks from multiple previous studies and found that rare events carried more weight for EBDs relative to DBDs-a reversal of the typical description-experience gap. Follow-up analyses revealed that the type of gamble was a significant moderator of the size and direction of the gap, such that analyses of "reduced" gambles including at least one certain option produced a traditional gap, and "non-reduced" gambles containing no certain options predicted a reversal of the gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(GlÃ¶ckner, Hilbig, Henninger, &amp; Fiedler, 2016)</ref> 2 . Using a within-subject design, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kellen et al. (2016)</ref> replicated and expanded <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">GlÃ¶ckner et al.'s (2016)</ref> findings of a reversed description-experience gap using hierarchical Bayesian modeling of CPT parameters across over 100 participants who underwent the same set of 114 gambles for both description and experience presentations, concluding that "Our results suggest that outcome and probability information translate into systematically different subjective representations in description-versus experience-based choice." <ref type="bibr">(Kellen et al., 2016, p. 126)</ref>. These foundational applications of CPT to model the description-experience gap-which moved away from heuristic methods of testing hypotheses in favor of more formalized, substantive models of psychological processes-led to novel and counterintuitive insights into a previously well-replicated behavioral phenomenon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning and Memory as Causal Mechanisms</head><p>Similar to Regenwetter &amp; Robinson (2017), we argue that the most commonly used method of modeling EBDs with CPT relies on a set of strong assumptions that introduce bias into the estimation of probability weighting due to model mis-specification. Specifically, to control for participants' unique learning history in EBDs, the probability of each outcome is assumed to be equal to the experienced proportion of outcomes observed for each participant-gamble pair (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Camilleri &amp; Newell, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">GlÃ¶ckner, Hilbig, Henninger, &amp; Fiedler, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kellen, Pachur, &amp; Hertwig, 2016)</ref>. For example, if a person draws samples â {$4, $4, $4, $0} for gamble , the probability for each outcome is heuristically set to the empirical proportion of samples that it was observed before CPT modeling (if = 1 indicates $4, and = 2 indicates $0, then ,1 = .75 and ,2 = .25). However, this heuristic method implicitly makes three strong assumptions, all of which are difficult to reconcile with learning and memory research:</p><p>(1) Learning and memory for all past samples is perfect,</p><p>(2) There are no individual differences in trial-by-trial learning across participants, and</p><p>(3) Learning occurs through a single, static mechanism.</p><p>These assumptions are easier to scrutinize if we formalize the implicit learning and memory models underlying them. Note that readers can refer to <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 1</ref> for an overview of the model terms and interpretations while reading through the next section.</p><p>If we assume learning progresses through a strength-based learning mechanism, the following delta learning rule is implied as samples are experienced (a.k.a. a simplified Rescorla-Wagner updating rule; <ref type="bibr">Rescorla &amp; Wagner, 1972)</ref>: which can be re-written as follows to better correspond to memory models that we discuss later on:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p g,j := p g,j + A â¥ (I g,j,s p g,j )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>&lt; l a t e x i t s h a 1 _ b a s e 6 4 = " ( n u l l ) " &gt; ( n u l l ) &lt; / l a t e x i t &gt; &lt; l a t e x i t s h a 1 _ b a s e 6 4 = " ( n u l l ) " &gt; ( n u l l ) &lt; / l a t e x i t &gt; &lt; l a t e x i t s h a 1 _ b a s e 6 4 = " ( n u l l ) " &gt; ( n u l l ) &lt; / l a t e x i t &gt; &lt; l a t e x i t s h a 1 _ b a s e 6 4 = " ( n u l l ) " &gt; ( n u l l ) &lt; / l a t e x i t &gt;</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p g,j := (1 A) â¥ p g,j + A â¥ I g,j,s<label>(2)</label></formula><p>&lt; l a t e x i t s h a 1 _ b a s e 6 4 = " ( n u l l ) " &gt; ( n u l l ) &lt; / l a t e x i t &gt; &lt; l a t e x i t s h a 1 _ b a s e 6 4 = " ( n u l l ) " &gt; ( n u l l ) &lt; / l a t e x i t &gt; &lt; l a t e x i t s h a 1 _ b a s e 6 4 = " ( n u l l ) " &gt; ( n u l l ) &lt; / l a t e x i t &gt; &lt; l a t e x i t s h a 1 _ b a s e 6 4 = " ( n u l l ) " &gt; ( n u l l ) &lt; / l a t e x i t &gt; Above, is a learning rate, indicates the outcome within a given gamble , indicates the sample number, and , , is an indicator that equals 1 or 0 if outcome is observed or unobserved on the given sample, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ahn et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Haines et al., 2019)</ref>. In this formulation, irrespective to the initial value for , , if the learning rate is set such that = 1 , then , will always be equivalent to the proportion of times that outcome is observed up to sample , resulting in the same behavioral predictions (perfect knowledge and memory of all previous outcomes) as the heuristic CPT implementation.</p><p>We could equivalently formalize the heuristic CPT analyses with an instance-based memory model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gonzalez, Dutt, &amp; Lejarraga, 2011)</ref>. For example, if we assume that each encounter with an outcome leaves a memory trace of that outcome, that each trace decays exponentially in time (indexed by sample number), and that the salience of each outcome is determined by the relative strength of its memory traces compared to traces for alternative outcomes within the given choice option, then we can use the following simplified decay memory rule to generate outcome probabilities:</p><p>Here, , indicates the number of times that outcome has been observed for gamble up to the current sample , (1 â ) is a memory trace decay rate, is the number of different outcomes that can be observed within the given gamble, and , , is the same indicator as described above.</p><p>If (1 â ) = 1, then , will always equal the objective number of times that outcome has been observed up to sample , and the summation (i.e. "blending") will subsequently return the proportion of times that outcome is observed across trials, akin to the delta learning rule above.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">n g,j := (1 A) â¢ n g,j + I g,j,s p g,j := n g,j P J k=1 n g,k<label>(3)</label></formula><p>&lt; l a t e x i t s h a 1 _ b a s e 6 4 = " ( n u l l ) " &gt; ( n u l l ) &lt; / l a t e x i t &gt; &lt; l a t e x i t s h a 1 _ b a s e 6 4 = " ( n u l l ) " &gt; ( n u l l ) &lt; / l a t e x i t &gt; &lt; l a t e x i t s h a 1 _ b a s e 6 4 = " ( n u l l ) " &gt; ( n u l l ) &lt; / l a t e x i t &gt; &lt; l a t e x i t s h a 1 _ b a s e 6 4 = " ( n u l l ) " &gt; ( n u l l ) &lt; / l a t e x i t &gt;</p><p>Note that in this specific setting, the delta learning and decay memory rules are equivalent except that in the decay memory rule, the experienced outcome is given a weight of 1 as opposed to being weighted in proportion to the learning rate. There are more general relationships between the delta and decay rule, but they are not relevant for the current analyses (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Turner, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Given these formal definitions, we now turn back to assumptions 1-3 listed above.</p><p>Assumptions <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1) and</ref>(2) imply that either = 1 or = 0 for all participants in the case of the delta learning or decay memory rules, respectively, thus giving equivalent weight to all experienced outcomes irrespective to the time at which they were experienced. However, it is well known that people place higher weight on more recent samples when making EBDs and that there are substantial individual differences in learning rate or memory decay between people. In fact, individual differences in learning rate or memory decay during EBDs are associated with neurodegenerative disease status (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Busemeyer &amp; Stout, 2002)</ref>, delinquent behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Yechiam, Busemeyer, Stout, &amp; Bechara, 2005)</ref>, and age-related changes in impulsive decisionmaking (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wood, Busemeyer, Koling, Cox, &amp; Davis, 2005)</ref>. More generally, there is an extensive and longstanding literature on the basic psychological mechanisms underlying frequency or probability learning that reveals biases (e.g., toward recently experienced outcomes, attention to wins versus losses, etc.) in how people estimate probabilities or assign salience to outcomes (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Estes, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gonzalez, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zacks &amp; Hasher, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding assumption (3), there is growing evidence that people learn at different rates for positive versus negative surprises (i.e., prediction errors) or outcomes, which can lead to riskseeking or risk-averse behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Christakou et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Daw, Kakade, &amp; Dayan, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Doll, Jacobs, Sanfey, &amp; Frank, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Haines, Vassileva, &amp; Ahn, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Niv, Edlund, Dayan, &amp; O'Doherty, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Turner, 2019)</ref>. In fact, the magnitude of such individual differences in learning rates is genetically linked to striatal dopamine functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cox et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Frank, Moustafa, Haughey, Curran, &amp; Hutchison, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Frank, Seeberger, &amp; O'Reilly, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, learning from positive outcomes is associated with Striatal D1 receptor density, while learning from negative outcomes is associated with D2 receptor binding. Although both are modulated by dopamine, this dissociation implies that the two components of learning -positive and negative -correspond to physiologically <ref type="bibr">(Cox et al,</ref><ref type="bibr">201)</ref> and genetically <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Frank et al, 2007)</ref> distinct processes. Converging evidence from fMRI BOLD analyses showed that manipulations of reward variance led to distinct prediction error signals in nucleus accumbens corresponding to rates of positive and negative prediction errors, favoring a model with distinct positive and negative learning rates (Niv et al., 2012).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current Study</head><p>Altogether, most approaches to studying the description-experience gap assume that people have optimal learning rates, decay-free memory representations of experienced outcome frequencies (which we term "imperfect learning and memory"), and no individual differences in learning or decay rates. These tenuous assumptions can both lead to biased inferences on performance differences between DBDs and EBDs when using the heuristic CPT method.</p><p>Furthermore, there is growing neural and behavioral evidence that people learn asymmetrically from positive versus negative predictions errors. As demonstrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, such biased learning can partially explain changes in behavior consistent with the description-experience gap, yet typical approaches to modeling the gap fail to account for asymmetric learning.</p><p>Here, we examine the consequences of removing these assumptions by integrating learning and memory models with decision-making theories. Our core argument is that, rather than estimating additional parameters in the CPT utility function to describe the description-experience gap, it is more fruitful to explain the gap by identifying and modeling psychological learning or memory mechanism(s) that lead to preference differences across description and experience. To do so, we first conduct a simulation study to determine how individual differences in learning during the sampling phase of EBDs (and asymmetric learning in particular) can bias CPT parameters when using the heuristic method that assumes no learning or memory effects. Next, we develop a variety of computational models that instantiate different learning or memory mechanisms and determine which model provides the best joint statistical account of behavior in DBDs and EBDs. This latter model comparison approach allowed us to test specific hypotheses regarding differences between DBD and EBD tasks, including whether the proposed learning mechanism described true behavior better than CPT models assuming differences in probability weighting, risk aversion, or loss aversion in addition to other mechanism we describe below.</p><p>Inspired by the results of our simulation study, we next fit a series of competing models to empirical within-subject data collected from 104 participants across 114 unique description-and experience-based gambles to determine the degree to which people engage in behavior consistent with the integrated learning and decision-making models we propose.</p><p>Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how formalizing and quantitatively comparing competing hypotheses can enhance our understanding of complex psychological phenomena in a way not afforded by experimental design alone. We begin below with a mathematical overview of the models used throughout both our simulation and empirical study.</p></div>

We used this single-parameter version because we were most interested in changes in probability weighting rather than probability elevation, and the symmetry allows for easier interpretation compared to CPT's original instantiation 5 .

Loss-aversion is captured by &gt; 1 (i.e. losses are weighted more heavily than gains), whereas loss-seeking is captured by &lt; 1.

For the simulation study, we set = 1 for convenience and did not estimate it as a free parameter. For the empirical study, we estimated as a free parameter.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinforcement Learning CPT Hybrid Model</head><p>The RL-CPT model extends CPT from pure description-based tasks into experience-based tasks by assuming that the probability ( , ) for each choice outcome is learned through</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Pr[Choice = g] = exp( â¥ V g ) P 2 k=1 exp( â¥ V k )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>experience during sampling for EBDs. Therefore, RL-CPT assumes that traditional CPT parameters ( , , ) are equivalent across DBDs and EBDs, and any differences in preferences between tasks are captured by the effects of a dynamic learning mechanism. When , is given (i.e. DBDs), the RL-CPT model simply reduces to traditional CPT, with a single set of valuation parameters estimated for each participant. Conversely, when , is not given, the RL-CPT learns , through repeated sampling using the strength-based learning rule described in the introduction (see Equation 1-2). Specifically, we assume that , = .5 once the given outcome is observed-indicating maximum uncertainty-and is then updated after each sample with a different learning rate depending on whether the observed outcome is better or worse than expected. If outcome is not observed while sampling option , then , remains at 0 and the outcome subsequently plays no role in the final preference judgement. Additionally, we assumed that, if one outcome has already been observed such that ,1 has already taken on some value different from 0 or .5, then upon observing outcome ,2 for the first time, updating begins from ,2 â 1 â ,1 rather than from ,2 â .5. Setting the initial values for , in this way assumes that people keep track of how likely various outcomes within a given option are relative to one another, such that if one outcome is very common, the other must be rare and vice versa. Further, this scheme ensures that if people observe more than one outcome for a given option, that the outcome probabilities sum to 1 (i.e. ,1 + ,2 = 1). The learning rule is then:</p><p>Here, + (0 &lt; + &lt; 1) and -(0 &lt; -&lt; 1) are learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors, respectively, and = ( ) â is the prediction error generated</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">8j 2 J, p g,j := p g,j + ( A + â¥ (I g,j,s p g,j ), if P E 0 A â¥ (I g,j,s p g,j ), otherwise<label>(8)</label></formula><p>after observing the outcome of sample . The first term, ( ), is the utility (see Equation 6) of the experienced outcome upon drawing sample . Then, is the expected value (see Equation 4) for gamble that was sampled. Intuitively, the learning rule described by Equation 8 assumes that people update their expectations for how likely each outcome is to occur differently based on whether the observed outcome was better ( â¥ 0) or worse ( &lt; 0) than expected. If + = â , then Equation 8 is identical to the single learning rate learning rule described in the introduction (see Equation 1). However, when + &lt; â , higher negative relative to positive learning rates leads to an underestimation of the high outcome probability and therefore produces risk-averse behavior.</p><p>After iterating through each sample a participant draws before making a choice, the resulting , estimates from Equation 8 are entered into Equation 5. This explicit learning mechanism contrasts the traditional heuristic analyses of EBDs where , is simply set to the experienced proportion of each outcome (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">GlÃ¶ckner, Hilbig, Henninger, &amp; Fiedler, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kellen, Pachur, &amp; Hertwig, 2016</ref>). As we described in detail in the introduction, the heuristic method of setting , to the experienced proportion of each outcome is analytically equivalent to a special case of the RL-CPT model wherein + = â = 1 . This mathematical correspondence allows us to find evidence for traditional probability weighting and mean-tracking models (described below) as special / nested cases of the RL-CPT model. All other aspects of RL-CPT are equivalent to standard CPT.</p><p>The RL-CPT differs from other learning and memory models of EBDs in two important ways. First, learning and memory models including the scanning model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Estes, 1976)</ref>,</p><p>Value-updating Model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hau et al., 2008)</ref>, Decay-reinforcement model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Erev &amp; Roth, 1998)</ref>, delta-rule learning model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Busemeyer &amp; Myung, 1992)</ref>, prospect valence learning model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ahn, Busemeyer, Wagenmakers, &amp; Stout, 2008)</ref>, and the ACT-R inspired Instance-Based Learning model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gonzalez, Dutt, &amp; Lejarraga, 2011)</ref> do not directly estimate probabilities. Instead, they assume that people either learn the expected average return of an option (in the case of learning models) or sample memory traces of previously encountered stimuli to evaluate the relative frequency of potential outcomes (in the case of memory models).</p><p>By contrast, the RL-CPT model assumes that people directly learn the probability of each outcome occurring before integrating probabilities with their respective outcome values (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Haines et al., 2018)</ref>. Despite making different mechanistic assumptions, models that update toward the average value of an option (e.g., the delta-rule learning model) produce the same behavioral predictions as a special case of the RL-CPT, where learning rates are equivalent ( + = â ) and all CPT valuation parameters ( , , ) are set to 1. In this reduced case, the RL-CPT model will update toward the objective expected value of an option. More generally, the explicit tracking of probabilities in the RL-CPT is necessary to both: (1) model DBDs, which ask people to integrate potential outcomes with their explicitly given probabilities; and (2) compare probability weighting across DBDs and EBDs. Therefore, the RL-CPT can only be compared to the above learning and memory models in the context of EBDs because other learning and memory models do not make clear predictions for DBDs. However, because memory decay is a reasonable competing explanation for differences between DBDs and EBDs, we also tested an instance-based model that estimates outcome probabilities using a memory decay mechanism as a competing mechanism to the RL-CPT model. We describe this model in the next section.</p><p>Second, the RL-CPT includes a pair of learning rates to account for asymmetric learning of positive versus negative predictions errors (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Mihatsch, &amp; Neuneier, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Niv, Edlund, Dayan, &amp; O'Doherty, 2012)</ref>, whereas the abovementioned models contain only a single learning or memory decay mechanism. The asymmetric learning mechanism in the RL-CPT is qualitatively different from attention mechanisms in other models, which assume that people differentially attend to gains versus losses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Busemeyer &amp; Stout, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Estes, 1976)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, because the learning rate is dependent on the sign of the sample-to-sample prediction error rather than the outcome domain (see Equation 8), a learning asymmetry can lead to biased probability expectations within any domain (e.g., for gains, losses, or mixed gambles).</p><p>Conversely, asymmetric attention to gains versus losses is necessarily a between-domain effect.</p><p>In sum, the RL-CPT can produce biased expectations of outcome probabilities (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>), which allows it to account for preference differences between DBDs and EBDs in a way that alternative models are unable to capture. Further, because traditional CPT characterizes risk sensitivity through valuation parameters alone, it follows that any changes in risky behavior resulting from an asymmetric learning mechanism may lead to biased inferences in CPT valuation parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instance-Based Memory CPT Hybrid Model</head><p>As a competing mechanism to strength-based updating rule in the RL-CPT, we also developed an instance-based memory and CPT hybrid model (IB-CPT) that estimates the probability ( , ) for each choice outcome in EBDs using the memory decay plus normalization step described in the introduction (see Equation 3). From the instance-based perspective, , is thought of as the memory salience of a given outcome relative to other possible outcomes. All other aspects of the IB-CPT model are equivalent to the RL-CPT model described abovetraditional CPT parameters ( , , ) are assumed to be equivalent across DBDs and EBDs, and differences in preferences between contexts are captured by the effects of the dynamic memory decay mechanism. As described in the introduction, the memory decay rule in the IB-CPT reduces to the heuristic CPT implementation when the memory decay rate is set to 0.</p><p>Despite sharing core features with other instance-based models, the IB-CPT differs from other instance-based models in one important way. For example, the Instance-Based Learning model is one extant model that assumes that people multiply (i.e. "blend") probabilities and their respective outcomes to determine the subjective value for each gamble <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gonzalez, Dutt, &amp; Lejarraga, 2011)</ref>. The probabilities are determined by sampling memory traces of experienced outcomes, which allows the model to capture deviations of individuals' choices from the objective expected value of each gamble-the use of memory decay and "blending" to arrive at outcome probabilities and expected values is equivalent to our formulation of the IB-CPT. For DBDs, however, the memory trace sampling process in the Instance-Based Learning model drops out of the equation (there are no prior experiences to sample), reducing to a simple expected value model which assumes that people make choices to maximize the objective expected value of each pair of gambles. Because this assumption is: (1) inconsistent with research on DBDs, (2) is contained as a special case of the CPT model that we tested (when = = = 1), and (3) extends to all instance-based models described above, we did not test <ref type="bibr">Gonzalez et al.'s (2011)</ref> specific implementation of an instance-based learning model in the current study, opting instead for the formulation of the IB-CPT described above.</p><p>In summary, the traditional CPT, RL-CPT, and IB-CPT models are all equivalent in the context of DBDs, but they differ in how they assume people learn to integrate experienced outcomes into their decision process in the context of EBDs. Therefore, comparing the models allows for us to determine how well each of the proposed learning and memory mechanisms can account for the description-experience gap. Before fitting the models to empirical data, however, we conducted a simulation study to determine what the heuristic CPT analyses will reveal if data are actually generated by the learning model instantiated by the RL-CPT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation Study</head><p>We focus our simulations on the RL-CPT due to the relationships between asymmetric learning and risk aversion, which could drive differences in probability weighting (and outcome valuation more generally) between DBDs and EBDs. However, we emphasize that memory decay in the IB-CPT could give rise to similarly biased estimates.</p><p>For our simulation study, we first simulated both description-and experience-based choices from the RL-CPT model using a single set of CPT parameters with separate positive and negative learning rates. Next, we fit the simulated data with a traditional CPT model using the heuristic method of setting , to the experienced proportion of rare events. The traditional CPT model assumed differences in probability weighting ( ), risk sensitivity ( ), and loss sensitivity ( ) between DBDs and EBDs, which is consistent with previous computational analyses of the description-experience gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(GlÃ¶ckner, Hilbig, Henninger, &amp; Fiedler, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kellen, Pachur, &amp; Hertwig, 2016)</ref>. With this design, any preference differences inferred across DBDs and EBDs are wholly attributable to the proposed learning mechanism as opposed to true differences in CPT valuation parameters. Further, by keeping the valuation parameters constant while varying the learning rates, we were able to determine exactly how much (and in what direction) learning during EBDs could bias traditional CPT valuation parameters in the context of EBDs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation Model Specification</head><p>We generated pseudo-participants' person-level RL-CPT valuation parameters using random draws from group-level normal distributions with means of = .88, = 2.25, and = .65, and with SDs of â â .10 and â .3 (see Supplementary Text for full details).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation Results</head><p>Probability weighting. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> shows that asymmetric learning leads to biased estimates of CPT probability weighting ( ) when using the traditional heuristic method of setting , to the experienced proportion of outcomes observed within participant-gamble pairs 6 . For reduced gambles, probability weighting for EBDs-but not DBDs-is significantly biased by asymmetric learning in small sample settings, such that it is over-estimated when learning occurs more rapidly for positive prediction errors and under-estimated when learning occurs more rapidly for negative prediction errors. Further, as participants draw more samples, the effect reverses such that more rapid learning from negative prediction errors leads to over-estimation of probability weighting in EBDs. We did not observe this differential bias when both learning rates were closer to 1, in which case EBD probability weighting ( ) was more consistently overestimated.</p><p>Because the overestimate was close to = 1, these results may reflect uncertainty in estimates caused by rapid updating (i.e., high variation) of the outcome probability that, on average, will tend to drive estimates toward .5.</p><p>The results are different for non-reduced gambles, which lead to more consistent overestimation of probability weighting for EBDs in small sample settings (except when learning rates are lower and equal, or + = â â .25). In larger samples, however, non-reduced gambles tend to produce accurate recovery of probability weighting estimates when learning rates are equivalent, but biased estimates when learning is asymmetric (where the direction of bias depends on the strength of both learning rates). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> suggests that if people do learn asymmetrically from positive versus negative prediction errors, then (1) a single pair of learning rates can lead to biased probability weighting estimates for EBDs using traditional CPT modeling, and (2) the same pair of learning rates has different effects on probability weighting estimates across reduced and non-reduced sets of gambles (i.e. "contextual" effects), where the direction of the bias is dependent on the number of samples that participants draw. For example, in small sample settings when both learning rates are approximately .5, traditional CPT modeling leads to linear probability weighting ( â 1) for reduced gambles, but apparent overweighting of rare events ( &lt; 1) for non-reduced gambles.</p><p>Risk aversion. <ref type="figure">Fig.'</ref>s S1 and S2 show traditional CPT estimates of risk-and loss-aversion between description and experience generated by participants who learn at different rates for positive and negative prediction errors. For risk-aversion, there are two general trends worth noting. First, is consistently under-estimated for experience-based decisions (EBDs), whereas it is accurately estimated for description-based decisions (DBDs). A small exception is that for non-reduced gambles, there is a tendency for to be slightly under-estimated even for DBDs.</p><p>Second, across both reduced and non-reduced sets of gambles, biased estimates of are most extreme when both learning rates are low (i.e. less than .25), become less pronounced as learning rates become more rapid (i.e. greater than .25), and sometimes become more biased as learning again becomes more rapid (i.e. both learning rates greater than .75). However, this latter trend is minor.</p><p>Loss aversion. Results were different for loss-aversion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interim Summary of Simulation Study</head><p>Our simulation study confirmed that, if people do learn in a way consistent with the RL-CPT while sampling gambles (i.e. they are most sensitive to recent outcomes and update expectations differently based on whether outcomes were better or worse than expected), then heuristic applications of CPT are bound to reveal differences in valuation parameters across DBDs and EBDs even when there are no true differences in valuation. Further, the direction and magnitude of this bias is not initially intuitive-it is dependent on both the average value of learning rates, the magnitude of the difference in learning from positive versus negative predictions errors, the number of samples that a person draws, and features of the specific gambles that people are given (i.e. reduced versus non-reduced). However, as opposed to designing an experimental manipulation to control these various factors to explore the description-experience gap, we can explicitly model the learning and memory mechanisms underlying EBDs to identify potential invariances in valuation between DBDs and EBDs. Without an explicit model of learning, we risk misinterpreting CPT valuation parameters estimated in the context of EBDs due to our inability to experimentally control for complex learning and memory effects. Following this rationale, we next conducted a model comparison study using empirical data to determine the extent to which asymmetric learning captures observed within-person preference differences between DBDs and EBDs. For empirical model comparisons, we include the IB-CPT model as a competing learning/memory mechanism to the RL-CPT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical Study</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Experiment</head><p>For the empirical study, we used actual participant data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kellen et al. (2016)</ref>. A total of 104 participants underwent all 114 description-and experience-based gambles as described above (see Simulation Experiment). We refer readers to the original study for more details on participants' characteristics, and provide summary statistics for the choice proportions within description and experience for each pair of gambles in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table S1</ref>. For description-based gambles, participants were presented with gamble pairs one at a time, and they were instructed to choose the option that they preferred. For experience-based gambles, participants were allowed to sample from each option in whatever order and for how ever many trials they preferred before making a final preference judgement. Importantly, the order of description and experience was counter-balanced across participants, and the description and experience sessions were separated by at least one full week within each participant to minimize potential order effects. For EBDs, participants drew an average of 21.04 (SD = 9.4) samples before making a contingent choice (i.e., preference judgement). Previous CPT modeling of these data revealed an overweighting of rare events in EBDs relative to DBDs (i.e., &lt; &lt; 1; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kellen, Pachur, &amp; Hertwig, 2016</ref>).</p><p>Our simulations above indicated that an asymmetric learning mechanism could produce this overweighting result if: (1) learning rates are both below .75, (2) people learn more rapidly from negative relative to positive prediction errors, and (3) people draw around 20 samples on average (see the top row in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3)</ref>. Conversely, the traditional description-experience gap arising from apparent underweighting of rare events in EBDs can occur if: (1) learning rates are both above .75, (2) people learn more rapidly from positive relative to negative prediction errors and draw around 20 samples (see the bottom panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>), or (3) people learning more rapidly from negative prediction errors and draw a large number (~100) of samples.</p><p>Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kellen et al. (2016)</ref>  This finding that the same exact participants show variation in both the magnitude and direction of the description-experience gap across different sets of gambles is consistent with our simulation study-the contextual nature of learning during EBDs gives rise to apparent differences in valuation across different sets of gambles despite the underlying cognitive mechanisms being invariant. Although experimental designs such as the matched sampling paradigm can partially control for these factors, they still succumb to the unrealistic assumptions described in the introduction (i.e. perfect learning and memory). Therefore, we compared various models that make explicit assumptions about learning and memory during sampling on the dataset as a whole and individually to each of the four sets. We compared models both across and within sets to determine whether the same model (or class of model) could best capture performance across gambles that do versus do not show the traditional description-experience gap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Competing Model Specifications</head><p>We developed three classes of competing models to determine which cognitive mechanisms provided the best statistical account of within-person preference differences between DBDs and EBDs. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 1</ref> describes each of the models considered in the current study, which we describe in more detail below.</p><p>CPT models. First, we fit an array of traditional CPT models using the heuristic method of setting , to the proportion of samples that it was experienced for the given participant. To determine which particular valuation mechanism best accounted for preference differences between DBDs and EBDs according to traditional CPT, we developed models for each combination of differences in probability weighting, risk sensitivity, loss sensitivity, choice sensitivity, or probability elevation for positive and negative outcomes (described in more detail below). We also developed a base model that assumed CPT valuation parameters were identical within-participants across tasks. Of the CPT models, we were particularly interested in the variant with different valuation parameters across DBDs and EBDs (model Î , Î , Î in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table   1</ref>). This model is theoretically important because, as outlined in the introduction, prior research has suggested that differences in risk sensitivity, loss sensitivity, or probability weighting could explain the description-experience gap.</p><p>RL-CPT models. Second, we tested three different variants of the RL-CPT model, including a version with a single learning rate for positive and negative prediction errors, a version with a different learning rate for each positive and negative prediction errors, and a version including probability elevation parameters (see section below titled The Role of Probability Elevation).</p><p>Throughout our results, we focus our attention on the RL-CPT variant used in our simulation study (model Â± in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 1</ref>) due to its theoretical relevance.</p><p>IB-CPT models. Third, we tested two variants of the IB-CPT model, including the version described in the introduction (i.e. a memory decay rate with a single set of valuation parameters across description and experience; model in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 1</ref>) in addition to one with probability elevation parameters. As with the RL-CPT model, we focus attention on the variant due to its theoretical relevance.</p><p>The Role of Probability Elevation. Although we did not consider it in our simulation study, we tested variants of <ref type="bibr">Kellen et al.'s (2016)</ref> CPT formulation in our empirical model comparisons, which included a probability elevation parameter in the CPT probability weighting function. In particular, Equation 5 can be expanded as follows:</p><p>where (0 &lt; &lt; +â) is an added probability elevation parameter that is often interpreted as optimism ( &gt; 1) versus pessimism ( &lt; 1) toward probabilistic outcomes. Mathematically,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">W (p g,j ) = p g,j ( p g,j + (1 p g,j ) )<label>(10)</label></formula><p>when &gt; 1, the probability weighting function is shifted upward, indicating a general overestimation of the strength of probabilities (i.e. optimism); when &lt; 1, the function is shifted downward, indicating a general under-estimation (i.e. pessimism). Oftentimes, a separate parameter is estimated for gains and losses to capture differential optimism or pessimism towards gains versus losses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kellen et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical Model Comparison</head><p>We used the leave-one-out information criterion (LOOIC) to determine which model provided the best fit to the data while penalizing for model complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Vehtari, Gelman, &amp; Gabry, 2017)</ref>. LOOIC is a fully Bayesian information criterion that estimates true leave-one-out cross validation; LOOIC is therefore an estimate of how well a model will perform relative to competing models on out-of-sample data. To compute LOOIC, we first computed the loglikelihood of each participant's choices given their estimated parameters for each posterior sample (i.e. log pointwise predictive density or LPPD) and gamble (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ahn, Haines, &amp; Zhang, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Haines et al., 2018)</ref>. This procedure results in separate posterior samples by participant by gamble ( Ã Ã ) LPPD arrays for description-and experience-based gambles. We then combined both arrays on the gamble dimension and input the resulting array in the loo R package <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Vehtari et al., 2017)</ref>  We caution that a lower LOOIC (or higher pseudo-BMA+ weights) does not indicate that a model is "true" or a better representation of the cognitive processes of interest in an absolute sense. Instead, we believe that such model comparison metrics are useful to compare the relative predictive performance of various models, and that the theoretical value of each model includes both predictive performance and other more qualitative considerations (e.g., assumptions they make about learning and memory, connections with the broader literature; Navarro, 2019).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the current study, we used a combination of computational model simulations and empirical model fitting to show that preference differences between description-and experiencebased gambles can be attributed to an asymmetric learning mechanism rather than contextdependent changes in psychological valuation across tasks. We developed a hybrid reinforcement learning and cumulative prospect theory (RL-CPT) model that used separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors and assumed that probabilities and outcomes are valued equivalently across DBDs and EBDs. Through Bayesian model comparison, we found that the Â± variant of the RL-CPT model (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 1</ref>) provided a better account of within-subject differences in DBDs versus EBDs when compared to traditional CPT models that assume perfect learning and memory with differences in risk aversion, loss aversion, probability weighting, choice sensitivity, and probability elevation for gains and losses (i.e.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Saturated CPT).</head><p>Put together, the RL-CPT offers improved performance for EBDs without compromising performance on DBDs relative to traditional CPT models (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>). The RL-CPT with asymmetric learning also performed better than a competing instance-based memory model ( from <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 1</ref>). While other studies have shown that learning and memory models can account for EBDs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Busemeyer &amp; Myung, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Erev &amp; Roth, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Estes, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gonzalez et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hau et al., 2008)</ref>, they did not demonstrate any ability to capture the description-experience gap.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly and quantitatively compare a variety of computational models that make explicit assumptions regarding how learning and memory can give rise to preference differences between DBDs and EBDs. This was only possible because the learning and memory models that we developed directly estimate the payoff probabilities associated with each outcome, which allows for them to simultaneously capture decisions from both description-and experience-based tasks in a straightforward manner.</p><p>The RL-CPT ( Â± variant) suggests that foundational cognitive biases including risk aversion, loss aversion, and overweighting of rare events hold true across both DBDs and EBDs when asymmetric learning during sampling in EBDs is accounted for (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6</ref>). Further, our finding that people learn more rapidly from negative as opposed to positive predictions errors extends previous findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cox et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Doll et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Frank et al., 2004;</ref>. A higher learning rate for negative as opposed to positive prediction errors produces "risk sensitive" decision-making (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Mihatsch &amp; Neuneier, 2002)</ref>. Conceptually, it follows that typical CPT valuation parameters-which also capture risk sensitivity-could be poorly estimated in EBDs if asymmetric learning occurs. Indeed, our simulations confirmed this quantitatively, predicting that more rapid learning of negative relative to positive prediction errors will lead to an underestimation of probability weighting in EBDs relative to DBDs when using traditional CPT modeling (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>), which can explain contextual effects of more overweighting of rare events in EBDs compared to DBDs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">GlÃ¶ckner, Hilbig, Henninger, &amp; Fiedler, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kellen, Pachur, &amp; Hertwig, 2016)</ref>. To the extent that these learning rates vary across the lifespan, we might observe apparent differences between older and younger adults that are specific to experience-based decisions and physiological measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Rosenbaum et al, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Responses to positive and negative surprises will impact not only probability weighting and value sensitivity, but also measures like pupil dilation that are known to reflect the magnitude prediction errors during learning on these types of tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Braem et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lavin et al, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Given prior findings that people learn more rapidly when experiencing intense negative rather than positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Haines et al., 2019)</ref>, future research may explore the relationships between physiological states and learning throughout EBDs.

Despite this, models including search or optional stopping rules show promising results (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Busemeyer, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">Markant, Pleskac, Diederich, Pachur, &amp; Hertwig, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wulff, Markant, Pleskac, &amp; Hertwig, 2019)</ref> and may be well-suited to integrate with models such as the RL-CPT.</p><p>Nevertheless, RL-CPT does account for variation in behavior across participants by leveraging the information that they gain across samples to estimate the learning rates (see Equation 8).</p><p>Further, the learning mechanism of the RL-CPT is generalizable in the sense that it can be applied to both sampling EBDs, repeated choice EBDs, and EBDs with more than two choices.</p><p>Specifically, if each sample that participants draw is treated as a choice (i.e., preference judgement in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>), the probability estimates and resulting expected values on each sample (or trial in repeated choice tasks) can be used to estimate the likelihood of repeated, trial-by-trial choices for each choice option (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Haines et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Niv, Edlund, Dayan, &amp; O'Doherty, 2012)</ref>. Therefore, we view the addition of an optional stopping rule as a taskspecific extension, and not a competing mechanism, of the RL-CPT.</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that future research on the description-experience gap should focus on learning, memory, search (i.e., during sampling), and optional stopping mechanisms, all of which could lead to deeper insights into human decision-making under risk.</p><p>Additionally, future studies could use experimental manipulations that are known to influence learning rates to determine if the RL-CPT can capture subsequent changes in risk preferences.</p><p>More broadly, our findings demonstrate the benefits of using formal computational cognitive models of behavior to understand how individual differences at one level-of-analysis (e.g., psychological mechanisms) can affect inferences made at another level (e.g., behavioral differences). Computational modeling allowed us to merge different areas of research (i.e., reinforcement learning and risky decision-making) in a formalized, straightforward way, which led to circumscribed predictions regarding the relationship between psychological mechanisms (i.e., probability and outcome valuation), neural mechanisms (i.e., differential dopamine response to positive versus negative prediction errors), and an observed behavioral phenomenon (i.e., the description-experience gap). We then leveraged Bayesian model comparison of multiple competing theoretical models to determine which theory was most consistent with the data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Asymmetric learning offers causal mechanisms to explain the apparent changes in probability weighting-and valuation more generally-across both description-and experiencebased decisions and different forms of experience-based decisions. Classic findings of riskaversion, loss-aversion, and overweighting of rare events can apply for both description-and experience-based decisions, but only when asymmetric learning is appropriately incorporated.</p><p>More work needs to be done to refine joint models of description and experience that are both predictively powerful and psychologically realistic with regard to mechanisms underlying learning and memory in addition to valuation and action selection. More broadly, computational models offer a formalized way to combine substantive theories from different areas of research, which can reveal simple rules underlying otherwise complex, context-dependent psychological effects inferred using theoretically inconsistent statistical procedures.</p></div>

Examples of description-versus experience-based decisions for a gamble between winning $4 with probability .8 ($0 with probability .2) versus $3 for certain. As depicted, people tend to choose the safe option when the probability is given. Conversely, when people must sample both options to learn the probabilities of each outcome (i.e., sampling paradigm), they tend to choose the risky option. Such preference differences are often interpreted as differences in evaluating the probability of rare events. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain this difference including sampling error and recency, which will lead to experienced probabilities that are different from the true probabilities when people draw low numbers of samples (e.g. ~20) before making a contingent choice (i.e. preference judgement). Alternatively, people may actually weight probabilities differently between task presentations, which can be captured by the parameter from cumulative prospect theory. Specifically, &lt; 1 indicates overweighting of rare events while &gt; 1 indicates underweighting of rare events.</p></div>

The above graph shows model-predicted probability of the high outcome [Pr(H)] occurring for both the "reduced" gamble (i.e. one option is certain and the other risky/probabilistic) exemplified in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref> and another "non-reduced" gamble (i.e. both options are probabilistic/risky). To generate sample-to-sample probabilities, we used a simple strength-based reinforcement learning model with separate learning rates for positive ( + ) and negative ( -) prediction errors (see Equation 8 in the Method section), where option A and B were sampled with equal probability. All outcome probabilities are updated after each sample in proportion to both the difference between the expected and actual outcome (prediction error) and the learning rate-we show only Pr(H) for visual purposes. Panels denote each combination of + andwith values of .1, .3, and .5, and shaded intervals around predicted values indicate Â±2 standard errors of the mean across repeated iterations. The shaded region highlights the first 20 samples.</p><p>Probability estimates converge to true values for certain options (irrespective to the learning rates), but converge to biased estimates when outcomes are probabilistic and learning rates are not equivalent. Additionally, effects of sampling error and recency are apparent even when learning rates are equivalent, where the random nature of the sampling process has not yet allowed for learning to converge to the true outcome probability and estimates are subsequently biased toward .5. Details on how we generated the above predictions are described in the Supplementary Text for the sake of brevity. Note. Estimates for group-level CPT probability weighting in DBDs and EBDs when setting , to the experienced proportion of rare events. Because was left unchanged across all simulations of the RL-CPT, all deviance between EBD probability estimates and the true values reflect biases induced by the asymmetric learning mechanism (Equation 8). For reduced gambles, when learning rates are generally lower (i.e. &lt; .5) and participants draw fewer samples, is overestimated (underestimated) when learning occurs more rapidly for positive (negative) prediction errors. Importantly, this effect reverses in larger sample settings, revealing an interaction between learning asymmetry and sample size. For non-reduced gambles, probability weighting is more consistently overestimated across all levels of learning rates relative to reduced gambles only (particularly in small sample settings), leading to apparent underweighting of rare events for EBDs relative to DBDs in the absence of a true difference in probability weighting. Therefore, the same pair of learning rates can lead to different biases in probability weighting across reduced and non-reduced gambles for EBDs, particularly in small sample settings (cf. + = .25 and + = .5 across reduced and non-reduced gambles).

We chose these prior distributions to minimize any potential directional biases that could otherwise be induced with more informative prior distributions. Because the group-level means for all valuation parameters are centered around 1 and equivalent across DBDs and EBDs, we can be sure that any parameter estimates we get on either side of 1 can be interpreted as information gained through the data, rather than through the choice of prior (e.g., an estimate of &lt; 1 indicates that there is evidence for risk aversion for DBDs in the data). We chose the specific parameter bounds 0 &lt; , &lt; 5 and 0 &lt; &lt; 10 because we deem values outside of this range highly unlikely based on previous applications of CPT. Finally, for each combination of learning rates, we fit the CPT model using 2 sampling chains for 2,000 total iterations each, 500 of which were discarded from each chain as warm-up samples (3,000 total samples for each parameter). We visually checked trace plots of group-level parameters, and ensured that all Ì values (i.e., Gelman-Rubin statistics) were under 1.1, suggesting that the variance between sampling chains is similar to the variance within chains and therefore indicates convergence to the same distribution .</p></div>

For risk-aversion, there are two general trends worth noting. First, is consistently under-estimated for experience-based decisions (EBDs), whereas it is accurately estimated for description-based decisions (DBDs). A small exception is that for non-reduced gambles, there is a tendency for to be slightly under-estimated even for DBDs. Second, across both reduced and non-reduced sets of gambles, biased estimates of are most extreme when both learning rates are low (i.e. less than .25), become less pronounced as learning rates become more rapid (i.e. greater than .25), and sometimes become more biased as learning again becomes more rapid (i.e. both learning rates greater than .75). However, this latter trend is minor.</p><p>Results were different for loss-aversion. For reduced gambles, is consistently underestimated when both learning rates are low (i.e. less than .25), but becomes better estimated as the negative prediction error learning rate ( -) becomes increasingly large.

Assuming that the average participant learns more rapidly from negative as opposed to positive predictions errors-consistent with both our results reported in the main text and those of others (e.g., Gershman, 2015)-our simulations suggest that reductions/reversals of loss-aversion found in prior studies of EBDs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Erev, Ert, &amp; Yechiam, 2008)</ref> may actually be the result of biased inference due to asymmetric learning (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. S2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probability Elevation Priors</head><p>To determine if the inclusion of probability elevation affected our empirical model comparison results, we fit both (1) the Saturated CPT model, and (2) a version of the RL-CPT model with separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors that includes probability elevation for gains ( + ) and losses ( -) according to eq.'s S1 and S2 (see <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>).</p><p>Note that as in the main text, and unlike the Saturated model, the RL-CPT with probability elevation for gains and losses assumes that + andare shared across DBDs and EBDs, and that the learning mechanism alone captures preference differences between tasks.</p><p>We assigned the prior distributions for the Saturated CPT and RL-CPT with probability elevation models in the same way as described in the main text. Using the probability elevation parameter for gains as an example:</p><p>As with all models in the main text, we fit both models using 3 sampling chains for 3,000 total iterations each, 1,000 of which were discarded from each chain as warm-up samples (i.e., resulting in 6,000 total samples for each estimated posterior). To assess model convergence, we visually checked traceplots, and ensured that all Ì values were under 1.1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameter Identifiability</head><p>Given the relative complexity of the models we fit to data, a natural question arises regarding the identifiability of model parameters-particularly when these parameters are used to make inference, as is the case with the RL-CPT model. Although we did not perform a full parameter recovery or simulation-based calibration analysis, we did explore the joint posterior distribution of the following three primary models depicted in In particular, there are moderate trade-offs between person-level and parameters across all models, although the trade-offs are strongest for the learning models. This is a common finding in decision models that have both inverse temperature/choice sensitivity and valuation parameters (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Molloy et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Krefeld-Schwalb et al., 2022)</ref>. This trade-off occurs because changes in either parameter can influence the likelihood in similar ways-a decrease in makes differences in subjective values smaller, which produces more ambivalent choice between competing gambles. Similarly, decreases in produce more ambivalent choices between gambles (i.e. the probability of choosing the gamble with higher expected value decreases). Given the similar effects that these parameters have on behavior, they show a strong negative correlation in the joint posterior-when is higher, a lower value of can produce an equivalent likelihood, and vice-versa.</p><p>Despite these moderate parameter trade-offs, the joint posteriors reveal that the direction of the parameter values remains consistent across the entire range that they trade off. Specifically, the posteriors for both and are entirely below 1, indicating risk aversion ( &lt; 1) and diminishing sensitivity to changes in expected value ( &lt; 1) across all models. More generally, the joint posteriors on learning parameters for both learning models are generally well-behaved.</p><p>The only pattern worth noting is the minimal correlation between person-level + and â parameters in the RL-CPT model, which we would expect to see given that, in our study design, the relationship between + and â indicates changes in preference across description-and experience-based tasks. Therefore, higher values for one learning rate must be accompanied by higher values for the other to preserve the observed changes in behavior across task formats. The fact that learning rates are not highly correlated provides some evidence that they are identifiable in a local sense, at least to the extent that is necessary for making inference on their difference.

Across all sets, the RL-CPT with asymmetric learning and a single set of valuation and choice parameters across DBDs and EBDs (model Â± inTable 1) performed better than all variants of CPT, including the most complex CPT model (i.e. the Saturated CPT model with 12 free parameters per person).

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">It is worth noting that this moderation of the description-experience gap by reduced versus non-reduced gambles was not calculated using CPT probability weighting. Instead, it was calculated using a heuristic method and therefore relies on all of the assumptions about learning/memory outlined in the following section.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">For modeling empirical data, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by testing the classic probability weighting function of CPT (i.e. including the 1/ exponent on the denominator). Results were consistent with the original parameterization, but we report the symmetric version here due to the more simplistic interpretation. We additionally tested a model including probability elevation parameters for gains and losses, which did not substantially improve model fit. Therefore, we relegate discussion of models with probability elevation to the Supplementary Text for brevity.</note>
