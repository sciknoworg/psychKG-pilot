			<abstract>
				<p>Daily life, whether at home or at work, requires people to split their attention. These simultaneous demands can be exhausting and one strategy is to reallocate attention towards a pressing demand at the expense of others. Choosing how to allocate limited cognitive resources is the basis of many psychological theories but few have directly investigated the cognitive mechanism that drives the resource allocation process. In this paper, we present a novel joint-computational approach that highlights the central role of attentional resource allocation in dual-task environments. We present two paired experiments where participants simultaneously complete a Multiple-Object-Tracking task (MOT) alongside a Detection Response Task (DRT). In breaking with previous modeling investigations, our computational framework unites separate decision-making models under the control of a single allocation process that makes accurate predictions under a range of cognitive demands. Foremost, the current investigation provides a framework for quantifying the subjective and latent processes involved in divided attention. We discuss the theoretical implications of our approach and highlight the flexibility of decision-makers to adjust where resources are spent under dynamically shifting workloads. Public significance statement Everyday decisions often require people to split their attention. With many tasks to do, paying more attention to one task might require paying less to another. This trade-off is the basis of many attentional theories that we directly test in this work. Our paper provides a quantitative model of attention allocation that aims to understand the underlying cognitive process of dividing up one&apos;s attention.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Daily life demands that people perform more than one task at a time. Ask any parent in the morning and the luxury of completing one chore at a time becomes woefully apparent. While one's hands might be occupied with school lunches, the mind is already busy with the next dozen steps, all while keeping an eye on the clock. Yet, the problem hardly goes away after the morning. Consider the difficulty of parking while holding a conversation <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Tillman et al., 2017)</ref>, or listening in a meeting while writing emails in the background <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Orhan et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Had evolution equipped decision-makers with unlimited mental resources, such dilemmas would be moot: this post-doc would reverse park while making a coffee, and perhaps reply to student emails on the side too. Yet, whole compendiums have been compiled on the opposite idea; namely, that human capacity for processing information is limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Broadbent, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kahneman, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Miller, 1956)</ref>.</p><p>The idea of limited cognitive resources spans many fields of psychology.</p><p>Undergraduate textbooks are littered with examples of dual-task interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Pashler, 1994)</ref>, attentional bottlenecks that selectively filter information <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Treisman, 1969)</ref>, visual change-blindness phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Wolfe et al., 2006)</ref>, working memory limits where over-committed resources lead to poorer memory traces <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Oberauer et al., 2016)</ref>, and performance penalties when switching attention between competing task demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Steyvers et al., 2019)</ref>. Uniting these many threads is the pursuit to understand how resources are shared and, consequently, what costs are borne when the cognitive system is placed under pressure. In other words, one common undercurrent is individuals are often required to divide their cognitive resources from a limited pool.</p><p>Generally, investigations of divided resources have been a question of measurement.</p><p>Performance at an unburdened baseline (e.g., driving without conversation) is compared to performance when cognitive load is applied (e.g., holding a conversation) where an overall DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 4 decrement is indicative of attentional resource costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Castro et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Strayer et al., 2017)</ref>. In other words, the measurement method indexes attentional resources by subtraction. When only a single metric of performance is necessary, measurement-subtraction can unveil the precise detriment to a specific cognitive process.</p><p>However, when multiple metrics are involved, such as when multitasking, how should errors of one task be stacked against errors of the other?</p><p>To illustrate, consider a driver attempting to hold conversation with a passenger <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Strayer et al., 2017)</ref>. Each task, conversing and driving, produces its own performance metric where an overburdened driver might exclusively invest their cognitive resources into only one task; hopefully, the driving. Here, measurement by subtraction would reveal attention deficits in only a single domain, despite a strategic choice that spans both tasks.</p><p>One way to reconcile these incompatible yet related metrics is to examine the underlying cognitive process that determines where attention is allocated.</p><p>To do this, we use a computational approach that unifies separate psychological processes, as indexed by established cognitive models, under the control of a single attentional mechanism. This attention-allocation mechanism dictates the division of cognitive resources, mirroring the prioritisation of one task over another (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>The main advantage of our approach is that between two superficially distinct tasks, we can compare apples with oranges on psychologically meaningful terms and understand better how one should spend their limited cognitive resources.</p><p>In this paper, we develop a quantitative process model that unifies dual-task performance as a process of attention allocation. Across two experiments, decision-makers are placed in an environment where they must simultaneously complete two tasks; the Multiple Object Tracking task (MOT: <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pylyshyn &amp; Storm, 1988</ref>) and a Detection Response Task <ref type="bibr">(DRT, ISO:17488, 2016)</ref>. In Experiment 1, we demonstrate that modulating the difficulty of the MOT task within the dual-task environment places strenuous demands on cognitive resources. We separately fit standard models of decision-making to understand DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 5 the latent processes underlying task performance; Signal Detection Theory Model to the MOT and Wald Accumulator to the DRT. Critical to the development of the joint resources model, we take a brave approach of embedding exact, calibrated parameters into a unified model of attention allocation and then test its predictions under novel experimental conditions. In Experiment 2, we demonstrate that when pushed to the limits, individuals shift their attentional resources to where they are needed most. In addition to predicting dual-task performance across both tasks, our computational analyses quantify the precise trade-offs of partial attention and enumerate the degree to which secondary tasks are subordinated to a priority. Considered together, our combined approach provides one of the first detailed quantitative theories of attention allocation and makes inroads towards understanding how each person carves up their own attentional pie.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capacity limits &amp; trade-offs</head><p>Whilst multitasking might come more naturally to some people, the underlying process each person uses is subject to limits. Cognitive capacity limitations are central to almost all theories of perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Treisman &amp; Gelade, 1980)</ref>, memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Miller, 1956)</ref> and attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Broadbent, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kahneman, 1973)</ref>. Here, we are interested in understanding how people divide resources when they are required to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, but there is also a very long history of research on "task switching": how people divide time between competing tasks <ref type="bibr">(Karayanidis et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Monsell, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Steyvers et al., 2019)</ref>. In both literatures, the measurement of these cognitive limits is analogous to a trial-by-fire. Task demands are increased until performance at a given task suffers, thereby indexing the critical point beyond which one's mental resources are exhausted.</p><p>Tested in isolation, one can systematically ratchet up the load on a specific cognitive system, such as recalling ever-larger lists from memory or adding perceptual distractors to a visual display, to examine when an individual's task performance suffers.</p><p>Conversely, for a given test-bed, one might be interested in performance comparisons of DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 6 how mental load applied in one modality, e.g., auditory conversation when driving, compares to load applied in another modality, e.g., drunk driving <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Strayer et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The task switching analogue involves presenting distinct tasks one after another with varying degrees of predictability <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Goschke, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Koch, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sohn &amp; Anderson, 2001)</ref>, with the finding that decision-making is poorer when performing multiple tasks in succession. Across these methods, the key commonality is that cognitive capacity is limited and so, beyond indexing the effects of cognitive load, understanding how cognitive resources are shared in vivo is a critical psychological question.</p><p>A commonly used tool for measuring online changes in workload is the Detection Response Task <ref type="bibr">(DRT, ISO:17488, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Strayer et al., 2017)</ref>. The DRT has been extensively used in driving research where it is a stimulus-response task that indexes residual cognitive resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Strayer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Strayer &amp; Drews, 2007)</ref>. Whilst driving, a small vibration unit is attached onto the driver's body who is required to make a tactile response in reply to periodic vibrations. Over many stimulus presentations, the DRT serves as a continuous measurement tool where the latency of responses and propensity to miss stimulus provide an a non-invasive yet sensitive (and well validated) measure of attention.</p><p>DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 7</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indexing dual-task workload</head><p>Outside of driving settings, variations of the DRT have been adapted and validated for in-lab testing of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Innes et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Thorpe et al., 2019)</ref>. In place of the tactile stimulus and response, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Innes et al. (2021)</ref> adapted the DRT to incorporate a visual stimulus displayed on screen, partnered with a keyboard response. Paired alongside this visual DRT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Innes et al. (2021)</ref> used the Multiple Object Tracking task <ref type="bibr">(MOT;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pylyshyn and Storm, 1988)</ref> to manipulate cognitive load. The MOT task is a widely used paradigm in which participants track a set of continuously moving dots with distractors (for illustration, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 2</ref>). Workload is manipulated by increasing the number of dots to track where the motion of the target dots is random and could overlap with distractors.</p><p>In this dual DRT-MOT design, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Innes et al. (2021)</ref> found that the visual DRT was sensitive to changes in MOT workload. More importantly, however, was that increasing workload harmed performance in both the MOT task and the DRT, albeit to differing degrees. These disproportionate decrements in performance not only demonstrate that the DRT-MOT dual-task brushes up against the cognitive capacity limits constraining multitasking, but also suggests that cognitive resources are not equally allocated across the two tasks.</p><p>One open possibility is that resource allocation is dynamic. As workload increases in one task, cognitive resources are deliberately reallocated to meet the increased demand.</p><p>Under low workload conditions, performance across both tasks would likely remain high if the task demands do not exceed the decision-maker's available cognitive resources.</p><p>However, should workload increase beyond the limit, an individual may select a strategy that buoys performance in one task at the expense of the other. In the General Discussion, we discuss how a satisficing strategy permits additional cognitive resources to be available by setting a good-enough criterion for performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Simon, 1947)</ref>. Different strategic choices may yield disproportionate decrements in each task, as observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Innes et al. (2021)</ref>. At the extreme, a strategy that allocates all available resources towards one task DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 9 and entirely neglect the other is analogous to our opening morning-meeting example of shifting attention entirely to the speaker and pausing the email mid-meeting.</p><p>Dynamic resource allocation also dovetails with recent investigations that differentiate increased task difficulty from multitasking. Using quantitative cognitive modelling, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Howard et al. (2020)</ref> found that although both forms of workload decreased information processing, only multitasking invoked more cautious response strategies. One interpretation is that choosing to be cautious may be prudent under dual-task settings, knowing that one has to allocate fewer resources in order to balance the other task.</p><p>This caution-interpretation converges with previous work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Castro et al. (2019)</ref> whereby in a driver-simulator-DRT task, they found that cognitive load increased decision threshold settings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Castro et al. (2019)</ref> made initial in-roads to understanding resource allocation by fitting separate Wald and Linear Ballistic Accumulator models to factorially-crossed workload conditions. The current work takes an analogous approach in Experiment 1 where separate decision-making models are simultaneously fit to the MOT and DRT tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Turner, Forstmann, et al., 2013)</ref>. Our theoretical approach differs from Castro et al.'s in important ways in Experiment 2, where we directly link parameters across both tasks such that each model's parameters are constrained to draw upon a central finite pool (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). This linked architecture extends beyond previous modelling methods because we directly model the attention allotment to each task simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Turner, Forstmann, et al., 2013)</ref> rather than inferring the process indirectly after the fact. Directly linking the tasks together provides additional and psychologically-principled constraint on model predictions because the performance-related parameters from each model are determined by their direct link to a central pool of resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling Approach -Generalisation Criterion Methodology</head><p>Our computational modeling approach makes use of an extension of out-of-sample cross validation called the Generalisation Criterion Methodology (GCM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Busemeyer and Wang, 2000)</ref>. Where the GCM differs from traditional cross-validation procedures is that a DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 10 calibrated model is generalised to a test sample that uses a new design. This extrapolation capitalises on the knowledge one obtains during the calibration stage before subjecting that knowledge to a strong critical test under new theoretically-motivated constraints.</p><p>Here, we implement the GCM by calibrating the parameters of our joint model using data from Experiment 1. To provide an overview, Experiment 1 serves as a baseline for the MOT-DRT task in which we manipulate workload, increasing the number of dots to track in the MOT task. For each task, we fit standard decision-making models to each task, Signal Detection Theory for target identification in the MOT, and a single-bound Wald accumulator for the DRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Castro et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Howard et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Innes et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Using the results of Experiment 1, we calibrate theoretically linked parameters, specifically between discrimination, d ′ in SDT for the MOT task, and drift rate, v in the Wald accumulator for the DRT. We subsequently hold constant the calibrated model parameters from the baseline Experiment 1, constraining key aspects of the model before testing it against data from Experiment 2.</p><p>In Experiment 2, we test resource allocation with this constrained model and new manipulations where participants are directed to focus on either the DRT or MOT task.</p><p>To model resource allocation, we simultaneously fit both models but add the constraint that theoretically linked parameters draw from a central finite pool. Rather than fitting d ′ in SDT for the MOT task and drift rate, v, as in Experiment 1, both parameters are determined by a central allocation parameter, π, which is informed by both tasks simultaneously.</p><p>The GCM provides two primary benefits in our investigation. First, the non-nested structure of the models means the extrapolation step in the GCM provides a strong test of 15, N other = 4). Six participants were removed for low average performance on the MOT task (i.e., &lt; 60% overall task accuracy) resulting in a final N = 44. Participants were reimbursed for their participation at a rate of £3.75 for the 30 minute experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>The dual-task experiment was programmed in Javascript and presented in full-screen on a computer. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the dual-task features and in the next section, we describe the tasks in greater detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task 1: Multiple Object-Tracking task (MOT)</head><p>The timeline of a single MOT trial is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 2</ref>. In the task, the participants' goal was to track the motion of a subset of 10 randomly moving dots over 15-second period. The dots continuously moved in non-linear trajectories and could overlap with one another within the array. At the start of each trial, the ten dots are stationary on the display. The number of target dots, between one to five, was manipulated within-subjects and is referred to as MOT task difficulty.</p><p>Before motion begins, the randomly chosen subset between one to five dots were highlighted to identify the target dots for that trial. Motion commenced with the target dots highlighted, and after 3 seconds, the highlight is removed such that all dots appear the same for the remainder of that trial.  After 15 seconds of motion, all dots became stationary and half, i.e, 5/10 dots, were sequentially interrogated. These five dots were randomly chosen and, so, could comprise a mixture of targets and non-targets, or either exclusively. Participants made responses as to DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 13 whether each randomly selected dot was a target or non-target, where, the interrogated dot was visually highlighted on screen one at a time. Note that although the number of target dots was manipulated across trials, five dots were always interrogated at the end. This subset rather than the entire 10 dots was chosen to avoid participants responding with the exact number of 'target' responses and then guessing 'non-target' for the remaining dots.</p><p>Accuracy, indexed by the proportion of correct interrogations out of these five dots, was recorded for the MOT task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task 2: Detection-Response Task (DRT)</head><p>Alongside the MOT task, participants simultaneously completed the Detection response task where they were instructed to make a keyboard response as quickly as possible when a stimulus was presented on-screen. The stimulus was a red box that surrounded the object-tracking display (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 2</ref>). The stimulus was displayed for a maximum of 1.1 seconds and disappeared after either the time elapsed, or participants made a key-press response. Participants completed multiple DRT stimulus-response (∼ M = 4.5) during a single MOT trial. Note that the DRT stimulus was never presented during the initial MOT target identification or subsequent dot interrogation stages.</p><p>Accuracy and response times were recorded for the DRT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Joint modelling of the MOT &amp; DRT</head><p>In Experiment 1, we estimate separate decision-making models for each task. The dot interrogation in the MOT task was modelled using Signal Detection Theory (henceforth SDT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Green, Swets, et al., 1966)</ref> and the DRT task was modelled as a single Wald accumulator (response time and accuracy). We chose these two models because of their standard application within each task paradigm (MOT tasks with SDT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Drew et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">&amp; Oksama &amp; Hyönä, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">DRT with Wald;</ref><ref type="bibr">Palada et al., 2019&amp; Thorpe et al., 2020</ref>. To preface the reader, in Experiment 1, each model captures separate decision-making processes that we later explicitly tie together in Experiment 2.</p><p>Below, we detail the parameterisation of the SDT and Wald accumulator. Within DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 14 the SDT model for the MOT task, we took the standard approach of fixing non-target distribution to a standard normal (mean 0, standard deviation 1). Criterion (β) was estimated as a proportion of discrimination parameter (d ′ , described further below). The DRT task was modelled as a single Wald accumulator for response time and accuracy data.</p><p>As is standard with the Wald model, we incorporate a probablistic go-failure process in which the accumulator fails to race on a proportion of DRT trials. This inclusion is to account for a proportion of DRT trials in which participants failed to detect or respond to the stimulus. For the Wald accumulator model, we fix the decision boundary parameter, b</p><p>to a value of 1 for model identifiability. 1 Across the dual-task setup, there were five levels of stimulus difficulty corresponding to the number of dots to track in the MOT. For both models, we fit parameters to each level of stimulus difficulty. To reduce the total number of parameters, we implemented a linear parameterisation across the five levels of stimulus difficulty. For example, rather than estimating five drift (v) parameters for the Wald model, we estimated an intercept and slope parameter (v 1 = intercept + slope, v 5 = intercept + slope ×5). We found this simple linear parameterisation was a good approximation of the freely-estimated 5 parameter model (see Supplementary Materials Section 2, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure S2</ref>). Therefore, to reduce model complexity, we also implemented the linear parameterisation for go-failures (f ) and drift rates (v) in the Wald Model. For the SDT model, we similarly compressed the number of parameters using an exponential function for discrimination (d ′ ) such that (d 1 = intercept + slope, d 5 = intercept + slope ÷5). This parameterisation implies that sensitivity (d ′ ) changes across the levels of difficulty. Relatedly, we implemented the decision criterion (β) as a proportion of discrimination (d ′ ). Therefore, our proportional criterion parameter (β) is estimated as a single parameter that flexible changes across workload difficulty.</p><p>Together, in total, we estimated 9 parameters per subject, as summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table  1</ref>. These 9 parameters comprised of three parameters for the SDT model; intercept and slope of Dprime (d') with a single proportion criterion (c) that evaluates as a proportion of each expanded Dprime (d') value, and 6 parameters for the Wald accumulator; intercept and slope of go-failure (f i , f s ), intercept and slope of the mean drift rate (v i , v s ), drift rate noise (S ), and non-decision time (t0 ).</p></div>

PMwG is a MCMC sampler that uses a hierarchical Bayesian framework to estimate random subject-level effects alongside group-level effects. In the results, we present analyses of the group-level effects and DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 16 correlations between parameters that are explicitly estimated by PMwG. Note that this approach is one that has previously been described as a "joint" model of the two tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(de Hollander et al., 2016;</ref>, because the parameters for each task are estimated simultaneously in a multivariate distribution which allows for correlations between parameters within and between tasks. While this is an important first step in understanding inter-task dependency and workload division, our theoretical development goes much further in Experiment 2, where structural constraints are imposed on parameters between tasks.</p><p>For each step in the MCMC chain, proposal distributions are generated in bulk and evaluated relative to the prior and data. There are three stages of sampling in PMwG:</p><p>burn in, adaptation, sampling. We set the number of iterations and proposal-generating particles in each respective stage to 1000 (100 particles), 5000 (100 particles), 5000 (50 particles).

We express the allocation of resources between each task as π which represents a proportion of the total resource pool. Higher values of π indicate greater allocation to the DRT task and conversely, lower values of π indicate allocation to the MOT task. Computationally, the proposed pooled model is distinct from the modeling approach in Experiment 1 because it does not allow free drift rates (v) for the DRT or discrimination (d ′ ) for the MOT. Rather, the model estimates the allocation proportion (π) that jointly determines the available resources for each subordinate model (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>.

In the example, Wald drift rates are determined by the allocation π which is a proportion of the total resource capacity (G) which is fixed to a value of 10. The allocation π value is set to 0.4 which produces a drift rate value of 4.</p><p>For the SDT model in Equation 2, d ′ is expressed as the product of the complementary proportion of attention, 1-π, total capacity G, and a final term k which is a unit conversion factor. To elaborate, because drift rates (v) and discrimination (d ′ ) units are expressed on separate arbitrary scales, the k parameter provides a conversion factor between SDT d ′ and Wald v. We calibrated k based on estimated d ′ and v values estimated from Experiment 1 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we applied a computational modelling approach to understanding mental resource allocation. We paired two experiments where the cognitive load demands dynamically shifted within the DRT and MOT dual-task, forcing individuals to divide and allocate their attention. Experiment 1 established that the cognitive demands of the MOT-DRT task exceeded the available cognitive resources, whereby increased cognitive load led to measurable decreases in behavioural measures and decision-making model parameters.</p><p>Using these initial results as a barometer , we proposed a pooled resources model that causally determines performance in both tasks by allocating resources from a central, finite pool. We tested the model's predictions under novel experimental conditions where decision-makers volitionally allocated more resources to one task within the dual-task design. A theoretical contribution was to demonstrate that exclusively modulating resource allocation captures the qualitative and quantitative trade-offs of splitting one's attention.</p><p>Our approach extends beyond previous investigations of divided attention by unifying control of dual-task performance under a single attentional process that causally predicts the cascade of cognitive impacts from dynamic increases in mental load.</p><p>The current investigation provides a framework for quantifying the subjective and latent processes involved in divided attention. At its core, our model makes a theoretical DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 36 commitment to the idea that split attention divides a central pool of cognitive resources.</p><p>Split across the DRT and MOT task, this architecture embodies the very constraints that decision-makers often face when balancing multiple priorities at once. Re-allocating attention to one task comes at the expense of performance at another. Our work directly quantifies and expresses this expense as a latent attentional process that governs performance across both tasks. Two advantages emerge as a consequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prioritisation in dual-tasks</head><p>First, quantification provides direct evidence of which of the dual-tasks are treated as secondary. One common assumption in dual-task environments is that decision-makers share a definition for which task is to be prioritised. This assumed order may emerge organically from the task demands where one task is more taxing than the other, akin to the MOT in our experiments, or through direct incentives where performance priorities are shaped by rewards or punishments <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Farmer et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>However, differences in subjective priorities can emerge. For example, individual variations in driving ability would allow better drivers to allocate more cognitive resources to a secondary task like conversation with a passenger <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Castro et al., 2023)</ref> or the DRT. An advantage of our framework is that the pooled resources model provides a quantitative definition of which task was prioritised and to what degree. In Experiment 2, our modeling results provided a precise quantification of the resource allocation differences between the DRT-emphasis and MOT-emphasis conditions. Quantifying these values also provides a common basis upon which to measure participants' subjective interpretation of task priority instructions. A qualitative instruction like "prioritise safety" or "focus on the MOT" involves subjective interpretation as to how much cognitive attention one should allocate to a given task. Our approach provides an objective apparatus to index this prioritisation, as well as the associated costs in the de-emphasised task. Taken together, quantifying resource allocation allowed us to check a core assumption about dual-task priorities while also providing a clearer view of the latent psychological process governing DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 37 performance in both tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The computational approach</head><p>The second advantage of our computational approach is that by indexing the psychological costs of divided attention, we can highlight situations where re-allocated attention is most worthwhile. Our combined experiments used an extended out-of-sample validation method where the costs of divided attention between the MOT and DRT were calibrated from the results of Experiment 1. Across decision-making models, performance on the DRT, indexed by Wald drift rates (v), correlated with performance on the MOT, indexed by the SDT sensitivity(d ′ ). From these results, we were able to encode into the model structure the trade-offs between parameters as cognitive load increased. Our central finding was that the reallocation costs increased as the MOT task difficulty increased. In other words, reallocating the same amount of attention from the DRT to the MOT would yield greater improvements in performance at lower cognitive loads, e.g., 2 dots to track, as compared to higher cognitive load, e.g., 5 dots to track. Measuring the performance trade-offs in terms of psychologically relevant parameters provided insight as to which aspects of decision-making were affected under increasing dual-task loads.</p><p>For certain tasks, this computational measurement of cognitive trade-offs is a viable alternative to physiological measures that may require additional training or equipment.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Biondi et al. (2021)</ref> investigated the cognitive resource costs of the N-back task alongside the DRT using pupillometry where greater cognitive demand was physiologically indexed by larger pupil diameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lohani et al., 2019)</ref>. Another alternative measure is electroencephalography (EEG) that provides an instantaneous and continuous measure of workload, albeit requiring specialised equipment and some extra assumptions about the links between brain and behaviour. Our computational method complements this repertoire by offering a non-invasive and precise alternative where the trade-off in performance between tasks are explicitly modelled and directly tested against new data.</p><p>Our out-of-sample validation framework is also applicable beyond the specific DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 38 decision-making models and tasks presently shown. For example, the N-back task often includes lure memory items alongside targets and non-targets, the responses of which can be modelled using the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA: <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Evans et al., 2018)</ref>. Alongside the physiological measures obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Biondi et al. (2021)</ref>, calibrating the performance costs from models parameters between the N-back and DRT would provide a complementary source of evidence for working memory load. Considered together, the core strength of our methodology is that cognitive costs can be measured on terms that are psychologically meaningful and constrained together by theoretical links.</p><p>One key convergence with previous work on divided attention is that cognitive load effects can be captured by changes in drift rate. Castro et al. (2019) used a dual-task methodology where cognitive load, induced by participants simultaneously counting backwards, reduced performance on a secondary DRT task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Castro et al. (2019)</ref> found that compared against workload-absent conditions, adding cognitive workload reduced the decision-maker's rate of evidence accumulation for the DRT when their attention was occupied by the primary driver-steering task. They posited that both secondary and primary tasks drew upon the same central pool of attentional resources; a conclusion by subtraction between the two workload conditions. Our pooled resources model directly tested their proposal by modulating the drift rate as the core mechanism of attention allocation. Experiment 1 demonstrated that cognitive workload could be indexed by drift rate changes in the DRT, and the joint-model in Experiment 2 made simultaneous predictions about performance in the MOT task. Our findings dovetail with Castro et al.</p><p>(2019)'s finite-attention hypothesis and extend upon their investigations by explicitly modelling the shared attentional process underlying dual-task performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limited cognitive resources</head><p>A central theoretical commitment in the current work is that cognitive capacity has limits <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Broadbent, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kahneman, 1973)</ref>. However, focusing on attention allocation within these limits meant that our focus shifted away from examining the limits DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 39 themselves. Naturally, the size of the pie bears implications for how the pie can be divided.</p><p>For computational pragmatics, fixing resource capacity in the pooled resources model <ref type="bibr">(G)</ref> was necessary in order to identify other parameters of interest 4 . Substantive questions about capacity remain that are fruitful avenues for future work.</p><p>Prime amongst these avenues is characterising the boundaries of cognitive capacity.</p><p>Unlike our model, an individual's cognitive capacity is not a fixed quantity but can change across measurement instances (e.g., today vs. next month), type of tasks (e.g., logical or spatial problem-solving), and, in the long term, with age or experience. The diversity of cognitive capabilities presents a wide multi-dimension plain upon which to characterise resource capacity. This breadth can be partially ameliorated by obtaining multiple indexes across different domains, such as the many tests within a g-factor for general ability or i-factor for impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Huang et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>For our specific dual-task combination, eye-tracking indices would provide a useful additional metric of online attention 5 . One key distinction between the MOT task and DRT task is the manner in which each demands resources. The DRT stimulus is unpredictable and requires the individual to set aside cognitive resources to detect and respond to a stimulus at a moments notice <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hoffman et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Innes et al., 2021)</ref>. By comparison, the MOT task requires sustained attention over time to track continuous motion where a momentary break in attention can be detrimental. This temporal dynamic makes eye-tracking particularly useful as a live index of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Galdo et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Future work could integrate fixation times for each target as well as generating a temporal marker for when item confusion occurs. Converging behavioural metrics of attention would provide added constraint to our computational framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Turner et al., 2016)</ref> and this 4 For the interested reader, we estimated a pooled resources model that additionally estimated capacity (G). Broadly, the results mirrored those included in the main text and so, to retain a focus on resource allocation, we show the capacity-estimated analyses in the Supplementary Materials Section 5, <ref type="figure">Figure S9</ref>. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We thank an anonymous reviewer for this helpful suggestion.</p><p>DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 40 triangulation is especially useful given the fact the SDT model is a static model of MOT decision-making, which remains agnostic to the fluctuations in sustained attention over time.</p><p>One question this attention-distinction raises is whether it is cognitively more effortful to redirect attention from one form to another. Consider again our example of driving with a chatty passenger. One can imagine how a driver could increase their attention to driving but feel more constrained when asked to more deeply attend to conversation with their passenger. In exactly this manner, Experiment 2 aimed to shift cognitive resources to favour one task over another. However, in contrast to our model, our behavioural data only showed meaningful divergence in task performance for the DRT task and, notably, not for the MOT task (panel B vs. panel A, <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>).</p><p>The task asymmetry reveals an approximation within our attention allocation mechanism. For the DRT-emphasis condition where DRT task-performance was faster and more accurate, the model's predictions of MOT task accuracy are penalised to accommodate these improvements (panel A, <ref type="figure">Figure 8)</ref>. A computational interpretation is that the misfit is driven by the strictness of the linear allocation function (Equations 1 &amp; 2). Linearity imposes a strict constraint that any improvement in one psychological process exacts a precise attention penalty from the accompanying task. Initially, this compensation was a feature rather than a limitation of the proposed model. A simple linear function enforced the desired monotonicity constraint on attention allocation when we dove into untested waters with precisely calibrated parameters in Experiment 2. That we could unite separate decision-making models and extrapolate predictions to novel manipulations was a strict and unprecedented test of a causal, though inelegant, attention allocation mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Busemeyer &amp; Wang, 2000)</ref>. We acknowledge that the underlying attention allocation process is unlikely to be linear and believe future work has much to understand about the functional properties of attention trade-offs under a range of multitasking settings.</p><p>Concurrently, the task asymmetry encouraged us to explore the boundaries of the pooled resources model that we detail in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisficing &amp; extra capacity as an alternative explanation</head><p>Distinct from varying the allocation of a finite pool of resources, an alternative explanation for our task asymmetry data is that one pool of resources is bigger. That is, because the DRT-emphasis condition matched the MOT-emphasis condition in MOT performance but surpassed it in DRT performance, the DRT-emphasis condition appears to possess greater cognitive capacity. Below, we detail a computational instantiation of this additional-capacity model, show the fits to data, and examine why it is also a psychologically plausible account when we consider a satisficing strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Simon, 1947)</ref>.</p><p>Satisficing is the rationing of mental resources to meet performance outcomes one deems satisfactory rather than expending resources exhaustively. Importantly, a participant that employs a satisficing strategy holds cognitive resources in reserve. This is pertinent in our dual-task context because what is deemed satisfactory performance in the DRT likely demands fewer resources than the MOT. One consistency across experiments was that performance in the DRT was high (M accuracy &gt; 90%) and so, even at higher workloads individuals likely were satisfied with their attentional investment in the DRT.</p><p>Consequently, additional emphasis on the DRT would leave a large pool of resources available for the MOT. By comparison, the MOT is continuously demanding and increasingly so with higher workloads. Should an individual use a satisficing strategy and primarily allocate resources for the MOT, the remaining pool of resources for the DRT would be comparatively smaller. Taken together, satisficing offers a route by which the apparent pool of cognitive resources can differ depending on the task emphasis.</p><p>To test this possibility, we instantiated the satisficing strategy into our pooled resources model. Specifically, we estimated how much additional resource capacity (G) is available in the DRT-emphasis condition if individuals adopted the same satisficing strategy in the MOT-emphasis condition. We extracted the median posterior MOT discrimination (d ′ ) parameter values from estimates of the MOT-emphasis condition in DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 42 Experiment 2. These d ′ values represent the satisficed level of MOT-performance as the total resources allocated to the MOT task from the attention allocation mechanism. We exported these exact values to the DRT-emphasis condition and fixed the resources allocated to the MOT task but made any additional capacity available for the DRT. In this way, we measure how much additional capacity was available to a DRT-emphasised condition adopting the same attention allocation as the satisficed MOT-emphasis condition.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, we show MOT-task predictions for this new 'DRT-emphasis + extra capacity' condition relative to the predictions from the pooled resources model. In the figure, we preserve the data and model fits exactly as in Exp. 2 results, replicating panel A <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, where the pooled resources model assumes a common capacity value (G = 10).</p><p>The novel 'DRT-emphasis + extra capacity' condition shows the best fit extra capacity value, G = 11, representing a 10% increase in capacity for the DRT-emphasis condition 6</p><p>The key diagnostic is the improvement of model predictions for MOT target stimuli (right panel, orange-vs. tan-coloured points). Whereas the pooled resources model penalised the DRT-emphasis condition, a satisficing strategy provides sufficient extra resources to maintain MOT performance and improve DRT task performance (see Appendix <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> for accompanying DRT fits). Together, these modeling analyses show that additional resource capacity is a plausible alternative explanation and points to a need to understand further the limits of cognitive capacity under multitasking settings. Beyond our current focus on the cognitive allocation mechanism lies a swathe of opportune research questions. Amongst these are new investigations into cognitive control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 10</head><p>One common analogy for attention is money; that attention is spent on the things we want but that by nature of its finiteness, spending efficiently or avoiding wasteful outlets is important. One tacit premise of this spending analogy, however, is that one keeps a constant control over attentional resources as though our mental wallet can be open or shut at will. Indeed, the current work makes this exact assumption that allocated resources are spent precisely where they are allocated.</p><p>However, contrary to this spending analogy is research into mind-wandering <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Killingsworth &amp; Gilbert, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mittner et al., 2016</ref>) that trains of thought follow their own path, unrelated to one's current affairs. These mind-wandering thoughts can just as readily lead to new ideas as they can distract from one's focus which makes it difficult to straightforwardly label them as purely distraction or interference. Mind wandering poses a challenge to the attentional resource account because control can be eroded without direct intervention on the cognitive system <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hawkins et al., 2022)</ref>. Rather, factors such as repetitiveness, e.g., in airport baggage screening, can lead to attentional lapses alongside notable high cognitive workload demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Meuter &amp; Lacherez, 2016)</ref>. Cognitive training has proven helpful with maintaining vigilant attention such as in repetitive sports practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ducrocq et al., 2016)</ref> with the caveat that individual expectation and motivation play key roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Parong et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Taken together, understanding attention is central to many day-to-day applications in society. Anyone involved in safety-critical work could attest to the importance of focusing at crucial moments under intense cognitive load. However, even when wrangling with daily minutia, one feels the many-armed tugs on attention, out of sight but not out of mind. To meet these many everyday demands, our current investigation highlights the flexibility of decision-makers who adjust their cognitive resource investment on the fly.</p><p>DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION</p></div>

Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) task is shown above the dotted line and concurrent Detection Response Task (DRT) illustrated below. Dotted line indicates progression of the trial. The MOT trial is divided into three stages. The first target identification stage, dots are stationary and the target dots are highlighted onscreen. The number of target dots, between 1-5, randomly changed between trials. In second continuous motion stage, dots moved for 15 seconds where the targets are briefly highlighted. The highlight was removed after 500ms and after which all dots appeared identical. All motion ceased in the third interrogation stage. Five dots are randomly chosen (i.e., could include targets &amp; non-tragets) and sequentially interrogated where participants respond either 'target' or 'non-target'. The DRT stimulus appeared only in the second continuous motion stage of the MOT as a red box around the screen. The DRT stimulus lasted for 1 second and re-appeared in cycles with intervals randomly distributed between 3-5 seconds. Participants were instructed to make a response as quickly as possible once the DRT stimulus appeared. This resulted in approximately 5 DRT stimulus presentations per MOT trial.</figDesc></figure>

Whilst response times were significantly slower with increase in number of dots to track, participants were only slightly less accurate as load increased (see right-panel). We find moderate evidence that task accuracy was consistently high even with increasing MOT task demands, despitethe numerical suggestion of a decline (M 1 = 0.95 vs. M 5 = 0.91, BF: 3.46).

Given the individual task results, one open question is how does performance in one task relate to performance in the other?

This across-task correlation points towards an individual differences perspective on cognitive capacity. That DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 21is, across subjects, individuals adept at the MOT were also adept at the DRT. However, DRT response times negatively correlated with MOT accuracy,(β = −0.03, BF = 101.45).</figDesc></figure>

Accuracy DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 32 decreased with MOT-task difficulty (M 1dot = 0.94 vs. M 5dots = 0.59, BF &gt; 1000). Accuracy was also lower for target stimuli than non-target stimuli (M target = 0.67 vs.M non−target = 0.83, BF &gt; 1000). However, between the task-emphasis conditions, the MOT-emphasis condition did not outperform the DRT-emphasis condition at the MOT task, (M M OT = 0.75 vs. M DRT = 0.75, BF 01 = 12.45), and this equivalence in MOT performance was preserved across task difficulty (BF 01 = 77.43).Task performance was most clearly affected in the DRT data (panel B &amp; C,Figure 8. Consistent with the emphasis manipulation, accuracy in the DRT was greater for theDRT-emphasis condition (green vs. orange dots, M DRT = 0.99 vs. M M OT = 0.96, BF &gt; 1000). There was weak evidence that DRT accuracy was consistent across difficulty levels (BF 01 = 2.87) as well as weak evidence against an interaction with task emphasis condition (BF 01 = 8.24). However, there is at least the numerical suggestion that accuracy in the MOT-emphasis condition declined over difficulty (orange points, panel B; M 1dot = 0.98 secs. vs. M 5dots = 0.94). Turning to the response time data, the DRT-emphasis condition made faster responses compared to the MOT-emphasis condition (panel C, Figure 8 , M DRT = 0.39 vs. M M OT = 0.49, BF &gt; 1000). Over MOT task difficulty, the evidence was ambiguous as to whether reaction time changed (M 1dot = 0.41 secs. vs. M 5dots = 0.46, BF = 0.48), although this did not differ across emphasis conditions (BF 01 = 13.20). Taken together, the emphasis conditions separate most clearly in the DRT data. DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION 33 Figure 8</figDesc></figure>

One parsimonious interpretation of this correlation is that both tasks draw from a central resource pool where a larger pool of resources leads to better performance at both tasks. A larger resource pool would mean Experiment 1 demonstrated that in a dual-task setup, increasing cognitive demands in the MOT decreased performance across both tasks. When unburdened and tracking a single dot, individuals were capable of performing accurately in both the MOT and DRT tasks. However, even incremental increases to the MOT task difficulty, i.e., increasing the number of dots to track from one to two, led to measurable declines that were captured by parameter estimates of both models. Such decrements suggest that the dual-task demands exceeded the available pool of attention that may have been sufficient under less</figDesc><table><row><cell>DIVIDING UP THE PIE: ATTENTION ALLOCATION</cell><cell>24</cell></row><row><cell>Discussion Exp. 1</cell><cell></cell></row></table><note>that an individual could more flexibly allocate their resources across the two tasks when the cognitive demands fluctuated.
