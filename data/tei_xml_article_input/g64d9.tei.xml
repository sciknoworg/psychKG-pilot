			<abstract>
				<p>Computerized paradigms have enabled gathering rich data on human behaviour, including information on motor execution of a decision, e.g. by tracking mouse cursor trajectories. These trajectories can reveal novel information about ongoing decision processes. As the number and complexity of mouse-tracking studies increase, more sophisticated methods are needed to analyse the decision trajectories. Here, we present a new computational approach to generating decision landscape visualizations based on mouse-tracking data. A decision landscape is an analogue of an energy potential field mathematically derived from the velocity of mouse movement during a decision. Visualized as a three-dimensional surface, it provides a comprehensive overview of decision dynamics. Employing the dynamical systems theory framework, we develop a new method for generating decision landscapes based on arbitrary number of trajectories. This approach not only generates three-dimensional illustration of decision landscapes, but also describes mouse trajectories by a number of interpretable parameters. These parameters characterize dynamics of decisions in more detail compared with conventional measures, and can be compared across experimental conditions, and even across individuals. The decision landscape visualization approach is a novel tool for analysing mouse trajectories during decision execution, which can provide new insights into individual differences in the dynamics of decision making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Every minute of every day, we make decisions that affect our personal and professional lives, sometimes to a great extent. Despite this continuous practice, our decisions often leave much to be desired. To understand why we make decisions the way we do, decision making researchers have mainly focused on what people choose, by proposing cognitive processes that would give rise to the observed choice outcome distributions. Outcome distributions, however, constitute relatively loose constraints on the possible processes underlying decision making. Consequently, researchers have argued that decision making theories should be tested on a functional (process) level rather than just on the level of outcome predictions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). This can be achieved by measuring behavioural activity during the decision making process to directly assess how a choice is made.</p><p>A variety of experimental methods have been used to study the cognitive processes underlying decision making. One class of paradigms, including eye tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and different variations of the information search paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, taps attentional processes, trying to answer the question of what information is attended to in the course of a decision. Another strand of research, focused on hand or mouse tracking, examines how decisions are executed through the motor system. These studies interpret motor output of a decision as a continuous trace of decisional processes. In a typical experiment on mouse tracking, the participant chooses between the two options presented in the corners of a computer screen <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. The dynamics of the response, as expressed in recorded mouse cursor trajectories, can then reveal (post hoc) the degree of competition between the two options during choice.</p><p>Mouse (or hand) tracking have been employed to investigate decision making dynamics in a variety of different domains, e.g., speech processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, social categorisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, numerical cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, intertemporal choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, see also reviews in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. The recent development of specialized software for capturing mouse cursor data <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> has further increased the amount and complexity of the data generated by mouse-tracking studies.</p><p>Response trajectories provide rich continuous data, but the vast majority of available studies utilize a few relatively simple measures. These include latency measures (initiation or response times), consistency measures (e.g., changes in the x-direction ("x-flips") or sample entropy), and trajectory curvature measures (maximum deviation of the trajectory from an ideal, straight-line trajectory, or area under the curve of difference between actual and ideal trajectories). The analyses of these measures are often highlighted by average mouse trajectories, which may have several important</p></div>

In recent years, further methods have been proposed, including average mouse velocity plots (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>), trajectory heat maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, time plots of regression coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, and visualizations based on principal component analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. However, given the rich spatial and temporal information in response trajectories, it is likely that much potentially important information remains beyond our analytic capacity. More advanced analysis and visualization methods can enable us to get deeper insights from the rich data provided by the mouse-tracking paradigm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical foundations of the decision landscape notion</head><p>Dynamical accounts of cognition posit that decision making should be treated as a continuous rather than discrete process <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. On the way to our final decision, we must traverse a multitude of intermediate mental states; in other words, we gradually arrive at a decision instead of instantaneously falling into it. On a neural level, this hypothesis is supported by the finding that intermediate states of a decision process are characterized by partially activated neural populations in dorsal premotor cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</p><p>In line with the foregoing perspective, we assume that the temporal dynamics of a decision can be represented by a trajectory in the multi-dimensional space of all possible mental states. Some of these states ("attractors") are locally stable, so that every decision, although passing through a multitude of intermediate states, eventually gravitates towards one of these attractors. A mouse trajectory can then be treated as a projection of this highdimensional trajectory onto a two-dimensional space represented by the computer screen <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> for extended discussion of theoretical foundations of the mouse-tracking paradigm). Two attractors ("pure" mental states corresponding to finalized decisions) are then mapped onto the locations of the decision outcomes on the screen. The mouse cursor (as a projection of a multi-dimensional mental state) can then be viewed as a particle moving in an two-attractor force field, much like a marble rolling down one of the two valleys in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>. However, up until recently the notion of an attractor landscape driving the decision process remained purely hypothetical. The purpose of this work is to facilitate practical and data-driven applications of this notion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current study</head><p>Here we present a computational approach for illustrating mouse-tracking data through three-dimensional visualizations of the decision landscape, motivated by recent work in the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. We assume that the decision process, as reflected in a mouse trajectory, and the decision itself are driven by a decision landscape much like the motion of a physical particle in a force field is driven by its potential energy. The parameters defining the shape of the decision landscape can then be tuned to fit a specific decision trajectory (or a set of trajectories). Visualized as a 3D surface, the decision landscape provides a comprehensive overview of motor evolution of decisions. The suggested method can generate illustrations of the decision landscape based on arbitrary number of trajectories, and, in addition, can effectively describe each mouse trajectory by a number of interpretable parameters. These parameters, coupled with the generic landscape model, capture the time evolution of decisions in more details than conventional measures. Using previously collected data on a learning task <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we demonstrate how decision landscape visualizations can be used to compare sets of mouse trajectories between experimental conditions or individual decision makers in a comprehensive and visually appealing way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. VISUALIZING DECISION LANDSCAPES: METHOD</head><p>The proposed method is aimed at reconstructing a 3D decision landscape based on a mouse trajectory of a decision (or a set of trajectories). To do this, we assume that each trajectory can be described by a dynamical system of a specific form, which incorporates a parametrized function describing the shape of the two-attractor landscape. By fitting this dynamical system to a set of trajectories, we obtain specific values of the parameters characterizing these particular trajectories. We can then use these parameters to generate the three-dimensional visualization of the decision landscape characterizing all of the given decisions (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> for the high-level overview of the method). The source code implementing all the procedures of the method in Python is publicly available <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data requirements and preprocessing</head><p>Our method can be used to visualize decision landscapes using the trajectories obtained in a typical mouse-tracking experiment <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. We assume that each decision trajectory starts in the bottom-centre part of the screen and ends in either the top left or top right corner. The method can be generalized to the case of more than two choice options; it can as well be used with any other experimental paradigm generating simple enough continuous trajectories (for instance, arm reaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, using two-dimensional projections of actual 3D trajectories).</p><p>Prior to feeding the experimentally obtained trajectories to the method, we pre-process the trajectories as follows: • The screen coordinates are rescaled such that each trajectory originates close to (x, y) = (0, 0) and ends near (x, y) = (−1, 1) (left target) or (x, y) = (1, 1) (right target). The reason for this is that the screen size and proportions can differ between experimental setups; we thus illustrate the method for spatially normalized trajectories.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= − ( ,</formula><p>• Movement initiation time (the time during which the mouse cursor does not move from the starting position) is disregarded. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The final part of the trajectory (after the mouse has stopped in the response area and its coordinates do not change until the end of the trial) is also discarded from the trajectories.</p><p>• Time series describing x-and y-coordinates of the mouse cursor are re-sampled so that each trajectory consists of the same number of data points (usually 101). 2</p><p>• For each trajectory, mouse velocities in the x-and y-directions are computed by taking time derivatives of the x and y mouse coordinate data. This can be done numerically using finite difference approximations or Savitzky-Golay filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model of trajectory dynamics</head><p>Without aiming at developing a model explaining the dynamics of a decision, we use the simple dynamical system to describe the decision trajectory, capturing the high-level features of motion of the mouse cursor. We describe the</p><p>x-and y-components of a decision trajectory by a system of differential equations</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">τẋ = − ∂V ∂x , τẏ = − ∂V ∂y ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where x = x(t) and y = y(t) are the positions of the mouse along the x-and y-coordinates, respectively,ẋ = dx /dt andẏ = dy /dt are the time derivatives of x and y, τ &gt; 0 is the time scale parameter expressed in seconds, V (x, y) is an unknown function describing the decision landscape, which defines the dynamics of the system, and ∂V ∂x and ∂V ∂y are partial derivatives of V . Our method is not constrained by some particular function V (x, y); here we use one of the simplest possible variants. We assume that V (x, y) comprises a fixed baseline component</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V x (x) + V y (y) and a parametrized component V xy (x, y): V (x, y) = V x (x) + V y (y) + V xy (x, y),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where V xy (x, y) can be fitted to the data, and V x (x) and V y (y) are polynomials chosen in such a way that the two target locations, (-1, 1) and (1, 1), are attractors, and the starting location (0, 0) is a repellor of the system (1) and thus (with the integration constants set to zero)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V x (x) = ∂V x ∂x dx = x(x + 1)(x − 1) dx = x 4 4 − x 2 2 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">V y (y) = ∂V y ∂y dy = y(y − 1) dy = y 3 3 − y 2 2 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Having a two-attractor decision landscape as a baseline, we introduce the parametrized polynomial component V xy (x, y) to be able to account for asymmetry in the landscape and other, more intricate properties of experimental trajectories. Here, also for the reason of simplicity, for V xy (x, y) we use a polynomial function of x and y</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">V xy (x, y) = α k=2 i,j&gt;0 i+j=k c ij x i y j /(k − 1),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where the parameter α ≥ 2 determines the number of terms in the polynomial, which in turn determines descriptive ability of the model, and the parameters c ij are fitted to the mouse data. With increasing α the number of free parameters increases, therefore the fitted values of these parameters may be difficult to interpret for large α. Heuristically, we recommend to use the method with α = 2, 3 or 4, depending on complexity of the trajectories, and taking into account the trade-off between approximation accuracy and interpretability of the parameters.</p><p>The effect of the model parameters τ and c ij on the shape of the decision landscape can be analyzed independently of the experimental data ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>). For any α, two parameters, τ and c 11 , always enter the model. The parameter τ affects the characteristic time scale of the system motion: the larger the value of τ , the slower the motion of the mouse generated by the model (in both directions).</p><p>The only second-order parameter of the model, c 11 , is the primary determinant of the asymmetry of the decision landscape. Such asymmetry may be caused, for instance, by strong prevalence of one decision outcome over another. Another possible example would be a situation when trajectories towards one option are consistently faster compared to the trajectories pointing to the other option.</p><p>When α ≥ 3, two additional parameters enter the model, c 21 and c 12 . Their effects are somewhat similar to those of τ and c 11 respectively <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>, however, these and the other higher-order parameters allow for fine-tuning of the decision landscape to the experimental trajectories.</p><p>Fitting the model to one trajectory For a single experimental trajectory, we aim to find the parameters allowing the model (1)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> to reproduce the dynamics of this trajectory as closely as possible. We can quantify the fitting error in two ways: (i) as a function of the positional difference between the data and the modelled trajectory, or (ii) based on the difference in mouse velocities</p><p>x co or din at e between the data and the model. The first approach would arguably result in a more accurate approximation of trajectories, but requires substantially more computational effort, as in each step of the fitting algorithm the system of differential equations (1) has to be solved. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Here we focus on the second, velocity-based approach, which is much more efficient in terms of computational resources (although sometimes at the expense of approximation accuracy). Given an experimental mouse trajectory sampled at m time steps and the numerically derived mouse velocity vectors</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">v data x , v data y</formula><p>, we define the fitting error</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">H(τ, c ij , v data x , v data y ) = 1 m m i=0 (v model x (x i , y i ) − v data x (t i )) 2 + (v model y (x i , y i ) − v data y (t i )) 2 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Here</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">, v model x,y (x i , y i )</formula><p>are the values of the right-hand side of the system (1) (divided by τ ) computed at each point (x i , y i ) along the experimental trajectory</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">v model x (x i , y i ) = − 1 τ ∂V x ∂x (x i , y i ) v model y (x i , y i ) = − 1 τ ∂V y ∂y (x i , y i )</formula><p>These values depend on the parametrization of the model, so the defined error function depends both on the model parameter values and the experimental trajectory. Using numerical optimization routines (available, e.g., in the Python package scipy.optimize), we can now find the best-fitting values of the model parameters for a given mouse trajectory. Note that Jacobian of the error functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and (7) can be analytically derived (see accompanying source code <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>), which enables one to use more efficient and robust optimisation algorithms. As an initial approximation for the parameter fitting procedure, the parameters corresponding to the baseline landscape V x,y = 0 should be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fitting the model to multiple trajectories</head><p>Visualizing a decision landscape that would integrate the properties of multiple trials (within a single experimental condition, individual participant, or a group of participants) is where the method can prove most useful. To be able to do this, we use the same approach as in the case of a single trial, and minimize the average error across individual trials in the given set. Given the set of N trajectories and their velocities v data</p><p>x,n and v data y,n for n = 1, . . . , N , the fitting error for multiple trajectories is defined bŷ</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">H(τ, c ij , v data x,1 , v data y,1 , . . . , v data x,N , v data y,N ) = 1 N N n=1 H(τ, c ij , v data x,n , v data y,n ),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where H is defined in (6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. VISUALIZING DECISION LANDSCAPES: EXAMPLES</head><p>We illustrate several potential scenarios of using decision landscapes to visualize mouse tracking data by applying the technique to previously obtained data on a simple learning task <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> (the data is publicly available <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>). The task consisted of a series of binary choices between abstract symbols, with each symbol yielding either low or high reward (e.g., 5 or 20 points). The goal of the participants was to get as many points as possible throughout a set of 36 trials, which included low vs. low, high vs. low, and high vs. high choices. By the end of the experiment, most of the participants successfully learned to choose only the symbols associated with a high reward.</p><p>Here we only consider the part of the data corresponding to high vs. low choices (20 per participant), so that the outcome of a decision is either "high" (7, 10 or 20 points depending on experimental condition) or "low" (5 points). Without loss of generality, the data are preprocessed so that the "high" option is mapped to the right-hand corner of the screen (x = 1), and the "low" option is located in the left-hand corner (x = −1). To fit the experimental data, we used the version of the model (1)-(5) with α = 3, which has four free parameters. The baseline values of the parameters were set to τ = 0.05, c ij = 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single-trial decision landscapes</head><p>Fitted to a single trial's mouse trajectory, the decision landscape captures both temporal dynamics and geometry of a trial <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5</ref>). Two key properties of mouse trajectories reflected by the fitted landscapes are: motion time (MT), i.e., how long it takes for the cursor to reach the response area once it leaves the starting location, and "max-d", maximum deviation from the ideal, straight-line trajectory. Slow trajectories are characterized by shallow landscapes, which indicate weak attraction towards the eventually chosen option (e.g., trial 2 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>). With decreasing motion time, the attractor associated with the chosen option becomes stronger, as reflected by the steeper slope of the landscape (trials 28 and 15 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>). However, if the trajectory deviates substantially toward the "low" option, the second, latent attractor emerges in the decision landscape (trial 28), although this option was not chosen. Still, the chosen option attractor appears to be stronger than that of the unchosen option, reflecting the fact that the participant was "pulled" towards it eventually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning</head><p>If the experimental task involves adaptation, the decision landscapes can be used to highlight learning patterns within subjects. By way of example, we pooled all trials of a representative participant into three consecutive blocks, so that the first six "high-low" trials fell into Block 1, the next six into Block 2, and the last eight "high-low" choices formed Block 3. Across blocks, the participant learned to ignore the "low" option (Tab. 2). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref> represents three decision landscapes separately fitted to all trajectories of each block. The decision surface gradually changes from the two-attractor landscape with a more pronounced potential well associated with the "high" attractor to the singleattractor configuration, thereby tracking the learning-induced evolution of preference across blocks. Here, besides the x coo rdin ate  dynamics of the trials, the decision landscape is shaped by the choice distribution: with practice, Participant 1334 learned to ignore the "low" option (in blocks 2 and 3 only the "high" option was selected).</p><p>One may note that the decision landscapes suggest the participant's aversion to the "low" option has somewhat decreased from Block 2 to Block 3. This is likely to be the consequence of more curved trajectories observed in Block 3, given that the choice distribution and motion times remained similar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision landscapes of individual decision makers</head><p>One of the potential applications of the present method is highlighting individual differences between two participants performing the same task. To do this, one can obtain decision landscapes individually for each participant by fitting the landscape model to all trials of that individual simultaneously. In the case of multiple-trajectory fitting, the fitting error is defined as the average error across all trajectories of a given participant <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Eq. (7)</ref>), so the resulting decision landscape will integrate the information on how often, how fast, and with what degree of competition each option was chosen. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the participant's decisions throughout the experiment.</p><p>We illustrate this by two representative examples comparing pairs of participants. In the first example <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 7)</ref>, Participant 9276 was equally likely to choose either option, with faster trajectories reaching towards the "low" (lefthand-side) option. Participant 9424 had chosen the "low" response more often, and it was chosen on average faster than the "high" option. This difference in choice distributions is reflected in the decision landscapes of the two participants. Particularly, the decision landscape favours the "high" option more in Participant 9276, who chose this option relatively more often than Participant 9424, although the motion times towards this option are similar in the two participants, and despite the fact that trajectories of Participant 9424 towards this option were more direct.</p><p>The second example highlights the differences in decision landscapes of the participants with similar choice distributions ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 8)</ref>. Participant 1395 (purple surface) and Participant 1962 (green surface) chose "high" option in 65% and 70% of the trials, respectively. However, because the trajectories of Participant 1962 toward the "low" choices were more deflected towards the "high" option than those of Participant 1395 (max-d 0.18 vs. 0.06), the left-hand-side attractor of the green decision landscape is shallower than that of the purple landscape.</p><p>x coord inate x coo rdi na te </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DISCUSSION</head><p>The decision landscape visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of decision-makers' responses in mousetracking experiments. Each visualisation integrates the information on 1) the likelihood of each option to be chosen, 2) the duration of the response, and 3) the degree of competition between the options.</p><p>The shape of the decision landscape is influenced (but not completely determined) by the likelihood of choosing</p><p>x coo rdi na te each option. If one option was selected much more often than the other, the optimal fit of the landscape might be achieved by effectively ignoring the trajectories towards the less frequent choice, which results in a one-attractor decision landscape. However, in the case of equally likely choices, the best-fit decision landscape must necessarily capture the dynamics of the trajectories in both directions. At the same time, temporal and geometrical aspects of the trajectories also contribute to the shape of the landscape. Slow or very curved trajectories toward an option can lead to decreased attraction of that option as expressed in the decision landscape, even though that option was finally chosen in the end. Consequently, the decision landscape visualizations may aid in interpreting possible paradoxical situations where one option is chosen less frequently, but faster and more directly, and the other option is chosen often, but in a conflicted way. The parameters of the decision surfaces generated by the method can be used to concisely describe each trajectory (or set of trajectories). Much like coefficients in a Fourier series representation of a periodic function, the parameters of our model define relative contributions of corresponding polynomial terms of the "potential energy" V (x, y) to the overall dynamics of a trial. On the one hand, the polynomial approximation of trajectory's mouse velocity is more detailed (and less concise) than the standard discrete measures used in the mouse tracking literature, namely, response time and maximum deviation. On the other hand, it is less detailed (yet more concise) than the original time series of mouse x-and y-coordinates.</p><p>Traditionally, mouse-tracking data is visualized using mean mouse trajectories in the x-y plane <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This method, being one of the simplest visualization techniques, is easy to interpret: increased attraction towards a competitor option is clearly reflected by a mean trajectory curved towards that option. However, an important limitation of this approach is that, in order to generate mean trajectories, one must either time-normalize trajectories to provide the same number of time steps per trajectory (e.g., by interpolating each trajectory to 101 time steps) or average x − y locations within temporal bins. In the former case, such mean trajectories allow one to visualize the geometry of the trajectories, but it ignores their temporal dynamics: two geometrically identical mean trajectories of different durations would be indistinguishable in the x − y plot. In the latter, one can visualize the average temporal dynamics of a set of trajectories, but at the cost of averaging across space, and potentially occluding features of the typical geometry of trajectories. The proposed decision landscape visualization approach addresses this issue by incorporating temporal aspects of the trajectories as well as their geometrical properties.</p><p>The first method for visualization of decision landscapes based on mouse tracking data was recently provided by O'Hora et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Their approach, however, is purely data-driven, and thus requires large number of trajectories (of order 100) to generate a reliable visualization of a decision surface. By incorporating prior assumptions about decision landscape V (x, y) into a parametrized model, we dramatically reduce the data requirements of our method. As demonstrated above, the method proposed here can be used even with individual trajectories, but can also incorporate arbitrary number of trajectories. In addition, the decision landscape visualization method reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is constrained solely to visualization, whereas we, thanks to the underlying dynamical model, can extract from each trajectory a set of parameters describing that trajectory. These parameters characterize time evolution of decisions, and can be compared across experimental conditions and even across individual participants.</p><p>Even though the current approach can be employed to characterize the average decision landscape for a person or even a condition within an experiment, the utility of the current model reduces as we move further from individual trajectories. As we have demonstrated, "average" landscapes can be meaningfully generated for conditions within a participant. However, when dealing with large numbers of trajectories, the computational costs of our method associated with fitting the dynamical system to the data become too high for practical use, so in this case, methods such as those proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> are preferred. It is then possible to apply the approach proposed here to infer the landscape parameters by fitting V (x, y) to these data-driven landscapes; this might facilitate comparison across groups of subjects.</p><p>Importantly, the presented version of the method assumes continuity of trajectories, which is not always the case: in a fraction of experimental trials, participants change their mind during a trial, which is indicated by abrupt shifts in x-direction of a decision trajectory. This happens even in simple perceptual discrimination tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>; depending on the task and the experimental setup, the frequency of changes-of-mind can reach 20% (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>). The deterministic dynamical model of a decision trajectory utilized in the present method does not account for such changes-of-mind. One way to conceptualize such responses is that the landscape of a decision involving abrupt preference shifts should depend on time, and thus, might be described by a non-stationary, possibly stochastic model. Development of a method to infer decision landscapes from such change-of-mind trajectories is an important future research direction.</p><p>It is important to note that, though the current visualizations provide a concise way of displaying the most relevant features of mouse cursor movement during a two-choice experiment, they do not constitute a process model of decision making. That is, the attractors at the response locations in the model of a trajectory simply reflect the requirement that a participant chooses one of these responses to complete a decision. The current visualization approach aims to facilitate comparison of mouse data across experimental conditions or consecutive decisions, as we have demonstrated. Moreover, this approach provides a rich outcome space within which to contrast the hypothetical outcomes of proposed process models. For instance, decision making models that infer differences between earlier processes and later processes within a decision might predict specific changes in these landscapes under certain experimental conditions.</p><p>Attractor models have proved useful in understanding outcomes of cognitive processes such as categorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, risky decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, intertemporal choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, and perceptual decision making in intermittent motor control <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. This work is among the first attempts to apply the concepts of dynamical systems theory to process data characterizing decisions. We hope that the proposed decision landscape visualization approach will eventually grow into a new tool for analyzing decision trajectories, which will be able to provide new insights into dynamics of decision making.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Mouse trajectory fromFig. 1and a hypothetical decision landscape driving the decision process.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">Recently, a dynamic start procedure has been advocated, where a participant is only presented with the stimuli once they start moving the mouse<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Dynamic start would mitigate the potential problem of meaningful information about the initial stages of decision not being expressed in the mouse trajectory.<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Re-sampling to sufficient number of data points is unlikely to distort the relevant spatial information<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">In this case, initial conditions for simulating model trajectories also need to be taken care of. In each experimental trial, the exact starting point of the mouse trajectory is determined by where exactly in the "start button" the participant clicked to begin the trial, which makes this starting point effectively random. However, the system (1) is deterministic, so initial conditions fully define its dynamics. Thus, in order to get reasonable fit to the data, one needs to minimize the error function not only over the parameters of the dynamical system, but also over the range of possible initial conditions, which in themselves do not carry any meaningful information. This further adds to computational requirements of this approach.</note>
