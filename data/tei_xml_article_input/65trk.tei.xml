				<p>How do people estimate the prevalence of beliefs and knowledge among others? Here, we examine the hypothesis that mere repetition of information increases such perceptions of consensus-an &quot;illusory consensus effect.&quot; Although existing evidence suggests that repeated exposure to information may increase its perceived consensus, the impact of repetition has not been tested in isolation from other source and contextual cues. We conducted two experiments to fill in this gap. Prolific participants located in the U.S. read a series of trivia claims-half true and half false in Experiment 1 and all true in Experiment 2. These claims were not attributed to any source. After a short delay, participants made consensus judgments about previously seen (repeated) and new trivia claims. Repetition significantly increased perceived consensus in both experiments; in Experiment 1, participants judged that more Americans would believe repeated (vs. new) information, and in Experiment 2, participants judged that more Americans knew repeated (vs. new) information. These findings provide strong evidence for an illusory consensus effect, such that mere exposure to information increases perceptions of how many others would believe it as well as estimates of current public knowledge. These findings add to our understanding of how our information environments contribute to (mis)perceptions of consensus, with a broad range of implications for social media platforms, journalistic practices, and communication campaigns.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>People's beliefs and behaviors are driven, in part, by what they think others believe and know (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cialdini, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Festinger, 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tankard &amp; Paluck, 2016)</ref>. Prior research has demonstrated the important role of perceived consensus on a vast array of outcomes, from health-related decisions like vaccination uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Moehring et al., 2023)</ref> to attitudes toward polarized topics like climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lewandowsky et al., 2019)</ref> to the likelihood of engaging in undesirable behaviors like drinking and driving <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Perkins et al., 2010)</ref> to the success of teaching practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Sadler et al., 2013)</ref>. These estimates of what others think are often constructed through an individual's own experience rather than obtaining actual information about the rates of behaviors and opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Nelson et al., 1998)</ref>. When constructing estimates of what others know or believe, individuals appear to be particularly influenced by the frequency with which they have previously encountered the information they are judging, relying on this cue more than other relevant cues such as the variety of sources sharing that information or opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pillai &amp; Fazio, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Weaver et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>However, this past research has generally examined the effects of exposure to claims attributed to distinct sources in a specific context (e.g., users on social media). This methodological choice makes it difficult to disentangle the distinct role of repetition as the context of the repeated exposure also provides relevant information that bears on judgments of consensus; i.e., exposure to a statement from a specific source provides suggestive evidence that the statement is believed by others. Thus, whether repetition per se can influence perceptions of social consensus remains an open question. Here, we examine for the first time whether mere repetition affects the perceived consensus of claims that are presented without any source information or contextual clues. We present two experimental studies, each focused on the effects of repetition on a different measure of social consensus: judgments of how many others REPETITION AND ILLUSORY CONSENSUS 4 would believe true and false claims (Experiment 1) and estimates of current public knowledge about true claims (Experiment 2). We hypothesized that we would observe an "illusory consensus effect" in both, such that participants would judge that more others would believe or already know repeated (vs. new) information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effects of Repetition on Consensus Estimates</head><p>Existing research provides insights into how repetition may increase consensus estimates.</p><p>First, exposure to a stimulus increases how easy it feels to process that stimulus when it is encountered again. This increased processing fluency may then be used as a heuristic cue to infer that the stimulus is widely known (for reviews, see ). Because people are more likely to encounter widely shared beliefs, these beliefs are also likely to feel familiar and easy to process. Thus, processing ease can serve as a valid cue for consensus if it is a result of having encountered information many times from a variety of sources. However, processing fluency may also result from incidental influences that do not directly reflect consensus. For example, information may feel easy to process if it has been encountered repeatedly from the same source or a source that is not relevant to the target of the consensus estimate. Because people are more sensitive to their experiences of processing fluency than they are to the sources of those experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Schwarz, 2012)</ref>, sources of processing ease that are unrelated to consensus estimates may be misattributed to consensus. For example, seeing a name repeated during an experiment increased participants' perception that the person was famous <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jacoby et al., 1989)</ref>, and hearing one person repeat an opinion increased its perceived popularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Weaver et al., 2007)</ref>. Specific to estimates of what others believe, researchers have also found that repeatedly hearing a trivia question increases participants' perceptions that their peers know the answer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Birch et al., 2017)</ref>, and reading news headlines shared by the same social REPETITION AND ILLUSORY CONSENSUS 5 media user multiple times increases perceptions that others believe it to be true <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pillai &amp; Fazio, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Repetition may also increase estimates of consensus through changes in one's own beliefs. Similar to consensus estimates, individuals rely on experiences of processing fluency and familiarity to make judgments of truth. Information that is repeated is judged to be more true than new information, a robust finding called the "illusory truth effect" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hasher et al., 1977</ref>; for recent reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pillai &amp; Fazio, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Udry &amp; Barber, 2024)</ref>. When making judgments about what others believe, individuals often draw on their own knowledge as a source of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Nelson et al., 1998)</ref>. The tendency to be biased by one's own knowledge when making estimates about what others know represents a form of egocentric mentalizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Todd &amp; Tamir, 2024</ref>) that has been called the "curse of knowledge" effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Camerer et al., 1989)</ref>. For example, people judge that more of their peers would know the answer to a trivia question when they themselves know the answer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Birch et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nickerson et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tullis, 2018)</ref>. Thus, repetition may facilitate perceptions of consensus by increasing one's own belief in the claim, which people may draw on as a source of information to estimate that others are more likely to believe that information as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Present Investigations</head><p>Although prior literature provides compelling evidence for a repetition-consensus link, information in these studies has typically been presented with accompanying source or contextual cues (e.g., from a specific person in a specific context) and has thus not provided an isolated test of the effects of repetition on consensus. To fill this gap, we conducted two studies with Prolific users located in the U.S. testing whether repeating information -in the absence of any accompanying source or contextual cues -increases perceptions of its consensus. In REPETITION AND ILLUSORY CONSENSUS 6 Experiment 1, we investigated whether participants judged that more Americans would believe true and false claims that were repeated (vs. new). In Experiment 2, we investigated the effect of mere repetition on participants' judgments of how many others knew true information. Given that individuals tend to rely more on their own knowledge when making estimates about more similar others for whom one's own knowledge is more likely to be a relevant cue <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Nelson et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Todd &amp; Tamir, 2024)</ref>, we additionally explored whether the effects of repetition were moderated by how closely participants identified with the target of the consensus measure (Americans). We also investigated whether these effects varied by individual differences in thinking styles (Need for Cognition and Cognitive Reflection) in both experiments, as well as by claim veracity in Experiment 1 (which used both true and false claims). Given the similarities in the methodology and analysis in each experiment, we report them together.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments</head><p>The methods and analyses described refer to those used in both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 unless otherwise stated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Design</head><p>We manipulated claim repetition (repeated or new) within-subjects. Participants made consensus judgments for 72 claims, half of which they had seen in the earlier exposure phase and half of which were new.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>To determine the number of participants to recruit, we performed a power analysis using an estimated effect size d = 0.48, an effect size observed in a recent study from our research group testing the effects of repetition on perceived expert consensus. We found that a total REPETITION AND ILLUSORY CONSENSUS 7 sample of 59 participants would be required to detect the effect in a repeated measures design with α = .05, power (1-β) = .95, and using a two-tailed test according to G*Power <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Faul et al., 2007)</ref>. Given that we did not yet have an estimate for the effect of repetition for each of our consensus measures, we decided to overrecruit from this estimate and aim for 100 total participants in each experiment.</p><p>We recruited 100 Prolific workers located in the U.S. with a 95%+ approval rating to participate in a survey on "Item Perception". In Experiment 1, we estimated our study would take approximately 15 minutes and participants were given $3.00 for their participation, consistent with Prolific's current recommended rate of $12/hour. The median time for participants to complete the survey was a few minutes longer than estimated, so we increased our payment to $3.60 in Experiment 2. As a requirement of our funding, people who were affiliated with the University of Washington and involved in this research were ineligible for this study. In total, 101 participants completed the survey in Experiment 1 (M age = 40.66, SD age = 15.75; 40.6% male, 57.4% female, 2.0% non-binary, 0.0% choose to self-describe) and 100 participants completed the survey for Experiment 2 (M age = 37.21, SD age = 14.24; 43.0% male, 56.0% female, 1.0% non-binary, 0.0% choose to self-describe).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Measures</head><p>Stimuli. In Experiment 1, we used a set of 72 true and false trivia claims about a variety of topics (sports, geography, food, animals, and science) from Jalbert, Newman, and Schwarz (2020). These claims were selected from a broader set of claims previously normed in a sample of online workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jalbert, Newman, &amp; Schwarz, 2019)</ref> to be ambiguous in regards to truth, with participants judging each claim selected to be true between 35% and 65% of the time in the norming. Claims were also selected such that truth ratings were similar for true and false claims, REPETITION AND ILLUSORY CONSENSUS 8 with M = 0.52 (SD = 0.08) for both. Examples of true claims include "Halvah is a confection made of sesame seeds" and "Fly-fishing is the oldest method of recreational fishing", while examples of false claims include "Biking is the first event in a triathlon" and "Mayonnaise is usually made with raw egg whites."</p><p>In Experiment 2, we only wanted to use true claims as stimuli. In the broader set of normed claims <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jalbert et al., 2019)</ref>, each false claim had a corresponding true claim that was created by altering one word in the true claim (e.g., the false claim "Snakes have movable eyelids" had the true version "Snakes lack movable eyelids"). To create a set of true claims in Experiment 2, we simply replaced the 36 false claims with their corresponding true versions from the normed data set, keeping the counterbalancing the same as in Experiment 1.</p><p>During the initial exposure phase, participants were presented with 36 of these trivia claims (half true and half false in Experiment 1, all true in Experiment 2), and during the judgment phase, participants saw the same 36 claims along with 36 new claims (also half true and half false in Experiment 1, all true in Experiment 2). To control for item effects, in each experiment, we also counterbalanced which half of the claims were repeated between participants such that half of the participants saw one set of 36 claims repeated while the other half saw the other set of 36 claims repeated.</p><p>Consensus Measure. In Experiment 1, for each trivia claim, participants were asked "How many Americans do you think would believe this claim?", and made their responses on an unnumbered ten-point scale with the endpoints "hardly anyone" (coded as 1) on the left and "almost everyone" (coded as 10) on the right.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REPETITION AND ILLUSORY CONSENSUS 9</head><p>In Experiment 2, participants were asked "How many Americans know this information?", and made their responses on an unnumbered ten-point scale with the endpoints "hardly anyone" (coded as 1) on the left and "almost everyone" (coded as 10) on the right.</p><p>Additional Measures. We included four additional measures assessing individual characteristics for exploratory purposes. We were interested in whether any of these measures might moderate the effects of repetition on consensus estimates. Two of these measures assessed aspects of individual thinking styles. These were a 12-item Need for Cognition Scale (NFC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cacioppo &amp; Petty, 1982)</ref> to capture individual differences in tendency to engage in elaborative thinking, and a 7-item Cognitive Reflective Task (CRT; 3-item reworded version of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Frederick, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">via Shenhav et al., (2012</ref><ref type="bibr">, and 4-item CRT by Thomson &amp; Oppenheimer, 2016</ref> to capture individual differences in reliance on analytical (vs. intuitive) thinking. An additional two items were included to assess participants' identification with Americans, the target of judgment for our consensus measure. The first item was an adapted Inclusion of Others in the Self Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aron et al., 1992)</ref>, where participants select one of seven pairs of circles overlapping to various extents that best describes their relationship with Americans. These responses were coded from one to seven, with higher values corresponding to higher levels of overlap. An image of how this scale item appeared to participants can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. We also asked participants to answer the question, "How similar do you think you are to the typical American?" with responses made on a seven-point unnumbered scale with the endpoints "not at all similar" (coded as 1) on the left and "extremely similar" (coded as 7) on the right.</p><p>In Experiment 2 where we only used true claims, we also added an additional exploratory measure to assess whether participants (correctly) thought the claims to be true during the exposure and test phase. Participants were first asked to think back to either the first task when REPETITION AND ILLUSORY CONSENSUS 10 they were reading the claim (the exposure phase) or the task later in the study where they were rating claims (the judgment phase) and indicate if they thought all of the claims were true while completing this task (yes/no). If participants marked yes, they received a follow-up question asking them approximately how many of the claims they thought were true and made their ratings on an unnumbered Likert-type scale with the endpoints "Almost none" (coded as 1) and "Almost all"(coded as 7), with "about half" in the middle (coded as 4). We randomized whether participants were asked about the claims at exposure or test first. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. An adapted version of the Inclusion of Others in the Self Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aron et al., 1992)</ref> presented to participants to assess their perceived relationship to Americans in each experiment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>When participants signed up for the experiment, they read an information sheet and indicated their agreement to participate. Participants were required to complete the survey on a computer (not a phone or tablet).</p><p>Exposure Phase. In the exposure phase, participants were told that, for approximately the next three minutes, they would see a series of statements, and that these statements would be presented automatically. They were asked to read the statements carefully as they were presented but to not do anything else. They were additionally informed that they would not be able to pause the study so they should make sure they had no distractions before they started.</p><p>Participants then saw the series of 36 trivia claims that would be their repeated claims.</p><p>Each trivia claim appeared on the screen for five seconds before auto-advancing to the next claim. The order in which these claims were presented was randomized for each participant.</p><p>Delay. Next, to serve as a short delay, participants completed the 12-item NFC Scale. For this task, participants were told they would be shown a series of statements, and for each statement to indicate to what extent the statement was characteristic of them. Participants made their responses on an unnumbered five-point scale from "extremely uncharacteristic" (coded as -2) on the left to "extremely characteristic" (coded as 2) on the right. Judgment Phase. In the judgment phase, participants were presented with 72 trivia claims -the 36 they had viewed during the exposure phase along with 36 new claims -and answered the consensus measure for each claim. Claims were presented one at a time and the order was fully randomized for each participant.</p><p>In the instructions for this task, participants were informed that they would see another series of claims appear on the screen. They were additionally told that they may have seen some REPETITION AND ILLUSORY CONSENSUS 12 of these claims earlier in the study and that some of the claims were true and some of the claims were false. Participants were also told that when they saw each claim appear on the screen, to please read it carefully, and were then shown the consensus measure and an example rating scale they would be using to make their response. Finally, participants were asked to not search for answers online, and that if they were unsure of an answer, to just make their best guess. There was one difference in the instructions between the two experiments: in Experiment 2, as we were asking participants to judge how many Americans knew information (and showing them only true information), we referred to the claims (correctly) as "true claims" throughout the judgment phase instructions.</p><p>Additional Measures and Demographics. After the judgment phase, participants answered the questions relating to their American identity (the adapted Inclusion of Others in the Self Scale and the perceived similarity question) followed by the 7-item CRT. In Experiment 2, participants additionally answered the extra questions about their perceptions of claim truth.</p><p>Finally, all participants answered a few demographic questions including age and gender.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To answer our primary research question of whether repeating information increases perceptions that more others would believe (Experiment 1) or already know (Experiment 2) that information, we conducted a paired samples t-test comparing the mean consensus ratings of repeated and new claims. For this analysis and in future analyses in this paper, we report a  Ratings were responses to the question, "How many Americans do you think would believe this REPETITION AND ILLUSORY CONSENSUS 14 claim?", and made their responses on an unnumbered ten-point scale with the endpoints "hardly anyone" (1) on the left and "almost everyone" (10) on the right. Ratings were responses to the question, "How many Americans know this information?", and made their responses on an unnumbered ten-point scale with the endpoints "hardly anyone" (1) on the left and "almost everyone" (10) on the right.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory Analyses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REPETITION AND ILLUSORY CONSENSUS 15</head><p>We next turned to our exploratory analysis. We first investigated whether variation in our individual difference measures (NFC, CRT, adapted Inclusion of Others in the Self Scale, and, ratings of perceived similarity to the typical American) moderated the effects of repetition on consensus judgments. To do this, we conducted a series of mixed model ANOVAs with claim repetition (repeated or new) as a within-subjects variable and the relevant scale scores or item response included as a continuous mean-centered between-subjects variable. We also investigated whether the impact of repetition varied by claim truth in Experiment 1 (which used both true and false claims) using a repeated-measures ANOVA with repetition and claim truth as within-subjects variables. Given that our stimuli were chosen to be ambiguous in regards to truth (for both true and false claims) based on norming data, we did not anticipate that the effects of repetition on perceptions of consensus would vary by claim veracity in this case. However, we thought this analysis may be of interest to others.</p><p>Overall, we found that none of these variables significantly moderated the effects of repetition on judgments of consensus. The impact of repetition on did not significantly vary across individual differences in NFC, Experiment 1: F (1, 99) = 2.69, p = .104, partial eta 2 = 0.026; Experiment 2, F (1, 98) = 0.97, p = .327, partial eta 2 = 0.010, or CRT, Experiment 1: F (1, 99) = 2.65, p = .107, partial eta 2 = 0.026; Experiment 2: F (1, 98) = 0.21, p = .646 partial eta 2 = 0.002. Nor did they differ by ratings on our adapted Inclusion of Others in the Self Scale, Experiment 1, F (1, 99) = 0.12, p = .728, partial eta 2 = 0.001; Experiment 2, F (1, 98) = 2.43, p = .122, partial eta 2 = 0.024, or by how similar participants perceived themselves to be to the typical American, Experiment 1, F (1, 99) = 0.19, p = .663, partial eta 2 = 0.002; Experiment 2, F (1, 98) = 1.40, p = .240, partial eta 2 = 0.014. In addition, the impact of repetition on did not vary by claim veracity in Experiment 1, F (1, 100) = 0.38, p = .538, partial eta 2 = 0.004, indicating that the repetition had a similar effect on perceived consensus across true and false claims. A detailed report of our exploratory analyses (including coding information, descriptives, and main effects) can be found in our supplementary materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In two studies, we demonstrate that the mere repetition of information increases perceptions of its consensus -an "illusory consensus effect". In Experiment 1, U.S. participants judged that more other Americans would believe repeated (vs. new) true and false claims. In Experiment 2, U.S. participants judged that more others already knew repeated (vs. new) true claims. Our research demonstrates for the first time (to our knowledge) that the mere repetition of information -in the absence of any accompanying source or contextual cues -is sufficient for these effects.</p><p>In addition, our analysis revealed that effects did not significantly vary across individual differences in participants' tendency to engage in elaborative processing (assessed using the Need for Cognition ) and to utilize analytical (vs. intuitive) thinking (as assessed using the Cognitive Reflection Test). These results are consistent with findings from the illusory truth literature that the effects of repetition are relatively robust across individual differences in cognitive style and individual differences (see Pillai &amp; Fazio, 2021 for a review). However, it is important to note that these analyses were exploratory and that our studies were powered to detect a main effect of repetition and not a more subtle moderation.</p><p>The finding that mere repetition increases perceptions of consensus is theoretically consistent with existing work in a variety of domains linking repeated exposure to perceptions of broader support and knowledge (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Birch et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jacoby et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kwan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pillai &amp; Fazio, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Weaver et al., 2007)</ref>, and builds on existing theories of how people draw on different sources of information to make judgments of others' cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Nelson et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Thomas &amp; Jacoby, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tullis, 2018)</ref>. In addition, this work bears on a related observation that people often have a difficult time differentiating between true consensus (conclusions drawn from independent sources) and false consensus (conclusions drawn from one primary source) when making judgments from information <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ransom et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Yousif et al., 2019)</ref>, and that people are often similarly influenced by hearing information multiple times from one source or for many sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pillai &amp; Fazio, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Weaver et al., 2007)</ref>. In short, we find that people's perceptions of others' beliefs and knowledge are reliably influenced by mere repetition -even in the absence of any diagnostic social cues associated with these exposures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Potential Mechanisms</head><p>We expected that repetition would facilitate perceptions of consensus through two mechanisms. First, repetition increases processing fluency, which is then used as a heuristic cue to estimate consensus (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Schwarz &amp; Jalbert, 2020;</ref>. Second, repetition increases an individual's own belief in the information (i.e., an illusory truth effect), and people draw on their own knowledge to make estimates about what others know <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Nelson et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Todd &amp; Tamir, 2024)</ref>. Individuals' judgments are likely to be informed to some degree through both of these paths, and we view them to be highly interconnected. As discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Birch et al. (2017)</ref>, the effects of knowledge and processing fluency are likely to be confounded in most real-world situations (e.g., exposure to information increases both knowledge and processing fluency), making the specific impact of each difficult to disentangle. In addition, we expect the degree to which participants rely on each of these pathways are likely to depend on the specifics of the context (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nelson et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Thomas &amp; Jacoby, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tullis, 2018</ref> for relevant discussions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>Our findings broadly speak to how an individual's unique information environment may shape their perceptions of the state of knowledge and beliefs of those around them. On the one hand, repeated exposure to credible information can increase judgments of its consensus -a reassuring finding given that repeated exposure is often a valid cue for consensus (see <ref type="bibr">Reber &amp;</ref> Unkelbach, 2010 for a similar argument regarding repetition and truth). Thus, in situations where it is important for individuals to know or follow credible information -as in public health campaigns and science communication -organizations may benefit from prioritizing repeating this information to communicate its broader acceptance. On the other hand, our findings are concerning when considering contexts where individuals are likely to be repeatedly exposed to false, problematic, or controversial information that is not representative of true consensus views. On social media, for instance, a small number of vocal users with extreme views may drive attention and engagement, despite being unrepresentative of the majority view <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Robertson et al., 2024)</ref>. Relatedly, news coverage may skew perceptions of the consensus around topics such as climate change by providing equal coverage to non-consensus and consensus views <ref type="bibr">(Immundo &amp; Rapp, 2022)</ref>. These are contexts that may benefit from adjusting the flow of information itself (i.e., through the removal or deprioritization of repeated false content) or from the application of interventions aimed at correcting any resulting misperceptions (for an example of one such possible intervention, see Immundo &amp; Rapp, 2022 on weight-of-evidence statements).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>As these were initial investigations of this illusory consensus effect, there are some constraints on generalizability to consider. First, we only tested the impact of a singular repetition and type of stimuli (trivia claims). We do not yet know how multiple exposures to statements may affect perceptions of consensus, though one possibility is that, similar to the effects of repetition on belief, they do so in a logarithmic manner, with later exposures increasing belief less than earlier exposures <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fazio et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hassan &amp; Barber, 2021)</ref>. We also do not yet know whether repetition increases perceptions of consensus around other types of claims besides news (e.g., health claims, political news), but it seems plausible that these effects would replicate in other contexts for similar reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pillai &amp; Fazio, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The effect of repetition may also depend on the target group of the consensus estimate.</p><p>For example, we initially speculated that repetition may be more likely to affect consensus estimates for similar others, for whom one's own knowledge is more diagnostic (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nelson et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Todd &amp; Tamir, 2024)</ref>. In our studies, we did not find that the effects of repetition were moderated by our measures of identification with or perceived similarity to Americans, the target group of our judgments. However, like with our other individual difference measures, these analyses were exploratory and we did not power our studies to this interaction.</p><p>It would also be valuable to further explore how the effects of repetition on consensus play out in polarized news media environments where individuals are selectively exposed to information that is consistent with their own political affiliations. Shedding light on these processes, recent research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beattie and Beattie (2023)</ref> found that people tend to overestimate how familiar people on the other side of the political spectrum are with stories from their own preferred news sources, potentially contributing to affective political polarization because the other side "should know better". An additional consideration is whether the coverage of extreme views held by a few counter-partisans could lead to perceptions that those views are more commonly held by all counter-partisans, contributing further to this perceived divide.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The results of our two studies provide compelling evidence that the mere repetition of information is sufficient to increase judgments of how many others would believe it or currently know it -an "illusory consensus effect". Simply hearing a statement, even when it is not attributed to a particular source or context, increases perceptions of its consensus.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Cohen's d that uses Hedges' correction for small sample sizes.Consistent with our hypothesis, we found a significant effect of repetition on perceived consensus in both Experiments. In Experiment 1, participants judged that more Americans would believe claims that had been repeated (M = 6.65, SD = 1.07) compared to claims that were newREPETITION AND ILLUSORY CONSENSUS 13 (M = 6.17, SD = 0.96), mean difference = 0.48, 95% CI [0.36, 0.60], t (100) = 8.06, p &lt; .001, d = 0.80 95% CI [0.57, 1.02]. In Experiment 2, participants judged that more Americans knew information that had been repeated (M = 4.39, SD = 1.28) compared to new information (M = 4.09, SD = 1.21), mean difference = 0.31, 95% CI [0.22, 0.39], t (99) = 6.65, p &lt; .001, d = 0.66, 95% CI [0.44, 0.87]. Plots showing the range of mean consensus ratings for new and repeated claims in Experiments 1 and 2 can be seen in Figure 2 and Figure 3, and an additional visualization of this data can be found in the supplementary materials.</figDesc></figure>
