			<abstract>
				<p>Could a simple rule of thumb help to find the truth? People struggle with integrating many putative cues to deception into an accurate veracity judgement. Heuristics simplify difficult decisions by ignoring most of the information and relying instead only on a few but highly diagnostic cues (&apos;Use the best, ignore the rest&apos;). We examined whether people would be able to tell lie from truth when instructed to make decisions based on a single, diagnostic cue (verifiability and richness in detail). We show that these simple judgements by lay people allowed to discriminate dishonest from honest statements. These judgements performed at or above state-of-the-art, resource-intensive content analysis by trained coders. For a tech-and training-free approach, heuristics were surprisingly accurate, and hold promise for practice. General: We thank Abdoullah El Feddali and Vittoria Giannelli for their help with the Pilot Study.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One-Sentence Summary (current: 115 characters; max 125 characters): When relying on a single diagnostic cue to deception and ignoring all other cues, lay people's judgements allowed to tell lie from truth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main text (current: 986 words; max 2500 words):</head><p>Medical doctors, criminal court judges, HR consultants and stockbrokers all face a similar challenge: they need to make complex decisions in the face of substantial and often conflicting information -surgery or medication, guilty or innocent, hire or reject, buy or sell.</p><p>One way of dealing with an information overload is to simply ignore most of it <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. Consider a medical doctor who needs to decide whether a heart attack patient is best off with a regular nursing bed or the intensive care unit. Instead of considering all patient variables and medical test results, in order to be able to act promptly, the doctor may (need to) rely only on a few good cues. Such heuristics are not only efficient but can be surprisingly accurate as well. For classifying a heart attack patient, a simple decision tree with just three criteria outperformed algorithms that combined many parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Similarly -using just two criteria -age and criminal record -allowed to predict the risk of criminal recidivism with the same accuracy as an algorithm that combined 137 criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. And a large-scale study on predicting life outcomes showed that complex computational models did not fare better than domain expert judgments based on just four variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Sometimes, less is more.</p><p>One of the domains this 'less is more' principle may apply to is the difficulty lay people and experts face in telling lie from truth. Yet, being able to make a correct lie-truth judgment touches many areas of personal life (e.g., white lies in relationships), society (e.g., telling misinformation from actual evidence) and even the foundation of legal practice (e.g., detecting false testimonies and false confessions). The amount of information from which veracity judgements can be derived is vast. When 138 police officers were surveyed about what could be good cues for lie detection, they mentioned 655 cues altogether <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. A meta-analysis mapping how predictive verbal and non-verbal behaviors are for deception, included no fewer than 158 cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Most of these cues are not or only weakly related to deception, further adding to the complexity of veracity judgements. Unsurprisingly, when making veracity judgement, people struggle with integrating the different cues into a single veracity judgement, and perform at the chance level <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Instead of considering all cues, the better strategy may be a simple heuristic: use-the-best (and ignore-the-rest) (1). Here, we introduce the use-the-best (and ignore-the-rest) heuristic to deception detection. Theory and meta-analytic reviews suggest that, when people describe an experienced event, richness in detail and verifiability are valid cues to deception <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>. Could simple heuristics using only detailedness or verifiability allow ordinary people to tell lie from truth?</p><p>In a pilot (Study1), we found that considering a single, diagnostic cue (verifiability) allowed for accurate lie-truth discrimination. More so than when participants could consider any possible cues (veracity judgement), see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The pilot inspired us to conduct three preregistered follow-up studies.</p><p>In Study2, participants evaluated alibi statements in which undergraduates -honestly or dishonestly -described their campus activities of the last 15 minutes. Truth tellers had just engaged in regular campus activities (e.g., call a friend, drink coffee), whereas liars had actually committed a mock crime: they had stolen an exam but falsely claimed innocent to have been doing campus activities. Two groups of crowdsourced participants evaluated only a single cue -either verifiability or richness in detail. The accuracy of their judgements was surprisingly high, confirming the use-the-best, ignore-the-rest heuristic applies to deception detection (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>To replicate whether use-the-best judgements outperforms judgements that allow taking all possible cues into account we repeated study2 with twice the sample size to make sure we had sufficient statistical power (9; Study3). Again, we found the use-the-best heuristic to be surprisingly accurate (Cohen's dverifiability = 1.23, Cohen's ddetailedness = 1.15), now also clearly outperforming the veracity judgements that allowed considering any possible cues (ddeception = -0.10). Moreover, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows that the heuristics do better than the counting of details by trained coders -the manual procedure prevalent in research and practice that is much more recourse intensive.</p><p>To get an impression of classification accuracy, we used the average judgement for each of the 64 statements, for each judgement method, to predict statement veracity. The ROC analysis plots sensitivity against specificity and provides a measure of diagnostic value across all possible cut-off points. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, classification accuracy (expressed as ROC a, ranging from the chance level of 0.50 to 1.00, perfect classification) was above chance for judgments relying on a single cue (0.71 ≤ ROC a ≤ 0.75; with the lower bound of the confidence intervals exceeding 0.50), but at chance level for veracity judgements that allowed considering any possible cues (0.51 ≤ ROC a ≤ 0.61; with the 95% confidence intervals including 0.50). Using Youden 's J (11), we identified the optimal cut-off point when equally balancing specificity and sensitivity. We used independent validation, the strictest method to avoid data overfitting. Hence, we used the data of Study2 to evaluate classification accuracy based on the optimal cut-off derived in Study3 (and vice versa). Accuracy was poor for veracity judgements (50-52%), but moderate (65-70%) for the single cue judgements, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>In Studies 1 to 3, Dutch-speaking participants evaluated written Dutch statements. To avoid our findings would be specific to a single language or mode of production, we conducted a fourth study in which German-speaking participants evaluated interview transcripts in German, either on deception or on richness in detail. Again, participants struggled to tell lie from truth even though they could consider all possible cues to deception. But when judging only a single-cue -and these judgements took on average only a minute -significant and large differences emerged between deceptive and honest interview transcripts.</p><p>When people could consider all possible cues to deception, they performed at chance level. This shows again just how challenging veracity judgements are. When people were instructed to consider only a single diagnostic cue, they could tell a lie from a truth. These judgements were quick and did not require any technology, practice, or training. Moreover, their accuracy was at or above that of the far more complex content-content coding of the statement. The current findings suggest a simple solution to a complex problem: a simple rule of thumb may help to find the truth.</p></div>

Participants received course credits for partaking in the study and the most accurate participant received a 20,-euro bonus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>After providing online informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to the deception judgement or the verifiability judgement condition through Qualtrics. In both conditions, the participants were asked to evaluate 16 alibi statements, presented one by one, in a random order. In the verifiability judgement condition there was no mentioning of deception or lie detection.</p><p>Judging deception, participants were asked to evaluate "How truthful is this statement?", on a scale from "totally deceitful" (-100) to "totally truthful" (+100), explaining that "A truthful statement is a statement that is true, honest and adheres to the fact of the situation". Judging verifiability, participants were asked to evaluate "How verifiable is this statement?", on a scale from "totally unverifiable" (-100) to "totally verifiable" (+100), explaining that "Verifiable activities are activities that are recorded (e.g. a security camera), documented (e.g. payment with a debit card or using a smartphone) or an activity with an identifiable witness present". This definition arose from the Verifiability Approach (10), but we simplified it to its essence for our purpose.</p><p>An attention check was embedded among the statements. It looked like another alibi statement but instructed participants to ignore the provided statement and instead answer -47 on the scale. After rating the (real and bogus) statements, a manipulation check asked participants about the basis for the judgments (indicate up to 3 out of the 11 cues from the list they used most as the basis of their judgement; with 3 cues referring to verifiability), a single item asked about motivation to accurately judge the statements (from -100 to +100), and finally participants were asked to provide age, gender, and mother tongue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>We used 64 alibi statements (32 truthful, 32 deceptive). To avoid item-effects, we created 4 sets of 16 statements (each containing 8 truthful and 8 deceptive statements), and participants were randomly assigned to receive one of the sets. The statements were selected from 72 statements obtained in a mock crime study where participants provided a handwritten statement on their whereabouts on campus in the last 15 minutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>. Participants either truthfully described their activities, or they lied. The lying participants had just enacted the mock theft of an exam but pretended to have been on campus as a regular student. These 1 Cohen´s d is the standardized mean lie-truth difference. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The Bayes Factor BF01 expresses how much more likely the data are under the null hypothesis of no lie-truth difference than under the alternative hypothesis of a lie-truth difference. BF10 is the inverse of BF01. We report BF10 when the data were more likely under the alternative hypothesis than under the null hypothesis.</p><p>The manipulation check showed that participants made judgements according to their instructions: Participants judging verifiability more often listed cues related to verifiability as the basis of their judgement (M = 1.75; SD = 0.64) than participants judging deception (M = 0.68; SD = 0.75), t(37) = 4.78, p &lt; .001, d = 1.53, (95% CI: 0.81; 2.24), BF10 = 669.50.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study2 and Study3</head><p>Ethics approval, data, materials, and analytic scripts of Study2 and Study3 can be found on https://osf.io/z26ar/. Moving from the exploratory stages of research to confirmation, we preregistered our hypotheses, analysis plan, and predictions, see also https://osf.io/z26ar/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>There were a number of minor changes to Study1 procedure. There were now 3 conditions: Judging deception or making snap judgements based on either verifiability or detailedness. Also, we moved from locally recruited undergraduates to online crowdsourcing </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirmatory Analyses</head><p>Study2. Lie-truth differences when judging deception were small, d = 0.39 (95% CI: 0.02; 0.76), and lacked evidential value, BF10 = 1.40, but were just statistically significant, t(29) = 2.14, p = 0.041 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1</ref>). In contrast, lie-truth differences when judging verifiability were  22. Lie-truth differences when judging deception were small and non-significant, t(76) = 0.86, p = 0.394, d = 0.10 (95% CI: -0.13; 0.32), BF01 = 5.60 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, lie-truth differences when judging verifiability were again significant and large, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional analyses</head><p>Because these analyses are highly similar for Study 2 and 3 (that used the same procedure), we aggregated the data of Study 2 and 3 (n = 338; results for each study separately can be found on https://osf.io/z26ar/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirmatory additional analyses.</head><p>As Another way to examine what cues judges relied on, is to correlate their judgments with the content coding of trained coders. This correlational analysis also shows that people based their judgments on the cues they were instructed to use, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>To examine agreement between judges, we calculated the ICC (Average Measure) per judgement method 4 . Since different judges rated different sets of statements, we calculated the ICC separately for each set of statements. We set negative ICCs to zero (1 out of 42 ICCs;</p><p>occurring for deception judgements in Study4) (12). In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>, we report the ICC averaged across the sets of statements. Following interpretative guidelines (12), agreement between judges can be considered to be poor when judging deception, but strong when judging verifiability or richness in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robustness Analyses</head><p>Exclusion criteria were preregistered and served to assure that participants paid attention to each statement. But our findings do not hinge on the exclusion criteria. When not excluding any participant, the critical Judgment Method by Statement Veracity was significant for the  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) shows that the benefits of single-cue judgements do not hinge on a specific set of stimuli.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ROC Analyses</head><p>For each judgement method, we used the average statement judgement to predict statement veracity. The ROC analysis plots sensitivity against specificity and provides a measure of diagnostic value across all possible cut-off points. The area under the ROC curve varies from 0 to 1 (=perfect classification), with .50 denoting the chance level. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, classification accuracy was above chance for judgments relying on a single cue (either verifiability or richness in detail), but at chance level for deception judgements.</p><p>Using Youden J, we also identify the optimal cut-off point when equally balancing specificity and sensitivity. We used independent validation, the strictest method to avoid data overfitting. Hence, we used the data of Study2 to evaluate classification accuracy based on the optimal cut-off derived in Study3 (and vice versa). Accuracy was poor for veracity judgements, and moderate for the single cue judgements, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.  to restrict loss of power). The last two columns show lie-truth differences obtained for contentcoding by trained coders.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>After providing informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to the deception judgement or richness in detail judgement condition through Qualtrics. In both conditions,</p><p>participants were asked to evaluate 13 transcripts (including one bogus transcript used as an attention check, but excluded from main analyses), presented one by one, in a random order.</p><p>Instructions for the judgements were the same as for Studies 1 to 3.</p><p>5 To limit the required number of judges, we did not consider verifiability in Study4.</p><p>The first attention check concerned the bogus transcript, which looked like just another transcript, but with the instruction to ignore the transcript and instead answer -47 on the scale.</p><p>The second attention check was a surprise recall test after the last transcript, asking to select a unique utterance (e.g., 'forgot the name of the girl I was looking for') in the last transcript from 6 options. Thereafter, participants rated motivation and difficulty, and were asked to list, oneby-one, the cues they had relied on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>We used 72 transcripts (half truthful, half deceptive). To avoid item-effects, we created 6 sets of 12 transcripts 6 , and participants were randomly assigned to receive one of the 6 sets.</p><p>The statements were selected from (13). Participants in that study were native-German speaking undergraduates who were interviewed about the two tasks they claimed to have been doing in the past half hour. Statements were later transcribed verbatim. We selected the transcripts from participants who had been instructed to consistently lie or tell the truth (i.e., the lie-lie and truthtruth conditions), and used only the 'Find Michelle at the bus stop' task. This task entailed leaving the lab, crossing the campus to the bus stop, try to find a girl named Michelle (of whom they received a photo), make notes of arriving and leaving buses and returning to the lab within 35 minutes. From the structured interview, we selected only the first response to the interviewer´s instruction to describe the task as accurately and in as much detail as possible.</p><p>We edited the transcripts to correct for spelling errors, but we retained all utterances (e.g., 'Ehm'). Content-coding of the entire transcripts by trained coders (13) showed that the 36 truthful transcripts (M = 38.06; SD = 15.36) contained more details than the 36 deceptive transcripts (M = 25.72; SD = 9.66), d = 0.96 (95% CI: 0.47; 1.45) 7 , see also </p></div>

I was in doubt about what to do (stood still for a moment). Then I walked into the corridor of G, saw a cleaner/guy with a cart and read something about using lockers at the UvA. Then I walked to the outside entrance and walked around (back of G) and looked at the kind of butterflies that are now there for the light festival. So then walked further around G. Went back inside (second floor lab) and looked for a moment at university pabo, there is a poster next to the door about participating in brain research for money. When I had read that I walked quietly to this research room.' Non-Confirmatory analyses The 2 (Judgement Method: Deception vs Verifiability, between-subjects) x 2 (Veracity: Truthful vs Deceptive, within-subjects) mixed ANOVA on the participant's judgment showed the predicted interaction effect between Judgment Method and Veracity, F(1, 37) = 8.43, p = .006, η²p = .19 (Figure 1). To follow-up on the interaction, we conducted a paired sample t test contrasting judgements for truthful and deceptive statements within each judgement method. (Lie-truth differences when judging deception were small and non-significant, t(18) = 0.45, p = 0.660, d = 0.10 (95% CI: -0.35; 0.55) 1 , BF01 = 3.85 2 . In contrast, lie-truth differences when judging verifiability were significant and large, t(19) = 4.00, p &lt; .001, d = 0.89, (95% CI: 0.36; 1.41), BF10 = 45.65.
