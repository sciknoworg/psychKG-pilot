				<p>Prosocial behavior fundamentally involves trading off costs to the self against rewards to the other. • Using a modified intertemporal choice task, we found that children chose to maximize reward (stickers), minimize opportunity cost (delay), and traded off between the two. • Children invested more time towards earning stickers for themselves, versus for another child. • Children&apos;s tradeoffs in both otherand self-benefitting decisions followed a hyperbolic discounting function, qualitatively similar to those observed in human adults and non-human animals.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Humans care about the welfare of others: We punish those who treat us or third parties poorly, make fair allocations of resources and expect others to do the same, and donate our money, time, and energy to help others with no expectation that the favor will be returned in kind. When engaging in these behaviors, we face the task of representing and comparing others' welfare against our own <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Axelrod &amp; Hamilton, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buckholtz, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Crockett, Kurth-Nelson, Siegel, Dayan, &amp; Dolan, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Delton &amp; Robertson, 2016)</ref>. Here, we focus on helping-costly behaviors that deliver benefits to others-and investigate its origins in childhood. In deciding whether and how to help others, we have to consider the effort required to help, whether this effort is worth the reward, and whether the recipient of these rewards needs and deserves our generosity. What are the origins of these capacities? Do we begin as rational altruists, trading off our costs against others' rewards, or do we learn to do so gradually, over years of interacting with and learning from others? Developmental research demonstrates that the motivational and cognitive resources supporting cooperation emerge early. Children help others complete their goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Eisenberg, Spinrad, &amp; Morris, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hepach, Vaish, Grossmann, &amp; Tomasello, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tomasello &amp; Vaish, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Vaish, Carpenter, &amp; Tomasello, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Warneken, 2016)</ref>, understand social norms like fairness <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fehr, Bernhard, &amp; Rockenbach, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kanngiesser &amp; Warneken, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">McAuliffe, Blake, Steinbeis, &amp; Warneken, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Sloane, Baillargeon, &amp; Premack, 2012)</ref> and are willing to pay a personal cost in order to help and share <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(McAuliffe et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Warneken, Hare, Melis, Hanus, &amp; Tomasello, 2007)</ref>. This vast literature demonstrates that our impulse to cooperate is at the core of our social development. What are the computational resources that support these abilities?</p><p>Here, we build on proposals that children's prosocial behavior is best thought of as a decisionmaking process <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bridgers, Jara-Ettinger, &amp; Gweon, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sommerville et al., 2018)</ref>: one which integrates information about the cost of actions, the rewards they generate, and the social value of the other.</p><p>Previous research provides evidence that the building blocks of reward-and cost-sensitive decision making emerge early in development: Infants and young children tend to pursue the shortest path to a goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Paulus &amp; Sodian, 2015)</ref>, search a location that has more rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Feigenson, Carey, &amp; Hauser, 2002)</ref>, plan reaches in accord with how much effort their actions will require <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Upshaw &amp; Sommerville, 2015)</ref>, are more willing to help when less physical effort is required <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sommerville et al., 2018)</ref>, and are more likely to teach other people things that are high in reward and difficult to learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bridgers et al., 2016)</ref>. Children are also sensitive to temporal delay as a cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kidd, Palmeri, &amp; Aslin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mischel, Shoda, &amp; Rodriguez, 1989</ref>), suggesting that they consider not only physical effort, but also opportunity cost (the loss of time available to pursue other rewards), in their action planning. Furthermore, children's own ability to delay rewards has been shown to predict their tendencies to engage in costly sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Garon, Johnson, &amp; Steeves, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Thompson, Barresi, &amp; Moore, 1997)</ref>, suggesting that children's own action planning is related to their prosocial behavior. Lastly, children adjust their cooperative strategies based on who benefits from their actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dunfield &amp; Kuhlmeier, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Engelmann, Over, Herrmann, &amp; Tomasello, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Moore, 2009)</ref>, suggesting that they also take social value into account when deciding whom to benefit.</p><p>The above research, conducted in children across different age groups and using different tasks, show that as soon as children are able to plan actions in the world, they plan over variables like cost and reward to cooperate with and help others. Here, we present a case study within this framework, and ask how and whether children trade off between delay and reward. Studies of human adults reveal tradeoffs between these factors in both prosocial and self-serving decisions: People adjust the value of monetary rewards based on its temporal delay in self-serving decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berns, Laibson, &amp; Loewenstein, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Laibson, 1997)</ref> and trade off rewards delivered to another person against how socially distant that other person is <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Delton &amp; Robertson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jones &amp; Rachlin, 2006)</ref>. What function ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) expresses children's discounting strategies, both when they work to benefit themselves and others?</p><p>This question has been extensively studied in human adults (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Berns et al., 2007)</ref> and non-human animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kacelnik &amp; Marsh, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazur &amp; Biondi, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rosati, Stevens, Hare, &amp; Hauser, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Santos &amp; Rosati, 2015)</ref>. Specifically, two functions have been proposed to describe the tradeoff between reward and delay: hyperbolic (Eq. 1) and exponential discounting (Eq. 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>= 1+</head><p>(1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= − (2)</formula><p>In the above equations, V refers to subjective value, A to reward, D to delay, and k to an individual's discounting factor. Specifically, k describes how steeply a person trades off reward against delay:</p><p>Individuals who are less patient are thought to measure higher on this parameter. The key distinction between hyperbolic and exponential discounting is that exponential discounting assumes time-consistent preferences. Unde exponential discounting, the difference in subjective value of a reward between now versus next week is the same as the difference in value between 52 and 53 weeks from now, whereas under hyperbolic discounting, the former difference is greater than the latter. Many past studies ask which of these functions best describes the mechanisms of temporal discounting, and consensus from behavioral economics is that hyperbolic discounting provides a better fit to people's decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berns et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Green, Fristoe, &amp; Myerson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Laibson, 1997)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Present Research</head><p>In summary, previous research suggests that children are adept action planners and precocious cooperators, but no research to date provides a systematic analysis of the mechanisms underlying selfand other-benefitting choices in young children. To investigate these questions, we chose to study children at an age where they demonstrate some patience under delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kidd et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mischel et al., 1989</ref>) and robust prosocial behavior (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Warneken 2016)</ref>. We developed a series of tasks that aimed to assess whether children (1) choose to minimize delay and maximize reward and (2) trade off between these two factors in both self-serving and prosocial decisions. Based on the evidence reviewed above, we predicted that children would be rational deciders --minimizing delay, maximizing reward, and trading off delay against reward, regardless of whether their actions benefited themselves or someone else. Furthermore, we predicted that children would invest more time towards their own rewards. Lastly, our study design allows us to make inferences about the functions that describe children's discounting behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Participants. N = 32 five-year-old children (M = 5.56 years, range = 5.03-5.98, 16 girls) were recruited and included in our final sample. Sample size was determined through a simulation power analysis on the effect of delay on discounting decisions from a pilot experiment (alpha = .05, two-tailed, desired power = .8). Four additional children were tested, excluded, and replaced due to experimenter error. Recruitment and experimental procedures were approved by the Committee on the Use of Human Subjects at Harvard University.</p><p>Materials. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the setup of the experiment: one central table, where decisions were made; 2 payoff tables, where children waited for rewards; and a toy, which incentivized children to view delay as an opportunity cost. One payoff table was consistently associated with lower delays and rewards, side and color counterbalanced across children, and the tables were marked with blue and yellow signs to help children remember which was which. On every trial, cards displaying the delays associated with each decision were placed on each corner of the decision table, and sticker rewards were placed at the payoff tables. To encourage children to view the delays of the game as costly (a methodological challenge we encountered during piloting), we introduced two toys that children could play with after they completed (1) Delay and Reward decisions, and (2) Discounting decisions. Cards with 0 to 18 squares indicated the delays of each option, where each square represented a five-second delay. A stopwatch was used by the experimenter to keep track of delays. Children rated various aspects of the game (e.g. stickers, waiting) on a seven-point Likert scale ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig S2)</ref>. Children deposited all rewards earned during the game into a box at the decision table.</p><p>Design. We randomly assigned children to earn sticker rewards for themselves (self condition) or for another participant (other condition). The experiment featured 3 kinds of decisions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>): Delay decisions, which hold reward constant, Reward decisions, which hold delay constant, and Discounting decisions, which vary delay across a constant ratio of rewards. Children engaged in 4 Delay decisions,</p><p>where they chose to earn 1 sticker after no delay or after {2, 4, 6, 8} five-second units of delay, 4 Reward decisions, where they chose to earn 0 or {1, 2, 3, 4} stickers with no delay, and 10 Discounting decisions, where they chose to earn 1 sticker after no delay or 2 stickers after {0, 2, 4 … 18} five-second units of delay. These delays, though far shorter than those from experiments testing decisions in human adults, allowed us to test children across many trials, using real, experienced delays rather than hypothetical ones. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>.</p><p>We counterbalanced whether the Reward or Delay decisions came first, which Next, children received an endowment of stickers in a paper bag. Children learned that these stickers were earned for them by a previous participant, and were told that in the current game, they will earn additional stickers for themselves (self condition) or for another child "just like you, who also likes stickers," coming at some other time to play the game (other condition). Children were naive to how many stickers were in their endowment until after the experiment.</p><p>Then, children were introduced to the study setup, where they could choose to wait some length of time, for some number of stickers, for either themselves or another child. To convey different amounts to delay to children, the experimenter showed the child a card corresponding to each option, where one square on the card referred to a 5-second delay. For instance, children saw a card with 4 blue squares on a particular trial and learned that "at the blue table, you'll have to wait 4 times [20 seconds] before you can take the stickers from the blue table and put them into the box...". To familiarize children to the full range of delays in the experiment, children were also asked to wait the minimum and maximum delay (0 and 90 seconds, respectively).</p><p>On every decision trial, children chose to sit at one of the two payoff tables in order to earn the stickers at that table. The experimenter timed the delay using a stopwatch told children that waiting is a "quiet part of the game". If children spoke during delays, the experimenter reminded them of the rules.</p><p>After completing the delay, children deposited the stickers from that trial in a box, and returned to the central table. If children chose an option with no delay, the stickers were available as soon as they sat down. A secondary experimenter then replaced the stickers and cards for the next trial, and the experiment continued.</p><p>Children made 4 Delay decisions (holding reward constant) and 4 Reward decisions (holding delay constant). Children then rated the delays and rewards in the game and answered comprehension questions about the setup of the Discounting decisions: (1) which table always has more and which table always has less stickers (probing their reward discrimination), (2) which table always requires more and which table requires less waiting (probing their delay discrimination), and (3) who the stickers were for:</p><p>themselves or the next participant. In the other condition, we also asked (4) whether the next participant was real or pretend. The experimenter provided corrective feedback to all questions. Children then made 10 Discounting decisions: choices between earning 1 sticker now, or 2 stickers after a delay.</p><p>At the end of the experiment, children were asked to explain their decision-making strategy ("How did you decide which table to choose in this game?"). Responses were coded for mention of the delay (e.g. "I didn't like waiting") and rewards (e.g. "I wanted to get more stickers"). Ambiguous responses (e.g. "This one has more and this one has less") were coded conservatively as mentioning neither delay nor reward. At the end of the session, children in the other condition passed on all of their earned stickers to the next participant, and children in the self condition were asked to donate 6 stickers to the next participant. These endowments were then passed forward within conditions to ensure that all subsequent participants started out with some reward, regardless of assignment to condition.</p><p>Data Coding and Analysis. All responses were coded online, except for children's explanations, which were transcribed and coded offline from video. All decisions including minor experimenter error (1 Delay decision, 2 Reward decisions, and 1 Likert rating of a toy) were conservatively excluded from the analyses. To assess the reliability of all measures, videos from decisions and explanations in 25% of the sessions were randomly selected, cut to remove all information about assignment to condition, and recoded by an additional researcher who was naïve to the hypotheses of the experiment. The coders agreed on 100% of responses.

What variables explain children's discounting behavior? We tested whether children's valuation of the delays and rewards in the experiment (measured by their Likert ratings of stickers and waiting) and their reported strategies (measured by verbal explanations of their decision-making process) explain variance in their discounting behavior. However, these measures were generally not predictive of children's discounting decisions above and beyond the subjective value of the rewards and who these rewards were for. The only positive finding from this analysis revealed that children who reported thinking about the stickers during their decisions (e.g. "Because the blue table has more stickers than the yellow table", "Because I just wanted more stickers") were more likely to choose the higher, delayed reward, <ref type="bibr">[0.277,</ref><ref type="bibr">3.353],</ref><ref type="bibr">B=1.728,</ref><ref type="bibr">SE=0.741,</ref><ref type="bibr">p=.020,</ref><ref type="bibr">OR=5.628</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Human cooperation is supported by early-emerging motivations to deliver benefits to others at costs to the self. We used an intertemporal choice task to investigate the cognitive mechanisms that support these tradeoffs in childhood. We found that children sought to minimize delay, maximize reward, and traded off between delay and reward during both self-and other-benefitting decisions. We also found that children were less willing invest time if someone else's stickers were at stake, suggesting that they trade off reward against delay more steeply for prosocial than self-serving decisions. Lastly, we found that like human adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berns et al., 2007)</ref> and non-human animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kacelnik &amp; Marsh, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazur &amp; Biondi, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rosati et al., 2007)</ref>, children's discounting strategies were captured by a hyperbolic function on the delay of this reward that expresses its subjective value. These results build on past work</p><p>showing that our abilities to plan and cooperate emerge in early childhood, and contribute a mechanistic proposal for how costs and rewards are integrated in children's selfand other-benefitting decisions.</p><p>This research raises questions about the fundamental mechanisms of prosocial behavior. First, our results do not reveal whether children shifted their valuation of reward, delay, or both, when making selfversus other-benefiting choices. Although we did not observe a relationship between children's Likert ratings of reward and delay and their discounting behavior, it is possible that other measures of value may help to clarify the computations that supported children's decisions. We also do not claim that hyperbolic discounting provides a perfect and complete explanation for children's decisions. Our findings suggest that hyperbolic discounting provides a better fit to the data relative to other functions, and future studies can enrich our understanding of the quantitative tradeoffs underlying children's decision-making.</p><p>Next, our case study does not address the question of how children discount reward by social value, or how much they value other people's utilities relative to our own. Research in human adults suggests that we discount others' rewards by their social value <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Albrecht, Volz, Sutter, Laibson, &amp; von Cramon, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Delton &amp; Robertson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jones &amp; Rachlin, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Strombach et al., 2015)</ref>, and developmental work can further investigate how children integrate social and temporal distance in their prosocial decisions.</p><p>More generally, his work supports the possibility that from an early age, patience is not only a growing resource <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Atance &amp; Jackson, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Green, Fry, &amp; Myerson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Harbaugh, Krause, &amp; Berry, 2001</ref>) but also one that is strategically deployed based on context <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kidd et al., 2013)</ref>. Further studies of the flexibility of intertemporal choice, and prosocial decision-making more broadly, can reveal how we come to represent time as a precious resource and delay as a cost. While we suggest that children's representation of value over time follows a hyperbolic function, our study leaves open whether other kinds of cost, like physical or mental effort, would trade off against reward in the same way.</p><p>Finally, these results leave open the origins and development of this mechanism. Are the decision-making processes recruited by infants and toddlers in previous studies of prosocial behavior the same ones used by children in this task? How do culture and circumstance shape these mechanisms?</p><p>Studies charting this task space across different populations and across development can clarify the development of the competencies that these tasks are meant to measure. Overall, these results demonstrate that by early childhood, children recruit a decision-making process for both self-serving and prosocial action that integrates many sources of information. Children appear to engage in rational altruism, a process that is supported by early-emerging motivations to benefit others at a cost to the self, and tradeoffs between how much good they can generate, and at what cost.  After the child makes a choice, she sits at either <ref type="table">Table 1 or Table 2</ref>, waits the amount of delay associated with that table, and then places the stickers earned at that table in a box to take home. All choices were made under an opportunity cost: a fun toy was displayed between Tables 1 and 2, which the child could play with only after finishing the experiment.  Children's choices for a higher, delayed reward over a smaller, immediate reward, across length of delay from 0 to 18 five-second units (0 to 90 seconds) across the other and self conditions (total N = 320 decisions), fit using a binomial smoothing function. Individual choices are plotted in black with random jitter. Raw proportions are plotted as grey bars. Ribbon indicates 95% confidence interval. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Summary of full model for predicting discounting behavior (0 = 1 sticker now, 1 = 2 stickers after a delay). All continuous variables were centered.

Before each decision, children were reminded that they had to choose one of the options presented before eventually gaining access to the toy.
