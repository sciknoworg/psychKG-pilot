			<abstract>
				<p>Reflective reasoning often correlates with certain philosophical decisions, but it is often unclear whether reflection causes those decisions. So a pre-registered experiment assessed how reflective thinking relates to decisions about 10 thought experiments from epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of mind. Participants from the United States were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, CloudResearch, Prolific, and a university. One participant source yielded up to 18 times as many low-quality respondents as the other three. Among remaining respondents, some prior correlations between reflective and philosophical thinking replicated. For example, reflection predicted denying that accidentally justified true beliefs count as knowledge. However, reflection test order did not impact philosophical decisions. Instead, a philosophical reflection effect emerged: making philosophical decisions before the reflection test improved reflection test performance. These and other data suggest causal paths between reflection and philosophy can go both directions, but detecting such results can depend on factors such as data quality.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>How are philosophical thinking and reflective thinking related? Certain philosophical decisions have correlated with performance on tests of reflective thinking, but are those correlations causal? If so, do the reflection tests cause changes in philosophical thinking, or is it the other way around? More than a decade of quantitative research finds mixed results as well as surprisingly low data quality from some online research participant pools. So a pre-registered experiment on reflective and philosophical thinking that employed various measures of data quality recruited online participants from four common sources. Low quality participants were not equally distributed across pools. In the aggregate sample of acceptable data, some prior results failed to replicate, and an unexpected causal effect emerged. These results confirm the importance of participant source, data quality, and sample size -they also suggest a mechanism by which studying philosophy can improve critical thinking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Reflection Tests</head><p>Reflection tests are tasks designed to lure people toward a particular, intuitively appealing response that -with a moment's reflection -they can realize is incorrect <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Byrd 2023a)</ref>. For example, 'If you were running a race, and you passed the person in 2nd place, what place would you be in now?' <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sirota et al. 2020)</ref>. This lures many people to think '1st place', but people who reconsider their initial response and/or consciously consider reasons are far more likely to realize the answer is actually '2nd place' <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Byrd et al. 2023</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Reflection &amp; Philosophy</head><p>Philosophers often perform better on reflection tests (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Livengood et al. 2010)</ref>. And reflective thinking often correlates with certain philosophical decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Byrd 2021)</ref>, even among philosophers (e.g., Byrd 2023b). Consider thought experiments that assess whether we think that accidentally justified true belief counts as knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gettier 1963</ref>) -a famous version of this case asks whether someone knows what time it is if they formed a true belief about the time on the basis of a clock that, unbeknownst to them, is broken <ref type="bibr">(Russell 1948, 170)</ref>. Philosophers' orthodox response seems to be 'no' <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bourget and Chalmers 2023)</ref>; and across 24 countries and 17 languages, correct reflection test responses predicted that orthodox response <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Machery et al. 2017)</ref>. Reflection test performance has also correlated with decisions about moral dilemmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Byrd and Conway 2019)</ref>, political priorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Byrd and Białek 2021)</ref>, and religious apostasy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Byrd, Stich, and Sytsma 2025)</ref>. Are these philosophical correlates of reflection caused by reflective thinking?</p><p>Causal effects of reflection on philosophical decisions are not always detected. Some researchers have attempted to get people thinking reflectively by placing a reflection test immediately before (vs. after) philosophical stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Pinillos et al. 2011</ref>). This reflection test order effect increased average acceptance of sacrificial harm on some moral dilemmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Paxton, Ungar, and Greene 2011)</ref>, but this reflection test order effect has repeatedly failed to replicate since the original result <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Attie and Knobe 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Paxton, Bruni, and Greene 2014)</ref>, and since the current research was conducted <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gouiran and Cova 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pereira 2024)</ref>. These null results have prompted research suggesting that the relationship between reflection and moral dilemmas may have more to do with the mathematical reasoning required by common reflection tests than with reflection per se <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Byrd and Conway 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Spears et al. 2020)</ref>. One may wonder if we should also reassess the causal relationships between reflection and other philosophical decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Participant Source And Data Quality</head><p>An increasing portion of surveys and experiments are completed by online crowd workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson et al. 2018)</ref>. Unfortunately, data quality and replicability are no longer ensured by the worker quality metrics on the crowd work platforms that are widely used in online research <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hauser et al. 2023)</ref>. Worse, removing low effort, disingenuous, fraudulent, or potentially botproduced survey responses seems to overturn attention-grabbing results such as alarming rates of alleged prophylactic household cleaner ingestion during the COVID-19 pandemic . So measuring and controlling for data quality is increasingly important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">The Current Research</head><p>This paper aims to clarify how reflective and philosophical thinking are related by deploying various tests of reflection, philosophy, and data quality to a broad range of participant samples in a pre-registered reflection test order experiment -see the Open Science Framework for the preregistration (osf.io/j6xvt), data, analysis files, and supplementary materials (osf.io/fp2z4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p>In late 2020 this experiment was pushed out to four participant sources to test the following predictions: (1) reflection test order will impact judgments about some philosophical thought experiments, (2) including moral dilemmas; (3) a minority of our adapted reasoning test items will seem familiar to participants; and (4) reflection test familiarity will correlate with better reflection test performance. Our secondary goals were to assess (5) response distributions, (6) demographic differences, and (7) platform differences in reflection test familiarity. Data quality was assessed with both overt and covert methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Participants</head><p>Positive reflection test order effects on philosophical decisions can be small, 0.41 &lt; d &lt; 0.44 <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Paxton, Ungar, and Greene 2011)</ref>. Precision for planning analysis suggested 50 participants per condition for a target margin of error of 0.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cumming and Calin-Jageman 2016)</ref>. With two conditions, the pre-registered goal was 100 participants per participant source or else the maximum we could recruit during our pre-registered timeline. We simultaneously recruited adults in the U.S. from Amazon Mechanical Turk or mTurk <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Zallot et al. 2021</ref>), CloudResearch's approved list of mTurk workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berry, Kees, and Burton 2022)</ref>, Prolific <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Palan and Schitter 2018)</ref>, and a pool of undergraduate students. When 100 participants were recruited from a source, low quality submissions were rejected to allow for 100 acceptable submissions per participant source.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Data Quality</head><p>To identify low-quality data, Qualtrics' covert fraud detection tools computed the probability of bot-assistance, repeat responding, and other problematic survey behaviours (Qualtrics 2022).</p><p>Various overt data quality checks were also developed. One data quality test instructed participants to write a complete sentence explaining what might have happened just before a photograph of an angry-looking person was taken <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1, left)</ref>. Bot-assisted, inattentive, or non-fluent English responders may merely describe the photo (e.g., 'The man is angry') instead of explain it (e.g., 'The man's team lost'). Incomplete sentences (e.g., 'anger' or 'Angry man') are also signs of low data quality. Participants were also asked, 'When completing this study, did you at any point use outside information?' -31 participants admitted that they did. Another item presented a two-sentence summary of how low effort and deceitful survey respondents can produce false scientific theories before asking, '…do you deserve to be paid for this study?' -four participants selected 'No'.  Of the participants that failed these data quality tests (nrejected = 75), 87% were from mTurk ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, right) even though worker qualifications were identical across mTurk, CloudResearch, and Prolific: only crowd work participants that had at least 500 completed submissions with at least a 98% acceptance rate could participate. This remarkably uneven distribution of low quality respondentsc 2 (3) = 80.74, p &lt; 0.001 -aligns with a growing literature suggesting that mTurk's internal completion and acceptance metrics are poor indicators of expected data quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Douglas, Ewell, and Brauer 2023)</ref>. These crowd worker metrics may be uninformative because researchers rarely reject low quality submissions -a potential 'collective action problem' in online survey research <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hauser et al. 2023)</ref>. To help address this problem low-quality submissions were rejected.</p><p>Analyses focus on the participants who passed the data quality tests (napproved = 385, Mage = 38, 170 female, 214 male, 1 neither; 289 White, 53 Asian, 18 Black or African American, 1 American Indian or Alaska Native, 8 entered their own response, 16 selected multiple responses).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Procedure</head><p>This experiment randomized the order of the two main question blocks: (1) a reasoning block (reflection tests, LSAT questions, etc.) and (2) a block of philosophical thought experiments <ref type="bibr">(Gettier cases, moral dilemmas, etc.)</ref>. Items were randomized within each block.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Manipulation.</head><p>Following prior reflection testing experiments, the order of the reasoning and philosophy blocks was randomized: half of participants started the experiment with the reasoning tests and the other half started with the thought experiments ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>). . Participants from four sources began the experiment by being randomly assigned to either the reflection test block or the philosophical thought experiment block. Then participants completed the other block.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Reflection tests.</head><p>Reasoning tests that lure people into accepting alluring-but-incorrect responses (i.e., reflection tests) were adapted to limit the degree to which test performance can be explained by participants searching for answers online <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ludwig and Achtziger 2021)</ref>. More generic reasoning tests were also in this block ( Just 30% of our adapted reasoning test items seemed familiar to participants regardless of their source or data quality. That relatively low familiarity rate is similar to that of a validated 'verbal' reflection test <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Byrd et al. 2023)</ref>. However, the correlation between familiarity and performance was nearly twice as large when reusing those validated test items (0.9 &lt; d &lt; 1.14) compared to this experiment's method of adapting new items (d = 0.54). Test familiarity was also similar across demographics (p = 0.505) and the average number of correct answers between males and females differed by just 0.5 out of 13 (95% CI [0.05, 1.03]): t (429.02) = 2.18, p = 0.030).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Thought experiments.</head><p>Philosophical thought experiments were adapted into binary choices for general audiences. Each thought experiment's description and source can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The vignettes' topics spanned epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of mind.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>As in prior work, philosophical decisions that correlated with reflection test performance were unaffected by the reflection testing order effect. However, there was an order effect of philosophical thinking on reflection. Participant source and data quality also seemed to matter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Undetected Reflection Testing Effects</head><p>No reflection testing effects on thought experiments were detected <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Philosophical Reflection Effect?</head><p>Testing reflection in both the reasoning-first and philosophy-first conditions allowed for a test of whether one condition resulted in more reflective reasoning than the other -something that cannot be tested when reflection is measured in only the reflection-first condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ervin and Corral 2022)</ref>. In this experiment, starting with the philosophical thought experiments increased the number of correct reflection test responses by about 1 (out of 13) compared to the reflectionfirst condition -d = 0.3, 95% CI [0.1, 0.5], p = 0.003 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3, right)</ref>. Although this result was not predicted when dual process theorists' claimed that reflective thinking causes changes in philosophical decisions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Greene et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Paxton, Ungar, and Greene 2011)</ref>, this result aligns with plenty of correlational data ( §4.3). Importantly, this philosophical reflection effect was undetected in low quality respondents <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3, right)</ref>, confirming that data quality can impact what results are detected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Correlational Analysis</head><p>Aggregating across participant sources, reflection test performance predicted responses to some thought experiments <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 4</ref>, left) even though these correlations were often undetected in some of the four constituent subsamples <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 4, right)</ref>. Notably, sometimes a correlation was detected in a subsample despite being undetected in the aggregate <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 4e, right)</ref>. This paper's statistical inferences are drawn only from the aggregate cross-sectional results; the lowerpowered sub-sectional results merely illustrate what some researchers may have inferred if they had collected just one or two of the four subsamples. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Replicated correlations.</head><p>Results from each thought experiment conceptually replicated correlations between reflection test performance and 1. philosophers' orthodox response of denying knowledge in cases of accidentally true justified belief -that is, the <ref type="bibr">'Gettier' and 'Truetemp' cases (Hall et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Machery et al. 2017)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4A</ref>-C show a reliable correlation: 2 &lt; OR &lt; 2.6, 0.16 &lt; R &lt; 0.23, p &lt; 0.002. 2. less attribution of responsibility when a harmful action is causally determined <ref type="bibr">(Hannikainen et al. 2019, 7)</ref>. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4G</ref>: OR = 1.8, R = 0.14, p = 0.005.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Correlations that failed to replicate.</head><p>The case-by-case analysis did not conceptually replicate correlations between reflection and 3. attributing intent to the CEO's harmful side effect ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4H</ref>: OR = 1.2, R = 0.04, p = 0.403). This may not be surprising. The probability that prior researchers would have observed at least as much correlation as they did between intention-attribution and reflection test performance if there was no correlation was 4% <ref type="bibr">(Pinillos et al. 2011, 124)</ref>. That is also the probability of a fair coin landing on the same side 59 out of 100 flips. Unless we would reject that that coin is fair, we should not reject the null hypothesis about reflective thinking and decisions about the CEO case <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Benjamin et al. 2018)</ref>. 4. causing some harm to mitigate greater harm <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Byrd and Conway 2019</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables 1 and 2)</ref> Indeed, one of the two correlations was the reverse of dual process theory's prediction: reflection predicted rejection of the utilitarian sacrificial trade-off ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4I</ref>-J), 0.5 &lt; OR &lt; 0.7, -0.12 &lt; R &lt; -0.05, 0.028 &lt; p &lt; 0.246. One hypothesis about why these two results deviate from so many prior results is that the dilemmas we included do not explicitly quantify a sacrificial harm trade-off like the trolley, crying baby, bomb threat, and other 'harm one to save many' moral dilemma decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rosas et al. 2023</ref>) that have correlated with decisions on explicitly arithmetic reflection tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Simpson 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Other undetected correlations. Further analysis did not detect correlations between reflection test performance and</head><p>5. judgments about the identity of someone who uses a 'teletransporter'. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4E</ref>: OR = 0.9, R = -0.02, p = 0.69. 6. whether the meaning of words is purely psychological. See 'Twin Earth', <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4F</ref>: OR = 1.1, R = 0.03, p = 0.556. 7. participants' denial that they 'know' they are participating in a study. See 'Brain in a vat', <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4D</ref>: OR = 1.21, R = 0.05, p = 0.382.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.4">Reflection &amp; epistemology.</head><p>The first and last of these correlational results form an interesting pattern: Correct reflection test answers reliably predicted philosophers' orthodox response of denying knowledge in the Gettier and Truetemp cases <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 4, A-C)</ref>. This raises the question of whether philosophers' orthodox response to these epistemic thought experiments is caused by a tendency to 'reflect more than others upon knowledge' <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hetherington 2011)</ref>. Consider two objections to this reflective orthodoxy hypothesis and one counter-objection.</p><p>First, perhaps denying knowledge in these cases may be less about reflective thinking in particular than scepticism more generally: this alternative idea is that some people perform well on reflection tests and deny knowledge in certain thought experiments because they are more likely to question everything, from their initial response on a reflection test to the possibility of knowledge more generally. If this latter objection were sound, then we should have detected a similar correlation between reflection and denying knowledge in the brain in a vat thought experiment. However, we did not ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4D</ref>). So the alternative scepticism hypothesis is not well-supported by these data.</p><p>A second objection is that reflection test order did not impact judgments in these Gettier or Truetemp cases relative to the philosophy-first condition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 4, A-C)</ref>. This could mean that reflective thinking fails to encourage more orthodox responses to such thought experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kneer et al. 2021)</ref>. However, reflection interventions modelled on Socratic discussion in philosophy conferences and seminars have yielded more correct responses to reflection tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Byrd, Chapkovski, and Michalska 2024)</ref> and certain responses to certain thought experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Keshmirian, Deroy, and Bahrami 2022)</ref>, including the orthodox response to Gettier cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cullen et al. 2022)</ref>. So this paper's results may not refute the reflective orthodoxy hypothesis so much as refute the assumption that reflection tests cause reflective thinking.</p><p>One implication of the reflection orthodoxy hypothesis is a sort of dual process theory that applies to more than just moral decisions. Perhaps some thought experiments (like Gettier's) prompt a certain response among less reflective thinkers that more reflective thinkers abandon for philosophers' orthodox response. Of course, this broader dual process theory about philosophical intuitions would have to be explained by reflective thinking itself and not, say, the observation that philosophers sometimes use words differently than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Starmans and Friedman 2020)</ref>. Admittedly, the present data do not suggest reflective thinking explains all orthodox intuitions about thought experiments: although greater reflection predicted denying full responsibility for a determined action, most surveyed philosophers believe that free will is compatible with determinism <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bourget and Chalmers 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bourget and Chalmers 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>To clarify previously mixed results in experimental philosophy, a pre-registered reflection test order experiment was conducted on four common pools of research participants. The results suggest that we may need to rethink (a) the relationships between reflective and philosophical thinking as well as (b) the methods we employ in online survey experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Participant Source And Data Quality</head><p>The rate of low data quality was up to 18 times higher among mTurk workers (not recruited via CloudResearch) compared to the other three samples, which were largely equivalent in data quality. Moreover, some of what we detected was found only in the higher quality participants. These data quality results support emerging themes in survey methods research. First, the statistical significance of results can depend on data quality, even when using strict selection criteria on crowd work platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Douglas, Ewell, and Brauer 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hauser et al. 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Peer et al. 2022)</ref>. Second, we should not expect similar data quality from all participant pools. So survey researchers should be mindful of where they get participants, measure data quality, and then control for data quality.</p><p>The differences between the cross-sectional and sub-sectional results also suggest caution about what we infer from relatively small samples from a single source. Each subsample has only a fraction of the statistical power that the aggregated sample contains, which can easily explain how a result that was undetected in some subsamples could be detected in the aggregate. However, sometimes a correlation was detected in a subsample that was undetected in the aggregate, which empirically illustrates how correlations may not stabilize in analyses of fewer than 250 observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Schönbrodt and Perugini 2013)</ref>. To overcome insufficient power, unrepresentative samples, and other forms of sampling error that can breed overconfidence in potentially false positives or false negatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Machery 2021)</ref>, researchers should oversample in order to ensure enough statistical power remains after rejecting low quality respondents. Otherwise, they may not be subjecting their predictions to 'severe' tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mayo 2018)</ref>. Researchers should also incorporate other best practices of online data collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cuskley and Sulik 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Reflection Test Order</head><p>The reflection test order manipulation seemed thoroughly impotent for philosophical decisions: None of the 10 decisions about thought experiments depended on whether participants completed the block of reasoning tests immediately before (versus after). This is not the first (or second or third or fourth) publication of a failure to replicate a reflection test order effect. So trust in reflection test order experiments as a method to activate reflection should be discounted accordingly.</p><p>And it may be that manipulating reflection test order is just one of many reflection interventions that are not expected to work <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Isler and Yilmaz 2022)</ref>. Although this paper's total sample size is far from the thousands of participants needed to demonstrate a null (or even practically null) effect (Lakens 2017, <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>), <ref type="bibr">Cova and colleagues (2018, §4.3)</ref> found that manipulations of reasoners' context (such as the order of two tests) were about 30% as likely to replicate as manipulations of reasoners content (such as what the tests contain). Results like these have led some to argue for a 'striking stability [of philosophical intuitions] across manipulations designed to increase reflectiveness' <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Knobe 2021)</ref>. Of course, this paper and many others suggest that philosophical intuitions are sufficiently variable to correlate with individual differences in reflection test performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Stich and Machery 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">A Philosophical Reflection Hypothesis</head><p>This warning about context manipulations also applies to this paper's unregistered philosophical reflection effect: thinking about philosophical thought experiments before a reflection test did result in slightly better reflection test performance (than thinking about the thought experiments after the reflection test). This order effect does not, by itself, confer much confidence that philosophical thought experiments promote reflective thinking, but triangulating on additional independent bodies of evidence may provide some support for this hypothesis.</p><p>First, studying philosophy predicts better reflection test performance (Prinzing and Vazquez 2024b), even when studying other fields predicts worse performance in the same statistical model <ref type="bibr">(Livengood et al. 2010, Endnote 10)</ref>. Second, case-based learning has improved exam scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Wu et al. 2023</ref>) and other cognitive outcomes (Bayona and Durán 2024) compared to traditional lecture-based learning. Third, there is growing evidence that even though philosophy undergraduates reason better than peers in their first year, they somehow improve more than their peers by their final year (Hatcher and Ireland 2024; Prinzing and Vazquez 2024a) -a pair of results that would be improbable if a null or regression-to-the-mean hypotheses is true. By adding this paper to the literature, we have preliminary evidence for the hypothesis that philosophical thought experiments "can encourage [people] to think through issues that they would otherwise not consider seriously or to think about them in a new light" <ref type="bibr">(Machery 2017, 15;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gendler 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The more that philosophical reflection effects replicate, the more that dual process theories about philosophical thinking should be supplemented: even if reflective thinking causes certain philosophical decisions, it may be that philosophical thinking also causes more reflective decisions. 1</p></div>
