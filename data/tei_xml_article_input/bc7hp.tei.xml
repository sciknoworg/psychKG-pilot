			<abstract>
				<p>People constantly decide how much time to invest in rewarding activities. Foraging tasks assess this decision-making by measuring when individuals switch between activities. People typically perform suboptimally in these tasks, largely due to overstaying, yet it remains unclear whether this tendency changes with age, independent of motivation and cognitive abilities. Based on findings showing increased sensitivity to the opportunity cost of time in older adults, normative models would predict less overstaying with age. In an online foraging task, 350 young and older adults decided when to switch between contexts with varying reward rates. We assessed self-reported apathy and depression and accounted for cognitive performance (planning and processing speed). Participants consistently overstayed, and this behaviour scaled with reward conditions. Overstaying was exaggerated with age but decreased with depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that mechanisms beyond normative models, such as perseveration, contribute to overstaying with age. Further, people may counterproductively interpret staying as persistence in reward extraction-a tendency that becomes more pronounced with age. Our results highlight the need for broader theoretical frameworks to explain systematic variations in foraging behaviour across the lifespan.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>When faced with diminishing returns from a current course of action, people must constantly evaluate whether to persist or switch to a potentially better alternative. This fundamental decision-making challenge is captured by foraging behaviour, which provides a theoretical and an experimental framework for understanding how organisms optimise resource acquisition over time. Studies examining foraging behaviour in humans have gained traction in recent years for investigating individual differences in neuropsychiatric conditions <ref type="bibr">(Barack et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bustamante et al., 2024</ref>). Yet, little is known about whether, and if so, how foraging behaviour differs across the lifespan.</p><p>What drives the decision to persist or to switch one's current course of action in foraging is an area of active research. One of the most prominent normative models for foraging behaviour, namely the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), suggests that the optimal strategy is to switch when the current reward rate falls below the average rate available in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Charnov, 1976)</ref>. That is, individuals should hold a consistent reward exit threshold across contexts and conditions, which matches the average reward rate they would achieve by switching. This is closely related to minimising opportunity costs-that is, the foregone rewards missed while staying in the current context <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Le Heron et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Niv et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>However, empirical evidence consistently show that humans systematically deviate from these theoretical predictions, typically persisting with diminishing resources longer than optimal <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Harhen &amp; Bornstein, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kolling et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Le Heron et al., 2020)</ref>. This systematic deviation from theoretical optimality suggests that human foraging behaviour relies on mechanisms other than threshold-based computations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Harhen &amp; Bornstein, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kane et al., 4</ref> 2019), including simpler heuristics such as perseveration-based strategies <ref type="bibr">(Rutledge et al., 2009)</ref>. These alternative accounts make different predictions about how ageing could affect foraging strategies.</p><p>Ageing significantly alters decision-making. Although older age is associated with significant changes in reward processing at the brain level <ref type="bibr">(Dhingra et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Eppinger et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Eppinger et al., , 2013</ref>, changes in behavioural responses to reward are less consistent <ref type="bibr">(Chowdhury et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>A recent study found that older adults are more sensitive to opportunity cost, investing more resources to accumulate reward more quickly when the opportunity cost of time is increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Devine et al., 2021)</ref>. This would predict that in foraging behaviour, older adults would show less overstaying behaviour and thus more normative behaviour relative to young adults.</p><p>However, older adults also tend to rely more on suboptimal heuristic decision rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Besedeš et al., 2012)</ref>, such as perseveration <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Sombric &amp; Torres-Oviedo, 2021)</ref>, which would deviate from the normative exit threshold-based computations. These studies would in turn predict that older adults would show more overstaying behaviour and thus less normative behaviour relative to young adults. To understand how foraging differs with age, a task that measures this type of suboptimality is needed, alongside measurements of other (confounding) contributors to foraging behaviour.</p><p>While examining individual differences in general, and in ageing in particular, it is important to account for other candidate contributors to foraging behaviour, namely individual differences in motivation and cognition. The critical role of motivation in decision-making has typically been studied through the lens of apathy and depression -two conditions that impact goal-directed behaviour through distinct mechanisms. Apathy, characterised by reduced goaldirected behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Husain &amp; Roiser, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Levy &amp; Dubois, 2006)</ref>, is associated with a 5 reduced willingness to invest effort for reward, both in healthy population and in various neuropsychiatric populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jurgelis et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Nair et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Saleh et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Treadway et al., 2009)</ref>, although mixed findings have been reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Valton et al., 2024)</ref>. Similar findings have been reported for individuals with depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Treadway et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Valton et al., 2024)</ref>, while cognitive ability is a well-known contributor to decision-making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Sandra &amp; Otto, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we tested whether, and if so, how suboptimality in foraging behaviour differs with age. To this end, we developed a new online foraging task, which was designed to test different aspects of suboptimality, while remaining intuitive and minimally cognitively demanding. The task required participants to maximise reward over a limited time in the face of changing reward accumulation rates. We also measured motivational factors with self-report apathy and depression questionnaires, and cognitive performance with two independent tasks. We first characterised the nature of suboptimality in the new task, hypothesising that participants would show a consistent overstaying behaviour and some simpler heuristics unrelated to exit thresholds. Importantly, our principal hypothesis was that older adults would show less overstaying behaviour, in line with an increased sensitivity to opportunity cost of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Devine et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited participants through Prolific (https://www.prolific.co/). Screening criteria included age of 18-45 years for the young adult group and 65+ years for the older adult group, no chronic condition/illness, and no ongoing mental health/illness/condition. Participants also had to pass a colour-blind test. All participants were asked to read the study information pages and to confirm they are eligible to participate and their consent to participate in the experiment.</p><p>Participants were paid £4.50 (approximately £9 an hour rate), which included a fixed £1 bonus (see below). The study was approved by the Tel Aviv University ethics committee (ref:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">0003132).</formula><p>Power analysis showed that with a 2:1 young-to-older adult group ratio, and a sample size of 230 young adults and 115 older adults, the study would have &gt;95% powered to detect significant associations between foraging performance and the variables of interest: age, depression and apathy in two regression analyses (see below), while controlling for the three cognitive variables (see below), with f2=0.15, ɑ=0.05/2. We therefore recruited 235 young adult participants (96 female) with a mean age = 30.81 years and SD = 5.79 years (age range 19-42 years) and 120 older adult participants (54 female) with a mean age = 69.26 years and SD = 3.81 years (age range 65-80 years). The data of five participants was not considered due to a technical error in data collection leaving a total of n=350.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental procedures</head><p>Participants performed three behavioural tasks and two questionnaires. The tasks examined foraging behaviour (milkman task), basic processing speed (choice reaction time task), and executive function or planning abilities (Tower of London task).</p><p>Milkman task: Inspired by Le Heron et al. (2020), we developed a task that operationalises the decision to switch in a time constrained experiment <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1A</ref>). Participants were asked to collect as much milk as possible in a 10-minute experiment. To incentivise them, they were informed that only those ranked in the top third in terms of total amount of milk collected would receive a bonus payment of £1.</p><p>To milk a cow, participants held down the spacebar key while a bucket, representing the accumulating milk, was displayed on the screen ('milking screen'). They were informed that as milking continued, it would become increasingly difficult to obtain milk from a cow. In reality, the milk accumulation rate followed an exponential function ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>) of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(") = $ %&amp;"</formula><p>Where (") is milk accumulation rate at time t, and $ is the initial accumulation rate and is the milk accumulation decay rate. The total milk accumulated <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1C)</ref>, as shown in the bucket, reflected the closed-form integral of this function. $ was taken from the set {0.01, 0.02} and from the set {2e -4 , 4e -4 }, creating a 2x2 design and four cow 'types' or conditions with high/low initial reward rate and fast/slow reward decay rate: High-Slow, High-Fast, Low-Slow, Low-Fast. These specific values were chosen, so as to have one best condition (High-Slow), one worst condition (Low-Fast) and two intermediate conditions which would be similar in optimal stay durations (High-Fase and Low-Slow). Conditions were interleaved and pseudorandomly presented, such that each cycle of four consecutive trials contained each condition.</p><p>After releasing the spacebar, participants saw a 'travel screen', where they were told the next cow was being prepared for milking. Travel time was fixed at 4 s, and a progress bar was displayed showing the remaining time for the travel screen. On the travel screen, participants could see how much milk was added to their total. Participants were discouraged from pressing the spacebar key during the travel screen, and if premature pressing occurred, they received a warning on the screen which appeared for 2 s. Throughout the experiment (during both milking and travel screen), time remaining was displayed as a countdown timer, as well as the total milk acquired so far. The experiment began with a 1-minute practice to familiarise participants with the task. In the task, participants had 10 minutes to maximise the amount of milk they collect. In the main milking screen, participants held the spacebar key to fill a bucket with milk. Animated milk filling the bucket showed participants the milk accumulation rate, and participants chose when to release the spacebar key in order to switch to the next cow. Switching cows ('travel') resulted in a fixed (4 s) time cost. Milk accumulation rate followed an exponential function, and there were four types of cows (uncued, pseudo-random differences, observable only via reward accumulation), each combining one of two initial milk accumulation Motivational factors. To investigate the relationship between foraging and motivation, participants completed two scales assessing apathy and depressive symptoms in addition to the foraging task. First, Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Marin et al., 1991)</ref> was used to examine individual differences in apathy symptoms. Second, depressive symptoms were assessed using the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kroenke et al., 2001)</ref>. We included two attention check items per questionnaire in the format of nonsensical or 'infrequency' items <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Zorowitz et al., 2023</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control cognitive tasks. Choice reaction time task:</head><p>In the choice reaction time task, two empty circles were displayed horizontally on the screen. After a pseudorandom interval of 1-5 s (drawn from uniform distribution), one of the circles turned black, and participants were asked to press the left or right arrow key as fast as they can, if the left or right circles turned black, respectively. There were 50 trials overall, and the task took approximately 5 minutes.</p><p>The measure of interest for each participant was median reaction time in ms, as overall accuracy (whether the button pressed corresponded to the circle turning black) was at ceiling (minimum 89% across individuals, with median accuracy of 100% across individuals).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tower of London task:</head><p>In the Tower of London task <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Shallice et al., 1997)</ref>, participants were instructed to move coloured discs, one by one, from a 'start state' depicted in one image, to match a 'goal state' depicted in another image. The discs are stacked vertically across three positions, with different configurations in each trial. During three practice trials, participants indicated the required number of moves to reach the goal state and then demonstrated these moves using a mouse. Only after correctly indicating and performing the moves did participants proceed to the experimental trials. In the 20 experimental trials, participants had 20 seconds to indicate the number of moves needed, without having to demonstrate the moves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10</head><p>The task was designed similarly to that in the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Keefe et al., 2008)</ref>: It was terminated after five incorrect responses, and conversely, participants who were correct on all 20 trials completed two additional trials. The measure of interest was the total number of correct responses in the experimental trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exclusion criteria</head><p>We implemented several basic quality controls. Our data included some participants who did not engage with the task properly, including one that only completed several trials, waited approximately 8 mins (out of a total of 10 mins), and a second that foraged in each patch for an average of 50-60 s. After excluding these two participants, we performed further exclusions by computing robust z-scores of stay durations, response latencies, stay duration Principal Component Analysis (PCA) scores (see below), and total reward, then removing participants falling outside of 3 robust SDs (defined as 1.48 times the median absolute deviation) on these measures ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1</ref>). Our exclusion criterion can be considered lenient, because it translates into an average stay duration threshold of over 10 s and an average latency threshold of over 1 s.</p><p>Many of the participants who failed one of these tests also failed multiple of them ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S2</ref>).</p><p>Ultimately, our 3-SD outlier exclusion rule removed 31 participants from our foraging analyses, for a retention of 91% of the data, 317/350 participants for the main behavioural analyses.</p><p>For analysing the associations between task performance, age and motivation, we further excluded participants who either failed attention check questions on the AES or PHQ-9, or had implausible mean response times on the reaction time task. The implausible response times were also determined according to the 3-SD criterion, which translated into a threshold of approximately 1200 ms. Most participants failing this criterion had reaction times longer than 11 2.5 s, with some reaching 15 s. As a result, these set of analyses included 274 participants, comprising 78% of the original dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>In our analyses, we first computed the optimal policy for the task, by using the SciPy optimisation package, maximising reward with respect to stay durations. We defined a reward function mirroring that used in the task, which was parameterised by a fixed total experiment time of 10 min, an inter-patch travel time of 4 s, the experimental rates of return for each condition, and a fixed response latency of 650 ms across all patches (roughly the median participant latency, which has no effect on the optimal policy within reasonable bounds).</p><p>Optimisation used an initial policy estimate with stay durations of 6 s, 5 s, 4.5 s and 3.5 s, and was robust to changes in this initialisation.</p><p>To examine the structure of foraging behaviour, we conducted PCA on stay durations and exit thresholds, where exit thresholds were the patch reward rate at the time people switched patches. The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) were used in subsequent analyses.</p><p>We decomposed PC1 into 1) baseline stay duration offset, measuring how much longer a participant stayed compared to optimal durations. This was calculated as the mean stay duration across all conditions; 2) condition-difference scaling, measuring how much a participant exaggerated the differences between conditions. This was calculated as the projection of meansubtracted stay durations onto the normalised optimal policy. To assess task measure stability, we computed split-half reliability by comparing PCAs and exit deviations between first and second halves of the experiment. Correlations between halves were calculated using Pearson's r for PC scores and rank correlations for exit deviations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>12</head><p>Finally, we investigated the relationships between foraging behaviour and age, AES, PHQ-9, and cognitive performance in the two cognitive tasks. We first residualised task exogenous variables against age, before entering them into two separate linear regression models, predicting PC1 and PC2. This allowed us to identify independent contributions of each variable. Statistical significance was assessed at α=0.05, with specific p-values reported for key comparisons. Effect sizes were reported as Cohen's d for group comparisons and Pearson's r for correlations.</p><p>All analyses were performed in python version 3.11.7, and code for performing them can be found at https://github.com/DanielNScott/milkman-analysis. Data will be made publicly available on publication.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Condition differentiation and suboptimality</head><p>In order to understand how people should ideally behave in the foraging task, we first computed the optimal policy using optimisation methods (see Methods). We found that optimal policies depended both on the initial reward rate and the speed of decay, with the high reward rate-slow decay condition (High-Slow) prescribing the maximal stay duration 7.5 s and the low reward rate-fast decay condition (Low-Fast) prescribing the minimal stay duration of 2.5 s. The two intermediate conditions had similar optimal policies, with 4.1 s for Low-Slow and 3.8 s for High-Fast. Given these large differences between all but the intermediate conditions, we expected the optimal policy would be learned quickly by most participants.</p><p>Participant behaviour indeed differed across conditions in accordance with normative predictions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2A</ref>). Group means differed significantly between pairs of conditions (twotailed paired t-tests; t(316)=22.9, 22.2, 14.8; p=3.8e-85, 2.5e-2, 5.4e-43 for the three adjacent ordered comparisons starting with High-Slow vs. Low-Slow; d=1.8, 0.2, and 0.9, respectively).</p><p>As expected, the two middle conditions which had optimal stay durations within ~300 ms of one another had similar stay durations. Importantly, compared to optimal behaviour, most participants exhibited overstaying behaviour ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2A)</ref>, and this had a substantial impact on total reward in the task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2B</ref>). Group mean stay durations were substantially longer than those of an optimal agent, with mean overstaying of 2.6 s, 1.6 s, 1.6 s, and 1.7 s for the High-Slow, Low-Slow, High-Fast and Low-Fast conditions (two-tailed one sample t-tests; t(316)=16.9, 13.0, 20.5, and 23.8; p=6.6e-46, 2.8e-31, 6.3e-60, and 2.5e-72; d=1.0, 0.7, 1.2, and 1.4). Moreover, a second primary determinant of reward in the task was response latency <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig.    14   2C</ref>), which was correlated with total reward (Pearson's r=-0.33, p=1.6e-9), but was unrelated to average stay durations <ref type="bibr">p=0.8</ref>).</p><p>Similar to stay durations, participant exit thresholds (their reward rates at exit time) were roughly half to three-quarters of the optimal values <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2D</ref>) (optimal threshold: 0.44 L/s; average thresholds: 0.30, 0,35, 0.27, 0.25 L/s for the four conditions, ordered as above).</p><p>Overstaying behaviour, measured as exit threshold differences, was different across task conditions (two-sided paired sample t-test, t(316)=-9.7, 2.8, 6.4; p=8.5e-21, 1.3e-111, 3.5e-10; d=-0.77, 2.21, 0.50, ordered as above). This means that participants overstayed more in some conditions than others in terms of their exit thresholds. Specifically, participants performed more optimally in the two slow decay rate conditions, compared to the worst (Low-Fast) condition (compare red to black in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2D</ref>). This tendency cannot be explained by a fixed overstay duration pattern, as optimal stay durations were similar in the intermediate-quality conditions (see above).</p><p>Examining individual participant exit thresholds in more detail, we computed each participant's variation around their own exit threshold baseline ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2E</ref>). This confirmed that individual participants tended to perform most suboptimally in the fast decay rate conditions, and most optimally on the Low-Slow condition. Many participants also overstayed in the High-Slow (best) condition more than in the Low-Slow (second best) condition. Participant suboptimality was therefore most pronounced in the fast decay rate conditions, over and above the (average) exit thresholds. One possible explanation for this may be that participants are less capable of approximating an internally defined exit threshold in the fast decay rate conditions (because of the higher rate of reward change, and perhaps an associated response lag) than in the slow decay rate conditions, but this would not explain the difference between High-Slow and Low-Slow suboptimality. Notably, the differences between participants' highest and lowest exit thresholds were also significantly correlated with their average exit thresholds <ref type="bibr">(Pearson's r=0.65,</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2F</ref>), suggesting that the magnitude of this suboptimality difference is significantly related to the flattening reward rate curves at increasing stay durations. Taken together, better performing (more optimal) participants had less consistent exit thresholds than poorer performing ones. Reward was strongly, but not entirely, determined by average stay durations. In particular, it was reduced by overstaying, which most participants exhibited, but also by under-staying, making the relationship nonlinear. (C) Response latency was a second significant determinant of total reward, and was not related to total stay durations (see main text). (D) Participants' exit thresholds, which show differential overstaying by condition, with the least overstaying in the Low-Slow condition and the most in the Low-Fast. (E) Exit threshold deviations (from by-participant grand means) for each condition.</p><p>Having a higher exit threshold deviation is generally better (less suboptimal). A minority of participants were in the vicinity of optimal performance, or even under-stayed, and for these participants, this higher-is-better interpretation will not always be correct. Participants can be seen to perform most suboptimally in the Low-Fast condition, followed by the High-Fast, High-Slow, and lastly, Low-Slow condition. (F) Participants with larger differences between their highest and lowest exit threshold, i.e., who had less consistent exit thresholds, had higher average exit thresholds and performed better on the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual differences in suboptimality</head><p>To further examine the differences in foraging policies across participants, we performed PCAs on stay durations and exit thresholds. The first two principal components explained 90%, and 8% of the variance in stay durations across participants, respectively, and we obtained similar results for exit threshold PCs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3A)</ref>. The first PC (PC1) represented a combination of average stay duration shifting and scaling <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3B-C)</ref>. Specifically, PC1 loaded positively on all stay durations, indicating baseline (or average) offsets between participants, but increased more for the 'better' two conditions than the 'worse' ones, indicating scaling or exaggeration of the between-condition stay durations. We found this to be a consequence of transforming approximately uniform exit threshold variations into duration space. In particular, the exit threshold variation (PC1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 3C</ref>) implied greater stay duration variability in the slow decay conditions (PC1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 3B</ref>) and vice versa.</p><p>Overstaying behaviour therefore had two components: a baseline stay duration offset (relative to the optimal set of stay durations), and a condition-difference exaggeration component.</p><p>Examining this decomposition further, we computed participant's offset components by taking mean stay durations, and computed their scale components by projecting mean-subtracted stay durations onto a mean-subtracted, unit-normed transform of the optimal policy. These components were highly correlated <ref type="bibr">(Pearson's r=0.69,</ref>, suggesting that participants that overstayed more, tended to exaggerate condition differences as well <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3D)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to PC1, the second PCs in both stay duration and exit threshold spaces measured a tendency to stay in the best (High-Slow) condition over all others <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3B-C)</ref>. Therefore, systematic variation between participants was dominated by differences in their baseline overstaying behaviour and scaling (PC1: overstay/scaling) and their expressed preferences for the single best patch in the task (PC2: High-Slow preference). In subsequent analyses, where possible, we chose to primarily analyse participant stay behaviour in stay duration space rather than exit threshold space, since the two were strongly related, and exit reward-rates asymptoted to zero as stay durations increased <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3E)</ref>. Both PC1 and PC2 remained consistent over the course of the experiment (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Materials)</ref>.</p><p>Differences in overstaying/scaling (PC1) were strongly related to total reward earned in the task. In line with the strong impacts of average policy stay durations across conditions, participants with lower PC1 scores tended to earn more reward (Pearson's r=-0.63, p=1.1e-35) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3F)</ref>. When breaking PC1 down to baseline overstaying and scaling, the correlation between PC1 and reward was largely driven by a strong relationship between overstaying and reward (Pearson's r=-0.63, p=4.9e-36), whereas there was no association between scaling and reward, independent of the relationship with overstaying (when scaling residualised by baseline overstaying, Pearson's r=-0.01, p=0.89). Similarly, the orthogonal aspect of preference for the best task condition (PC2) did not meaningfully impact participants' earned rewards (Pearson's r= 0.02; p=0.73). The remainder of reward variation was due in large part to response latency differences, as noted above, and consistency differences over the course of the task, to which we turn next. To assess the unique contributions of these variables to differences in foraging behaviour, we fitted linear regression models. First, we residualised our task-exogenous variables by age, as age was significantly associated with all variables <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4A</ref>). These variables were then entered into two regression analyses, predicting PC1 and PC2. In the first regression model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4B</ref>), age and PHQ-9 scores showed significant associations with PC1 (β=0.13, -0.21; SE=0.06, 0.07; t(274)=2.3, -3.50; p=0.02, 0.003, for age and PHQ-9, respectively). By contrast, none of the variables was associated with PC2 in the second regression model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4C)</ref>.</p><p>Post hoc zero-order correlations showed there was a positive association between PC1 and age (r=0.20, p=4.3e-4, uncorrected; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4D</ref>), a negative association with PHQ-9 (r=-0.13, p=0.025, uncorrected; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4E</ref>). For completeness, we also illustrate the positive association between PC1 and response times in the Tower of London task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4F)</ref>, which was abolished when residualising by age. Considering the high correlation between offset and scaling behaviour (see above), these analyses meant that older adults and those with lower depression scores showed both a greater tendency to overstay and greater scaling to each reward condition. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study investigated the age-related differences in suboptimality in foraging behaviour. Specifically, we tested whether, in line with an increased sensitivity to opportunity cost, older adults would show less overstaying compared to young adults. In contrast to this hypothesis, we found that the main form of suboptimality in our foraging task, overstaying and condition-specific exaggeration of stay duration, was increased with age. A simpler heuristic, namely preference for the best condition, was not associated with age. Similar results were found for individuals with lower depressive symptoms. Together, our results suggest that unlike predictions from normative models, people may counterproductively interpret staying as persistence in reward extraction, and this tendency becomes more pronounced with ageing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suboptimality in foraging</head><p>As reported in previous research, we found that most participants consistently overstayed in a patch, beyond what is predicted by normative models, such as the MVT <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kendall &amp; Wikenheiser, 2022)</ref>. Several cognitive and motor mechanisms have been suggested to explain overstaying tendency. First, temporal discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kane et al., 2019)</ref> can make individuals overstay because leaving one source of reward incurs a cost in the form of a time delay before the next source of reward becomes available. This time delay spent on 'travelling' reduces the value of the future reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kane et al., 2019)</ref>. Second, sensitivity to costs or effort in the task may contribute to overstaying, specifically in relation to costs incurred during travel to a different patch or while extracting reward within a patch (i.e., harvesting). Although we did not directly manipulate the effort involved in harvesting or travelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bustamante et al., 2023)</ref>, individuals may perceive the effort of harvesting by holding down the button and monitoring the filling milk bucket differently. Those who are less sensitive to this effort would exhibit more overstaying behaviour. Third, foragers need to infer the structure of their environment and use the uncertainty about this inferred structure to adjust their strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Harhen &amp; Bornstein, 2023)</ref>. This means that future reward value is discounted by uncertainty about the environment, leading to overstaying behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Harhen &amp; Bornstein, 2023)</ref>. Fourth, overstaying can be explained by perseveration -whether cognitive or motor <ref type="bibr">(Rutledge et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Sombric &amp; Torres-Oviedo, 2021)</ref>-that is, the inappropriate, or in this case suboptimal, prolongation of behaviours (sometimes termed 'continuous perseveration' <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Sandson &amp; Albert, 1984)</ref>).</p><p>Adding to these contributors to suboptimality in foraging, we found two distinct behavioural patterns that deviate from optimality: 1) a strong association between baseline overstaying and condition-specific exaggeration of overstaying; 2) a condition-specific deviation of exit thresholds from optimality. First, we found that the tendency to overstay ('offset') was highly correlated with condition-specific exaggeration of stay durations ('scale'). In other words, participants who tended to overstay for longer, were also more sensitive to changes in the reward conditions. This suggests that overstaying tendency cannot be simply explained by a reduced attention to the task or general slowness, which was indeed not associated with this behavioural pattern in our study (no associations with reaction time). Instead, people who tend to stay longer may place a greater subjective value on extracting reward from each condition, which also makes them more sensitive to differences between conditions. That is, people may suboptimally perceive (over)staying as persistence in the task, and hence those who are more engaged and reward-driven may counterproductively overstay in each patch. This interpretation would also explain the negative association between overstaying/scaling and depressive symptoms (see below).</p><p>Second, we found that the extent of suboptimality differed between reward conditions. Specifically, our task allowed us to examine the differential effect of initial reward rate vs. reward decay rate. While overstaying was similar in terms of stay durations across conditions, people overstayed more in fast relative to the slow decay rate conditions in terms of exit threshold. Initial reward rate, by contrast, did not affect the degree of suboptimality in the task.</p><p>These findings are at odds with theories such the MVT, which compute the optimal exit thresholds as a function of current reward rate relative to average environmental reward, without considering the specific factors that contribute to the instantaneous reward rate. Our findings suggest that other contextual or cognitive mechanisms might contribute to suboptimality in foraging. For example, the larger deviation from optimality in fast decay rate can be due to a limitation in cognitive flexibility or suggest that individuals favour stability in their reward-seeking behaviours, even in environments that would benefit from more agile adjustments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age-related differences in foraging behaviour</head><p>In contrast to the hypothesis that older age leads to an increased sensitivity to the opportunity cost of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Devine et al., 2021)</ref>, older adults demonstrated a greater tendency to overstay in a patch compared to younger adults. Such a tendency would suggest reduced sensitivity to the opportunity cost of time according to normative models like the MVT. These findings do align, however, with previous literature suggesting that ageing is associated with increased perseveration as seen in rule-switching tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Daigneault et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Haaland et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Head et al., 2009)</ref>. Such perseveration may reflect a resource rational response to increased computational costs associated with cognition in the ageing brain, which in other work have been shown to give rise to both perseverative and anchoring biases that are amplified in older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bruckner et al., 2020)</ref>. Although we independently measured cognitive performance in two other tasks in our study, we did not measure perseveration. Future studies could directly test the hypothesis that age-related overstaying during foraging is mediated by perseverative tendencies.</p><p>The high correlation between overstaying and sensitivity to reward conditions in our task meant that although older adults generally waited longer until they decided to switch, they remained highly responsive to the declining value of a resource over time. This heightened sensitivity could be an adaptive response to their overall tendency to stay in a patch, allowing them to reach similar levels of reward to that of young adults over time. Moreover, increased sensitivity to reward decay speaks to a large body of literature looking at reward processing in ageing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cutler et al., 2022)</ref>. Previous research has shown that reward processing changes in the brain across the lifespan <ref type="bibr">(Dhingra et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Eppinger et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Eppinger et al., , 2013</ref>, but behaviourally, there are no clear age-related changes in reward sensitivity <ref type="bibr">(Chowdhury et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cutler et al., 2022)</ref>. The lack of a consistent behavioural change could be related to the inconsistent agerelated changes in dopamine <ref type="bibr">(Chowdhury et al., 2013)</ref>. Dopamine has been suggested to control responsiveness to reward in the decision to switch <ref type="bibr">(Constantino et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Le Heron et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Niv et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Raio et al., 2022)</ref>. Specifically, dopamine drives switching behaviour <ref type="bibr">(Constantino et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Raio et al., 2022)</ref>, particularly in low-reward or 'poor' environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Le Heron et al., 2020)</ref>, and it has been suggested that tonic levels of dopamine reflect average reward rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Niv et al., 2007)</ref>. Thus, a simplistic interpretation of our finding could be that overstaying behaviour in older adults is related to lower tonic dopamine levels. However, this interpretation would need to be reconciled with the finding of increased sensitivity to reward decay rate in older adults, which is in turn thought to be more related to phasic dopamine levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Niv et al., 2007)</ref>. Future studies could more specifically test these hypotheses, for example in groups of patients with Parkinson's disease where tonic dopamine is primarily affected <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Le Heron et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Association with motivational factors</head><p>We found a negative association between overstaying/scaling and depressive symptoms, as measured by the PHQ-9. This association indicates that individuals with more depressive symptoms tended to stay in a patch for a shorter duration. This finding is consistent with our interpretation that overstaying in the task could be seen as effortful or as persistence in the task (see above). On this account, more depressed individuals experience lower subjective value for extracting reward in each patch, leading them to switch earlier and have lower exit thresholds than those with less depressive symptoms. This result is also consistent with theories of lower average reward expectations in depression <ref type="bibr">(Bustamante et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Huys et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, a reduced scaling or reward sensitivity (tightly linked to overstaying in our task) aligns with existing research showing diminished reward sensitivity in individuals with depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Halahakoon et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The lack of an independent association between foraging and apathy, as measured by the AES, is in contrast with previous research linking apathy to: the opportunity cost of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Nair et al., 2021)</ref>; to temporal discounting and impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fellows &amp; Farah, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lansdall et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Petitet et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sinha et al., 2013)</ref>; to perseveration <ref type="bibr">(Kim et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Scholl et al., 2022)</ref>; and to an inflated sensitivity to effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dalléry et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Husain &amp; Roiser, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jurgelis et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Le Heron et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Müller et al., 2021)</ref> (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Valton et al., 2024)</ref>). Interestingly, another recent study found no significant relationship between task parameters in an effort foraging task and apathy, although measured using a different apathy scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bustamante et al., 2023)</ref>. Moreover, a different study reported only a weak association between AES and choice bias in an effort-reward decision-making task, but no association between AES and effort or reward sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Mehrhof &amp; Nord, 2024)</ref>. Still another study reported no association between AES and behavioural parameters in an effort-reward decision-making task <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Valton et al., 2024)</ref>.These studies raise the possibility that in the general population, where changes in apathy scores are more subtle than in clinical populations, and where the meaning and validation of clinical scales such as the AES are less established, associations with task parameters can be weak.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p>The strengths of our study include the use of a new time-constrained foraging task, together with cognitive tasks looking at processing speed and executive function. When measuring more complex behaviours with new tasks, and especially when testing differences between populations, such as older adults or patient groups, it is crucial to consider new tasks in conjunction with well-established measures of robustly identified cognitive traits, as we did here. However, our study has several notable limitations. First, the study was cross-sectional, and our results could not assess longitudinal changes with age. Moreover, we used a simple foraging task that could potentially be applied to clinical populations with varying degrees of cognitive impairments. However, this meant that the task was more limited in what it could measure, as for example only one environment was included, and we did not manipulate effort or background reward rate as has been elegantly done before <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bustamante et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Le Heron et al., 2020)</ref>. Lastly, this study was largely descriptive, and a more mechanistic account of task-related behavioural differences would, of course, be preferable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our principal findings indicate that suboptimal foraging behaviour arises from multiple behavioural factors, which are not consistent with consistent exit threshold-based computations. Further in contrast to normative theories, overstaying was strongly associated with adaptation to reward conditions, and this behaviour was exaggerated with age and with less depressive symptoms. Together, the results suggest that overstaying may reflect heightened engagement with reward extraction rather than simply suboptimal decision-making.</p><p>Our study highlights the need for more comprehensive theoretical frameworks and computational models that can account for systematic variations in foraging behaviour in general, and across the lifespan in particular. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S2</ref>.

Recomputing PCs using the initial and final data segments, we observed strong agreement over the course of the task for both PC1 <ref type="figure">(Fig. S3A</ref>) and PC2 <ref type="figure">(Fig. S3B</ref>) (cosine angles: 3.0 and 2.9 degrees for PC1 and PC2 initial vs. final). Similarly, the profile of exit deviations (computed as above) was conserved <ref type="figure">(Fig. S3C)</ref>, although there was a notable increase in the relative optimality of participants' responses to the Low-Slow condition over the task (start vs end bars, Low-Slow group, <ref type="figure">Fig. S3C</ref>). In addition to PC stability, participants' initial and final scores were high correlated for both PC1 (Pearson's r=0.80, p=1.5e-72, <ref type="figure">Fig. S3D</ref>), and PC2 (Pearson's r=0.57, p=4.4e-29, <ref type="figure">Fig. S3E</ref>). Exit deviations were correlated at a range of values between about 0.3 and 0.6 ( <ref type="figure">Fig. S3F</ref>). Taken together, these results therefore indicated that both group factor structure and individual participant scores reliably reflected suboptimality over the duration of the task. <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>. Participant exclusion across task variables. Participant reaction time, stay duration, latency, total reward, and Principal Component (PC) scores. Blue points are participants included in the analyses. Red points are outliers removed using a robust 3-SD cutoff for outlier detection.</p></div>
