				<p>Choice impulsivity can be measured by offering a sequence of various binary choices between smaller, immediately available rewards and larger, later available rewards. An individual&apos;s delay discount (DD) rate reflects the aggregate decision-making tendency. Given the broad spectrum of disorders associated with a high DD rate, this may be an important transdiagnostic factor. This study aimed to establish whether post-decisional neurophysiological processes reflecting the presence of error monitoring are involved in delay discounting. A large sample (N=97) was investigated, including 46 females and 51 males. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during the classic monetary choice questionnaire (MCQ-27). Error-related event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related oscillations (EROs) following responses were analyzed. A modest relationship between error positivity (Pe) and DD rate was seen centroparietal, with higher amplitude for low DD individuals after choosing immediate rewards and for high DD individuals after choosing delayed rewards, respectively. A robust association was found between DD rate and theta oscillation power increases. This was most prominent in low DD individuals after making an immediate reward choice, showing activation of all electrodes. No evidence was found for an error-related negativity (ERN) and response-related activity in the delta oscillations. This study provides clear evidence for conflict monitoring as a post-decision process in delay discounting. Findings suggest that diminished theta band power bursts and lower Pe amplitude, observed after choosing an immediate reward, reflect the neurophysiological consequence and possibly the cause of steep delay discounting. High DD was characterized by prefrontal hypoactivation and appears to result from affective decision-making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>One hallmark of addiction is limited self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baler &amp; Volkow, 2006</ref>). An essential aspect of limited self-control is that lower but sooner available rewards are preferred above larger but later available (delayed) rewards. It has been argued that addiction can be seen as a series of micro-decisions that result in detrimental health and well-being in the long term <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rachlin, 2004)</ref>. For instance, when a smoker considers whether to smoke a cigarette now or quit smoking, they may overlook the interdependence of these options and think, 'I will have one more, and then I will quit.' This flawed reasoning can lead to continued smoking.</p><p>Although discounting the value of delayed consequences relative to immediate consequences is seen as normal behavior, this tendency is more pronounced ('steeper') in impulsive individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Moreira &amp; Barbosa, 2019)</ref>. The relationship between reward value, delay, and individual differences is commonly described in the hyperbolic discounting function <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Mazur, 1987)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V = A / (1+ k * D)</formula><p>In this formula, the objective value of some reward to an individual is represented by (A), which will be available after a delay of (D), e.g., measured in hours or days. <ref type="bibr">(V)</ref> represents the subjective value of a reward with value (A), which is calculated by dividing (i.e., discounting) the objective value (A) by a number greater than 1. Parameter (k) defines the subject's sensitivity to delay (D). A high value of (k), often referred to as steep delay discounting, will imply a rapidly declining subjective value (V) as the delay until the receipt of rewards becomes longer, leading to a reversal of preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rachlin &amp; Green, 1972)</ref>. This is a choice for an immediate, smaller reward, even though a choice for a delayed, larger reward was previously intended. Intertemporal choice questionnaires are administered to measure DD. Several versions involve making binary choices between smaller, more immediate rewards and larger, more delayed rewards in a forced response setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(da Matta et al., 2012)</ref>. After completing the questionnaire, a single (k) can be calculated to summarize the individual's global sensitivity to delay. Onwards, parameter (k) will be referred to as the delay discounting rate (DD rate).</p><p>The relevance of DD in clinical psychology was strongly stimulated by early work in the field of heroin addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kirby et al., 1999)</ref>. It has been argued that the DD rate represents a personality trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Odum, 2011)</ref> and that given the broad spectrum of associated disorders (such as addiction, attention deficit disorder, and major depressive disorder), high DD may be seen as a transdiagnostic factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bickel et al., 2019)</ref> which offers a generic measure for studying and ultimately treating various types of psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Lempert et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>A DD task requires a person to decide between reward options, which places DD within a broader decision-making perspective. Abstractly, a decision can be defined as a commitment to a categorical proposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2007)</ref>. It has been proposed that specific metacognitive abilities, i.e., awareness of errors (a.k.a. error monitoring) and confidence in decisions, may improve decision-making by learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Yeung &amp; Summerfield, 2012</ref>) through post-decisional processing. These authors have argued that error monitoring influences subsequent decisions through a corrective adjustment process, whereas correct responses do not. Others have integrated this into a dynamic process view of DD, showing that choices for immediate or delayed rewards may become self-reinforcing through carryover effects to subsequent choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Scherbaum et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The event-related potentials (ERPs) of error monitoring in the electroencephalogram (EEG) have typically been defined as error-related negativity (ERN; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gehring et al., 1993)</ref> and error-positivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Falkenstein et al., 1991)</ref>. The ERN is a negative deflection in the ERP that occurs within 100ms after an incorrect response, which is understood to reflect error detection. The Pe occurs 200ms-400ms post-response and is associated with the motivational importance of errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Overbeek et al., 2005)</ref> and post-decisional accumulation of evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Desender et al., 2021)</ref>, with a more pronounced link to behavioral adjustment. Recently, event-related oscillations (EROs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Basar et al., 2001)</ref>, notably in the theta band (3-9 Hz) and delta band (&lt;3 Hz), have been found to reflect the underlying computational processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cohen, 2017)</ref> that are involved in error monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cavanagh, Zambrano-Vazquez, et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Luu et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Munneke et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Stam et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Yordanova et al., 2004a)</ref>.</p><p>Despite high research interest in DD and error monitoring, little is known about the EEG of DD post-decision processing. Only one study directly investigated this <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Patalano et al., 2020)</ref>, which found a positive association between high DD and higher ERN amplitudes for selecting delayed options. To the author's knowledge, no further studies have been done on the association between Pe, or theta/delta EROs, and DD error monitoring. Therefore, the role of post-decision processing in DD has not yet been adequately clarified, which represents a research opportunity. Advancing knowledge may support the development of novel treatment possibilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Lempert et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>This study hypothesized that a higher DD rate would be associated with an error-alike ERN/Pe after a delayed choice in participants (and the opposite, i.e., immediate choices for low delay discounting) within the context of an obvious choice bias between subjects (i.e., high DD rate is computationally linked with a higher proportion of immediate choices).</p><p>Furthermore, theta and delta power were expected to be positively associated with committing errors for these error-like decisions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods Participants</head><p>This investigation was part of a broader project with the same participants but involving distinctly different tasks <ref type="bibr">(Stam et al., 2024[submitted]</ref>). Inclusion criteria were age (18-40), literacy in Dutch (speaking and reading), and informed consent. Exclusion criteria were having a -self-reported -psychiatric or neurological disorder or the current use of psychotropic medication. Participants were recruited on campus through referrals from other studies and personal networks. Participants were rewarded with a payment of 25-30 euros.</p><p>Psychology students at Erasmus University Rotterdam could choose between payment or two hours of course credits.</p><p>In total, there were 110 participants, of which 97 (46 females and 51 males) were included in the final sample after applying exclusion criteria and data quality check (ADHD:4; failed / poor EEG: 3; impaired eye vision: 1; &lt; 4 artifact fee choices within condition: 5). The average age of participants was 21.9 years (SD=3.3).</p><p>Variation to pre-registration: The minimum number of artifact-free trials for each choice condition was set to 4. To compensate for ineligible participation (e.g., reported ADHD), participation continued beyond the preregistered maximum (100).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apparatus/instruments</head><p>The experiment lasted approximately 1.5 hours per participant. The order of the experiment was as follows: time estimation task/ Eriksen-flanker task (counterbalanced), the DD-task <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kirby et al., 1999)</ref>, demographics, smoking questionnaire, BIS/BAS questionnaire, and alcohol use questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lemmens et al., 1992)</ref>. The present report focuses solely on the DD task.</p><p>Stimuli for the DD task were presented electronically using the E-Prime 3.0 software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). The questionnaires were administered in Qualtrics, version 2022 (Qualtrics, Provo, UT).</p><p>Participants were first shown an instruction page (shown until key press). Then, each question was preceded by a 1000ms intertrial interval (ITI). After the response, the question disappeared, and the next question was shown after the ITI. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EEG Recording and signal processing</head><p>The EEG was recorded using a Biosemi Active-Two amplifier system from 32 scalp sites (10-20 system) with Ag/AgCl electrodes (active electrodes) mounted in an elastic cap.</p><p>Furthermore, six additional electrodes were attached to the left and right mastoids, two outer canthi of both eyes (HEOG), and infraorbital and supraorbital channels of the eye (VEOG).</p><p>All signals were digitized with a sample rate of 512 Hz and 24-bit A/D conversion. BioSemi uses the common mode sense (CMS) and driven right-leg (DRL) electrodes to create a feedback loop that replaces the conventional ground electrode. The CMS was used as an online reference. Data were off-line re-referenced to computed linked mastoids. Off-line, EEG, and EOG activity was filtered with a bandpass of .1-30 Hz (phase shift-free Butterworth filters; notch filter 50 Hz).</p><p>For EEG analysis, all 32 channels were included. After ocular (Gratton &amp; Coles)</p><p>correction with common reference, trials with EEG signals exceeding ±100 μV were excluded for channels of interest (all electrodes except rim electrodes F7, F8, Fp1, Fp2, O1, O2, Oz, P7, P8, T7, and T8). EEGLAB functions were used to automatically reject channels (criterium: &gt;= three z-scores based on probability) and subsequently interpolate faulty channels (spherical method).</p><p>Variance to pre-registration: As a pronounced negative deflection was observed prior to response, the baseline was set from -400ms to -200ms pre-stimulus, i.e., before the onset of response-related negativity. Artifact rejection applied for ERO was optimized by adding 19 extra channels to F3/F4. This step was necessary to clean the data adequately for TF-PCA analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ERP and ERO Analysis</head><p>EEG data was inspected using BrainVision Analyzer (Brain products GmbH, 2014).</p><p>The EEG data was extracted from Vision Analyzer for analysis in the TF-PCA toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bernat et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buzzell et al., 2022)</ref>. R-Studio (R Core Team, 2022) was used for downstream data processing from the TF-PCA toolbox. JASP (JASP Team, 2023) was used for statistical analysis. The ERN and the Pe were calculated using the TF-PCA toolbox described hereafter.</p><p>Time-Frequency Principal Component Analysis (TF-PCA) was applied to measure oscillatory power in the theta and delta bands. TF-PCA was conducted based on a pre-filtered signal (3 -9 Hz) for theta-frequency and (1-3) Hz for delta-frequency. Epochs were extracted from -1000ms before response to +1000 post response. In the following step, the time windows for both theta and delta frequency decomposition were set from -100ms before response to +500ms post response to effectively focus on the events of interest (ERN and Pe).</p><p>The analysis was conducted on phase-locked data (average power). The toolbox allows for extracting results at the participant/condition/electrode level for subsequent analysis. For robustness analysis of theta, the subsampling function was used with ten samples for each condition by participant (without replacement), with 25 subsamples (with replacement), i.e., a randomized total of 25 'sweeps' for each condition for every participant was analyzed in the robustness test.</p><p>The software used was the Psychophysiology toolbox (Curtin, 2011) and EEGLAB (version 2023.1) <ref type="bibr">(Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004)</ref>, and the TF-PCA toolbox. EEGLAB, the Psychophysiology toolbox, and the TF-PCA toolbox were run in MATLAB (Version: 9.11.0;</p><p>R2021b Update 6) (The MathWorks Inc., 2023).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deviation from pre-registration</head><p>Visual inspection of ERPs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>) revealed no visible Pe centered around 300ms.</p><p>Instead, the positive peak occurred around 200ms post-response. Based on this finding, the choice was made to deviate from the pre-registration; the time window for calculating the average Pe was set to 100ms to 300ms post-response. Furthermore, ERP analysis was conducted using the TF-PCA toolbox for consistency. ERN and Pe were analyzed at the subject-average level by condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis plan</head><p>Individual DD rates were first calculated using an automatic scoring tool based on all choices between smaller, immediate rewards and larger, delayed rewards <ref type="bibr">(Kaplan et al., 2016</ref>). The resulting k was log-transformed to ln(k), as DD rates are known to be nonnormally distributed. In simple terms, the DD rate numerically represents the degree of impulsivity.</p><p>The first step in the analysis was to analyze task behavior (reaction time). This first step was taken to gain fundamental insight into the differences in deliberation time for immediate and delayed rewards in the context of the DD rate.</p><p>Furthermore, the association between ERPs (ERN/Pe) and DD was analyzed using repeated measures of variance analysis (RMANCOVA). The next step was to investigate time-frequency differences in theta and delta-band using principal components. Components were assessed for explanatory power and then analyzed by RMANCOVA, with oscillatory power as the dependent variable, choice as a repeated measure, and DD rate as a covariate.</p><p>As a final step, regressions were run with conditional theta/delta-power as the dependent variable and DD rate as the independent variable. RMANCOVA results were corrected for sphericity with Greenhouse-Geisser adjustments.</p><p>For each analysis, gender and BIS/BAS were separately added to the regression analysis to evaluate if these moderated the results.</p><p>To help present the analyses, three DD rate classes were formed into roughly equalsized groups: low DD (M=-6.6, n=30), medium DD (M=-5.1, n=35), and high DD (M=-3.8, n=32). However, the regressions were run with the DD rate as a covariate.  Notes: The upper section shows DD rate, age, and BIS/BAS by delay discounting class, followed by ANOVA test (F) for group differences. BIS: behavioral inhibition system; BAS: behavioral activation system. The lower section shows the group contingencies followed by a Chi-squared test (X 2) . Df: degrees of freedom. Behavior on the DD task was investigated by analysis of reaction times. The results of the repeated measures analysis are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. There was no fixed effect of the DD rate (F(1, 95)=.01, p = .94), so the degree of delay discounting was not associated with a primary difference in reaction time to a question. However, the DD rate interacted with the condition (immediate or delayed) of the reward <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(F(1, 95)</ref>=28.78, p = &lt;.001, η 2 p=.23). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure    1</ref> explains the association. A low DD rate was associated with short reaction times for delayed choices and longer reaction times for immediate choices, with the opposite pattern for a high DD rate. There were no separate associations with BIS, BAS, or gender (all p=values &gt; .05).  For the ERN amplitude, there was no main effect of DD rate (F(1, 95)=.19, p=.66),</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant characteristics and reaction time analysis</head><p>nor was there an interaction between condition and DD rate (F(1, 95)=.15, p=.70). There was also no difference in ERN between choice conditions (F(1, 95)=.31, p=.58). There was a within-subject effect of channel (F(1.43, 135.35)=46.46, p&lt;.001, η 2 p=.33), which showed that the ERN was largest at Fz (M=-2.69), followed by Cz (M=-2.41) and smallest at Pz (M=-.37).</p><p>There was an association between ERN and BAS (F(1, 92)=5.29, p=02, η 2 p=.05) but this did not influence the results overall.</p><p>For the Pe amplitude, there was no main effect of DD rate (F(1, 95)=.14, p=.71).</p><p>There was no difference between conditions (F(1, 95)=.24, p=.63) as such, implying a similar amplitude by choice type. Channel was a significant within-subject predictor (F(1.46, 138.48)=17.04, p&lt;.001, η 2 p=.15)., p=.18), but there was no interaction between channel and DD rate (F(1.46, 138.48)=1.31, p=.27).</p><p>However, there was a trend for the interaction between DD rate, channel, and condition (F(1.51, 142.98)=3.23, p=.06, η 2 p=.03). The trend is graphically presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2 (D, E, F)</ref>. The figure shows that the difference was most pronounced for low DD at the Cz-channel and, to a lesser extent, but similarly at the Pz-channel. There was no interaction between channel and DD rate (F(1.46, 138.48)=1.31, p=.27). After adding in gender, BIS, and BAS, as possible confounders a main effect of BAS (F(1, 92)=4.39, p=.04, η 2 p=.05) was identified, which strengthened the association between condition and DD rate (F(1.53, 140.86)=4.19, p=03, η 2 p=.04). Other associations with condition were not significant (p's &gt; .05).</p><p>The topography plots ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2G)</ref> show the between-subject differences. Cz was most positive (red) for low DD compared to high DD in the immediate choice condition. For delayed choices, we can see a negativity (blue), primarily located in the parietal region, suggesting more activation for high DD than for low DD in this region. For delta, the main component was a burst at ca. 1.0 -1.5 Hz, which peaked at around 350ms and finished at circa 400ms. Activity was broadly distributed across the scalp, not highlighting any specific contributing region. This component explained circa 78.1% of the variance. The timing of delta activity did not coincide with ERN or with Pe. Given the high explanatory power of single components, these were considered adequate representations for subsequent analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theta-frequency</head><p>Theta power was robustly associated with DD rate through interaction with condition (F(1, 95)=35.97, p &lt; .001, η 2 p=.28). <ref type="figure">Figure 3A</ref> shows a low DD rate was associated with higher theta power after immediate reward choices compared to delayed choices. To a lesser extent, a high DD rate was associated with higher theta power after making delayed reward choices compared to immediate reward choices. The relationship appears quite similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> (DD rate versus reaction time), yet the difference in <ref type="figure">Figure 3A</ref> is more pronounced.</p><p>Adding BIS, BAS, and gender did not influence the model (all p's &gt; .05). <ref type="figure">Figure 3B</ref> shows the time-frequency course of the difference between immediate and delayed reward choices for high DD rate subjects. The blue indicates power was lower between circa 200ms and 500ms after response. The topography insert shows a hypo-active frontocentral region (black area). <ref type="figure">Figure 3C</ref> shows an opposite pattern; a low DD rate was associated with higher theta power when making immediate choices compared to delayed choices. The topography plot shows that the power difference was noticeable across the scalp (white area). Lastly, there was a main effect of DD rate (F(1, 95)= 4.25, p=.04). <ref type="figure">Figure 3D</ref> shows the between-subject differences in time-frequency, which shows that low DD rate was associated with a higher theta power-intercept, i.e., regardless of choice. The topography plot suggests that this trend difference between groups was predominantly central (the white area).</p><p>In summary, the differences by condition were most pronounced for individuals with a low DD rate, with the most significant difference for immediate rewards at the Cz channel and the most significant difference for delayed rewards at the Pz channel. High DD individuals showed a lack of activation of the frontal region compared to low DD individuals.</p></div>

A test was run at ten valid observations per condition for each participant, which resulted in a reduced sample of 62 participants. Still, at this level, the interaction between DD rate, choice and theta power remained significant <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(F(1, 62)</ref>=11.47, p=.001, η 2 p=.27). However, the main effect between DD rate and theta power dropped to insignificant (F(1, 62)=.95, p=.33). This confirmed that the interaction between DD rate, choice and theta power was unbiased by the number of trials per condition for each participant. The between-subject difference may be biased. However, this latter observation cannot be made with certainty due to the smaller sample being considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Association between reaction time and theta-oscillations</head><p>These were added as covariates to the previously described analysis to assess the association between reaction time (RT) and theta-oscillations.

The association between DD rate and condition was consistently robust (F(1, 93)=24.26, p&lt;.001, η 2 p=.21). In conclusion, the relationship between DD rate and reaction time by condition appeared quite similar to the association between DD rate and theta power by condition. However, there was no association between RT and theta power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Delta-frequency</head><p>For delta frequency, the results were not significant. There was no fixed effect of DD rate (F(1, 95)=1.66), p=.20), and there was no interaction between DD rate and condition (F(1, 95)=.03, p=.87). Furthermore, condition, channel, and DD rate were unrelated (F(1.41, 134.06)=.93, p=.40). There was equally no association between delta power and condition (F(1, 95)=.23, p=.63) or between condition and channel (F(1.06, 100.44)=1.17, p=.28).</p><p>In summary, delta-power was not related to the decision-making process on the delay discounting task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study aimed to establish whether post-decisional neurophysiological processes reflecting the presence of error monitoring are involved in delay discounting. The EEG was recorded during the classic monetary choice questionnaire (MCQ-27), and both ERPs and EROs following responses were studied to identify whether this possible relationship was manifest. The MCQ questions do not have correct or incorrect answers; they reflect choice options, and the answers measure preference for immediate or delayed rewards, translating into a single DD rate. However, the expectation was that making an atypical choice (such as a delayed choice for a high DD individual) might result in subjective error processing.</p><p>Making delayed reward choices was positively associated with reaction time (RT) for more high-DD individuals and the opposite for low-DD individuals. This is consistent with prior research on delay discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Patalano et al., 2020)</ref>. These longer RTs suggest more deliberation time was required to resolve a higher degree of decisional complexity (conflict) in making these decisions <ref type="bibr">(Atiya et al., 2020)</ref>. Shorter RTs for either choice category generally reflect preferred choices with low decisional conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Konovalov &amp; Krajbich, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>A negative deflection was found within 100ms after response, i.e., the typical window for the occurrence of an ERN after error commission. However, no association was found between DD, choice, and this negativity. This differs from prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Patalano et al., 2020)</ref>, which found an ERN for high DD individuals after making delayed reward choices.</p><p>The absence of an ERN in the present study may be due to the different experimental conditions, such as the type of questionnaire, the number of trials, and the absence of a limit on response time. The negativity that was found possibly reflects a late Contingent Negative Variation (CNV). The CNV is understood to reflect a stimulus-response connection, which acts like a spring that tenses (increasingly negative) prior to response and relaxes post-response <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Verleger et al., 2000)</ref>. The response-related CNV (readiness potential) is associated with voluntary movement, i.e., in the present study, it is related to motor preparation and execution for submitting the response.</p><p>In contrast, a robust association was found between DD rate, choice, and theta power approximately 200-400ms after response. This theta burst was most prominent in low DD individuals after making an immediate reward choice. High DD was characterized by diminished theta power after immediate choices compared to delayed choices, and the opposite was true for low DD individuals. For this group, all electrodes showed more power after choosing immediate rewards. It has been shown that the number of brain areas activated increases with reward uncertainty and loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Guo et al., 2013)</ref>. The present results suggest that the experience of loss (small vs large reward) may have driven the post-decision theta power increase in low DD individuals. This phenomenon appears related to prior findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Zeelenberg et al., 2003)</ref>, which pointed out that the obvious consequence of choice is losing the non-chosen option. Pre-decisional attachment (preference) during deliberation may have increased the attractiveness of the forgone option after decision-making ('choosing feels like losing').</p><p>Theta band activation in the fronto-central region is known to be involved in conflict monitoring and is usually associated with the ERN <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cavanagh &amp; Frank, 2014)</ref>. The current study found no ERN. Therefore, the theta power increases after unpreferred choices suggest the activation of a broader, post-decisional conflict monitoring process, not an error monitoring process. The nature of this process may indicate an ambiguity after decisionmaking, e.g., a doubt about whether the 'right' choice was made <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Sandre &amp; Weinberg, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>For high DD individuals, the theta burst after making delayed reward choices was mostly centro-parietal, specifically not frontal. This suggests a different post-decision process compared to low DD individuals. The lack of frontal activation may reflect lesser involvement of cognitive control (CC), as CC processes are associated with the functioning of the prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Friedman &amp; Robbins, 2022)</ref> and involved in decontextualized, nonemotional decision-making (a.k.a. "cool" cognitive control). In contrast, the predominantly parietal activation might point towards an affective post-decision process for high DD individuals, a.k.a. "hot" cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Welsh &amp; Peterson, 2014)</ref>, as found in studies with emotional tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cole &amp; Ray, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Schutter et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tortella-Feliu et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Consistent with these findings, a meta-analysis has shown that risky and ambiguous decisionmaking activates frontal and parietal regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Krain et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>A Pe-like positive deflection, peaking 200ms post response, was found to be associated with reward choice and DD rate. Results showed an inverse relationship between DD rate and reward choice, with elevated levels of positivity for low DD individuals choosing immediate rewards and for high DD individuals choosing delayed rewards, respectively. Caveated as a modest relationship, it suggests the presence of post-decisional processing, as the Pe is known to proportionally increase with confidence level in making an error <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Desender et al., 2021)</ref> and occurs centro-parietal.</p><p>The presence of a Pe in the absence of an ERN has been found before when the correct response was unavailable (Di <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gregorio et al., 2018</ref>), which appears consistent with the findings in the present study as described above. It also adds further evidence for the distinct roles of the Pe and the ERN <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Overbeek et al., 2005)</ref>. The Pe findings in the present study are not to be understood as strictly related to an error. Instead, the significance of Pe appears to reflect post-decisional evidence accumulation (i.e., through evaluation of choice) in conflict monitoring, potentially aimed at adapting behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Desender et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>No evidence was found for the expected role of delta band activation, which was unrelated to choice behavior and DD. One explanation is that delta activity is related to the ERN <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Yordanova et al., 2004b)</ref>, which was absent in the present study. However, studies have also found an association between the Pe and delta band activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Luu et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stam et al., 2024[submitted]</ref>), which was not seen in the present study. Still, an association between positive deflections and theta was found before <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cavanagh, Figueroa, et al., 2012)</ref>, again concerning an experimental design involving uncertainty. That study found positive peaks at circa 200ms and 300ms post feedback associated with theta band power. The present study appears to resemble these findings. Taken together, the nature of the activity in the present experiment is likely to be the cause of a typically different post-response process than is the case when a speed/accuracy trade-off is involved, such as an Eriksen-flanker task, explaining the absence of an ERN and unrelated delta band activity.</p><p>The finding that theta power and Pe amplitude increase after decisions leads to the question of whether this was only evaluative or (also) guided a change toward opposite choices in subsequent decisions. This question could not be answered based on the current results. However, it seems plausible that there is some relation with subsequent choices for two reasons. Firstly, the evidence for a post-decision process should imply some purpose rooted in improving outcomes in future behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Yeung &amp; Summerfield, 2012)</ref>. Related to this rationale, the associated energy expenditure caused by the theta/Pe increase would conflict with the principle of energy conservation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bullmore &amp; Sporns, 2012)</ref> if not followed by a change of direction. Secondly, theta power has been found to initiate self-control by activating the subthalamic nucleus (STN; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Zavala et al., 2016)</ref>. The STN is believed to increase the evidence threshold when choosing between alternatives. We speculate that repeated theta power and Pe amplitude increases in the post-decision process may have increased the evidence threshold by choosing differently to avoid conflict in future decisions. This study provides clear evidence for conflict monitoring as a post-decision process in delay discounting. Results show that theta band oscillations are robustly present in evaluating choices between immediate and delayed rewards, most prominently in low delay discounting individuals. A similar pattern was found for the error positivity. In conclusion, diminished theta power bursts and Pe amplitude -after choosing an immediate rewardreflect the neurophysiological consequence and possibly the cause of steep delay discounting.</p><p>Steep delay discounting may be characterized by a more affective, parietally active, postdecision process. In contrast, low delay discounting appears to additionally draw on activation of the prefrontal cortex, suggesting a more substantial relation with cognitive control.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Reaction time to DD-questions by choice and DD rate Note: N=97.
