			<abstract>
				<p>We conducted pre-registered replications of 15 effects in the field of judgment and decision making (JDM). We aimed to test the generalizability of different classical and modern JDM effects, including, among others: less-is-better, anchoring, and framing to different languages, cultures, or current situations (COVID-19 pandemic). Replicated studies were selected and conducted by undergraduate psychology students enrolled in a decision-making course. Two hundred and two adult volunteers completed an online battery of replicated studies. With a classical significance criterion (p &lt; .05), seven effects were successfully replicated (47%), five partially replicated (33%), and three did not replicate (20%). Even though research materials differed from the originals in several ways, the replication rate in our project is slightly above earlier reported findings in similar replication projects. We discuss factors that may underlie replication results (success vs. failure). We also stress the role of open science practices such as open data, open research materials, pre-registration, and registered reports in improving the replicability of results in the JDM field.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the seminal works by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Popper (1934)</ref> reproducibility is regarded as a cornerstone of modern science. Original findings that cannot be systematically obtained by other researchers who employ appropriate scientific methods in adequately powered studies are questionable for theory development and become futile in terms of their potential to be applied in different domains of everyday functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Simons, 2014)</ref>. For example, if the significance of a promising effect of an intervention on health behaviors that fails to be replicated by other researchers diminishes, the intervention may be regarded as fruitless for policymakers responsible for health services.</p><p>A series of unsuccessful replications of notable psychological effects, such as ego depletion <ref type="bibr">(Hagger et al., 2016)</ref>, social priming <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Doyen et al., 2012)</ref>, or power posing <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Ranehill et al., 2015)</ref> reported in papers published in prestigious peer-reviewed journals raised concerns about numerous scientific findings and initiated a debate commonly labeled as a replication crisis (see, for example, the open letter written by <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Yong, 2012</ref>).</p><p>There were several factors identified that might be responsible for the crisis, including, among others, selective data collection and reporting, data manipulations/transformations, treating exploratory analyses as confirmatory analyses, or drawing conclusions based on underpowered studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Simmons et al., 2011)</ref>. Failure to reproduce positive results has been observed in different disciplines from psychology, through neuroscience, political sciences, to economics, indicating that various fields may struggle with a broad range of problems that prevent efficient reproducibility of scientific discovery. Interestingly, a survey conducted among researchers from various disciplines revealed that more than 70% of them experienced failure when tried to reproduce the results of another experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baker, 2016)</ref>. In response to this, investigators called for enhancing efforts aimed at verifying the robustness of effects and recommended running multi-lab pre-registered replication projects to establish replicability and boundary conditions essential to observing an effect of interest.</p><p>For instance, a replication project run by the Open Science Foundation <ref type="bibr">(Open Science Collaboration, 2015)</ref> indicated that the successful replication rate of 100 effects published in three top psychological journals ranged from 36 to 47%, depending on the criterion used to assess successful replication (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gilbert et al., 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Klein et al. (2014)</ref>, in their Many Labs registered replication project (N = 6,344) conducted in 36 labs across the world, found that out of 13 psychological effects that were selected for the study, ten were successfully replicated (but with smaller effect sizes), two were not replicated, and there was weak evidence to conclude successful replication for one effect. In the Many Labs 2 project <ref type="bibr">(Klein et al., 2018)</ref>, only 15 of 28 psychological effects were successfully replicated <ref type="bibr">(N = 15,305; 36</ref> countries).</p><p>Replication projects were also conducted in the field of judgment and decision making (JDM). For example, it has been demonstrated that 94% of the effects predicted by prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref> were successfully replicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ruggeri et al., 2020)</ref>. Also, other classical JDM effects such as money illusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Ziano et al., 2021)</ref>, decoy effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Xiao et al., 2020)</ref>, status quo bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Xiao et al., 2021)</ref>, framing <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Zhou et al., 2021)</ref>, or motivated numeracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Persson et al., 2021)</ref> were subjects of replication and extension studies.</p><p>Despite the fact that the majority of JDM effects have been successfully reproduced, there are at least two potential concerns of replication studies in the JDM field that limit their ubiquitousness and generalizability. First, studies on decision making often incorporate simple monetary lotteries to draw conclusions about choices under risk/uncertainty and test cognitive models of choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fox et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Wu et al., 2008)</ref>. Parameters used in the process of lottery construction (e.g., payoffs) may exert an influence on choices. For example, depending on the currency used in the original study, investigators conducting replications can 1) use the same currency irrespective of the currency of the country where replication is carried out (e.g., $5 in the original study and $5 in the replication study), 2) change the original currency to the currency of the country where replication is carried out without changing values (e.g., $5 in the original study and PLN 5 in the replication study), or 3) change the original currency to the currency of the country where replication is carried out along with changing values according to the present currency exchange rate (e.g., $5 in the original study and PLN 19.10 in the replication study). Based on the research on number sense and numerical cognition, such modifications are likely to modulate numeric information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dehaene, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Second, language-, time-, and culture-related nuances observed in choice dilemmas used in JDM research may be critical for successful replications. For example, a person living in Europe will perceive a dilemma describing a lottery in which an individual can win a travel coupon covering the costs of going to Europe differently in comparison to a person living in the US <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Rottenstreich &amp; Hsee, 2001)</ref>. Decisions in the classic Asian disease problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref> can be influenced by the current pandemic situation, and dilemmas describing an opportunity to purchase Barnes &amp; Noble featured coupons can be difficult to understand in countries where the company does not operate <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gneezy et al., 2006</ref>).</p><p>In the present study, we attempt to make the initial step to address these concerns. We report the results of a project aimed at evaluating the reproducibility (and boundary conditions) of 15 classical and modern effects in the field of judgment and decision making.</p><p>Nevertheless, our project differs from many other replication projects in psychology. In particular, all replicated JDM effects were adjusted to the Polish language, currency, and economic situation. Thus, our research could be considered conceptual replication rather than a direct replication <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hüffmeier et al., 2016)</ref>. Additionally, replicated studies were selected, pre-registered, and conducted by undergraduate psychology students enrolled in a decisionmaking course, which seems to be of special importance because of educational benefits and the increasing methodological awareness of students <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jekel et al., 2020)</ref>. Moreover, such a selection procedure allows a broad range of effects that are regarded as important by young people to be investigated, and not only effects that have gained an audience among experienced researchers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method &amp; Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.1.Participants</head><p>Two hundred and two Polish speaking Prolific users (65 females, 133 males, 4 persons refused to answer the question about gender, Mage = 23.5, SDage = 6.43) completed a series of online tasks. Participants were paid £2.50. Participation in the study was voluntary, and participants gave informed consent before the study. The study protocol was approved by the departmental Ethical Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.2.Procedure</head><p>During the decision-making course 1 , undergraduate psychology students formed fifteen research teams and were asked to choose effects known from the judgment and decision making field that, in their opinion, had value for replication in Polish settings. These effects were selected and evaluated by the brevity of the procedure, feasibility to be conducted online, and on adults from the general population. Next, students prepared a pre-registration of replication of each effect on the Open Science Framework platform. We designed a simplified pre-registration form (in Polish) based on the "Replication Recipe" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brandt et al., 2014)</ref> to make it more understandable for undergraduate students. Nevertheless, this simplified form contained all essential elements, such as the brief description of the replicated effect and its effect size, known differences between the original study and replication, required sample size, and plan of data analysis. We used G*Power <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Faul et al., 2009)</ref> to calculate the required sample size for each effect based on the original effect size (we used effect sizes reported in original studies or estimated them based on available information).</p><p>Conventionally, we assumed α = .05 and 1 -β = .80. Obtained sample (N = 202) was larger than the required sample size for each effect (however, see the description of the project S04 for an exception).</p><p>Research materials were translated and adapted to current settings (e.g., language, the COVID-19 pandemic). Then all tasks were coded in an online experimental procedure run under the Qualtrics. The order of presentation of tasks testing different effects was counterbalanced. The whole study lasted approximately 25 minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">The description of 15 psychological effects</head><p>For each of the tested effects, we provide a brief description of its nature, main findings based on the results reported in the original articles, differences between the original and replication study, and detailed results of the replication. We assumed that the effect is successfully replicated if it is statistically significant (p &lt; .05) and its direction is consistent with the results of the original study. Additionally, in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, we present unified effects sizes estimated in the original studies (i.e., all effect sizes were converted to the Cohen's d) as well as effect sizes in replication study with 95% confidence interval.</p><p>2.3.1. Relationship between procrastination and dependent decision-making style <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Geisler &amp; Allwood, 2018)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(S01) 2</formula><p>This study investigated the relationship between decision-making styles and other individual differences. One hundred and eighteen Swedish students completed several questionnaires: General Decision-Making Style Inventory (GDMS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Scott &amp; Bruce, 1995)</ref> containing five subscales (rational, intuitive, spontaneous, avoidant, and dependent), Self-Monitoring Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lennox &amp; Wolfe, 1984)</ref>, Machiavellian Personality Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dahling et al., 2008)</ref>, Procrastination Scale-Student version <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lay, 1986)</ref>, and Time-Style Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Usunier &amp; Valette-Florence, 2007)</ref>. This study demonstrated that different decision-making styles were related to specific differences in social orientation and time approach.</p><p>In the current study, we wanted to replicate the relationship between dependent decision style (the tendency to "seek advice and support of others or let others decide") and procrastination (the tendency to " use time resources by postponing the start or completion of tasks that need to be done"). In the original study, a small positive correlation was observed between these two variables (r = .277). Individuals who more often procrastinated also had a higher tendency to consult their decision with others.</p><p>We used the Polish version of the Pure Procrastination Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Stępień &amp; Topolewska, 2014)</ref> and the translation of the dependent style subscale from the GDMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Scott &amp; Bruce, 1995)</ref>. Both scales had excellent reliability (Cronbach's αdependent style = 0.809; and Cronbach's αprocrastination = 0.898). We found a significant relationship between dependent decision style and procrastination (r = .165; p = .019). Thus the effect was replicated but smaller than in the original study.</p><p>2.3.2. The effect of sunk cost on the decision to escalate commitment to an ongoing project <ref type="bibr">(Garland, 1990) (S02)</ref> In the original study, 407 participants estimated the likelihood that they would authorize spending money on an ongoing investment project in the five different conditions, when 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 million dollars had already been spent on the project (with a total budget of 10 million dollars). Participants were assigned to one of three between-subjects conditions varying in the dependent variable measure: some participants estimated the probability of authorizing the next one million dollars for this project (1), others estimated the probability of authorizing remaining budget funds (2) or the perceived likelihood of the project's success</p><p>(3).</p><p>Results showed a significant effect of sunk cost for authorizing the next one million dollars, F(4, 145) = 6.67, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = 0.14, and for authorizing all remaining budget funds, F(4, 122) = 12.20, p &lt; .001 ηp 2 = 0.28. The subjective probability of charging all remaining funds and an additional one million dollars increased when the sunk cost was higher.</p><p>In our study, we intended to replicate the effect of investing an additional one million dollars for the project. However, we used only three between-subjects conditions, when 1 (10% of a project; n = 69), 5 (50%; n = 67), and 9 million (90%; n = 66) dollars had been invested in the project. The results showed a significant effect of sunk cost on the subjective likelihood of investing an additional one million dollars, F(2, 199) = 14.51, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = 0.13. Participants in the 10% condition estimated the probability of investing an additional million dollars for a project as M = 42.26 (SD = 25.84), in 50 % as M = 52.79 (SD = 25.42), and in 90% as M = 66.33 (SD = 26.74). The post-hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction revealed that the difference between conditions 10% and 90% as well as between 50% and 90% were statistically significant (t = -5.377; p &lt; .001; d = -0.916 and t = -3.003; p = .009; d = -0.519, respectively). While the difference between 10% and 50% conditions was only marginally significant t = -2.361; p = .058; d = -0.411. Nevertheless, we argue that this effect was successfully replicated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Zaleskiewicz, 2008)</ref>  <ref type="formula">S03</ref>In the original study, 200 participants were randomly assigned to one of the five conditions: four experimental and one control. In a 2 x 2 design of experimental conditions, participants were asked to solve a word search puzzle including words priming the attitude 2(encouraging, discouraging) toward risk 2(instrumental, stimulating). Sets of priming words were selected in pilot studies and contained, for example, success (encouraging instrumental), excitement (encouraging stimulating), defeat (discouraging instrumental), and fear (discouraging stimulating). Participants in the control condition did not solve any puzzle before the main task. Next, all the participants were shown six risk-related scenarios and declared their willingness to take these risks using a 7-point scale-three of these scenarios related to instrumental risk (e.g., taking a student loan) and three to stimulating risk (e.g., bungee jumping).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Priming risk attitudes and instrumental risk tendency</head><p>The results (the one-way ANOVA) showed that priming an instrumental risk attitude (encouraging or discouraging) influenced willingness to take instrumental risk, F(4, 195) = 9.454; p &lt; .001; η 2 = 0.16. Participants who solved a puzzle containing words discouraging them from taking instrumental risk had the lowest tendency to engage in instrumental risk behaviors (M = 3.33), whereas those who solved a puzzle containing words encouraging them to take the instrumental risk were more willing to take such risk (M = 5.10). On the other hand, willingness to take stimulating risk was the highest among participants who solved a puzzle containing words encouraging them to take stimulating risk (M = 5.01), while the lowest tendency to take this type of risk was found in two groups solving puzzles with discouraging words (Mdiscouraging_instrumental = 3.12, Mdiscouraging_stimulating = 3.33), F(4, 195) = 9.240; p &lt; .001; η 2 = 0.16.</p><p>In the present study, we wanted to replicate the effect of priming instrumental risk attitudes and willingness to take this type of risk. Similar to the original study, participants solved word search puzzles containing words encouraging or discouraging instrumental risktaking. However, based on advice from the author of the original study, we decided to alter the control condition (in this replication study, participants solved a puzzle that contained only neutral words). After solving a puzzle, participants were shown three scenarios related to instrumental risk and declared their willingness to take such risks using 7-point scales. We hypothesized that participants primed with words encouraging to take instrumental risk would declare the highest willingness to take this risk. In contrast, those primed with discouraging words would have the lowest tendency to take this risk. Finally, participants completed the attention check task.</p><p>Because in the pre-registration form, we set eligibility criteria (e.g., finding at least eight words in a puzzle and correctly responding to the attention check questions), the analyses were performed on a smaller sample (N = 127: ncontrol = 40, ndiscouraging = 48, nencouraging = 39) 3 .</p><p>The results showed that priming risk attitudes influenced willingness to take instrumental risk F(2, 124) = 4.721; p = .011; η 2 = 0.07. Participants in the discouraging condition declared the lowest tendency to take risk (M = 4.34; SD = 0.99), while those in the encouraging condition declared the highest (M = 4.93; SD = 0.98). Post-hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction revealed that the only significant difference was obtained between encouraging and discouraging conditions (t = 2.913; p = .013; d = 0.592), while the comparisons between experimental and control (M = 4.78; SD = 0.79) conditions were not significant (t = -0.709; p = 1.000 for comparison between control and encouraging) or marginally significant (t = 2.188; p = .092 for comparison between control and discouraging). Therefore, we argue that our replication was partially successful.</p><p>2.3.4. Sex differences in risk preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Harris et al., 2006)</ref>  <ref type="formula">S04</ref>This study investigated the effects of sex differences on risk perception in four risk domains: gambling, recreation, health, and social. The authors also explored potential mediators of these relationships, such as perceived likelihood and severity of negative risk consequences or perceived benefits of risky activities.</p><p>In the present replication, we focused only on the effects of sex on declared past risk behaviors. In the original study, a sample of 657 US students (266 males and 389 females) responded to nine questions about their actual past risky activities using five-point scales. The results showed that males reported more risky behaviors when they were asked about smoking [t <ref type="formula">654</ref> Because of budget constraints and required sample size, we decided to pre-register only replication of the strongest effects: gambling ("How often do you gamble?"), engaging in risky recreational activities ("How often do you engage in risky recreational activities?"), and drinking alcoholic beverages ("How many alcoholic beverages do you typically drink in a week?") 4 . Nevertheless, we translated all nine risky behavior questions and used them in the procedure. We also slightly changed the question about public exposition during classes because a more representative sample took part in this study. We asked, "How often do you express your opinion in public?" instead of "How often do you raise your hand to answer or ask questions in class?".</p><p>Sixty-five females and 133 males participated in the replication study. Because four people declared another gender, they were excluded from the analyses (this eligibility criterion was declared in the pre-registration form). First, we performed t-tests for preregistered effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">5</ref> . We found that males engaged more often in gambling but not in risky recreational activities or frequently drinking alcoholic beverages (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Thus the effects were partially replicated.</p><p>Additionally, we performed exploratory analyses for all other risk behavior questions <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. We found that males declared that they engage in fast driving or breaking traffic laws more often than females. Moreover, they also had a higher tendency to drink heavily. Surprisingly, we found that females declared that they took more risk in a social domain: they got into arguments or expressed their opinion in public more often than males.  <ref type="bibr">(Traczyk et al., 2018) (S05)</ref> In this study, 133 participants made twelve high-payoff choices and twelve low-payoff choices in binary two-outcome gambles framed as gains. Choice problems differed in their expected value (EV) ratios. When the EV ratio was high, choice problems could be regarded as meaningful because selecting an option with a higher EV could lead to a higher payoff. When the EV ratio was low, choice problems could be regarded as trivial because irrespective of a chosen option, playing them repeatedly would lead to relatively small differences in payoffs.</p><p>Individual differences in objective numeracy, subjective numeracy, fluid intelligence, and the need for cognition were measured to investigate their relationships with choices under risk and adaptive strategy selection.</p><p>Results showed that objective numeracy was related to adaptive strategy selection. That is, participants with higher objective numeracy, in comparison to participants with lower objective numeracy, maximized EV only when choice problems were meaningful (i.e., they were associated with high payoffs). When choice problems were trivial (i.e., choosing the option with a higher EV did not result in a large payoff), they switched to a heuristic strategy.</p><p>In contrast, people with higher subjective numeracy maximized EV in choice problems irrespective of the payoff. Subjective numeracy was related to more choices maximizing EV in both low-payoff problems (r = .200, p = .021, d = 0.408) and high-payoff problems (r = .323, p &lt; .001, d = 0.683).</p><p>In the current study (N = 202), we wanted to replicate the effect of subjective numeracy in choices under risk. Participants completed a subjective numeracy test and made decisions in 24 choice problems. In contrast to the original study, an objective numeracy test, fluid intelligence test, and the need for cognition scale were not administered. We found that subjective numeracy was significantly related to the number of choices maximizing EV in high-payoff problems (r = .195, p = .005, d = 0.398) but it became non-significant in low-payoff problems (r = .086, p = .221, d = 0.173). Nevertheless, these two correlations did not differ significantly (Z = 1.558; p = .119). The effect was partially replicated and smaller than in the original study.</p><p>2.3.6. Framing of moral choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Parkinson &amp; Byrne, 2017)</ref>  <ref type="formula">S06</ref>This research focused on testing the moral echoing effect, which is a tendency to praise the decision-maker for a good outcome when a sure option is chosen, but to blame the decision-maker for a bad outcome after a risky choice in a loss frame. Nevertheless, in the present study, we only aimed to replicate the effect of choice framing (gain vs. loss) on the moral acceptability of risky vs. safe options.</p><p>In the original study, a modified Asian disease problem was used. Two hundred and seven participants were randomized across a 2(decision-maker's choice: sure vs. risk) x 2(frame: gain vs. loss) x 2(hypothetical outcome: good vs. bad) between-subjects experimental design. They were asked to indicate, among other things, whether the decision-maker (i.e., John) is morally responsible for people dying/surviving. Moreover, before the main task, participants were asked whether each choice (safe vs. risky) was morally acceptable using a 5-point scale (1completely disagree, 5-completely agree). This was a control analysis to check whether participants tended to make the typical responses observed in framing studies (prefer a sure option in a gain frame and risky option in a loss frame). Still, this effect was a target for our replication.</p><p>In the original research, a 2(frame: gain vs. loss; between-subjects) x 2(choice: sure vs risky option; within-subjects) ANOVA was conducted. The authors observed a main effect of choice, F(1, 199) = 4.11, p &lt; .05, ηp 2 =.02 , main effect of frame, F(1, 199) = 19.37, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = .09, and an interaction of choice and frame, F(1, 199) = 24.49, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = .11. The participants perceived risk choices as more morally acceptable in the loss frame F(1, 96) = 32.31, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 =.25. Choosing the sure option was perceived as more morally acceptable in the gain frame than in the loss, F(1, 205) = 47.06, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 =.19.</p><p>Because our replication study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to change the original "Asian Disease" into "novel and unknown disease in Ireland". All other details remained the same as the original scenario. Participants were randomly assigned to the gain vs. loss conditions (ngain = 93; nloss = 109). The results of our study showed a main effect of frame F(1, 200) = 8.12, p = .005, ηp 2 = .04, but not of choice F(1, 200) = 2.53, p = .113, ηp 2 = .01. However, we observed an interaction of choice and frame, F(1, 200) = 9.98, p = .003, ηp 2 = .04. Post-hoc tests with Bonferroni correction revealed that people perceived choosing a sure option in a gain frame as most morally acceptable (M = 3.63, SD = 1.06) while choosing this option in a loss frame was perceived as least morally acceptable (M = 3.00, SD = 1.01), t = 4.115, p &lt; .001. Nevertheless, we did not observe a significant difference in moral acceptability of risky options depending on the frame (Mgain = 3.15; SDgain = 1.03; Mloss = 3.15; SDloss = 1.09), t = 0.024; p = 1.00. Generally, all the significant differences were found only between ratings of a safe option in a gain frame and other conditions (p = .013 for choosing risky option in the context of gains; p = .010 for choosing risky option in the context of losses).</p><p>Thus, we argue that the effect of framing was only partially replicated.</p><p>2.3.7.

In the first model, we included openness-to-experience and anchors as predictors. The model was statistically significant: F(2, 189) = 3.74, p = .026. A high anchor led to higher estimates of the river's length, b = 454.25, t = 2.490, p = .014. There was no effect of openness-to-experience, b = 34.95, t = 1.188, p = .235.

Anchoring in estimation tasks <ref type="bibr">(Jacowitz &amp; Kahneman, 1995) (C25)</ref> In this study, 103 students answered three consecutive questions in each of 15 problems (for instance, assessing the height of Mount Everest or the number of United Nations members). Firstly, they respond if the right answer is bigger or smaller than the anchor.</p><p>Secondly, they estimated the exact quantity. Jacowitz and Kahneman used an anchoring index (AI) to check the difference between groups. They calculated it as a quotient of the difference between medians in two conditions and the difference between two anchors. In this sense, AI measures the movement of the median estimate provided by participants toward the anchor they were presented with. The value of AI = 0 informs that there was no anchoring effect, while the value of AI = 1 suggests that median estimates provided by anchored participants are equal to the shown anchors. AI can be calculated separately for the low and high anchors. The overall mean of the AI in the original 15 problems was 0.49 (0.51 for the high anchors and 0.49 for the low anchors),</p><p>suggesting that the median estimation moved approximately halfway toward the anchor.

The value of mean AI was similar to the original study (0.47) and bigger in the high anchor condition (0.61) than in the low anchor condition (0.27). The mean value of the point-biserial correlation between participants' estimates and anchors over the 15 problems we used in the replication study was r = .46, p &lt; .001. In addition to the original study, we performed a Student's t-test for independent groups for all 15 items separately. The difference between groups was statistically significant in 10/15 cases. The effect was successfully replicated.  <ref type="bibr">(Kivetz &amp; Simonson, 2002) (C26)</ref> In this study, participants were asked to imagine two frequency programs. The first program offered a luxury reward (i.e., pampering Swedish massage or two tickets for a concert at the San Francisco Symphony), while the second program offered a necessity reward (i.e., credit toward a future grocery bill). They had to choose one preferable program. In two studies, researchers manipulated the level of effort participants must invest to obtain the reward. For example, in the first study, participants (N = 159) were informed that they could get a reward in a car rental loyalty program if they rent a car 10 times (low effort and requirements) or 20 times (high effort and requirements). In the second study (N = 294), they were informed that they would get the reward in a loyalty program in Macy's shops after accumulating either $1,000 or $2,000 of purchases.</p><p>In the frequent car renter program, 26% of participants preferred a luxury reward when requirements were lower. The proportion was higher (41%) when requirements were also higher. The difference was statistically significant, χ 2 = 4.1, p &lt; .05. In the frequent Macy's shopper program, 34% of participants preferred a luxury reward when requirements were low.</p><p>Again, the proportion was higher (45%) when requirements were higher, and the difference was statistically significant, χ 2 = 3.9, p &lt; .05.</p><p>In the original study, participants were recruited at the airport. In the replication study, we collected data using an online questionnaire. Participants were presented with two programs: a loyalty program for a cinema's clients and a loyalty program for a clothing retailer's clients. In the first scenario, participants had two options as a reward to choose from: massage or credit toward a future discount store bill. In the second scenario, they were offered a voucher for a theatre show ticket or a discount bill.</p><p>In the cinema loyalty program condition (n = 184; 18 participants did not select any reward), 33% of participants preferred a luxury reward when requirements were lower (10 purchased tickets, n = 94). The proportion decreased (to 23%) when requirements were higher (20 purchased tickets, n = 90), but the difference was not statistically significant, χ 2 (1, N = 184) = 2.11, p = .146, φ = 0.11.</p><p>In the case of the clothing retailer's loyalty program (n = 201; 1 participant did not answer a question regarding reward), 40% of participants preferred a luxury reward when requirements were lower (accumulating 1000 PLN of purchases, n = 101). The proportion decreased (to 19%) when requirements were higher (accumulating 2000 PLN of purchases, n = 100). The difference was statistically significant, but in the opposite direction to the original study: χ 2 (1, N = 201) = 10.29, p &lt; .001, φ = 0.23. The effect was not replicated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Discussion</head><p>The main goal of this project was to replicate a series of studies that were originally used to test effects related to judgment and decision making. Altogether, we aimed to conceptually replicate 15 effects concerning such issues as framing, anchoring, risk propensity, decisionmaking styles, etc. In 12 out of 15 cases, we succeeded in replicating the original effects, either completely or partially (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Supplementary Table S1</ref> for the summary of replicated effects).</p><p>Among seven successfully replicated effects, we can find well-established JDM effects:</p><p>the sunk cost <ref type="bibr">(Garland, 1990)</ref>, the anchoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jacowitz &amp; Kahneman, 1995)</ref>, the framing <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Peters et al., 2006)</ref>, and the "less-is-better" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hsee, 1998)</ref> effects. Notably, in the case of these effects, our results are consistent with the previous replication studies. For example, the anchoring effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jacowitz &amp; Kahneman, 1995)</ref> was successfully replicated in the Many Labs project <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Klein et al., 2014)</ref> and the "less-is-better" effect in the Many Labs 2 project <ref type="bibr">(Klein et al., 2018)</ref>. In our study, other successfully replicated effects regarded the role of individual differences in decision making, such as the role of openness to experience in susceptibility to anchoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(McElroy &amp; Dowd, 2007)</ref>, the positive relationship between procrastination and dependent decision-making style <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Geisler &amp; Allwood, 2018)</ref>, and the self-control's impact on financial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Strömbäck et al., 2017)</ref>. Importantly, even though there were substantial differences in research materials used in the original and replication studies, most effects were successfully replicated. For example, we used the length of the Odra river as an anchor (the second-longest Polish river) instead of the Mississippi River, and we changed miles to kilometers <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(McElroy &amp; Dowd, 2007)</ref>. In the replication of the "less-is-better" effect, we changed the currency (PLN instead of USD) and provided more ecologically valid prices for products (coat and scarf) by replacing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">$5,</ref><ref type="bibr">$45,</ref><ref type="bibr">$50,</ref><ref type="bibr">$55,</ref><ref type="bibr">and $500 with 15 PLN,</ref><ref type="bibr">130 PLN,</ref><ref type="bibr">150 PLN,</ref><ref type="bibr">200 PLN,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 600 PLN.</ref> In the case of five of the effects, our replication success was only partial. We defined the partial success when the main effect was significant, but some of the post-hoc tests were not significant or when the effect was significant only for some items/conditions. We observed such a pattern in the case of the following effect: priming of instrumental risk attitude <ref type="bibr">(Zaleśkiewicz, 2008)</ref>, the effect of gender on risk taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Harris et al., 2006)</ref>, the relationship between subjective numeracy and risky choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Traczyk et al., 2018)</ref>, and the effect framing on the moral acceptability of risky vs. safe option <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Parkinson &amp; Byrne, 2017)</ref>. Interestingly, the second operationalization of the "less-is-better" was only partially successful <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hsee, 1998</ref>): we found a significant effect in the joint evaluation condition but not when the items were evaluated separately.</p><p>In three studies that were conducted in our project, we did not find effects that were consistent with original results. The first study in this set concerned the relationship between decision quality and participants' focus on either information or emotion, as compared to the control condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mikels et al., 2010)</ref>. In the original study, the authors found that younger participants made better decisions when they focused on information (compared to controls), but no such difference was observed between the emotion focus condition and the control condition. In our project, the differences between all pairs of conditions were insignificant.</p><p>One potential explanation was that our replication was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the decision was related to health issues. In the pandemic, people often faced information that later turned out to be incorrect <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Van Bavel et al., 2020)</ref> which may have reduced people's general trust in medical knowledge, and even instructing participants to focus on information may not positively impact the quality of their decisions.</p><p>The second study without successful replication was related to the framing effect in decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981)</ref>. In the original study, saving $5 was attractive for the majority of participants when the product's price was low ($15) but not when the product's price was high ($125). Here, the reason behind the lack of replication may be due to the fact that we had to make several changes in the experimental stimuli. First, we changed the currency from $ to PLN (Polish Zloty). Second, we used different products than <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tversky and Kahneman (1981)</ref> did in their study. Nevertheless, in the Many Labs 2 project <ref type="bibr">(Klein et al., 2018)</ref>, a similar approach for replicating this study was employed. <ref type="bibr">Klein et al., in</ref> consultation with one of the authors of the original study, adjusted the currency and replaced items (a ceramic vase and a wall hanging) as well. Still, their replication was successful, but the effect was much smaller than in original study.</p><p>Finally, the third study that we were not able to replicate concerned the effect of frequency program requirements on preferences between rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kivetz &amp; Simonson, 2002)</ref>. In the original experiment, the authors found that higher required effort makes consumers prefer luxury rather than necessity rewards. We did not observe such results in our replication. In this case, the lack of replication may also be related to the change in experimental stimuli. It is possible that the psychological difference between the rewards we presented as either a luxury reward or a necessity reward was too small, and participants did not perceive both rewards in a way we expected. Additionally, the original study was conducted in an airport where there are more luxurious rewards such as first-class lounges, duty-free shops, fancy sitting arrangements as compared to home settings. This factor could also be a reason for unsuccessful replication.</p><p>To summarize, we successfully replicated 80% of the original studies that were included in our project. The replication rate we found in our research was higher than the one reported by the Open Science Foundation (Open Science Collaboration, 2015), which is less than 50%. However, it resembled the results found in the Many Labs registered replication project <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Klein et al., 2014)</ref> that replicated approximately 77% of the original effects.</p><p>Importantly, our aim was not to conduct direct or close replications but rather to test the generalizability of these effects to other contexts, as well as investigate their validity and possible boundary conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fabrigar et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hüffmeier et al., 2016)</ref>. Thus, our procedures differed from the originals in several ways (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref>). If replication differs from the original study in too many details, we cannot be sure that the lack of support for the original effect is not caused by such changes. Since our study was exploratory in nature, future research should directly aim to investigate distinct differences: such as currency or products. Such an approach would allow putting forward specific hypotheses regarding replication success. It would also be valuable to conduct the prediction market among experts before collecting data (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dreber et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hüffmeier et al. (2016)</ref> suggested, to ensure the testing of reproducibility of the effect, development of theory, and practical relevance, researchers should aim to conduct a series of replication studies varying in a scale of differences from the original research (exact replication, close replication, constructive replication, conceptual replication in the laboratory, conceptual replication in the field).</p><p>In our project, despite the obvious differences between original research and replication attempts, such as language/translation, currency, current (epidemic) context, we also faced challenges with obtaining original research materials. Often, the exact wording was not available in original manuscripts or supplementary materials. Moreover, in many cases, we</p><p>were not able to precisely calculate effect sizes for power analyses. Thus, we estimated them based on the available information. We argue that more JDM researchers should adopt Open Science practices such as open materials and open data to make this research more reproducible. For example, even among very recent (2015-2020) articles published in a wellknown journal (i.e., Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes; Impact Factor: 4.9), only 22% had available research materials, and 32% provided access to the dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Logg &amp; Dorison, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, how can JDM researchers improve the replication rate in their field? We argue that adopting other solutions developed by the Open Science movement-pre-registrations and Registered Reports-may help. In the pre-registrations (on websites such as osf.io or aspredicted.org), researchers could describe their effects of interest, hypotheses, method, sample size, and detailed plan of analysis before the study is conducted. This approach helps to delineate between confirmatory analyses and exploratory analyses. Confirmatory analyses allow for testing predictions/hypotheses, and exploratory analyses help generate predictions for future research. Generally, the number of pre-registered studies has sharply increased in the last few years, especially in psychology journals (such as Psychological Science or Journal of Experimental Psychology: General) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Simmons et al., 2021)</ref>. Nevertheless, in some fields, e.g., consumer research journals (Journal of Consumer Research, Journal of Consumer Psychology), the pre-registration rate is still low <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Simmons et al., 2021)</ref>. In JDM journals, when we look at Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, only 9%</p><p>of papers provided pre-registration <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Logg &amp; Dorison, 2021)</ref>. Thus, to ensure fewer falsepositive results, more JDM scholars should pre-register their studies.</p><p>Second, to improve the quality of research, scientists may consider submitting their works as Registered Reports (it is possible in many journals such as Judgement and Decision</p><p>Making or Psychological Science). In this format, reviewers evaluate the quality of the introduction, method, and plan of analyses before the study is conducted. If authors follow the accepted plan, their article is published even when their results do not support the hypotheses. The study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Soderberg et al. (2021)</ref> showed that Registered Reports were assessed by experts as better in all criteria (from the rigor of methodology and results to novelty and creativity) when compared with other (non-registered) papers.</p><p>To summarize, the majority of the JDM effects chosen by psychology students replicated in a Polish setting; even our research materials differed from originals in many ways (e.g., language, culture, currency), and a study was conducted in a special context (during COVID-19 pandemic). Moreover, we showed that it is possible to engage undergraduate students in</p><p>Poland to promote Open Science and accumulate evidence for the generalizability and validity of various JDM effects. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.
