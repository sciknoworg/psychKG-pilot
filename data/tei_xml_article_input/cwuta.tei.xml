<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>   <p>system of values An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) As we will demonstrate, the temporal stability of all systems, from the earliest formed, simplest atoms onwards, is dependent on the cooperation of their components. We locate such systems in the conservative/cooperative quadrant of a universal motivational map (UMM) with a structure equivalent to that of Schwartz's system. In the anthropocentric terminology of the ten personal values 1 of  system, this is equivalent to the 'traditions' of all stable systems being dependent on the mutual 'benevolence' of their components. Sustainable internalized motivations for competition and change only emerged in the evolution of the complex adaptive systems of organisms. Of organismic systems, only that of the human mind would appear capable of generating change based on cooperative motivations associated with near universal, conscious appreciations of the greater systems of which it is part.</p><p>We consider the possibility that if human values evolved sequentially as components of an increasingly sophisticated decision-making mechanism, they may still exert a hierarchical pattern of influence on human cognition and decision-making. Comparing individual responses to a selection of decision-making tasks with corresponding personal values profiles, we present experimental evidence that suggest they do. Since we are not aware of any competing theory that would predict this, the plausible explanation we provide for these otherwise unexpected findings invites further investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory in psychology</head><p>Borghi and Fini (2019) identify a lack of emphasis on theoretical contributions as a deficiency of modern psychological science. While acknowledging the importance of empirical investigation, they point out that without a broad-based theoretical framework, core principles that accelerate scientific progress are likely to be missed. Specifically, they state "complex phenomena such as mental and cognitive processes can be understood only starting from multiple perspectives" <ref type="bibr">(Borghi &amp; Fini, 2019, p.1)</ref>, and "prioritizing empirical results over theory can instead lead to a growing tendency to obtain fragmented and conflicting evidence about a phenomenon" <ref type="bibr">(Borghi &amp; Fini, 2019, p2</ref>).</p><p>Theories may be judged by the degree of informed consensus surrounding them. This tends to decrease as one moves up the hierarchy of sciences <ref type="bibr">(Comte, 1854)</ref>: from fundamental mathematics and physics, through the increasingly complex sciences of chemistry and biology, to the social sciences and psychology <ref type="bibr">(Fanelli &amp; Glanzel, 2013)</ref>. Whatever the theoretical challenges of maths and physics, they are as nothing compared to those facing psychologists. Whereas the widely accepted theories of physics concern just 12 fundamental building blocks of nature and 4 forces <ref type="bibr">(Fermilab, 2014)</ref>, psychologists are tasked with making sense of the outputs of an unimaginably complex set of interactions between approximately 60 trillion neural network connections (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gulati, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The five-factor model, whether in its appended HEXACO form or not, is arguably one the best established in psychology, and the most widely adopted in the study of personality. Yet <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Block (2010)</ref> criticised it for being atheoretical; falling short because it is incomplete, non-systematic, and simply descriptive. He said that what is needed is "an adaptive paradigm … a model or point of view or productive principles that can, in Gell-Mann's memorable and guiding phrase, generate sufficient 'surface complexity arising out of deep simplicity'" <ref type="bibr">(Block, 2010, p.22)</ref>. He echoed <ref type="bibr">McAdams &amp; Pals (2006, p. 204</ref>) statement that the aim for the study of personality is "to provide an integrative framework for understanding the whole person" <ref type="bibr">(Block, 2010, p.19)</ref>. Also saying "It is about time we recognized that heredity and environment are not simply additively related; their connection is complex and nonlinear, often synergistic" <ref type="bibr">(Block, 2010, p.5)</ref>.</p><p>We argue that the  values model replicates a motivational structure that delivers on all of <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Block's (2010)</ref> aspirations. It is systematic, complete, and, when considered in relation to fundamental principles and insights from physics, evolution by natural selection, and complexity theory, offers a simple, unifying perspective from which to explain all human psychological and social phenomena. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gell-Mann (1994)</ref> himself observed that traversing the layers of complexity between the fundamental mechanisms of physics and the high-level emergent phenomena of psychology requires computations of intractable complexity. However, he believed similarities among systems at different levels point toward connections between the fundamental and the emergent that could be used to approach a deeper understanding.</p><p>Evolution in this universe has been driven by the same fundamental motivational forces in accordance with the same physical laws for some <ref type="bibr">13.8 billion years (Kolb, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Planck Collaboration, 2020)</ref>. Countless, increasingly complex systems have emerged over this period. Of these, humanity, in the form of homo sapiens, emerged around 200-300,000 years ago <ref type="bibr">(Brooks et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Marean et al., 2007)</ref>: i.e., in the last forty-sixth-thousandth of this period. Yet, even evolutionary-and comparative-psychologists tend not to look beyond it when trying to build a clearer picture of why we are as we are (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bryer et al., 2020)</ref>. That the psychological phenomenon of personality has been attributed to organisms as simple as bacteria , which evolved three billion years ago <ref type="bibr">(Alegado &amp; King, 2019)</ref>, should draw attention to the possibility that such anthropocentric myopia may have inhibited our ability to achieve a deeper understanding.</p><p>In the following we traverse a vast scientific terrain: from quantum physics to social psychology through classical physics, chemistry, and evolutionary biology. In the interests of brevity and making the argument comprehensible to psychologists who may be unfamiliar with much of this terrain, we have endeavoured to offer explanations in the simplest possible terms while remaining true to the underlying science. The principles described are universal and apply at every layer of evolving complexity. Their simplicity contrasts with the numerous, complex, and diverse emergent mechanisms for which they are responsible. While examples of these are provided, they are intended as way-markers rather than contiguous steppingstones by which to traverse the terrain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</head><p>Aside from considerations of brevity, when describing the evolution of complex systems, analysis of such detail is considered counter-productive, since the computations required to fully account for the evolutionary process are intractable (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Axelrod 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gell-Mann, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Holland, 1995)</ref>. Of greater interest are repetitive patterns that emerge at different levels of complexity, as these provide our best clues as to the universality of the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>The theory we advance has been developed from a transdisciplinary perspective. It is anchored in fundamental and universal principles, linked to the structure of  values model. It is not based on other psychological theories. Accordingly, we have neither reviewed nor extensively referred to examples of these in the main text. We provide commentary on relationships with prominent theories and models that may be of interest in the supplementary materials. Our evolutionary theory offers the potential to contextualise all such theories within a parsimonious framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core principles relevant to the evolution of the universe, and hence human psychology</head><p>It is beyond the scope of this article to fully describe the theories and well-established principles that drive the evolution of natural systems. In the supplementary materials (SM1) we provide brief descriptions and citations relating to selected core principles, namely: quantum uncertainty, the structure of atoms, gravitational and electromagnetic fields, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, energy transfer between systems, and evolution by natural selection. From these it follows that: (a) even the simplest, most stable atoms (from which all matter is made) are fundamentally dynamic systems; (b) all things in the universe are systematically connected such that they contribute to each other's environment, their influence on each other increasing exponentially with proximity, with gravity tending to draw systems together so they become entwined; (c) since energy cannot be destroyed or created, gains and losses to and from local systems must be compensated for in external systems -localised increases in order come at the expense of delocalised disorder; (d) all systems tend toward energetic equilibrium, with their components An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) displacing each other, so releasing kinetic energy (in the form of photons) to minimize their total potential energy (TPE); (e) since the electrons in atomic systems may only emit and absorb photons with energy levels particular to each atomic element, streams of photons pass between atomic systems, effectively transmitting information that is perceived and processed differently by different atomic systems; (f) systems (including organisms) evolve through a winnowing process akin to survival of the fittest, where fitness is derived from a system's ability to process (dissipate) energy more efficiently than competing systems in the context of its environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(England, 2015)</ref>, so accelerating entropy (disorder) globally in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Kaila &amp; Annila, 2008)</ref>. Accordingly, the human brain may be considered a consequence of 13.8 billion years of evolution by natural selection producing increasingly complex and energy-efficient processing systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Complexity and complex adaptive systems.</head><p>The <ref type="bibr">Schrodinger (1926)</ref> equation, which describes the wave functions 2 of quantum particles and their environmental interactions, represents a fundamental building block of quantum mechanical theory. Hence it may be regarded as key to explaining the existence and operation of all things in the universe. It can be used to accurately predict the permitted electron energy orbitals of atomic elements, and so their chemical properties. Armed with this and other equations and insights from quantum mechanics, one might consider it possible to accurately predict the behavior of all things from the behavior of their fundamental components. However, while the laws of physics enable us to predict the interactions of dynamic systems comprising just two bodies, the introduction of just a third gives rise to complex interactions that render systems chaotic and unpredictable, in the long term at least <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gowers et al., 2008)</ref>. Poincare's proof of this in 1890 led to the development of chaos theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Letellier et al., 2021)</ref>, of which the butterfly effect <ref type="bibr">(Lorenz, 1963)</ref> is possibly the best-known concept. This describes how very small changes in one part of a complex system may have very large <ref type="bibr">Holland (1995)</ref> describes fitness as context dependent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Dawkins ( , 1982</ref> considers this at multiple levels of complexity: from the context of a gene within a chromosome, to the context of a cell within an organ, to the context of organisms within an environment of overlapping extended phenotypes, to the context of memes within a culture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Dawkins (1982)</ref> introduced the concept of the extended phenotype to include all the effects of a gene: i.e., those beyond physiology and behavioral traits. Termite mounds, spider's webs, and beaver dams are among the examples of physical structures that are as much consequences of gene-environment interactions as the physical and neurological traits facilitating their construction. The construction of dam lakes by beavers directly affects the environments of other organisms, so setting in motion a chain of complex interactions. In the case of humanity, where the actions of one individual can affect a world population of 8 billion <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dion, 2022)</ref>, the potential for interacting extended phenotypes to trigger synchronized responses across the CAS of life on Earth is all too apparent. Because all things contribute to the environment of all other things, the interaction of extended phenotypes and other environmental interactions may generate feedback loops that contribute to reciprocal causations of evolution. The effects of these may be experienced at all levels of complexity, from the interaction of complex molecules in self-catalytic processes of the RNA world from which life may have emerged <ref type="bibr">Rich, 1965)</ref> upwards. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Hunter (2008)</ref> stresses the importance of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Dawkins' (1982)</ref> idea of extended phenotypes in the development of the current extended evolutionary synthesis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">Darwin's (1859)</ref> original theory of evolution.</p><p>The principles of natural selection are traditionally applied to biological evolution via reproduction.</p><p>However, just as organisms evolved from non-living complex molecules (e.g., Böttcher, 2018), the principles underlying evolution by natural selection pre-date the emergence of life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Pross (2005)</ref> considers fitness and natural selection to be representations of more fundamental concepts. Indeed, <ref type="bibr">Dawkins (1989, p.12)</ref> suggested that 'survival of the fittest' might be reconsidered as a special case of 'survival of the most stable'. An equivalent of which may be used to explain the abundance of free stable atoms such as those of carbon and gold, and free molecules of water, oxygen, and cellulose, at the expense of more reactive (less stable) free atoms of potassium, sodium, and lithium. So, while potassium atoms are of themselves considered stable, and potassium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, its susceptibility to reacting with Earth's abundant oxygen and water molecules ensures its atoms never occur in their free form <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Emsley, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Chemical reactions leading to the survival of the most stable tend to be settled relatively quickly, as atomic and molecular systems reconfigure into more energy-efficient states of equilibrium. By contrast, the fitness of organisms can only be determined over many generations. Rather than evolve through single interactions between stable states, organisms retain coherence by maintaining far-from-equilibrium states <ref type="bibr">(Prignone &amp; Nicolis, 1985)</ref> by continually absorbing and dissipating energy. Inanimate CAS, such as sand dunes and hurricanes, maintain far-from-equilibrium states by passively absorbing energy from their environment, whereas organisms actively orchestrate its acquisition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cooperation and competition</head><p>Consistent with quantum uncertainty , all stable systems in equilibrium are fundamentally dynamic, in that their constituent particles can never be at rest. Accordingly, their constituents cooperate to maintain system stability: literally, work together to the same end <ref type="bibr">(Oxford Dictionaries, 2023)</ref>. The scientific definition of work is to transfer energy. In a stable system that has minimized its TPE, such as an atom, energy may be transferred between components but must be conserved overall <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Moskowitz, 2014)</ref>. Systems become unstable when disequilibrium causes the displacement of components as they move to minimize their TPE, radiating kinetic energy as they do so.</p><p>In an ecological context, competition concerns interactions involved in attempting to gain a share of a limited resource <ref type="bibr">(Oxford Dictionaries, 2023)</ref>. In the context of physical systems, this limited resource is their minimum TPE. This is subject to localised environmental constraints. For example, while most atoms are stable in most environments, in high energy environments, such as those encountered in stars and supernovas, they may become unstable. In these environments lower minima of TPE become possible. Iron and Nickel atoms have the most energy-efficient, tightly bound nuclei, and so are the most stable atomic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fewell, 1995)</ref>. Given the abundance of elements in the universe tends to decline with mass, the relatively high abundance of iron and nickel in the solar system <ref type="bibr">(Arnett, 1995)</ref> would appear to be an example of <ref type="bibr">Dawkin's (1989)</ref> preferential 'survival of the most stable'.</p><p>Cooperation and competition are opposing factors in evolution, yet, due to the first law of thermodynamics, and the fact that systems can only be in equilibrium or not, they are also complementary. Their importance in evolution by natural selection, the functioning of organisms, and, more generally, in the study of CAS is widely acknowledged <ref type="bibr">(Axelrod, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bovaird 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Holland, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Nowak &amp; Highfield, 2012)</ref>. The model most frequently refenced to illustrate the relationship between them (see <ref type="bibr">Kaufmann, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Nowak &amp; Highfield, 2012</ref>) is game theory's The Prisoner's Dilemma, developed by Flood and Drechsler at the RAND corporation <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Poundstone, 1993)</ref>. Its wide-ranging utility may be appreciated by relating its basic premise and scoring system to energetic interactions between physical systems. In the game two players are faced with an identical binary choice: whether to seek to maximise their personal benefit at the cost of the other (defect/compete) or refuse to do so, preferring to share the same fate (cooperate). Each makes their decision without knowledge of what the other will do, yet their outcomes are co-dependent on these decisions. These can be scored as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">fig. 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2 The Prisoner's Dilemma scoring matrix</head><p>Axelrod &amp; <ref type="bibr">Hamilton (1981)</ref> staged a competition for research purposes in which game theorists in economics, sociology, political science, and mathematics were invited to submit strategies for playing an iterated version of The Prisoners Dilemma. No limits were placed on the complexity or simplicity of the strategies. The winning strategy -'tit for tat' -was simple: to cooperate first and then, in all subsequent rounds, repeat what the other player did in the previous round. If both players cooperate, they maximise their joint returns. If the other player defects they will be punished for doing so in the next round. The strategy of 'always defect' may be considered rational, since it ensures a player cannot come off worse than their opponent and offers the potential of maximizing one's relative gain. 'Always defect' is considered an evolutionary stable strategy because it cannot be beaten by a single mutated alternative (Cowde,, 2012). However, when played by two rational players it is highly unlikely the other party will choose to continue cooperating, taking the 'sucker's payoff' <ref type="bibr">(Axelrod &amp; Hamilton, 1981)</ref> of 0 points while ceding 5 points to the other player. Accordingly, it is more likely they will get stuck with 1 point each. Evolution by natural selection may not be rational, but through extensive trial and error it tends toward optimal solutions. A version of Holland's genetic algorithm, when presented with the same challenge, arrived at an improved version of tit for tat by allowing for the possibility of bluffing one's opponent <ref type="bibr">(Axelrod, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>If points are taken to represent energy, a meeting of cooperative strategies maximises energy conservation by the conjoined physical system of the two 'players', whereas competitive encounters involve much loss of energy. For example, two oxygen atoms combine to form molecular oxygen with little loss of energy, whereas reactions between potassium and water are violent: resulting in much energy loss through physical movement, heat, and light. Given that, in nature, systems may retain and accrue energy so that 'points' accumulate between 'rounds of play', not only does cooperation maximise energy-efficiency it also has the potential to allow systems to gain power relative to those 'playing by' other strategies, and so outcompete them. In the case of organisms subject to competition from resistant prey, hostile predators, bacteria, viruses, etc., this gives them greater potential to sustain damage and prevail. In the case of human systems, organizations in which individuals cooperate may more efficiently direct their energies to corporate endeavour than those in which energy is consumed in internal competition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Deery &amp; Iverson, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Spurny et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The evolution of robust, adaptive physical systems may be compared to that of similarly robust, adaptive information processing systems, such as the human brain. While potentially damaging, misleading information may gain a hold, abilities to seek out and reference an increasingly integrated (cooperative) knowledge base and intelligently process incongruous (competitive) information, potentiates humanity's accumulation and ability to access ever greater stores of useful information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase transitions and punctuated equilibrium: emergent traits and motivations</head><p>Perfectly cooperative stable systems cannot evolve. Evolution requires some disruption: some competition. The evolutionary sequence leading from quantum particles to humanity can be considered in terms of transitions between stable systems in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Novikoff's (1945)</ref> integrative levels of organization. In the beginning, competition between quantum particles resolved into the cooperative systems of hydrogen and helium atoms. In the more energetic environments of An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) supernovae the stability of these systems was disrupted again, sometimes repeatedly, before their components stabilized into a sequence of heavier elements. In turn, these collided, forming stable molecules. These were drawn together by gravitational attraction to form new stars, including our sun, and associated planetary systems. On Earth further transitions brought about the emergence and evolution of meteorological, geological, and geomorphic processes. Through these, a succession of increasingly complex molecular systems evolved, paving the way to life (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Salthe, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Steffen et al. 2020)</ref>.</p><p>While uncertainty remains concerning the precise origins of life, the 'RNA World' theory <ref type="bibr">(Rich, 1965)</ref>, which has ribonucleic acid as the immediate pre-cursor to the last common ancestor of life on Earth, remains one of the best supported (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Rana &amp; Ankri, 2016)</ref>. Whatever the first living molecule, many evolutionary stages may have passed before prokaryotic cells established themselves as cooperating systems of previously independent replicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Queller &amp; Strassmann, 2009)</ref>. Over approximately 4 billion years organismic evolution brought about the emergence of eukaryotes, archeans, algae, plants, fungi, and countless more, increasingly complex, organisms <ref type="bibr">(Betts et al, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dawkins, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The sequential emergence of increasingly complex and energy-efficient systems may be regarded in terms of phase transitions. In these, pre-existing components are reconfigured and recombined into new stable forms that best satisfy the second law of thermodynamics given localised environmental constraints. These emergent entities will most likely have different traits from their constituent parts. So, while, for example, the basic systematic building blocks of neutrons and atoms are neutrally charged, their constituents (respectively: up and down quarks, and protons and electrons) are positively and negatively charged. Consequently, they are motivated to behave differently with respect to electromagnetic fields. Different configurations of these atomic constituents endow the elements of the periodic table with different traits. For example, those of helium render it an inert, colorless gas in the Earth's environment, yet when those of three atoms of helium transition into single atoms of carbon, they manifest themselves as a chemically active, electrically conductive, black solid. The electron structure of helium renders its valence shell complete, and as such provides it with no motivation to react with other chemicals, whereas carbon is 'willing' to bond with itself and other atoms. This adaptability lending it to become an essential component of all organisms: representing 18.5% by mass of the human body <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Shah, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The novel traits of emergent systems are particular to the local environment in which they emerge.</p><p>At room temperature, water is an electrically conductive liquid, in contrast to its non-conductive gaseous components of hydrogen and oxygen. Water becomes gaseous at 100 O C and solid as 0 O C, losing much of its conductivity. Even fundamental traits such as the mass of particles are determined by their interactions with the <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Higgs (1964)</ref> Field: an all-pervasive quantum field. As previously discussed, the fitness-enhancing potential of organismic traits are similarly context dependent.</p><p>Behavioral traits mediate between the needs of an organism and its environment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Sih et al., 2003)</ref>. Genes that promote behaviors best adapted to satisfying an organism's survival and reproductive needs will be preferred by natural selection. As such, they may be considered products of interactions between the systems of organisms and the systems of their environment.</p><p>Consequently, in the sweep of millions of years of evolution, they may be considered transitory.</p><p>Therefore, if we are seeking fundamental truths about the nature of human psychology, including personality, behavioral traits can only provide indirect clues. They are ultimately products of interactions between fundamental motives (directly related to the second law of thermodynamics) and the environment in which they are expressed.</p><p>Previously stable non-living systems may be destabilized by inputs of energy that exceed their ability to maintain cooperative order through absorption and emission. Once this happens displaced components compete to establish new relationships that minimize their TPE in the context of their changed environment (see <ref type="figure">fig. 3</ref>). In chemistry, the energy required to initiate these transitions is known as activation energy. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> shows a transition in which the TPE of an evolving local system is lowered. Previously stable systems may be broken into simpler components in certain environments, such as when water molecules are split into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis. However, in accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Novikoff's (1945)</ref> concept of integrative levels, the evolutionary history of the universe suggests a trend toward greater complexity and integration. The components of pre-existing stable systems with unique properties are recombined into newly emergent stable systems with their own characteristic properties. The distinctive properties of organisms, and in turn of humanity, being no different in this respect <ref type="bibr">(Adami et al, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 3 Phase transition between stable cooperative states</head><p>Unlike atoms, which are mostly unbreakable in the environmental conditions found on Earth, molecules tend to be more easily destabilized. Those of carbon dioxide, for example, are decomposed as part of photosynthesis in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">(Singhal, 1999)</ref>. The energies required to move more complex arrangements of unbound molecules of gas and sand in CAS of persistent weather and dune systems may be even lower. Consequently, while whole systems of loosely or unbound components may endure for extended periods, localised transitions involving the relocation/recycling of their constituents may be continuous.</p></div>

While the oscillating reactions may persist for many minutes, the reaction gradually comes to an end as the reactants are exhausted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 4 Energy exchanges in far-from-equilibrium systems</head><p>Where previously stable systems undergo single phase transitions, such far-from-equilibrium systems may transition between multiple micro-states with near continuous energy exchanges (see <ref type="figure">fig.4</ref>). In weather and sand dune systems the activating source of energy comes from the external environment, whereas in the Briggs-Rauscher (1973) it appears to come from within. However, from the perspective of each reactant, the other effectively defines its environment. Such dynamic systems may be said to comprise components pursuing competitive strategies, yet they maintain orderly structures. In the case of dunes, most of the sand grains cooperate in maintaining the structure of each dune. The management of change/evolution involves competition between a relatively small proportion of sand grains and the external environment. Functionally, organisms also manage the competitive processes of change while maintaining relatively stable cooperative systems of cellular components <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Nowak &amp; Highfield, 2012)</ref>.

Perfect cooperation may be associated with the former and unfettered competition with the latter. However, due to gravitational and electromagnetic attraction, competition tends to be resolved in localised equilibrium or, in the case of CAS, dynamic stability. Accordingly, the universe may be considered a dynamic system in which cooperative and competitive strategies are intimately and inextricably entwined. Considered in this way it is apparent cooperation and competition, and their relationships with change, could be considered components of a universal motivational fractal.   system of values  system of values is a well-established motivational model that explores the relationships between stability and change, and cooperation and competition.  named the poles of its orthogonal axes as conservation and openness to change, and selftranscendence and self-enhancement. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 5</ref> shows this basic structure rendered as a universal motivational map. Justified by functional correspondence (e.g., Aelenei et al., 2020) competition replaces self-enhancement, change replaces openness to change, and cooperation replaces selftranscendence. Replacing anthropocentric terminology with terms applicable to any system makes it easier to bridge perceptual divisions between the motives of humanity, other organisms, and nonliving systems.</p><p>Prior to the emergence of organisms, all stable systems conserved energy through the cooperation of their components, and so can be said to have motives belonging to the conservation/cooperation quadrant. They change and evolve because of random collisions with other systems (or fundamental particles) moving chaotically through their shared environment. In this sense, the motivation for change comes from without.</p><p>Dynamic systems, such as storms and dunes, seem to have components exhibiting cooperative and competitive strategies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motives for competition and change</head><p>For some, the significant divides between humanity and our ape ancestors, between mammals and single celled organisms, and between life and inanimate matter, seem too great to be traversed by gradual evolution through chaotic collisions. However, that is the conclusion scientists are drawn to (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Salthe, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Steffen et al. 2020)</ref>. Therefore, rather than confine considerations of the evolution of human psychology within the framework of 300,000 years of homo sapiens, we might do well to embrace the more radical framework suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gell-Mann (1994)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Holland (1995)</ref>, , and others. Until the emergence of life, it seems no sustainable local system could harness motivations to initiate competition, change, and innovate. Yet, as history attests, the universal system did. It would be consistent with the observations and models of those studying CAS (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Gell-Mann, Holland, Kauffman, Simon, etc.)</ref> that smaller CAS should evolve within the greater CAS of which they are part An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) and replicate aspects of their structure. In so doing they betray something of the shared 'algorithm' that generated them by illuminating something of the relationship between traits and underlying motivations. Newly emergent systems may have novel traits, but these are derived from those of their constituents, which are in turn derived from the universal laws of physics as they play out in systemic interactions. So, while the neutral charge of the first hydrogen atoms was a novel trait that distinguished them from their proton and electron constituents, it derived from the sum of the positive and negative charges of their components, which were retained. The much later emergence of such novel traits as flight and consciousness in the complex systems of organisms can also be derived from pre-existing traits of pre-existing component systems.</p><p>Organisms first took flight approximately 400 million years ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dunning, 2014)</ref>. Prior to this, as now, leaves, seeds, and inorganic matter would have been transported above the Earth's surface by air currents. The aerodynamic traits that facilitate flight were already in place. Evolution simply facilitated the emergence of mechanisms for flight from pre-existing interactions between systems.</p><p>It did so via many phase transitions, likely including mechanisms that assist gliding in modern species (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Siddall et al., 2020)</ref>.

Consciousness involves modeling the internal and external environment to aid goal-directed activity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Pennartz et al., 2019)</ref>. As such, it demands, at the very least, abilities to gather, process, store, and relay information. The simplest atomic systems can do this by absorbing and emitting streams of information in the form of photons and processing them by 'deciding' the energy levels and directions of each emission. It also demands abilities to register and respond to this information in ways that facilitate awareness of a discrete host system (a 'self') in relation to its environment. When considered in relation to the closed loops within the brain-body system described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kotchoubey (2018)</ref> and the feedback loops of CAS, this suggests consciousness requires no more than complex rearrangements of pre-existing capabilities.</p><p>If so, the evolution of the full gamut of human psychology, including the traits associated with motives in the other three quadrants of our universal motivational map, and, by association, the values of  model, can be traced back to before the emergence of organisms.</p><p>Organisms are CAS (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Adami et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Brown, 1995)</ref> comprising many chemical components with low activation energies, that maintain near equilibrium states that are highly responsive to environmental changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Ross &amp; Berry, 2008)</ref>. As such, each component may be compared to a strategically placed grain of sand in a system of dunes, ready to fall into a location most advantageous to the system's orderly progression.</p><p>The first organism (like all subsequent lifeforms) would have been a molecular system that maintained a far-from-equilibirum state by absorbing and dissipating energy from and to its environment. Unlike inanimate systems, it had acquired the capacity to sustainably procure and process this energy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Mossel &amp; Steel, 2005)</ref>. Since the detail of how life emerged from non-life remains moot (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Sousa et al., 2013)</ref>, for the purposes of this discussion all that needs to be acknowledged is that the first organisms evolved almost 4 billion years ago <ref type="bibr">(Betts et al, 2018)</ref>. From then on, in accordance with the second law, natural selection preferred those able to process the greatest amount of energy most efficiently toward their own survival and reproduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(England, 2015)</ref>. This effectively gave rise to an arms race in the battle for access to resources: initially sources of food/energy and then, two million years later, to sexual partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">(Zimmer, 2009)</ref>. The first organisms may have been relatively passive components in the game of life: more like hands of cards in poker than players. Over time, natural selection imbued organisms with increasingly complex mechanisms, enabling even bacteria and plants to initiate competitive behavior <ref type="bibr">(Hibbing et</ref>  comparing these with previously stored information (memory) <ref type="bibr">(Bezdek, 1992)</ref>.

Stable, cooperative atomic and molecular systems represent the most basic of these. Organisms, like all other stable systems, require cooperating components: organelles, cells, organs, and integrating systems that work together to sustain and reproduce their host. Yet, the dynamism of each relies on highly constrained, subordinated competition. An important example being the electrochemical disequilibrium responsible for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, which performs key functions in all cellular activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Pfeiffer et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>Cooperation may be manifested externally between and with sexual partners, offspring, group/colony members, and even unrelated species in symbiotic relationships .</p><p>However, organismic interactions with the environment tend to be competitive: mechanisms that strip energy from other systems, including other organisms (e.g., digestion and metabolism), predatorial and defence mechanisms, and sexual reproductive strategies that seek to attract mates in competition with others. Such competitive strategies are outward facing and subordinated to serve the cooperative interests of the local systems of organisms. As such, they evolved to include An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) capacities for aggression, deception, and dishonesty (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bond &amp; Robinson, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hauser, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Proctor, 1991)</ref>, and for being unforgiving and unhelpful (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">, Hibbing et al., 2010</ref>.</p><p>When unmoderated competitive strategies evolve within a local system, as happens when mutations cause cells to become cancerous, dynamic stability may be undermined by the unsustainable demands they impose <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Nowak and Highfield, 2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivations for creativity and innovation</head><p>While natural selection facilitated organisms gaining traits better adapted to increasingly competitive environments, the primary motivation for change remained external in the earliest phases of their evolution.

Traits over which an organism has no executive control, such as those relating to basic physiology, are those most easily recognised as being directly programmed by genes. However, since all organisms are dynamic CAS that exist within dynamic and often unpredictable environmental CAS, some programmed allowance for localised executive control is also to be expected.</p><p>Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a fixed genotype to produce many phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Pigliucci et al., 2006)</ref>. It arises from the equivalent of <ref type="bibr">Holland's (1995)</ref> 'if-then' genetic programming. It enables organisms to respond differently to different environmental stimuli. Accordingly, while some ability to instigate change is universal in organisms, this may amount to no more than automated selection from a relatively small, genetically determined menu in accordance with prescriptive criteria. Just as identical DNA in the nuclei of somatic cells facilitates their developing specialised forms and functions dependent on their relative locations (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Holland, 1995)</ref>, this does not require an internalized pro-change, creative, or innovative motivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</head><p>To instigate change in ways that suggest a pro-change, competitive motivation associated with the competition/change quadrant of the motivational map requires an ability to deviate from a genetically determined menu. As the competitive traits of organisms evolved to become more sophisticated, they would have demanded more powerful and flexible mechanisms for gathering, processing, recording, and recalling information to inform decision-making.</p><p>Given that it can be argued freewill is an illusion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dennett, 2015)</ref>, the emergence of more sophisticated, flexible, and apparently self-directed decision-making mechanisms may be regarded simply a result of more layers of finely-tuned 'if-then' programming over which an organism has no effective control. An alternative perspective is that evolution equipped increasingly complex and individualized organisms with increasingly complex decision-making mechanisms able to adapt to the unpredictable, non-linear behavior of environmental CAS (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Franch-Gras et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Heisenberg, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Wingfield, 2013)</ref> in ways that imparted some level of independent executive control. The conscious entity (the 'self') that makes such decisions is an emergent phenomena borne of complex interactions in the CAS of brain and body <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Thompson &amp; Varela, 2001)</ref>. As with all other emergent phenomena, this evolved through many phase transitions.</p><p>All organisms must be able to tolerate at least short periods of unproductive activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Grime, 1977)</ref>.</p><p>The greater the resources available to them, the greater this tolerance is likely to be. However, because no activity is cost free, an organism's return on energy invested in 'unproductive' activity will inform judgement by natural selection. Accordingly, it may effectively be considered an organism's research and development budget. Apparently random search patterns such as 'Levy Flights' <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Mandelbrot, 1982)</ref> that insects, birds, sharks, and turtles use to satisfy a goal have been genetically programmed to optimise the chances of doing so in uncertain environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Guinard &amp; Korman, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Humphries at al., 2012)</ref>. Comparable exploratory behavior is witnessed in cells in the erection of microtubules in the construction of cytoskeletons <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Kirschner &amp; Mitchison, 1986)</ref>. Natural selection has seemingly honed these behaviors to minimize risk in unavoidably risky situations. The greater the eventual return from any related discoveries and innovations, the greater the An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) competitive advantage bestowed, and the greater the selection pressure that can be expected to come to bear on facilitating genes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Viewed within narrow temporal and spatial parameters, components of behaviors such as Levy</head><p>Flights may seem devoid of purpose due to the incomplete picture of the environment afforded. The same could be said for playful behavior. This may be described as not fully functional <ref type="bibr">(Burghardt, 2005)</ref> because it seems to offer no immediate survival or reproductive benefit. Given natural selection tends to eliminate comparatively inefficient mechanisms and behaviors, an inherent motivation for such behavior could only evolve in organisms able to maintain sufficient energy reserves over periods long enough for delayed benefits to be revealed. While individuals in dominant species seem best placed to develop such reserves, dominance promotes population growth, and so increased competition between individuals, which will tend to erode surplus.</p><p>In complex ecosystems, it may be that certain factors limit population growth of a species while others preserve a surplus of resources on which they depend in environmental niches. Also, if organisms are sufficiently adaptive that their population may disperse to other environments, intraspecies competition may be diluted. Whatever the means, genes for increasingly playful and adventurous behavior are only likely to have evolved if the returns on related 'research and development' exceeded the opportunity costs of not investing in more direct need-satisfying activities.</p><p>That such behavior tends only to be exhibited by animals in the absence of threats to fitness (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Burghardt, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Dawkins, 2006)</ref> seems to confirm its fitness-enhancing potential is served by motivations relating to less urgent needs: e.g., better preparing animals for future threats and opportunities <ref type="bibr">(Held &amp; Spinka, 2011)</ref>. That such activity is not usually associated with organisms lacking intelligence, and seemingly becomes more frequent and pronounced with higher intelligence, suggests its fitness-enhancing potential is a function of intelligence. This fits with the case made for a link between playfulness and creativity, and between propensities for these and fitness (Bateson, 2014).</p><p>We humans are not alone in our capacity for playful and adventurous activity. Other apes <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Pellegrini et al., 2007)</ref>, dolphins <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Kuczaj &amp; Eskelinen, 2014)</ref>, dogs (Bekoff, 2015), and octopi <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">(Zylinski, 2015)</ref> exhibit similar behaviors.

For individual organisms, experimentation through playful and adventurous activity replicates the research and development function that mutation and natural selection performs for genomes, but within a single generation. If its purpose is to guide future action with reference to an internal reference model of an organism's environment, as with consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Kotchoubey, 2018)</ref>, it must be supported by memory and intelligence. Because, playful activity leaves no trace in the fossil record, and even simple organisms can build and update an internal model of their environment to aid decision-making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Wright, et al., 2023)</ref>, it is difficult to determine exactly when internalised motivations for playfulness, adventurousness, and creativity emerged.</p><p>For the learnings of playful or adventurous experimentation to survive the death of the experimenting organism, they must be communicated to others and stored for onward transmission.</p><p>At what stage of evolution this became possible is also difficult to ascertain. Evidence suggests intelligent organisms such as dolphins learn to use tools <ref type="bibr">(Krutzen et al., 2005)</ref>, whales adapt their calls <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Zandberg et al., 2021)</ref>, rats adopt new feeding behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Heyes &amp; Galef, 1996)</ref>, and blue tits learn new foraging techniques, such as pecking through foil milk bottle tops <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Hinde &amp; Fisher, 1951)</ref> by cultural transmission. The creativity that spawns such behavior relates to innovative problem solving, which is thought to be an evolved adaptation to deal with environmental variation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Griffin, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Lefebvre (2013)</ref> reports that a domain general intelligence appears to promote innovativeness across species, and suggests that, while many factors including brain size relative to body size and the size of certain areas of the brain correlate positively with innovativeness and tool use, there are many other unidentified factors at work. However, if the creative intelligence of birds and mammals emerged in a shared ancestor, it would suggest a motivation for change within organisms began sometime after 120 million years ago (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dawkins, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Brusatte et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>

The traditions of organisms are primarily carried forward in their genes and passed on through meiosis (the formation of a zygote from gametes). In mitosis and cell division the copying of identical DNA to daughter cells ensures genetic conformity throughout the system of an organism. Reproduction encourages the proliferation of genes that conform to the fittest, most stable specifications in any given environment. Broad conformity of traits is evident among all animals belonging to the same species, and most clearly exemplified by the flocking behavior of bacteria, birds, fish, and wildebeest <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Toner et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The value of security includes such components as cleanliness, family security, and national security.</p><p>These regulate change in relation to localised boundaries in the interests of safety and stability.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase 2 -Conservation/Competition</head><p>The power value relates to desires for status, influence, and control. All things passively exert power through the gravitational or electromagnetic fields surrounding them. However, evolution promotes physical and behavioral characteristics that serve to actively increase or protect the influence and control organisms have over their environment. These might include anything that enables them to evade detection, mislead, escape, overpower, impress, or attract. These attributes are aimed at conserving or improving survival and reproductive opportunities in competitive environments, thereby enhancing an organism's ability to satisfy goals associated with conservative motivations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</head><p>The achievement value relates to the pursuit and advertisement of success in relation to widely accepted standards. For genes and organisms, natural selection effectively sets these standards, favoring: genes that promote success in survival and reproduction; fitness indicators that advertise such capabilities; and capabilities to recognise, distinguish between, and act upon reliable indicators in others. By demonstrating such capabilities, and having them recognised and recorded, organisms may be spared effortful and risky conflict. Zahavi's handicap principle (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Grafen, 1990)</ref> explains the evolution of costly displays such as the Peacock's tail in terms of their ability to honestly demonstrate the fitness of their owner, since they are too costly for less fit organisms to bear. To give an equivalent behavioral example, once a male chimpanzee has demonstrated his dominance he may then be spared constant challenges from others <ref type="bibr">(Waal, 1986)</ref>. However, such mechanisms can be subverted. Organisms may evolve characteristics that falsely advertise qualities they do not possess, whether to deter or attract others (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bond &amp; Robinson, 1988)</ref>, so giving rise to an evolutionary arms race between genes for improved detection and discrimination and genes for better deception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase 3 -Competition/Change</head><p>Hedonism promotes behavior that is fun, playful, and pleasureable in its own right. Behavior not directed at satisfying basic survival or reproductive needs may be less linear and more experimental. Accordingly, it offers greater potential for generating learning opportunities. Stimulation more directly promotes learning through a greater prepareness to take risks in the pursuit of variety and novelty.</p><p>Just as mutation and natural selection effectively enable successive generations of organisms to innovate, hedonism and stimulation potentiate this within the lifetime of an organism. Once innovations and learnings can be culturally transmitted to others, the effects may trickle down to better satisfy the goals associated with equivalents of 'lower' values; spreading through a population and down through generations to eventually replace long standing behavioral traditions. In stable An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) organism-environment systems, selection pressure may come to bear on enabling genes, so updating 'traditional' gene combinations as well as culturally inherited traits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase 4 -Change/Cooperation</head><p>Self-direction promotes independent thought and action, curiosity and creativity. As such, it facilitates a more targeted approach to experimentation and learning, and the pursuit of discoveries that facilitate more effective courses of action. Universalism promotes a desire for wisdom, developing a greater understanding and affinity with nature, with concerns for the environment, social justice, and equality. Self-direction and universalism feed each other, potentiating greater selfreliance, inner harmony, an appreciation of one's place in the universe, and so an understanding of the virtues of cooperation. A likely consequence of this being a motivation for less constrained forms of benevolence.</p><p>In line with the previously described relationship between progressive and cooperative motivation and intelligence and knowledge, these values seem to have the greatest potential to promote better decision-making. The greater efficiency so potentiated should create trickle down benefits for satisfying the goals associated with lower values: more opportunities to learn and have fun, less need to devote energy to proving oneself, or asserting ones influence or control over others, and less need to cling to and protect what one already has.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental evidence</head><p>Given their role in decision-making and how we suggest they evolved, it seems likely that values exert hierarchical influences to complement the known circular influences, and not just in relation to values laden propositions.

The size of the correlations between the relative importance given to individual values and performance in these tests underplays their influence. Because values operate as components of a system, even small, statistically insignificant differences in single value prioritization can promote large differences in the decision-making of differently motivated people. For example, when 1316 participants were divided into five motivational types <ref type="bibr" target="#b466">4</ref> , those allocated to a group for whom hedonism and stimulation were the most important values were more than twice as likely to risk a £100 loss for a potential £200 win on the toss of a coin than those belonging to a group for whom the conservation values were the most important (40% compared to 18%), despite no single value accounting for more than 4% of the variance (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">fig.

In respect of another challenge, concerning the allocation of healthcare budget, the largest single value/response correlation was responsible for little more than 0.5% of the variation in responses but contributed to a significant 28% difference in the average choices of two motivational types (see <ref type="figure">fig.

Conversely, those in which conservative values are more important should be among the least happy. Comparison of the World Values Survey (WVS, 2023) 5 and the World Happiness Report (WHR, 2021) 6 supports this conjecture. Those nations having the most selfexpressive/secular-rational values -which correspond with self-direction and universalism values  -are found to rank amongst the happiest in the WHR: Sweden 7th, Norway 5th, Denmark 2nd, Finland 1st, and the Netherlands 6 th , whereas those with the most survival/traditional values ranked among the least happy: Jordan 119th (of 153), Yemen 146th, Zimbabwe 151st, Morocco 97th, and Ghana 91st. <ref type="bibr" target="#b467">5</ref> A periodic international survey of the values of representative samples of adults conducted by a global cooperative of social scientists.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The coincidence of experimental and other evidence consistent with there being a linear, hierarchical structure to human values that complements the known circular structure lends plausibility to our evolutionary theory of values. That this is predicted by no other theory we are aware of suggests it is worthy of further investigation.</p><p>It is suggested that any evolutionary theory should address <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Tinbergen's (1963)</ref> four questions relating to function (why), evolution (how), causation (what), and development (how). The function of values is to guide decision-making toward the satisfaction of needs ). As we have explained, all needs can be derived from the universal need for systems to move toward equilbrium in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. All decision-making mechanisms can be traced back to the binary 'choices' of atoms of whether to absorb and emit photons or not. The mechanism by which they operate has evolved through layers of increasing complexity such that values-based decisions represent aggregates of countless layers of these binary 'decisions': from those of atomic electrons to those of neurons. Equivalents of values-based decision-making have evolved through countless phase transitions in increasingly complex CAS and their constituents in An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) terms that can be related to the UMM. The dynamic relationship between cooperation, competition and change captured by the UMM, and reflected in the structure of  system, plays out at every emergent level of complexity.</p><p>Given the radical nature of this theory and its relevance to the evolution of all systems, its implications and applications are too numerous to discuss here. Other than those related to psychology, and through psychology to all human systems, it offers an opportunity to consider the evolution of other systems in relateable human terms. A summary of suggested areas of interest is provided in the supplementrary materials, along with the perspective it offers on established psychological theory, including personality theories other than the Big Five. Here we will confine ourselves to addressing the aspirations and concerns of <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Block (2010)</ref> mentioned at the beginning of this paper: those relating to the five factor model and the state of personality science.</p><p>We have argued that the structure of a UMM equivalent to that of Schwartz's system is comprehensive, universal, and inescapable, in that all systemic interactions cannot escape being considered in terms of their propensity to change, and the degrees of cooperation and competition between their components. It therefore fulfils the requirement of an adaptive paradigm capable of generating sufficient surface complexity from great simplicity.</p><p>Our research into the effects of upbringing on the personalities of only-children when compared to those on siblings <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Griffiths et al., 2021)</ref> found significant effects on power and benevolence values consistent with the popular stereotype that has only-children as being more selfish. Previous research based on traits had concluded that either there was no such effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Polit and Falbo, 1987)</ref>, or any effect was too small to be noticeable <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">(Stronge, et al., 2019</ref>). An explanation for this, which may relate to many aspects of personality, is that the same value priorities may find expression in different behavioral traits in different environments. For example, an individual motivated most by power may be motivated to behave in any way they consider likely to maintain or increase their influence in the environment in which they find themselves. If this involves influencing perceived An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) superiors and others whose goodwill they wish to exploit, this may involve ingratiating, agreeable behavior. In other environments, involving others whose goodwill is considered unimportant, they may prefer dismissive, bullying, or other disagreeable behavior. Given that people who know each other well can read the values of others reliably <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dobewall et al.,, 2014)</ref>, an individual showing such context dependent duality of personality is likely to be identifiable as being relatively strong on power motivation and relatively low on benevolence. Conversely, given value priorities are considered trans-situationally stable , an individual considered broadly agreeable or disagreeable seems less likely to become fundamentally more or less motivated by self-enhancing or self-transcending values in different environments.</p><p>The relationship between values and traits is complex, because both are rooted in genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">(Schermer, et al., 2011)</ref> and are similarly stable, and subject to environmental change (see review in . Also, while values motivate action (and therefore behavioral traits), consequent behavior changes the environment to which values must adapt. So while they may influence each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">2019)</ref>, the basic principles of physics tell us that motivation precedes action, with the former arising from, and the latter proceeding in accordance with, the second law of thermodynamics. The behavioral traits of physical systems are particular to circumstantial interactions between proximate systems. They include radioactive emission, bursting into flame, and flight: none of which are easily reconciled with the personalty traits of humans. Yet all arise from competition between systems arising from energetic disequilbrium. Accordingly, at the very least, it seems rational to reconsider the relative roles of values (and their UMM equivalents and precursors) and traits in shaping personality.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The following information provides further background and expands upon the information provided in the main paper: An Evolutionary Theory of Values (EToV). In reading the following it should be borne in mind we are not suggesting perfect congruence between the UMM and Schwartz's model.</p><p>The structure of the UMM is theoretically ideal. That its orthogonal axes correspond with those of the Schwartz system justifies our comparison of the two. However, the Schwartz system, particularly its detailed structure, is not theoretically ideal because it is derived from self-reports (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b247">Baumeister et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Garcia &amp; Gustavson, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Apart from issues regarding the construction of self-report questionnaires, the reliability of individual responses and interpretations thereof are subject to human error. In the following we will An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) identify potential issues relating to the measurement of self-direction and universalism, and the lack of allowance for systematic interactions between values in correlation studies. This is not to suggest we believe the Schwartz model is not fit for purpose. The number and quality of studies confirming its validity (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b411">Schwartz, 2012)</ref> suggest it is 'good enough' for the purposes of exploring broad structural correspondence with the UMM, and broad sequential relationships between the emergence of evolutionary strategies and values. Accordingly, in these supplementary materials we have been sparing in our use of citations concerning correspondence between Schwartz's values and other models. We have used them illustratively, rather than relying on them, because the proposed structure of the UMM is independently justifiable.</p><p>Also, our research to date does not allow us to separate the influence of values from their UMM equivalents. If values operate consciously, pre-consciously, and unconsciously, it is likely the underlying neurological mechanisms are shared with deeper motivations related to the UMM.</p><p>Therefore, when we discuss the influence of values on mental health in SM4, it should be borne in mind that when considering yet to be explored relationships it would be better to infer no clear distinctions between values and unconscious UMM equivalents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SM1 Selected core principles relevant to the evolution of the universe</head><p>(1) Quantum uncertainty. The fundamental constituents of all energy, and therefore of all matter and organisms, can be considered in terms of quantum particles (for overview see <ref type="bibr" target="#b387">Peskin &amp; Schroeder, 1995)</ref> that observe   prescriptive energy levels particular to each element, the configuration of which determines the chemical characteristics of each element: i.e., how they relate to and interact with one another (for summary see <ref type="bibr" target="#b249">Bertsch et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>(3) Gravitational and electromagnetic fields 7 effectively connect all sub-systems of the universe. They imbue them with potential energy: i.e., a motive for change. Gravitation exerts a relatively weak attractive force between massive objects. Electromagnetic attraction (between oppositely charged particles) and repulsion (between like charged particles) exerts a vastly greater force. However, repulsive and attractive forces tend to cancel each other out over large distances due to the likely proximity of differently charged particles. Hence electromagnetism tends to exert the greatest influence over proximate systems such as the nervous systems of organisms, whereas gravity is the dominant influence shaping the greater physical environments organisms inhabit. The influence of both declines in proportion to the square of the distance from their source. Nevertheless, due to the infinite reach of these fields, all things contribute to the environment of all other things, and therefore sub-systems evolve with respect to each other and the larger systems of which they are part (see <ref type="bibr">Gupta, 1954</ref>).</p><p>(4) The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be destroyed nor gained in a closed system, i.e., one isolated from all others such that no energy may flow in or out. The universe is a closed system. Therefore, any energy lost from or gained by its local subsystems (such as atoms, molecules, genes, organisms, and ecosystems) must be compensated by gains to or losses from their environment (i.e., the other sub-systems of the universe). The relevance of this to the evolution of systems, and therefore to natural selection, is that all costs and benefits experienced by or attributed to a local system are balanced out across the universal system. More colloquially, 'there's no such thing as a free lunch' (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b330">Iwase, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="formula">5</ref>The second law of thermodynamics states that in a closed system 8 entropy (disorder) tends to increase. Energy flows from hot to cold, high concentrations to low, until equilibrium is reached. This is related to the minimum total potential energy principle, which states that local systems tend to deform until the potential energy of their components has been minimized. During the process of deformation (or reconfiguration) excess energy is lost from the system in the form of heat. Chemicals reactions are only potentiated when they lead to an increase in entropy. Mostly this arises when combinations of atoms and molecules deform into more energy-efficient configurations, giving off heat in the process (exothermic reactions). However, some reactions may be initiated by heating, such that highly localised, less energy-efficient configurations can be sustained by the absorption of energy (endothermic reactions). In such reactions, increases in the entropy of the external systems providing the heat exceed the decrease in the entropy of the local system of reactants. The second law also finds equivalence in the principle of least action, which dictates that particles and systems minimize their total potential energy by following the most energyefficient paths. This explains why objects are drawn directly down toward the earth's centre of gravity, light is deflected (refracted) when passing between media with different densities (e.g., water and air), and projectiles follow a parabolic path determined by balancing the downward force of gravity and their horizontal momentum. The second law is the principal motivation for change in any system (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b330">Iwase, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b468">(6)</ref> Energy transfer between systems is facilitated by photons. Photons are indivisible quanta of energy, each with a specific energy level. As systems deform to minimise their total potential energy, photons are emitted as electrons move to more energy-efficient configurations. As electrons may only occupy atomic orbitals with prescriptive energy levels characteristic of each element, emitted photons have energy levels equal to the energy gaps between orbitals. The wavelengths of the lines in the emission spectra of elements correspond to the gaps between these orbitals. Correspondingly, electrons may only absorb photons if their energy levels match gaps between permitted orbitals. This gives rise to the reciprocal pattern of dark lines in the absorption spectra of elements. Photons with energies that fail to correspond with orbital energy gaps are not absorbed (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b388">Podgoršak, 2014)</ref>. This effectively means they are not 'perceived'. This is not only analogous to the ways in which humans and other organisms perceive visual information but is a fundamental component of the enabling mechanism: one that facilitates and governs communication between systems. The human eye perceives color across the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum by means of 6-7 million cone cells, each perhaps comprising c.100 trillion atoms (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b374">Mustafi at al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b427">Spring et al. 2023)</ref>. These cones are just one part of the complex system that processes visual information. The exchanges of photons convey information between atoms. They do so obeying probabilistic quantum mechanical rules related to the uncertainty principle  that prohibit knowing the exact direction and locations they will be emitted and absorbed. This and the incalculable number of atoms involved are important factors contributing to the intractable complexity of the interactions that underpin both how humans process information and, more generally, how evolution proceeds.</p><p>An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) (7) Evolution by natural selection proceeds in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b401">(Sabater, 2006)</ref>. Organisms best adapted to their environment -i.e., those with characteristics most advantageous to survival and reproduction -i.e., those able to absorb, process, and invest energy most efficiently toward the satisfaction of their needswill tend to outcompete other organisms seeking to exploit the same resources. The most successful organisms will tend to pass more copies of their genes onto successive generations than others . The fitness of organisms is a function of both genes and environment. The fitness of genetically identical organisms depends on how well adapted to their respective environments they are. No two particles, atoms, or molecules, let alone organisms, may share the same space at the same time, even in otherwise 'shared'</p><p>environments. This alone ensures some variation upon which natural selection may act.</p><p>Directly imposed genetic variation comes from the mutation of genes. Whether by routine copying errors in DNA replication, or as a consequence of bombardment from high energy photons in their environment, the molecular structure of an organism's DNA is changed such that different chemical instructions are issued and acted upon.

As others (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b377">O'Connor &amp; Yballe, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wininger &amp; Norman, 2007)</ref> have pointed out, some of this criticism has been misplaced. Maslow An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) (1943) explicitly stated that multiple levels of need could be active at any one time. As for its alleged omissions,  listed status and dominance (which would seem to allow for abasement and aggression) as esteem-need-related values, and playfulness and goodness as self-actualizing values. Self-transcendence is a broad term that would seem to cover heroism and altruism.</p><p>Desmet and Fokkinga (2020) believe subsequent research has shown Maslow's theory to have been correct insofar as: human needs are inborn and universal; a broad set of behaviors can be explained by relatively few needs; needs are responsible for motivating behavior; and their satisfaction contributes to well-being <ref type="bibr">Ryff &amp; Keyes, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b433">Tay &amp; Diener, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Taormina and</ref> Gao <ref type="formula">2013</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linking Maslow's needs to Schwartz's values</head><p>The terms needs and values were used interchangeably by <ref type="bibr">Maslow (e.g., 1968, p. 153)</ref>, and taken to mean goals people strive to achieve, which, if frustrated, diminish well-being. While he considered values a term so broad that, without tighter definition, it would likely become obsolete, he expressed the belief that values were an intrinsic, structural component of human nature that were genetically as well as culturally derived <ref type="bibr">(Maslow, 1968, p. 167)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b396">Rokeach (1973)</ref> and  went on to provide the required definition and, using the latter's system, values have since been shown to be heritable <ref type="bibr" target="#b439">(Twito &amp; Knafo-Noam, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b460">Zacharopoulos et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Associations between Schwartz's values and Maslow's needs have previously been made (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b250">Bilsky &amp; Schwartz, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gau &amp; James, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b344">Kluger et al. 2004</ref>). Schwartz (2012) categorises achievement, An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) power, security, conformity, and tradition values as being prevention of loss (deficiency) orientated (i.e., associated with needs below self-actualization), and benevolence, universalism, self-direction, stimulation, and hedonism as growth values (i.e., associated with self-actualizing needs). However, comparisons tend to fall short of claiming a comprehensive overlap, perhaps because of difficulties in reconciling the circularity of the Schwartz system and the linearity of Maslow's hierarchy.</p><p>Nevertheless, when the terminology used in each is compared, (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">fig. SM2</ref>) sequential correspondence is readily apparent. Maslow links mastery to achievement and esteem related needs. While Schwartz (2012) associates mastery with self-direction, there is no explicit mention of mastery in the PVQ-40 <ref type="bibr" target="#b415">(Schwartz et al., 2001</ref>) we used in our research. Perhaps the two descriptions used to assess the importance of selfdirection that most closely relate to it are: 'they like to be curious and to try to understand all sorts of things' and 'they like to rely on themselves'. A desire to become self-reliant and understand many things may be sympathetic to gaining some level of mastery, however, the concepts are not inextricably linked. A similar case could be made for linking the descriptions used to evaluate the importance of achievement, i.e.: 'they want to show how capable they are'; 'they strive to do better than others'; 'being very successful is important to them'; 'they like to impress other people'; 'it is very important to them to show their abilities' and 'they want people to admire what they do'. If the purpose of mastery is to please oneself without reference to others or external benchmarks, or to enable one to complete a task for the same reason, then it relates more to self-direction than achievement. However, if the gratification comes from demonstrating one's capabilities such that others may be impressed, then it better relates to achievement. A third interpretation of mastery is 'control or superiority over someone or something' (Oxford Dictionaries, 2023), which directly relates to power values.</p><p>Aside from such quibbles, broad alignment between the two models is apparent. Considering this in the context of the argument presented in the main paper, we are drawn to believe Maslow was prescient in devising his hierarchy. Despite a lack of clarity concerning the precise nature of its operation and how its needs could be assessed, its correspondence with the Schwartz system, especially our hierarchical interpretation of it, suggests it provides a useful description of the human motivational system. By using well established methodology relating to the measurement of Schwartz's values and interpreting findings in accordance with the methodology described in Self-actualization was removed from atop of the pyramid because they considered that "although self-actualization may be of considerable psychological importance, it is unlikely to be a functionally distinct human need" <ref type="bibr">(Kenrick et al., 2010, p. 293)</ref>. If they are correct in believing Maslow justified the placement of self-actualization on the grounds that it was a functionally distinct human need detached from biological needs, we can agree he was wrong to do so. It is a truism to say no genetic disposition can be separated from its biological root. Also, based on the alignment between Schwartz's self-direction values and Maslow's self-actualization needs, it is apparent that dolphins and chimpanzees are among the intelligent organisms capable of exhibiting self-directing aspects of self-actualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b369">(Morrison &amp; Reiss, 2018)</ref>. However, neither of these reasons justifies its removal.</p><p>While all organisms have some capacity for autonomous action -i.e., their dynamism is not simply reliant on linear reactions to external motivating forces -it is apparent a capacity for self-direction (as well as for generating and referencing reliable models of their environment) increases with intelligence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b363">McFarland et al., 1993)</ref> and is uniquely expressed in humans.</p><p>Their suggestion that self-actualization is subsumed within status/esteem related needs appears to arise from a conflagration of distinct aspects of mastery and learning. As they point out, high status is useful because "it is much more efficient to learn by modeling the behaviors of successful others than by using trial and error <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">(Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b318">Henrich &amp; Boyd, 1998)</ref>, so people are willing to defer to, and perform favors for, others who have acquired skills" <ref type="bibr">(Kenrick et al., 2010, p. 297)</ref>.</p><p>Indeed, the motivation for replicating successful strategies and behaviors replicates the function of natural selection, which we consider to be functionally equivalent to the motivation provided by the value of achievement. However, this form of mastery is limited to replicating what already exists. Therefore, while it may serve a progressive function in raising the average performance/fitness of a population, it does little to drive progress by innovation. Without the introduction of novel components and combinations thereof systems tend to evolve toward equilibrium and stasis .</p><p>The type of mastery they describe as being non-specific to status or esteem is that related to curiosity and play. They refer to <ref type="bibr">Deci and Ryan's (2000, p. 252)</ref> linkage of these to a domain-general need ''to engage optimal challenges and experience mastery or effectance in the physical and social worlds'' as a problem-solving mechanism. We agree that curiosity and play, motivated by the values of hedonism, stimulation, and self-direction, serve problem-solving functions. However, unlike mastering an already established practise, play and curiosity are more concerned with selfexpression and self-directed discovery. They may lead to the discovery of behaviors and knowledge that one goes on to master, which may then serve as markers of achievement and status, but the initial motivation cannot be for mastery: mastery of something unknown? Self-direction and universalism in their promotion of curiosity, independent thought and action, and a desire to understand a broad range of things encourage mastery in a more general sense. By encouraging innovative thinking, they may push individuals into levels of understanding that make them more capable than those driven to achieve on more constrained terms. If so, they will have achieved higher levels of mastery, albeit they are more likely to realize that complete mastery is an unrealizable goal, in that their state of knowledge can always be improved upon. In common with all motivations, the ultimate 'problem' to be 'solved' is how to best satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. The hierarchical structure of evolving values we present simply represents an increasingly efficient suite of strategies for doing so.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</head><p>They suggest that self-actualization, like complex psychological phenomena such as religion and morality, may not serve specific fitness-relevant functions, and may be by-products or nonadaptive effects of other psychological mechanisms. We describe in the main paper the fitness-relevant function of self-actualization through the values of self-direction and universalism, however, it is perhaps worth addressing their treatment of religion and morality, since these would appear similarly rooted in values-based motivation.</p><p>Religion provides explanations for why things are as they are. For example: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And God said, 'Let there be light' and there was light." (Genesis 1:1-3). It also offers related guidance as to how one should go about one's life. The ten commandments of the Christian Bible being an example. In this respect it is little different to science. For religious believers and scientists alike, religion and science offer the most appealing explanations for why things are as they are and provide the most compelling guidance for how to proceed. What separates religious believers from others is their lower preparedness to change/adapt to new information. Humans and other organisms are prone to habit forming because it is generally more efficient to automatically repeat established patterns of behavior than to effortfully select and replicate them, or invest energy in inventing new ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b376">(Neal et al, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b422">Smith &amp; Graybiel, 2016)</ref>. This makes us susceptible to carrying forward pre-existing beliefs and behaviors when novel alternatives would be objectively superior. We may do so because we are not aware of alternatives or because we are not otherwise motivated to change. Both are encouraged by conservative values: lack of awareness being more likely if one's motivations oppose change-promoting, self-directed curiosity, and stimulation related adventurousness.</p><p>In accordance with  law of accelerating returns, the rate of technological and scientific advancement was several orders of magnitude slower at the time when most of the world's major religions were first established. Therefore, the fitness-related costs of failing to adopt new ideas and practices in those times were relatively very small. Having taken hold, these beliefs and related practices serve purposes related to Maslow's belonging and safety needs. The conservative values of tradition, conformity, and security relate to these basic psychological needs.</p><p>They serve to bind people together in cooperative social groups. From the perspective of group members, new ideas and practices, and those propounding and practising them, may represent potentially destabilizing competition. This may encourage greater resources being devoted to protecting and reinforcing the boundaries and practices of their religions. This has the potential to isolate religious believers from outsiders, so facilitating intellectual stasis and increasing polarization of views with respect to differently and more progressively minded outsiders. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</head><p>As in all dynamically stable systems, the cooperative strategies that, in human terms, correspond with high-morality will tend to dominate in accordance with the evolutionary rationale described in the main paper in relation to the Prisoner's Dilemma. Competitive strategies can only be tolerated if they are subordinated to serve greater cooperative interests, or if the parasitism they promote is constrained so as not to catastrophically deplete the resources of the cooperative systems on which they prey. Consequently, as with a genetic predisposition for parasitism in certain organisms, the motivation for immoral behavior associated with the competitive values of power and achievement can be tolerated insofar as it does not catastrophically undermine the cooperative integrity of society or the functioning of an individual.</p><p>The other changes to the hierarchy proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b343">Kenrick et al. (2010)</ref> involve the renaming of safety with self-protection, affection and belonging with affiliation, and the introduction of mate acquisition, mate retention, and parenting related needs above status/esteem related needs. The renaming is of little consequence but fails to address Maslow's misconception that safety (stability) is a function of cooperation (benevolence, including love), not the other way around. They justify the introduction of new needs with reference to life-history theory. This is not the place to conduct a review of this, nor attempt to contextualise the role of parenting within it. However, our observation would be that motives for mate-acquisition, mate-retention, and parenting are covered by the conservation half of the UMM, and so can be related to existing levels of need in Maslow's hierarchy. As described in the main paper, most sexually reproducing organisms rely on mechanisms related to the equivalent of power and achievement motivations to attract mates. These are rooted in genetic mechanisms that seek to maximise cooperative efficiency, albeit that these are susceptible to corruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b367">(Miller, 2000)</ref>. Mate retention (whether temporary or monogamous) represents a higher, more complex manifestation of the basic cooperation between two related genomes, but is not restricted to humanity, or even highly intelligent organisms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b368">Mock &amp; Fujioka, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b450">Whiteman &amp; Côté, 2004)</ref>. Yes, the considerable and extended investment of two parents in human offspring is related to the biological consequences of giving birth to and raising highly intelligent offspring that acquire much of the information they need to flourish from cultural interactions. And yes, this intelligence can be related to values at the top of our hierarchy, i.e., selfdirection, universalism, and benevolence (see SM3). However, in line with the trickle-down relationship we describe in the main paper, all evolutionary adaptations, genetic and cultural, have the potential to become rooted in motivations related to values (or their equivalents) at the base of the hierarchy, i.e., tradition and conformity. Given that co-parenting is a cooperative act, it would seem reasonable to anticipate that individuals motivated most by cooperative values at both ends of the hierarchy of values would be the most likely to commit fully to it, and those motivated by competitive values the least. Also, in terms of the quality of parenting they provide, it would seem reasonable to anticipate that parenting styles consistent with transformational leadership qualities (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b458">Zacharatos et al., 2000)</ref> would have advantages over styles more consistent with transactional leadership. The former leaning more heavily on encouraging independence and creativity through support and challenge (associated with the self-actualizing values of self-direction, universalism, and benevolence); the latter more on command and control, extrinsic reward, and punishment (strategies more aligned with the self-enhancing values of power and achievement).  values model concerns the motivations of individuals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b408">Schwartz (2004)</ref>   primarily to the power value. The final dimension of harmony-mastery is described in terms of an opposition between universalism values and mainly achievement values. However, harmony is described as a cultural tendency for fitting into the world rather than changing it, and therefore appears to blend universalism and conservative values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultural and Organizational Values</head><p>One description used to measure universalism in the PVQ-40 <ref type="bibr" target="#b415">(Schwartz et al., 2001</ref>) is worded as follows: 'It is important to them/him/her to adapt to nature and to fit into it. They/he/she believe that people should not change nature'. In our consideration, this is problematic in the context of universalism being a description of motivations for being sympathetic to others, open to the opinions of others, and desirous of accumulating knowledge toward a more complete understanding of people and nature. Scientific progress is reliant on better understanding nature and using what we learn to improve the lives of individuals and society. For example, while genetic engineering and nuclear power may be regarded as interfering with nature, they are replications of naturally occurring processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b366">(Mervine, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b417">Shapiro, 1992)</ref>. One can argue that all technological and scientific progress is reliant on the identification, understanding, and replication of natural mechanisms. While it is suggested the wheel is one of a few uniquely human inventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b295">(Gambino, 2009)</ref>, given there are naturally occurring cylindrical objects that roll, such as tree trunks and the stems of plants, and wheels are simply cylinders with comparatively small third dimensions, the invention of the wheel is perhaps an achievement equivalent to Columbus's 'discovery' of the Americas. Therefore, we are of the view that associating universalism with an antipathy to change is inappropriate.</p><p>In the context of the PVQ-40, it is possible to interpret the aforementioned descriptive statement as not being obstructive of progress. If one takes the view that all technology changes nature, the statement may appear so extremely demanding that it is better interpreted differently. If one takes the view that it is impossible to change nature, because all human inventions simply exploit what nature has to offer, then the statement similarly requires an alternative interpretation. A possible interpretation would be to consider the proposition as a means to measure how much the respondent cares for the natural world. However, Schwartz's more conservative cultural interpretation of harmony leans heavily toward a radically conservative interpretation.</p><p>As it happens, this is not the only problem with this interpretation of universalism. Another statement used to measure the importance of universalism is "They/he/she want everyone to be treated justly, even people they don't know. It is important to them to protect the weak in society."</p><p>To agree with these statements and to believe that people should not change nature requires the respondent to believe humanity's capacities for treating others unjustly and exploiting the weak are unnatural. Given that nature (including that relating to humanity) is, as Tennyson poetically An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) observed, 'red in tooth and claw', it is difficult to claim a desire to exploit the weak, rather than protect them, is unnatural. If it is natural, then it would follow that it would be inconsistent with universalism to seek to change this. This inconsistency may not be problematic if respondents don't think too deeply about the implications of the statements. They may simply recognize broad themes that enable them to interpret the statements as being aligned with allegiances for environmentalism and social justice.</p><p>While Schwartz's cultural orientations are broadly aligned with his system of personal values, any ambiguity in translation is problematic. This may have contributed to correspondence between the two constructs falling short of isomorphism <ref type="bibr" target="#b289">(Fischer et al., 2010)</ref>. Given the apparent universality of the structure of the UMM, it is arguable that Schwartz's cultural orientations would be better reconsidered and mapped in relation to the UMM's orthogonal axes.</p><p>The cultural model used in the World Values Survey ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">fig. 6</ref> in the main paper) is that of Inglehart-Welzel (WVS, 2020), which maps survival values versus self-expression values on the x-axis and traditional values versus secular-rational values on the y-axis. As stated in the main paper, survival and traditional values correspond with Schwartz's conservation values, and self-expression and secular-rational values with self-direction and universalism . Accordingly, diagonal movement across the map is equivalent to vertical movement up our hierarchy from conservation values to self-transcending values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hofstede's (1980) cultural dimensions theory describes cultural values in terms of six dimensions:</head><p>power distance, individualism-collectivism, masculinity-femininity, uncertainty avoidance, longterm-short-term, and indulgence-restraint. <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">Kaasa (2021)</ref> was able to demonstrate how these cultural dimensions could be merged with <ref type="bibr" target="#b408">Schwartz's (2004)</ref> orientations.

Ambiguity in interpretation, of the type discussed in relation to universalism, and failure to make allowance for the inevitable complexities of measuring the culture of CAS comprising millions of individuals (each of which is a CAS) present considerable difficulties for those seeking confirmation of the coverage we suggest. However, given the impossibility of escaping (or defying being mapped on) the UMM, the UMM must also provide a parsimonious model for mapping cultural values, however they are described.</p></div>

However, in a previous study,  found the values of children more predictive of behavior than traits were of values; albeit that a reciprocal relationship between the two seemed to be operating.</p><p>As acknowledged by , the interaction of personality traits and values is complex. There are 30 facets underlying the Big Five traits of NEO-PI-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">(Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992)</ref>   , whereas traits are partially correlated and partially orthogonal <ref type="bibr">(De Young et al., 2002)</ref>. The frequency and intensity with which all traits are expressed, and the relative importance attached to each value may be infinitely variable. While some genes affecting personality seem to have been identified (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b403">Sanchez-Roige, et al., 2018)</ref>, exactly how genes inform traits or values remains a mystery. Without the ability to identify and measure the genetic, physiological, and neurological processes underlying them, the challenges presented to those seeking to understand how each contributes to personality are considerable.</p><p>Personality has been described as 'the dynamic organization within the individual of the psychobiological systems that modulate … adaptations to a changing internal and external environment' <ref type="bibr">(Cloninger, 2004, p.374)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A few examples of prominent evolutionary theories and perspectives</head><p>Carol Dweck (2017, p. 690) lays the foundations for a unified theory of motivation, personality, and development with the following: "I start with the assumption that psychological needs drive goals that support psychological life and health in much the way that physical needs drive goals that support physical life and health". Citing <ref type="bibr">Baumeister and Leary (1995)</ref> she adds "to qualify as a basic need, it cannot be derivative of other needs". While the first statement may be true, to 'start' a theory that seeks to unify motivation, personality and development with an assumption that can only relate to organisms with brains sufficiently complex to warrant consideration in terms of psychology seems strange given, as we have argued, they have much deeper roots. If the second statement is correct, no psychological need can be considered 'basic' because, as our account of evolving complexity shows, psychological needs are derived from more fundamental physiological needs, and all of these are ultimately derived from the universe's 'need' to maximise entropy and minimize the total potential energy of its sub-systems. Considered in this light, all theories strictly bounded by the evolutionary history of our closest animal relatives, let alone those focusing only on homo sapiens, leave themselves open to criticisms of parochialism.</p><p>Having allowed that any psychological need could be considered basic, <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">Dweck (2017)</ref> identifies three basic psychological needs: acceptance, optimal predictability, and competence, that are present An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) from birth. From these emerge four compound needs of trust, control, self-esteem/status, and selfcoherence.</p><p>Dweck's (2017) basic need for acceptance can be derived from the UMM's cooperation/conservation quadrant and Schwartz's conformity values. Competitive/self-enhancing values (and their equivalents) may then build upon, exploit, and subvert this. Power and achievement values promote the demonstration of qualities that promote acceptance (and by extension, trustworthiness and group membership) and the influence this buys, whether honestly or by deception.</p><p>In evolving CAS, such as organisms, optimal predictability derives from cooperative, equilibriumseeking mechanisms that have evolved and operate similarly to  problem-solving genetic algorithm. These facilitate the evolution of ever more sensitive pattern recognizing adaptations that enable organisms to synchronize behavioral change in response to early signs of change in their environment.</p><p>Dweck distinguishes competence from prediction by saying prediction concerns understanding whereas competence concerns action. Ultimately both share the same root in cooperation, which provides the foundation of stability that subordinate, dynamic competitive strategies supplement. In evolutionary terms, prediction and competence are co-dependent: the understanding that facilitates prediction only serves an evolutionary purpose if it enables improved courses of action. There could be no selection pressure on genes for understanding if such understanding could not find expression through action. The authors of Moral Foundations Theory (MFT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">Graham et al., 2013)</ref> preface their proposition by quoting <ref type="bibr">Einstein (1934, p. 165)</ref> -"The supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience" -before identifying care-harm, fairness-cheating, loyalty-betrayal, authority-subversion, and sanctity-degradation as five fundamental dimensions of morality.</p><p>However, one barely need step outside the realm of psychology before these constructs are seen to lack parsimony.</p><p>MFT's care-harm, fairness-cheating, and loyalty-betrayal dimensions all transparently relate to the UMM's cooperative-competitive axis and Schwartz's self-transcendence-self-enhancement axes.</p><p>Authority-subversion may be considered from different perspectives, prompting different valuesrelated considerations. Insofar as authority concerns status, influence, and control, it is directly related to competitive power values. However, as previously described, these may all be more efficiently achieved in dynamic environments through higher values. Subversion involves one individual/group/system competing with another, either by direct action or through ideas and arguments. As such, it may arise from competitive power-related motivations. However, subversion may also arise involuntarily from progressive hedonism and stimulation values, or voluntarily through self-direction, supported by universalism. In a tightly regulated environment, the expression of desires to have fun and be adventurous may be perceived as wilful acts of subversion. However, when such non-conformist behavior subverts norms and defies authority, these may be considered An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</p><p>by-products of a motivation for self-expression more than a purposeful assault on authority.</p><p>However, when a self-directed motivation for independent thought and action (informed by universalism's drive for understanding) leads to a conflict with authority -whether it's the perceived authority of an argument, received wisdom, or an individual, group, or larger system -while any resultant action will be competitive, the ultimate motivation relates to a desire for greater cooperation: explanations and strategies that make better sense, promote more efficient actions, and lead to greater cooperative benefits. Sanctity-degradation again relates to the cooperationcompetition axis of the UMM. Sanctity promotes stability-enhancing cooperation through ideas and/or behaviors being given a protected status. This is the desired function of traditional customs and security related rules and boundaries. In dynamic environments, such fixed attitudes are likely to promote conflict between groups and cultures, irrespective of their intended purpose of promoting localised cooperation. Any idea or behavior that conflicts with those held to be sacred threatens their degradation, and so is likely to prompt defensive or aggressive action.</p><p>Rather than review further theoretical perspectives within psychology, since those we are aware of seem to share a common limitation, we will conclude this section with a more generalized commentary on studies in evolutionary psychology. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b349">Kurzban (2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scholarpedia, 2023</ref>) "evolutionary psychology begins with the idea that the source of organized functional complexity observed in all living organisms is evolution by natural selection. In its application to psychology, it entails the further uncontroversial assumption that the brain causes behavior.</p><p>Researchers in the discipline generally assume the basic principles of evolution by natural selection as articulated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">Darwin (1859)</ref> and subsequent important developments, such as sexual selection <ref type="bibr">(Darwin, 1871)</ref>, the modern synthesis (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fisher, 1930)</ref> and inclusive fitness theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b316">(Hamilton, 1964)</ref>. They also tend to assume some form of the computational theory of mind (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fodor, 1975)</ref>:</p><p>that what the brain does is process information (Pinker 1997)." It acknowledges the brain responds to external and internal inputs, evolving to become a problem-solving device, with specialized An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) components attuned to solving ancestral problems, most of which operate unconsciously <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">(Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>A tendency for psychological theories to be developed as if humans were fundamentally different from other animals has been noted by others (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b336">Jonason and Dane, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b335">Jonason (2017)</ref> describes evolutionary psychology as a field of study that attempts to remedy this misconception.</p><p>However, our principal criticism of evolutionary psychology (as it most often presented) is that the context for considering the ancestral problems the brain evolved to solve is provided by savannadwelling homo-sapiens of a few hundred thousand years ago. While parallels are drawn and lessons learned through comparisons with other animals, this is the equivalent of trying to understand a story from its closing passages. The universe has been evolving for approximately 13.8 billion years in accordance with the same fundamental principles. If the story of evolution took 24 hours to read, and reading began at midnight, homo sapiens wouldn't come into it until less than two seconds before the following midnight. If, instead of starting at the beginning of the universe, we had 24</p><p>hours to read the story from when life first emerged on Earth, homo sapiens would be introduced at around 7 seconds to midnight. If we started with the emergence of multi-cellular life, we would still have only around 12 seconds to review the awe-inspiring complexity of homo sapiens and consider what makes us tick.</p><p>Concentrating on this small period of evolution has yielded many interesting findings. However, just as archaeology has revealed much that allows us to trace the evolution of human culture yet offers us little concerning the fundamental mechanisms responsible for it, in our opinion, evolutionary psychology has been too limited in its frame of reference to afford us a comprehensive view of the bigger picture. Our aim has been to frame our evolutionary theory of values in the broadest context possible. In finding congruence between the structure of the UMM and Schwartz's (1992) system we have been able to contextualise humanity's psychological evolution in relation to the laws of physics and the localised oscillating patterns of order and disorder that emerge in a universe seeking to maximize entropy. In so doing we have offered a means to better contextualize the detailed findings An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</p><p>emerging from specialised fields within psychology.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SM3 (a) (iv) Analysis</head><p>The average score of PVQ-40 responses relevant to each of the ten values was calculated for each respondent. These were used to calculate basic Pearson's correlations with respect to the decisionmaking challenges. These base figures were attenuated to compensate for the low internal reliability of values -a consequence of their being part of a continuum  -by dividing them by the square root of Cronbach α figure for each value 14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b423">(Spearman, 1904)</ref>.</p><p>Given it is the relative importance of an individual's values within their motivational system that To better investigate the systematic influence of values, in accordance with <ref type="bibr">Fischer's (2013, p. 1123)</ref> assertion that "what is important is the alignment with theoretically derived correlation patterns and such an alignment can be achieved independent of absolute correlation strength", we subjected value/performance correlations to shape-consistency analysis. Anticipating that values may exert influences consistent with the circular relationships described by the Schwartz system, and a linear hierarchical relationship sympathetic with the EToV, we used Procrustes analysis to find the greatest correlation between theoretically idealised transformations of sinusoidal (circular transformed to linear) shapes. This involved manually altering the phase, amplitude, and tilt of the sinusoidal axis of a single cycle of a sine wave to correspond with a single cycle of  circle for each of the value/response correlation patterns (as depicted in figs.SM6-SM13 <ref type="bibr" target="#b477">15</ref> ).</p><p>As per <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">Boer and Fischer (2013)</ref>, correlations between an idealised waveform and experimental findings were calculated with respect to differences in the sum of the squares of two sets of ten yvalues corresponding to ten evenly distributed x-values corresponding to each of  personal values (as they appear in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">fig.5</ref>). While such a distribution of values is sometimes depicted (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b352">Lee et al. 2019)</ref>, it does not accurately reflect the relationships between values (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b414">Schwartz &amp; Boehnke, 2004)</ref>. While the general relationship between values and the two axes shown in <ref type="figure">fig.1</ref> (main paper) is well established and broadly stable, the precise location of boundaries between values varies between studies . Rather than attempt to more accurately reflect this, in interpreting the results we adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">Boer and Fischer's (2013)</ref>  To investigate the effects of systematic relationships between values more directly, we also analysed the decision-making of differently motivated individuals. In the absence of either a widely accepted methodology or typology that fits with an evolutionary, quasi-Maslowian interpretation of Schwartz's system, we adapted that of Dominant Needs Analysis (DNA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b478">16</ref> . This allocates individuals to one of five motivational types, dependent on which is the central value of their dominant (i.e., most important) triad of neighbouring values (as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">fig.SM5</ref>). Given the ten values are abstract divisions of a continuum, rather than being discrete , the use of higher order value triads is consistent with established theory and empirical precedent, such as when using the higher order values of self-transcendence, openness, self-enhancement, and conservation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">Boer and Fischer, 2013)</ref>. Three DNA motivational types fit the Maslowian hierarchy as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">fig.SM2</ref>: the conservation values associated with love, belonging and security needs being most important to 'Shepherds'; self-enhancing values associated with esteem needs being most important to 'Hunters'; and self-actualizing/transcending needs and values to 'Philosophers'. A fourth hierarchical type, 'Explorers', located between Hunters and Philosophers as per the third proposed phase of evolutionary emergence, describes those for whom hedonism and stimulation are the most important.</p></div>

Standard scores were converted so that the lowest and highest could be represented within a 0-100% scale.</p><p>The average standard scores for values in each of the ten triads were calculated for each participant.</p><p>Individuals were initially allocated to one of the four hierarchical motivational types according to the location of the middle value of their highest scoring (i.e., dominant) triad (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">fig.SM5</ref>). To better facilitate a linear, evolutionary, hierarchical, and Maslowian interpretation, individuals whose dominant triad was centered on benevolence were allocated to either the Shepherd type, if conformity was more important than self-direction, or the Philosopher type, if the reverse was true.</p><p>To evaluate the decision-making biases of individuals most likely to be subject to motivational conflicts, i.e., those for which no one triad, or wider set of sympathetic values, dominated others, a fifth motivational type labelled Moderators was used. All those whose dominant triad failed to outscore the next highest scoring and potentially conflicting triad by more than 6% were allocated to this type. Potentially conflicting triads were taken to be those with no common values. For this purpose alone, benevolence was treated as if it comprised two values: one associated more with tradition and conformity, the other with universalism and self-direction.</p><p>The choice of the 6% threshold was arbitrary but informed by a desire to set it high enough to Point biserial (Pearson) correlations between individuals' ten value scores and decisions were calculated for each of the decision-making challenges and <ref type="bibr" target="#b423">Spearman (1904)</ref> adjustments for attenuation made.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SM3 (c) Discussion</head><p>Consistent with previous findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Bardi &amp; Schwartz, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b282">Doran, 2009)</ref> this study revealed circular/sinusoidal patterns of values-related decision-making biases, but, consistent with theoretical expectations, these were supplemented by hierarchical influences. The patterns of personal risktaking between the motivational types was broadly in line with theoretical expectations, in that Shepherds were the most risk averse, Explorers the least, and Hunters ranking between the two in respects of Q1(ii), Q2 and Q4. For Q2 and Q4(a), the performance of the types followed the circle,</p><p>with Philosophers being similarly risk-averse to Hunters. However, in respect of Q4(b) Philosophers and Explorers were the least risk-averse, being as likely to risk incurring additional losses as not. This suggests an ambivalence consistent with our evolutionary justification of  observations regarding the greater resourcefulness of self-actualizing individuals.</p><p>The expectation that Philosophers would be the most likely to give rationally supportable answers was met in respect of Q5, due to the significant positive contributions of self-direction and universalism. It is also possible to make a rational argument in support of their greater preference for guaranteeing the survival of 30% of the population in respect of Q3. This makes sense from a widely framed, self-transcending, tribal or genetic perspective, as it guarantees the survival of the tribe and its gene pool. The alternative -a 45% chance of saving all and a 55% chance of saving no one -only makes more sense from the perspective of a selfish individual, as it maximises the chances of personal survival yet is more likely to save no one.</p><p>The marginally superior performance of Philosophers and the significant hierarchical influence of values in Q7 is consistent with the expectation that Philosophers would display the highest intelligence and Shepherds the lowest. However, the relatively small sample involved, and the lack of statistically significant differences between the performance of the motivational types, limits what may be inferred from this result. The clearest evidence of a hierarchical pattern of influence was in respect of Q8, <ref type="bibr">Guilford's (1967)</ref> Alternative Uses Test. The shape consistency of the pattern of An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) value correlations and related motivational type performance suggest that statistically significant correlations and differences between the performance of the motivational types would be likely to emerge if the exercise was repeated with a larger sample.</p><p>Given that the independent thought and action associated with self-direction are inextricably linked with intelligence and creativity, that correlations between self-direction and success in Q7 and Q8</p><p>were lower than those for the neighbouring values of stimulation and universalism are puzzling. It may be that these arise from discrepancies between self-evaluation and reality, and from shortcomings in the way the systematic relationships between 'higher' and 'lower' values are accounted for. Evidence that such factors are at play would seem to be provided by the average Shepherd and Hunter profiles shown in <ref type="figure">fig. SM14</ref>. These show self-direction scoring higher than might have been expected given the trend of scoring in neighbouring values, suggesting a perceived influence at odds with the relative importance given to conformity and security.</p><p>Theoretical expectations concerning the greater potential for those most likely to be subject to values conflicts (i.e., Moderators) to respond rationally to propositions that invite erroneous intuitive responses, or involve delayed gratification, also seem to have been met. Because values exhibiting the greatest positive and negative correlations with responses to the various propositions were likely to be relatively less influential in the motivational systems of Moderators than they were to other types, one might have anticipated Moderators would perform close to the average of other types. However, Moderators most preferred the risky option with the higher equivalent value in Q4(a) and were among the most likely to wait a month for £5,500 rather than take £5,200 immediately in Q1(ii). Most striking was their superior performance in respect of Q6(i), where</p><p>Moderators provided more correct answers than all other types combined, despite only representing 17% of the sub-sample responding to this question.</p><p>It is apparent the changes made to the Bayesian challenges of Q6, including replacing an open response with a multiple choice, improved the success rate for all types. However, given a 33%</p><p>An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) chance of guessing correctly in Q6(ii), that there were no significant differences between the type and only Hunters achieved an average success rate (34%) above this, the replacement of open responses with multiple choices seemingly made respondents of all types equally likely to disengage from rational consideration of the proposition.</p><p>Evidence for the influence of values on non-values-laden decision-making was found both in individual value scores and in the responses of differently motivated individuals. By accounting for the systemic interaction of values in individual motivational systems we found that relatively small, often statistically insignificant correlations between individual value scores and decisions concealed stronger, apparently values-driven influences. For example, over twice as many Explorers were prepared to risk losing £100 for a 50% chance of gaining £200 in Q2 as conservative Shepherds, despite no more than around 4% of the variation in choices being attributable to any one value.</p><p>Similarly, in respect of Q3, the apparently negligible contributions of self-direction and benevolence led Philosophers to be 28% more likely to prefer the certainty of saving 30% of people to a 45% chance of saving everyone than Hunters, who were most subject to the apparently negligible opposing influence of power and achievement.</p><p>As was demonstrated by changing considerations of delayed gratification in Q1, and the presentation of Q6, values-related responses may be highly sensitive to changing variables.</p><p>Inevitably, when the disparity between options becomes too small (or great) there will tend to be agreement between decision-makers regardless of their values. However, between these limits the influence of values can be expected to vary. If variance is normally distributed, it is to be expected that the different value priorities of individuals will contribute to the greatest divergence of decisionmaking somewhere in the middle. Future research might profitably explore decision-making challenges tuned to investigate 'sweet spots' of maximum values-related variance.</p><p>An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SM3 (d) Strengths, limitations, and directions for future research</head><p>Our findings illustrate how values influence decision-making in relation to challenges designed to test system 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b428">(Stanovich &amp; West, 2000)</ref> intuitive biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b338">(Kahneman, 2011)</ref>, and propensities for engaging system 2, rational thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b338">(Kahneman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b428">Stanovich &amp; West, 2000)</ref>. They also point toward how values affect rational capabilities. As such they advance our understanding of how values affect decision-making in real life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b338">Kahneman (2011)</ref> suggested that the type of risk-aversion exhibited in response to equivalents of Q2 could give rise to considerable opportunity costs if replicated in the decisions of many individuals in many organizations. Over many iterations, as might happen in large organizations, preferences for 'safe' options with equivalent financial values considerably below those of 'risky' options would eventually become the equivalent of refusing gifts with real values equal to the differences in these equivalent values (£50 in Q2). However, the questions we presented are perhaps too simplistic to fully explore real-life decision making. Organizational decision-makers are also subject to prescriptive guidelines and cultural pressures (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">Jabs, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b448">Weber et al., 2005)</ref> likely to be as influential as their personal values and other personal biases. For individuals, comparable decisions are likely to made in the light of other considerations salient to values, such as previous experiences, their impact on others, and how they will be viewed by others.</p><p>As with any self-reporting measure, the accuracy with which responses to the  questionnaire reflect the 'real values' of participants is uncertain. While removing data from some participants may have helped, it is likely spurious entries remained. Even genuine responses may be subject to imperfections in self-knowledge. The systematic nature of  values enables us to review the likely influence of any one value with respect to others, which ascribing individuals to motivational types sought to do. However, as the suggested restrictions on the effective self-directedness of those who attach great importance to conservative and self-enhancing values illustrates, a reliance on self-assessed value scores to determine motivational type is likely to An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) be sub-optimal. Allocational accuracy is most likely to be compromised when the margin by which values on the progressive half of the circle outscore those on the conservative half is small, because this may underestimate the restrictive influence of the 'lower' values. Given that the independent thought and action associated with self-direction are inextricably linked with intelligence and creativity, it seems likely the comparatively small correlations between self-direction and success in Q7 and Q8 relative to those for the neighbouring values of stimulation and universalism reflect such shortcomings in measurement. Budgetary constraints and a desire to make participation easier, and so expedite the gathering of data within time constraints, limited our ability to compare the relationship between intelligence, values, and decision-making. Research to analyse the performance of much larger samples with respect to a variety of measures of intelligence would shed further light on the apparent hierarchical relationship between values and intelligence, and their distinctive influences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SM3 (e) Research Conclusion</head><p>Our findings suggest that values may play a more extensive role in decision-making than previously thought. In addition to the circular pattern of correlations between values and decision-making biases usually associated with the Schwartz (1992) system, there is evidence to suggest coexistent linear correlations consistent with our proposed evolutionary hierarchy. This superimposes developmental influences attributable to the evolution of the increasingly complex systems of humanity: from the simple conservation of energy in its most fundamental components and antecedents, to the intelligent self-regulation of the CAS it has become. Additionally, the evidence suggesting individuals most likely to be prone to experiencing values conflicts are more likely to make decisions that fit neither with circular nor linear hierarchical patterns of correlations, and points toward values playing an important role in mediating between systems 1 and 2 thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b428">(Stanovich &amp; West, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>

Consistent with social identity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b324">(Hogg, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b346">Korte, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr">), homophily (McPherson et al., 2001</ref>, and the sympathetic relationships between values explained by , one might anticipate that individuals will tend to feel more at ease with, and therefore preferentially seek out, others who share similar value priorities. This encourages localised convergence and harmonization. Such de-homogenizing has the broader systematic effect of accentuating divisions between the social identities of differently motivated groups. In conservative The systematic challenges presented by globalization, climate change, and the growth of technology that replaces many but is owned by a few <ref type="bibr" target="#b292">(Freeman, 2015)</ref> are among those presenting themselves in an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world <ref type="bibr" target="#b354">(Mackey, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Meeting these with comprehensively informed initiatives requires ever greater numbers of individuals with a diversity of specialized and generalized knowledge to work cooperatively. Even within a scientific community reliant on shared information and learning, overcoming the boundaries between specializations that frustrate transdisciplinary cooperation seems to be proving problematic <ref type="bibr">(Er Saw &amp; Jiang, 2022</ref>).</p><p>An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</p><p>We perceive two major values-related issues to be inhibiting societies around the world from enabling the type of challenging cooperative endeavour required. Firstly, the value most directly associated with the status, influence, and control involved in leadership is power. Given the links between values, career choice, and organizational culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">(Arieli et al., 2020)</ref>, and between motivation and achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b333">(Johnson et al., 2014)</ref>, it seems likely that those most likely to occupy positions of power in large organizations, whether educational, commercial, or governmental, are power-driven. Consistent with this expectation, research by <ref type="bibr">Babiak et al. (2010)</ref> suggests that psychopathy, which is associated with power-related motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b303">(Glenn et al., 2017)</ref>, is significantly more common in senior leaders than in the general population.</p><p>Power-driven individuals are motivated to behave in ways that facilitate others deferring to them and granting them the influence and control they desire. Power is a competitive value likely to inhibit cooperation. In increasingly complex and fast changing environments the less likely it becomes that any one individual has the knowledge to make effective decision-making without incorporating information from other sources. In such environments effective decision-making demands cooperation between individuals who are helpful, curious, open to the ideas of others,</p><p>willing and able to share information, able to admit mistakes, honest, forgiving, capable of developing broad based understanding, etc. These are all qualities associated with the higher values, which may in turn be associated with transformational leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">(Bass, 1985)</ref>. These progressive and cooperative values are in opposition to the lower conservative values when considered hierarchically, and to the competitive values when considered in terms of  circle.</p><p>Behaviors associated with conservative values, such as following instructions, fitting in, not challenging the status quo, tend to be well adapted to large organizations, as they promise to maximise efficiency by suppressing internal conflict and uncontrolled risk-taking. They are useful to power-driven leadership, as they encourage deference to those in positions of power. The challenge for large organizations is how to reconcile personal power-driven tendencies toward the pursuit of short-term goals with the self-transcending characteristics required for sustainable prosperity.</p><p>An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</p><p>Personal compulsions to raise and maintain one's status, influence, and control, frustrate cooperative working, innovation, and rational risk-taking.</p><p>The second and related problem is that, in progressive democracies, governments are elected by popular vote. The more volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous the world becomes, and the greater the effects of cultural drag become, the larger the proportion of electorates unwilling or unable to engage with, let alone understand, the complex challenges arising is likely to become.</p><p>Given a choice between: (1) a power-driven potential leader that offers an electorate information it can comprehend, analyses of the problems they face that fit with their own prejudices, and seemingly simple solutions that promise not to adversely affect them; and (2) a self-actualizing, leader that honestly presents the nature of the complex challenges faced, and the perhaps uncomfortable changes people must make to overcome them, it would seem increasingly likely that electors will favor the former. From the perspective of natural selection, in these circumstances, power-driven leaders may exploit public ignorance to promote strategies that are better adapted to this psychological environment than alternatives better adapted to reality.</p><p>While these issues may present huge challenges, the knowledge that organizations led by transformational leaders (i.e., those likely to be motivated most by higher values) tend to perform better (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b299">García-Morales et al., 2012;</ref>, and be better places to work (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Sun &amp; Wang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Toor &amp; Ofri, 2010)</ref>, should make it possible to offer such leaders and organizations as exemplars. Also, since people's values can be developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">(Bardi &amp; Goodwin, 2011)</ref>, the hierarchical structure we have identified, and the developmental logic that explains its evolution, would seem to offer considerable potential in identifying and pursuing initiatives in personal and organizational development to improve societal preparedness to address the challenges of the VUCA</p><p>world.</p><p>An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SM4 (b) Mental Illness &amp; well-being</head><p>Given the fundamental role we suggest values and their equivalents play, there would seem to be great potential to extend values-related research into other fields. Mental illness and well-being, for example, would seem to be areas ripe with potential. The strong positive correlation of power and negative correlation of benevolence with Dark Triad personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b339">(Kajonius et al., 2015)</ref>, and the latter's association with psychopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b385">(Paulhus &amp; Williams, 2002)</ref>, hints at the possibility of there being a common neurological driver for the imbalances involved.</p><p>Paulhaus &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b385">Williams (2002)</ref> observed that subclinical psychopaths were low on neuroticism. Given the intimate relationship between values and affect , and the reasonable conjecture that the affect heuristic influences all decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b462">(Zajonc, 1980)</ref>, those most prone to experiencing values conflicts seem most likely to experience mixed feelings that make decisionmaking difficult and potentially stressful. If so, those least prone to values conflicts would seem the least likely to experience emotional instability. In the case of psychopaths, the lack of a moderating influence from other values, particularly benevolence, might effectively grant power-related motivations free reign. While those otherwise strongly motivated by any dominant value or suite of values might also be expected to experience little in the way of motivational conflicts, the influence of other values may be sufficient to normalize their behavior within the bounds of social acceptability.</p><p>It is perhaps worth pointing out that such conflicts could be internal, due to opposing values being similarly dominant, or because an individual's dominant values conflict with the values-equivalents of their environment. Given that each value contributes to the motivational environment of the others, both situations would be consistent with an extended systematic interpretation of the person-environment fit approach analysed by van Vianen (2018); i.e., local system-wider system fit.</p><p>For example, an individual who places equal importance on self-direction and conformity might experience stress as they experience opposing urges to express their individuality through self-An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) direction and their need to fit in through conformity. Similarly, an individual who is constrained, ostracised, or otherwise frustrated by lack of fit with others, because, say, of a conflict between personal self-directedness and group conformity, is likely to experience negative emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b351">(Leary, 2015;</ref>. Accordingly, further examination of the systematic relationship between values and values-equivalents in person-environment approaches, between values and emotional instability, and with other mental health issues may yield information that would aid understanding, prevention, and treatment.</p><p>One possibility we have considered, but for which we have no clear evidence, is that unrestrained self-direction may be linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in ways comparable to the link between unrestrained power motivation and psychopathy. To be clear, the lack of restraint being referred to is speculated to arise from genetically rooted, UMM-related neurological mechanisms from which values emerge, rather than simply being related to values per se. The apparent link between self-direction and intelligence and the exceptional mathematical abilities of some individuals with ASD (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b328">Iuculano et al., 2014</ref>) draws one's attention. More common symptoms of ASD include: inabilities to read and express feelings and interpret information other than literally;</p><p>being blunt/rude; needing to maintain routine; picking up on detailed information that others miss; having an obsessive interest in certain subjects (NHS, 2023). Of these, the last two can be considered direct expressions of curiosity, which is a component of self-direction. The remainder may be considered deficiencies resulting from a lack of influence from other values. Social skills evolved to promote and exploit cooperation, and over time became culturally enshrined. As such, they are rooted in the conservation/cooperation quadrant of the UMM, and carried forward in the values of benevolence, tradition, conformity, and security. Abilities to recognise and exploit these for competitive advantage followed and can be associated with the change/cooperation quadrant of the UMM: carried forward in the personal values of power and achievement. Accordingly, it is tempting to consider the possibility that aspects of neural function associated with self-direction have developed at the expense of those associated with lower values.</p><p>An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</p><p>The need for routine associated with ASD could be matched to the value of conformity. However, an alternative interpretation is that a compulsion for curiosity and understanding is so great in ASD sufferers that they are prone to extreme stress from information overload. If so, maintaining routines in which there is a relative absence of new information, and comforting opportunities to explore familiar areas of information more thoroughly, may be seen as effective coping strategies.</p><p>Other areas of potential concerning motivational imbalances would appear to be addiction and bipolar disorder. The values of particular interest here would appear to be achievement, hedonism, stimulation, and self-direction. Superficial associations between values-related motivation and behavior suggest links between: achievement and being a workaholic; hedonism and addiction to sex, alcohol and/or drugs; and stimulation to risky, high-adrenaline activities, or, more generally, restlessness or attention deficit syndrome. Logically, if the need-satisfying behaviors these values promote fail to achieve homeostasis, the urge to maintain them will be maintained. Therefore, regardless of an individual's achievements, achievement-related desires to win the approval of others will not abate. Similarly, regardless of the hedonistic pleasure and novel activity promoted by hedonism and stimulation values, an individual will not arrive at a state of motivational equilibrium, and so will continue to indulge these values.</p><p>It is possible to consider the hierarchical evolutionary structure of values we propose as a developmental structure that may also be ascended in a lifetime. If needs associated with each value are satisfied, surplus resources may be freed up for investment in behaviors aimed at satisfying the next value up in the hierarchy. As described in the main paper, the logic being that each successive value offers a more efficient means of satisfying basic needs. Accordingly, as subsequent values are engaged, reliance on lower values may diminish. As with financial investments, the ability to make the type of higher-risk/higher-reward investments associated with the higher values is contingent on the availability of a surplus. Those unable to satisfy needs associated with lower values will be unable to free up resources to make these potentially more rewarding investments. They will find themselves in the emotional equivalent of a poverty trap.</p><p>An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</p><p>Given the heritability of values <ref type="bibr" target="#b439">(Twito &amp; Knafo-Noam, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b460">Zacharopoulos et al., 2016)</ref>, it is likely we are born with predispositions that upset this developmental sequence. If the shuffling of genes in meiosis allows individual motivational systems with randomized value priorities, and varying linkages between values and behavior, an individual's ability to resolve motivational conflicts and develop through progressive phase transitions is likely to be frustrated. However, where genetic barriers to development are relatively low, the type of value-changing initiatives described by <ref type="bibr">Bardi and</ref> Goodwin (2011) may overcome them.</p><p>We consider the possibility of a link between bi-polar disorder and malfunctioning homeostatic relationships between these values on the grounds that bi-polarity is associated with higher intelligence, risk-taking, alcohol and drug abuse, feelings of worthlessness and negative affect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">Brady &amp; Sonne, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b309">Green et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b370">Motovsky &amp; Pecenak, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nowakowska-Domagała et al., 2023)</ref>. These cited resources are consistent with personal observations of individuals suffering from bipolar disorder. A possible interpretation of a link between values and bipolar disorder is that, despite having strong self-directedness (which we relate to higher intelligence) and impressive track records of achievement, afflicted individuals are prone to feeling themselves to be worthless and hopeless failures, leading them to invest their surplus energy in hedonistic and thrill-seeking activities from which they derive no long-term satisfaction. It is easy to picture this in terms of a value system with similar features to that illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">fig. SM15</ref>, i.e., with similarly dominant achievement, hedonism, stimulation, and self-direction values. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SM4 (c) In a wider context</head><p>If, as we suggest, all systems can be considered as evolving in relation to the axes of the UMM, then it would follow that equivalents to Schwartz's values may useful in providing relatable strategies by which to consider their operation. This is perhaps of greatest interest when considering humanity's relationship with economic and ecological systems. As we have argued, sustainable evolution requires competitive strategies to be subservient to cooperative ones. Yet large organizations and governments tend to provide environments better adapted to those motivated by the competitive values of power and achievement. This perhaps has encouraged the promulgation of a mistaken belief that competition alone drives progress, and this rather than cooperation needs to be protected (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b294">FTC, 2023)</ref>. Given that progress is ultimately dependent on innovation, and innovation is facilitated by the cooperation of two or more previously disconnected ideas or pieces of information, research into which requires broad-based understanding and carries no guarantee of success, innovation is better facilitated by self-direction, universalism, and benevolence than power and achievement. The purpose of competition is to: judge the cooperative efficiency of two or more different strategies or products, eliminate the least effective, and preferentially distribute the most An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) effective, so mimicking natural selection's survival of the fittest. Seen as such, competition may be considered as serving waste-management and replication functions more than driving innovation.</p><p>If the purpose of competition is misunderstood, so too is the potential for cooperation to be misunderstood. The values that promote self-transcendent cooperation are universalism and benevolence. Universalism concerns gaining knowledge of the natural system of which humanity is part. Because the natural world evolves through the interaction of competitive and cooperative strategies, universalism promotes not just an understanding of the virtues of cooperation, but also the role of competition. While the 'tit for tat' strategy of the Prisoner's Dilemma may be considered a broadly cooperative strategy, it dictates immediate retaliation against those failing to cooperate.</p><p>As discussed previously, the higher values offer alternative strategies to supplement those promoted by the lower values. They are not simply replacements for them. Consequently, a universalist and benevolent approach allows for a ruthlessness that might seem uncooperative when considered within narrow contexts. However, in wider contexts, ruthlessly targeting and destroying competitive strategies unaligned with overarching cooperative strategies sustains systemic cooperation in ways similar to treatments intended to destroy cancer cells in the human body.</p><p>Inconsistency in the treatment of competitively minded business and political leaders on one hand and competitively minded criminals and slackers on the other illustrates a misunderstanding of the role of competition. When populist leaders ruthlessly pursue strategies to undermine competitors in pursuit of personal or team gain they may be lauded as if they were sporting or military victors <ref type="bibr" target="#b390">(Rhodes &amp; Hart, 2014)</ref>. However, when fraudsters, drug dealers, and benefit cheats employ comparable strategies they are more likely deemed scourges of society (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">Baker &amp; McEnery, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berghoff &amp; Spiekermann, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Boddy et al., 2015)</ref>. A better understanding of the relationship between cooperation and competition and the values that support them, and an increased representation of individuals with motivational systems dominated by cooperative values (i.e., those most likely to promote cooperative strategies) in corporate and political governance, would seem to offer widespread benefits for society. Indeed, if we are to make the progress required to avert An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) environmental and political crises <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">(Boin et al, 2016)</ref>, and raise ourselves to confront the unfolding challenges presented by artificial intelligence, this would seem essential.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 5 A</head><label>5</label><figDesc>universal motivational map (UMM) resonant with the structure of</figDesc></figure>

A phase transition comparable to that orchestrated by the combination of physical systems takes place when complementary pieces of information are brought together. The inspiration that provides the equivalent of activation energy may result from accident, curiosity, thought experiment, and/or pattern recognition. Patterns suggest where continuations might lead, or highlight aberrations or conflicts indicative of missing or misinterpreted information. With evolving knowledge came emergent phenomena such as written language, the printing press, and the Internet: each with the potential to further improve humanity's cooperative endeavour and operational efficiency. The evolution of the complex genetic system that facilitated humanity's superior processing capability (e.g., Plomin &amp; Deary, 2015), may have been a gateway event (Morowitz, 1999) that gave our ancestors an enduring competitive advantage over other organisms. The more complex the interaction of genes, phenotypes, and environment required to facilitate superior processing, the less likely it would have been that selection pressure on random gene mutations in competing organisms would have given rise to combinations capable of facilitating effective counter measures. If this, the absence of intense competition from other hominins in a dispersing population (Huff et al. 2010), and our greater cooperative potential, cut the genome of our ancestors some slack from the competitive pressures of natural selection, potentially costly genetic mutations offering no immediate competitive advantage, that would otherwise have been eliminated, would more likely have been tolerated, passed on, and made available for future environmental testing.</figDesc></figure>

The linear component (derived from Procrustes analysis) was most pronounced in respect of the RPM fluid intelligence and GAUT creativity tests shown in fig.6(a) &amp; (b).

For this, the polar opposition in preparedness to accept risk associated with the circular arrangement of conservation and openness to change values is seen to exert the greatest influence. However, the linear hierarchical component is clear, and fits with our evolutionary theory, insofar as higher values and their equivalents are deemed to have evolved in sympathy with trends toward greater capacities for innovativeness and the accumulation of surplus personal resources: the creative experimentation required for innovation demanding a preparedness to invest resources without immediate prospect or guarantee of making a return.</figDesc></figure>

Through the systematic relationships between values, all other values are indirectly related to morality. The conservative values seek to perpetuate cooperation through setting formal moral codes, following the good example of respected others, and by punishing transgressors.Immorality finds expression in behavior deemed to be antagonistic to cooperation because it is selfish and/or damaging to others. While self-enhancement values are not inherently immoral, their opposition to self-transcendence values reflects the increased likelihood that competitive selfinterest will promote attitudes and behaviors prejudicial to the interests of others.Moral behavior might be considered as that which conforms to the maxim of the golden rule: do what you will but harm none. While perceptions of what is right, harmful, or moral may be subjective and dynamic (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Day et al., 2014)</ref>, law-making seeks to promote morality through statute. Immoral behavior such as deceit, theft, wilful manipulation, physical attacks, and other forms of law-breaking are competitive acts that seek to benefit an individual at the expense of the cooperative interests of others. Moral behavior reflecting honesty, consideration for others, helpfulness, and bearing responsibility for one's actions are cooperative acts that seek to maximise shared group benefits.</figDesc></figure>

As illustrated with reference to the Prisoner's Dilemma in the main paper, long-termism and short-termism readily relate to cooperative and competitive strategies respectively. However, given that conservative values are the least progressive, one could argue they promote narrow-framed, short-term attitudes such that one might anticipate an evolutionary hierarchical dimension to the influence of values in relation to this dimension. Indeed, those most motivated by conservative values have been shown to be the least prepared to defer reward (see SM3,. The masculinity-femininity dimension associates stereotypical gender attributes such as assertiveness, strength, and competitiveness with masculinity, and nurturing, quality of life, and cooperation with femininity. As such, this dimension can be readily associated with the competition-cooperation dimension of the UMM.</figDesc></figure>

The Big Five is the most widely accepted model of personality traits. Its five traits of neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and consciousness each comprise six facets, to which the HEXACO model added the sixth dimension of honesty/humility with four facets, as shown in fig.

Trust arises from benevolent cooperative relationships or sources of information that agree (cooperate) with that gained from experience and rational analysis. Conservative values seek to consolidate and protect this by limiting change, while competitive values are more likely to promote strategies that exploit trust for personal gain. Selfactualizing values promote trustworthiness through their promotion of gaining and disseminating An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) reliable information. Control is directly related to power values but, in terms of sustainable control over one's direction of travel in dynamic environments, may be achieved more efficiently through the higher values. Similar applies to self-esteem and status: both directly related to power values, but ultimately better realized through self-actualizing values. Self-coherence largely corresponds with Maslow's self-actualization needs, and so to Schwartz's self-direction, universalism, and benevolence values. Accordingly, Dweck's model offers aspects of need that can be derived from the UMM's change and mode of change axes.</figDesc></figure>

It may be possible to improve upon the coarse-grained findings we have made with appropriate controls and refinements, but neurological investigation may be required to gain a fine-grained understanding of people's values and their influence on decision-making.It may be that values-related decision-making biases are more fully revealed in real life situations concerning propositions that are more ambiguous and complex, and in respect of which the consequences of decisions are real and the risks tangible. Indeed, given that organizations tend to foster cultures, and therefore nurture individuals, sympathetic to the value priorities of their leaders(e.g., Hoffmann, et al., 2011), and the effects of consistent decision-making biases seem likely to be exaggerated and compounded when the challenges people face are contingent on the outcome of previous decisions, there would seem considerable potential for relatively small biases to have considerable compound effects. Large scale longitudinal research that analyses the responses of different motivational types to a range of comparable challenges that satisfy these criteria, in a variety of domestic and organizational settings, would help in developing a better understanding.An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)</figDesc></figure>

One might anticipate that self-enhancing (competitive) values would incline individuals toward exerting an influence, or making an impression on others, irrespective of the desires of those third parties. When compared to those less inclined to make an impression, such extraverted behavior is more likely to conflict with the desires of others.Consequently, the finding that self-enhancing values correlate positively with extraversion, and negatively with agreeableness fits with expectations. Reciprocally, that the opposite is true for selftranscending values is also fitting. Similarly, it is no surprise that the dutiful compliance one might associate with conscientiousness relates positively to conservation values (following precedent, being obedient, and observant of rules) and negatively to openness to change values. Given honesty is a component of benevolence, the positive and negative correlations between the honestyhumility dimension of HEXACO and self-transcending and self-enhancing values also matches expectations.An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)Of the Big Five, only neuroticism (or emotional instability) fails to show meaningful correlations.Given that emotions are components of decision-making processes, and values are inextricably linked to affect, it would be reasonable to consider that those individuals most subject to values conflicts would likely score highly in neuroticism. When the values most important to an individual are sympathetic to each other (i.e., are located next to each other in the Schwartz system) they will tend to work together. However, in personal value systems where no sympathetic group of values dominates, competition between conflicting emotions seem likely to result in emotional instability.
