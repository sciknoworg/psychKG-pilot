			<abstract>
				<p>Objective: Non-technical skill behavioural marker systems were developed for two distinct helicopter operation types; search and rescue and offshore transport. Background: Behavioural marker systems are tailored observational frameworks geared towards the assessment of non-technical skills and their associated elements by way of rolespecific behavioural markers. To date, behavioural marker systems exist across a variety of high-risk occupations, however no identifiable system exists based upon data derived from rotary operatives. Method: Discussion groups (n=9) were undertaken with subject matter experts (n=20) including pilots and technical crew operating across search and rescue and offshore transport environments, geared towards the identification of role-specific behavioural markers. Systems were reviewed on an iterative basis by the academic team and received final reviews by additional subject matter experts (n=6). Results: Two behavioural marker systems were constructed; HeliNOTS (O) for offshore transport pilots and HeliNOTS (SAR) for search and rescue crews. Both share the same core non-technical skill categories, but each includes a unique category-&apos;cognitive readiness&apos; for search and rescue, and &apos;workload management&apos; for offshore transport. While elements were consistent across categories, behavioural markers varied based upon operational role. Conclusion: The results confirm the need for tailored behavioural marker systems across helicopter mission types and provide role-specific behavioural makers for SAR and offshore transport crews. Application: The HeliNOTS behavioural marker systems represent a significant step towards a nuanced approach to training and assessment of helicopter flight crews&apos; non-technical skills and are the first publicly available systems tailored to these distinct mission types.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Helicopters are uniquely flexible aircraft, able to fly lower and access more remote terrain than fixed wing aircraft <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Morowsky &amp; Funk, 2016)</ref> and consequently they are used for a variety of high-risk operations including offshore transport, search and rescue and emergency medical services, forestry operations and fire-fighting ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">de Voogt, Uitdewilligen &amp; Eremenko, 2009)</ref>. These kinds of operations require crews to fly in hazardous conditions, including darkness, inclement weather and poor visibility <ref type="bibr">(Aherne et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Christensen et al, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Setten &amp; Lein, 2019)</ref>, as well as presenting complex landing situations, sometimes on undesignated sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baker et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hinkelbein et al., 2010)</ref>. The level of risk associated with helicopter flight is emphasised within the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) 2019 aviation safety review report, with 1,120 occurrences reported for offshore, onshore and emergency service helicopter flights combined, 11 of which were rated as high severity <ref type="bibr">(CAA, 2019</ref>).</p><p>An important component within aviation safety management, and a key mechanism for supporting pilot effectiveness and safety, is crew resource management (CRM), defined as 'the effective utilization of all available resources <ref type="bibr">(e.g., crewmembers, aircraft systems,</ref> supporting facilities and persons) to achieve safe and efficient operations' <ref type="bibr">(Flin 2019, p. 185)</ref>. A fundamental aspect of CRM is the enhancement of pilot non-technical skills (NTS), the social (inter-personal) and cognitive (thinking) skills necessary, alongside technical knowledge, for safe and effective work performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Flin et al., 2008)</ref>. The importance of these skills is emphasised within aviation safety reports, where lapses in NTS are related to adverse incidents, for example, loss of situation awareness in low visibility conditions was linked to a helicopter pilot losing their visual reference points on approach to landing <ref type="bibr">(CAA, 2019)</ref>. In common with fixed wing airlines, to comply with national regulations (for example, see CAA 2016), helicopter companies must train and assess their pilots' CRM skills on a DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS 5 regular basis. To be effective, the basis for NTS training within CRM should ideally be a tailored behavioural marker system (BMS); an observational tool which provides a taxonomy of the relevant skills, elements, and associated behaviours for training and assessment purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Flin et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the importance of a tailored system for training purposes, no such system, to our knowledge, currently exists for helicopter pilots. Instead, CRM training and assessment within helicopter operators is often based upon the NOTECHS system <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(O'Connor et al., 2002)</ref>, which was produced for the aviation context, but was primarily based on fixed-wing operations and does not distinguish between different flight, aircraft or mission types.</p><p>Recognition of variation in skill use and emphasis across mission types appears to be particularly important for helicopter flight. Recent research reporting variation in the categories of NTS skills necessary for specific helicopter mission types (offshore transport; search and rescue), as well as differences in their emphasis and execution related to key mission aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hamlet et al., 2020)</ref>. This included the importance of a concept known as cognitive readiness which, while applicable to offshore transport operations, should be considered part of an everyday skillset for search and rescue personnel -where solving problems, reacting to unforeseen circumstances and maintaining resilience are all crucial. To address the lack of specific helicopter crew NTS frameworks for particular mission types, this paper describes the development of two tailored BMSs for helicopter flight: HeliNOTS (O) (for offshore transport pilots) and HeliNOTS (SAR) (for search and rescue pilots and technical crew).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developing a BMS</head><p>BMSs are used to support the observation, evaluation, and training of key NTS within high-risk industries and professions. Each system has unique components that are context and/or role specific and must be developed through a rigorous research process with the DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS 6 workers who will be using the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Flin &amp; Martin, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yule et al., 2006)</ref>, rather than transplanting a generic system from one industry, or one job role, to another. The need for specificity is highlighted through the variation in the elements, and behaviours, required across different healthcare roles: SPLINTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mitchell et al., 2010)</ref> for example breaks the core NTS skills of scrub practitioners into three categories (Situation awareness, Communication and teamwork, Task management) while ANTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fletcher et al., 2003)</ref> outlines the skills of anaesthetists in four (Task management, Teamworking, Situation awareness, Decisionmaking). As such, each has similar, yet role-specific, associated elements and behavioural markers. In each of the described systems, the steps towards development of the system encompassed a literature review, interviews with practitioners, and a series of focus/discussion groups alongside academic or expert review to ensure the skills, elements and behaviours were all reflective of actual practice.</p><p>An additional consideration for the development of BMSs for helicopter flight is the number and function of flight crew. Specifically, while offshore transport (OT) helicopter crews consist of two pilots (pilot flying and pilot monitoring), search and rescue (SAR) crews encompass two pilots plus technical crew (TC) located in the rear of the aircraft. These crew members, made up of a winch-operator and winch-paramedic, aid in the planning, coordination and preliminary medical assessment and care of a casualty. Their input is frequent; across 2,380 UK-based SAR missions in 2019, 52% were classified as rescues or recoveries (Department for Transport, 2020). Given that studies have noted the inputs and skills of the TC (e.g. hazard perception, communication, team coordination, mission planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Morowsky &amp; Funk, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Plant &amp; Stanton, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Plant &amp; Stanton 2016)</ref>), and their role in flight safety, it will be important to include TC behaviours and elements in the development of the SAR BMS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS 7</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary framework</head><p>The behavioural markers systems described within this paper were built upon a body of research exploring the NTS utilised by OT and SAR crews. An initial NTS framework for the pilots of both flight types was reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hamlet et al (2020)</ref>. Specifically, the framework encompassed six skill categories: situation awareness, decision-making, task management, communication, teamwork and leadership for both flight types, plus an additional skill category of cognitive readiness for SAR crews. This interview study was followed by a focus group study designed to further explore the relevance and use of each skill, enhance the existing frameworks, and identify the factors influencing NTS performance across these flight crews <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hamlet et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hamlet, 2021)</ref>. The focus group findings, in addition to a further interview study with SAR TC personnel, confirmed the six-skill category framework, and the addition of the cognitive readiness skill for SAR crews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study aim</head><p>Building on the studies reported above, the next step in the development of the HeliNOTS (SAR) and HeliNOTS (O) BMSs was to confirm the core NTS categories and elements identified in the research, then develop observable behavioural markers (both positive and negative) for each element. This objective was achieved through a series of subject matter expert discussion groups, combined with expert and academic review, to produce the prototype version of HeliNOTS (O) and HeliNOTS (SAR). Given that the studies mentioned above identified differences between how the pilots and TC of a SAR aircraft may utilise their skills, the prototype of HeliNOTS (SAR) includes both shared and role-specific behavioural markers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stages of development</head><p>The study was conducted over four key stages:</p><p>1. Academic review and conversion of the OT and SAR helicopter crew NTS frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hamlet et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">2021)</ref> into a format suitable for use within the discussion groups. This is referred to as the 'refined version/s' below.</p><p>2. Discussion groups with subject matter experts (helicopter pilots, CRM trainers) to confirm the key skills and elements produced via Hamlet and colleagues alongside generating observable behavioural markers.</p><p>3. Refinement of the system between discussion group sessions by way of academic review.</p><p>4. Final subject matter expert review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical approval</head><p>This research complied with the American Psychological Association Code of Ethics and was approved by the University of Aberdeen, School of Psychology ethics committee, Scotland. Informed consent was obtained from each participant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic team</head><p>The academic team, referred to below, comprised the first, second and third authors, two of whom have more than ten years of NTS research experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>An essential component of BMS production is the involvement of SMEs, utilising their input across various levels of development (e.g. behavioural marker production, review). Experienced OT pilots, SAR pilots, and SAR TC personnel were the subject matter experts (SMEs) for this study. They were recruited, via email and social media (LinkedIn), DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS 9 and originated from a SAR and OT operator based in the UK (Operator A), an OT operator based in the UK with a SAR operation in Ireland (Operator B), an Australian Air Ambulance Service (Operator C), and a Northern European military SAR operator (Operator D).</p><p>Four SAR training consultants were recruited from different consultancies in the UK (n=2), Central Europe (n=1), and Australia (n=1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design criteria</head><p>Prior to devising a method for developing the HeliNOTS BMSs, several design criteria were outlined based upon those used for the development of NOTECHS <ref type="formula">(</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Framework pre-development (stage 1)</head><p>Prior to liaising with SMEs, the academic team developed refined versions of each role's NTS framework (i.e. SAR pilot, SAR tech crew and OT pilot), derived from the DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS 10 research described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hamlet et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hamlet, 2021</ref>). This refinement process centred upon removing unobservable elements and amalgamating any elements interpreted as overlapping. These refined frameworks provided the basis for SME discussion groups, with the OT version containing 29 elements and the SAR version containing 27 elements. At this stage, it was decided that cognitive readiness should be included within the refined OT framework, to assess whether behaviours associated with the skill were readily volunteered by the pilots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SME discussion groups and academic review (stages 2 &amp; 3)</head><p>Following the method outlined by O'Connor et al <ref type="formula">2002</ref>, discussion groups for HeliNOTS (O) and HeliNOTS (SAR) were conducted by the first and fourth authors with SMEs (experienced pilots, TC personnel and CRM trainers). While similar to focus groups, where participants are encouraged and led by a moderator to discuss specific topics under investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acocella, 2012)</ref>, the term 'discussion group' as used here describes the more interactive role the researchers played within the discussion. This could involve directly challenging or offering contributions as part of the discussion with the participants or playing an active role alongside the participants in developing the system collaboratively.</p><p>The first discussion group of HeliNOTS (O) and HeliNOTS (SAR) were conducted in person; at Operator B's office in Aberdeen in the case of HeliNOTS (O) and at a Scottish SAR base in the case of HeliNOTS (SAR). However, due to Covid-19 restrictions, all other groups were conducted via Zoom meetings. In each session, members of the academic team led the group through each NTS element asking for examples of positive and negative behavioural markers associated with the element. The researchers would note suggestions and discuss research findings on that concept with the participants to identify additional behavioural markers. The researchers would also engage with the participants on potential overlaps (across categories, elements and behavioural markers) or behavioural markers that DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS 11 may be problematic to observe. While no single group could dictate a categorical or elemental change in the framework they were shown, the academic team would consider this feedback against the other groups and come to a decision on pertinent amendments.</p><p>Discussion groups followed an iterative process, whereby the first SME discussion group for each system was shown the refined version of the NTS framework (mentioned previously) and asked to discuss potential behavioural markers on an element-by-element basis until the whole system was addressed or 90 minutes had expired. From there, the academic team would review the newly proposed behavioural markers and either approve them, edit marker wording, merge overlapping markers, or move markers to better-fitting elements. The next consecutive group/s would be given this updated version to consider in their discussion group session. This process was repeated until a) the academic team could confirm that the design criteria were satisfied and that b) the systems were met with general approval during the final discussion group.</p><p>Discussion groups were held from February -September 2020. These ranged from an hour to 90 minutes and were recorded for reference. Each role-specific discussion group contained 2 -3 participants (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS 12</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Review (stage 4)</head><p>The review stage was initiated once discussion groups had ceased, and preliminary behavioural markers had been established. The SMEs recruited to take part in reviewing the systems were experienced individuals within the domains who were either known to the DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS 13 research team or had volunteered to take part in the study. The format of review groups varied between the systems due to recently implemented Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p>The SMEs acting as reviewers were sent the system corresponding to their role / expertise by email and asked to review it in its entirety. They were to report any questions or concerns about: a) the system's usability and feasibility, b) the absence of key behaviours, c)</p><p>any overlap between elements within a skill or between skills, d) the wording of behavioural marker examples. For HeliNOTS (O), a review group was undertaken via a group Zoom meeting with two SMEs from the same organisation. For the pilot section of system SAR, a group of pilots (which had previously participated in a development discussion) were asked to undertake individual reviews on the entire system prior to the TC personnel's input. This was due to the issues encountered with recruitment as a result of Covid-19, where in person access to participants had been restricted. However, using this group again was considered an appropriate course of action given that the participants were highly integrated into the operator's CRM training processes and would have valuable insights into system usability and feasibility via a separate review. After TC discussion groups were concluded, the entire system (including SAR pilot and TC behavioural markers) was reviewed by three SAR training consultants.    and associated descriptions were based upon those outlined in NOTECHS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Flin et al, 2003)</ref> given the similarities between NTS assessment in fixed-wing and rotary environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure of the HeliNOTS systems</head><p>The decision to utilise a five-point scale, as opposed to the alternative four-point scale (e.g. ANTS, SPLINTS, NOTSS) was based on the general familiarity of the operators with the five-point NOTECHS based rating scale that already existed. Due to this, in the review group of HeliNOTS (O), the researcher asked the participating CRM and ex-CRM trainers to discuss their previous usages of four-and five-point scales, their preferences between the two and the justification for this preference. In this discussion, a strong inclination was noted for a five-point scale over a four-point scale; it was suggested that a five-point scale allowed more scope for degrees of passable performance while also providing more reflective feedback <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 4)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS 18</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructions for users</head><p>Both HeliNOTS systems were produced in the format of a handbook, which included the system, the HeliNOTS rating form, and opening guidance for users who wish to use the system. This included:</p><p>• an introduction to the handbook and contact information</p><p>• general information for users surrounding NTS and BMSs</p><p>• the rationale for the system and its associated taxonomy</p><p>• system user, and pilot (junior/trainee vs. experienced), selection and training</p><p>• suggested functions and practical recommendations.</p><p>This opening section was based upon the preceding system handbooks of ANTS, SPLINTS and NOTSS, which all heavily emphasised the importance of such guidance for the calibration of users to ensure system reliability in use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The HeliNOTS (SAR) and HeliNOTS (O) systems outline the core NTS and associated elements and behavioural markers for search and rescue crews and offshore transport crews respectively. The systems were designed utilising SME input to maximise their usability for operators while training and evaluating flight crews it was viewed as a method of observing the presence of NTS behavioural markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(O'Connor et al., 2002)</ref>. While we are in agreement with this, and previously note that the content of communications be used to detect cognitive NTS behaviours, all focus groups reported a strong preference for a standalone communication categoryan indication of the fundamental importance of this skill to helicopter crews. A similar finding was reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Irwin et al. (2022)</ref> where agricultural workers emphasised the need for a standalone communication category with its own behavioural markers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>20</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Situation Awareness</head><p>The data from the preceding studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hamlet et al., 2020)</ref> suggested a fit for Endsley's three-tier model of situation awareness (1995) and in the current discussion groups, helicopter crews readily proposed behavioural markers for these three levels (i.e. perception, comprehension, anticipation). This, too, appears to be the case for BMSs such as SPLINTS, ANTS, and NOTECHS. It is acknowledged that there is an argument for a situation awareness category built instead around the concept of distributed situation awareness which may account more for the technological components of helicopter flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Stanton, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, one of several team situation awareness models <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(She &amp; Li, 2017)</ref> could also be used to account for inherently interactive and cooperative aspects of situation awareness during flight. However, given that the coding process of the original <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hamlet et al. (2020)</ref> study grouped data according to their shared underpinning meaning there was no justification to amend the systems to another model of situation awareness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leadership and Teamwork</head><p>The NTS framework prior to refinement (i.e. before stage 1) encompassed four elements of leadership for each flight domain: The SAR specific element of overseeing the decision-making process; the OT specific element of training other crew members; and the shared elements of directing task behaviours, monitoring crew members, and tone-setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hamlet et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">2021)</ref>. In the pre-development phase (stage 1) of the current study it was agreed by the academic team that training as an element could not be considered an everyday element of leadership in an operational, as opposed to specifically line-training, context. In addition, the SAR specific 'overseeing the decision-making process' element was removed during this phase due to overlap with the decision-making skill category. Further, given that both teamwork and leadership categories for both roles incorporated elements of monitoring DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS 21 other crew members, considerations were initially made as to which category the element of monitoring other crew members should belong.</p><p>Directing task behaviours and tone-setting, were considered by the discussion groups (in stage 2) to lie ambiguously between leadership and teamwork domains. In a SAR environment, where a multidisciplinary flight crew must coordinate tasks across various stages of a rescue (e.g. transit, winching, casualty care), oversight of a particular task falls into the domain of the relevant crew-member's expertise. Leadership within a SAR environment can be seen as distinctly transferrable in that any team member can take the lead when they see fit, something <ref type="bibr">Bligh et al. (2006, p.305)</ref> refer to as 'shared leadership':</p><p>leadership as a team level phenomenon. In this sense, directing task behaviours or simply taking the lead can, for the purposes of the HeliNOTS BMSs, be considered a component of effective teamwork. Similarly, across all discussion groups, pilots and TC personnel felt that tone-setting (amended to setting and maintaining crew atmosphere) was something that each team member should undertake to avoid conflict and facilitate crew openness. Contrary to traditional views of leadership, leadership can also be a team-driven process, shared and distributed amongst a team, though clearly this is dependent on context <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Day et al., 2004)</ref>,</p><p>This precedent within the literature, combined with the data gathered from the discussion groups, led to the development of the combined teamwork and leadership NTS category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision-making and the assessment and management of risk</head><p>An awareness and management of risk element was outlined in the skill lists produced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hamlet et al. (2020)</ref> for both SAR and OT and was included in the refined versions of stage 1. However, across a substantial proportion of discussion groups from each system, it was highlighted that the assessment of risk aspect of this element was closely related to the situation awareness element of comprehending informational elements. Indeed, Endsley Previously pilots had indicated that decision-review this was a critical aspect of decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hamlet et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">2021)</ref> and this was reflected in the current discussion groups. The process of reviewing decisions is suggested to be a useful method of cognitively disengaging from a task, re-establish situation awareness and plan for future actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Geraghty &amp; Paterson-Brown, 2020)</ref>. This process of reviewing decisions is recognised in the medical BMS NOTSS which outlines an element and associated behavioural markers for implementing and reviewing decisions made by surgeons <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Yule et al., 2008)</ref>. In the ANTS system for anaesthetists, this decision-making review was termed 're-evaluating' and involved the reassessment of a situation or course of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Flin et al., 2012)</ref>. suggested by the CRM trainers in the HeliNOTS (O) review group that this may be because while cognitive readiness behaviours may appear to be important to any aviation role it may not be a standard flight skill one could expect from an OT pilot as opposed to SAR pilots.</p><p>Indeed, the basis of the concept of cognitive readiness is that it is most relevant to teams operating within dynamic and resource-limited environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Crameri et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>However, it was determined that some aspects of cognitive readiness (e.g. adaptability) were relevant to the OT environment, albeit out with an emergency response context. In light of this, these behaviours were better suited towards categorisation as workload management, the elements of which covered the prioritising of duties (e.g. correct sequence of checks) and the maintaining of standards, whilst a coping with task demands element was constructed to encapsulate the ways in which OT pilots noted being flexible and rational (e.g. response to adverse weather), in relation to their operational environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The HeliNOTS systems are currently pre-validated. Studies to consider the psychometric properties of BMSs are commonplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fletcher et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mitchell et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Yule et al., 2008)</ref>, and amendments may be made based on these results; for example, task management was removed as a category of NOTSS by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Yule et al. (2008)</ref> based on an evaluation of the preliminary framework finding that these behaviours were too closely related to situation awareness. The two HeliNOTS systems do, however, provide the basis for further testing and validation and this is a future aim for the researchers.</p><p>A second limitation is the lack of consistent data collection method across review groupswhich varied from email format in the case of HeliNOTS (SAR), to a focus groups for HeliNOTS (O). Additionally, for the pilot portion of system SAR, as mentioned previously, two participants who took part in a previous discussion group were also recruited to individually review the entire system handbook. While a consistent method would have DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS 24 been highly beneficial for validity, it simply could not be achieved in the pandemic circumstances, and therefore the review groups were undertaken with available SMEs to obtain this essential industrial feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The HeliNOTS systems were developed to outline the core NTS behavioural markers relative to the roles of OT helicopter pilots, and SAR helicopter pilots and TC. A range of SMEs took part in discussion groups and contributed reviews towards the production of the systems. The two resulting systems outline NTS categories and elements with maximum mutual exclusivity in a simple and pragmatic format to assess observable and inferable NTS performance. These HeliNOTS systems (including the rating forms and instruction booklets)</p><p>have been designed to be used for both training and assessment purposes with the aim of enhancing helicopter flight safety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Points</head><p>• Behavioural marker systems tailored observational frameworks geared towards the assessment of non-technical skills and their associated elements.</p><p>• Helicopter non-technical skills (HeliNOTS) systems were developed alongside pilots, technical crew from international operators and aviation consultancies.</p><p>• The HeliNOTS (SAR) system for search and rescue contains a unique domain specific skill category of 'cognitive readiness'; the HeliNOTS (O) system for offshore transport contains a domain specific category of 'workload management'.</p><p>• HeliNOTS systems are the first publicly available behavioural marker systems that outline the core non-technical skills, elements, and behavioural markers for helicopter search and rescue and offshore transport operations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>O'Connor et al, 2002): • Categories and elements should be based upon the maximum achievable mutual exclusivity with minimal overlap • The systems should be pragmatic, concise and useable, relying on as few categories and elements as possible to encompass critical behaviours • The terminology used should be recognisable to helicopter pilots and CRM trainers and assessors • All social and personal resource behavioural markers (associated with leadership, teamwork, communication, workload management) be directly observable, and all cognitive behavioural markers (associated with decision-making, situation awareness, cognitive readiness) be either directly observable through action or the use of communication.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>HeliNOTS (O) and HeliNOTS (SAR), are made up of five main categories, each subdivided into elements and associated behavioural markers (see Figure 1 for example of the category, element, behavioural marker relationship). Both systems share the same four core categories: Communication, Leadership and Teamwork, Situation Awareness, and Decisionmaking. System (SAR) includes the unique category of Cognitive Readiness, highlighting this skill's fundamental importance in relation to the SAR environment. System (O) includes a fifth category of Workload Management which was considered to be essential for OT DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS 14operations. The categories and elements of each system can be viewed inTable 2. Full systems, outlining all of the behavioural markers for HeliNOTS (O) and HeliNOTS (SAR), instructions for users and the HeliNOTS rating scale, can be accessed online at: https://research.abdn.ac.uk/applied-psych-hf/helinots.

The HeliNOTS systems are the first to the authors' knowledge of BMSs constructed specifically for the roles of OT and SAR, however given the systems are currently prototypical, further refinement should be conducted. The remainder of this section discusses the categories in the two systems. Communication HeliNOTS (SAR) and HeliNOTS (O) both contain a standalone category for communication. This stands in contrast to NOTECHS and the healthcare related BMSs of SPLINTS and ANTS. For example, in NOTECHS the authors suggest that communication was an inherent aspect of the other NTS categories, and that, for the purposes of NOTECHS,</figDesc></figure>

To reduce overlap, this element was removed.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Cognitive readiness vs. workload managementBoth HeliNOTS systems share the same core structure aside from the unique categories of cognitive readiness for HeliNOTS (SAR) and workload management for HeliNOTS (O). The justification for these unique elements derives from the study of Hamlet et al. (2020).Originally,<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hamlet et al. (2020)</ref> outlined six shared NTS across SAR and OT pilots: situation awareness, decision-making, task management, communication, teamwork, and leadership. A primary finding of this study was the identification of a range of data related to dynamic emergency scenarios for SAR pilots. Cross-referenced against previous literature, the data appeared to fit the concept of cognitive readiness as outlined by<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Morrison and Fletcher (2002)</ref>. The same data were not present for the OT sample.Cognitive readiness was, nevertheless, initially included in HeliNOTS (O) review groups to stimulate additional discussions around this skill in an OT context. By the second HeliNOTS (O) review group, it became clear that OT pilots could not readily propose behavioural markers of the skill. It was DEVELOPMENT OF HELINOTS 23</figDesc></figure>
