			<abstract>
				<p>Decisions that require taking prospective effort costs into account are ubiquitous in real life. The common currency theory hypothesizes that a neural network integrates different costs and rewards into a common scale to facilitate value comparison. Although there has been a surge of interest in the computational and neural basis of effort-reward integration, it is still under debate if the common currency theory could be applied to value integration in this context. Here, we comprehensively compared effort-based and risky decision-making using computational modeling, univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses, and data from two independent studies. We found that prospective outcomes were distinctively discounted by effort and risk. Moreover, although univariate fMRI analyses showed diverse results between tasks, multivariate decoding analyses indicated that the neural patterns of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) represented subjective value information across effort-based and risky decision-making. These findings suggest that the dmPFC plays a critical role in computing subjective value in a taskindependent manner and thus extend the scope of the common currency theory.</p>

For instance, many everyday activities such as exercising <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Harris &amp; Bray, 2021)</ref> and helping others <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lockwood et al., 2017)</ref> involve physical effort. Furthermore, an imbalanced effort sensitivity has been found to be closely related to a variety of disorders including schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gold et al., 2015)</ref>, binge eating <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brassard &amp; Balodis, 2021)</ref>, Parkinson's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chong, 2018)</ref>, aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Byrne &amp; Anaraky, 2020)</ref>, and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Berwian et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Treadway et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Considering its ubiquitous presence in our daily life and clear clinical relevance, it is crucial to elucidate the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying effort-based valuations.</p><p>The common currency theory suggests that a neural network is involved in subjective value calculation on a single scale across multiple types of reward and decision situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Levy &amp; Glimcher, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">McNamee et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sescousse et al., 2013)</ref>, thus providing a powerful framework to explain how different options are compared in the brain. Indeed, in decisionmaking with common costs, such as risk and delay, numerous studies have shown a positive association between ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity and subjective value <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bartra et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kable &amp; Glimcher, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Peters &amp; Büchel, 2009)</ref>, which implicates its critical role in cost-reward integration regardless of task types. Hence, the vmPFC has been proposed as a central node of this domain-general valuation network <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bartra et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Levy &amp; Glimcher, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>While this view has also received some supportive evidence in effort-based decisionmaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aridan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hogan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Westbrook et al., 2019)</ref>, a few other studies have identified effort-related value signals beyond the vmPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Klein-Flügge et al., 2016)</ref>, particularly in a more dorsal portion of the medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) that mainly includes the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and some parts of the presupplementary motor area <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kolling et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Piva et al., 2019)</ref>. A meta-analysis of fMRI studies showed that both vmPFC and dmPFC activity is associated with effort-reward integration, although in opposite directions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021)</ref>. These findings thus raise the possibility that, next to its ventral counterpart, the dmPFC also plays an important role in computing subjective value of effortful options.</p><p>To date, only a few studies with divergent results have directly tested if the common currency theory could be applied to effort-based decision-making by comparing it with decisions that involve other types of costs (e.g., risk and delay) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aridan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Massar et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Prévost et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Seaman et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, one study found that vmPFC activity increased with subjective value during both effort-based and risky decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aridan et al., 2019)</ref>, whereas some other studies showed that the dmPFC (especially the dACC) was uniquely involved in effort-reward integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Massar et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Prévost et al., 2010)</ref>. Another study identified subjective value signals in a large cluster covering both the vmPFC and dmPFC regardless of task types <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Seaman et al., 2018)</ref>. One possible factor that may have caused the inconsistency between studies is that some studies required participants to exert effort during decision-making, while other did not, possibly confounding neural correlates of subjective value with motor execution effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021)</ref>. Moreover, those studies mainly relied on a mass-univariate approach, which ignores the dependencies between brain voxels, as opposed to multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Haynes &amp; Rees, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Norman et al., 2006)</ref>. Thus, studies solely based on univariate analyses might be less sensitive to detecting signals related to subjective value in heterogeneous regions like the medial prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jimura &amp; Poldrack, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kahnt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nee et al., 2011)</ref>. Finally, trial-wise subjective value used in fMRI analyses is typically inferred based on a computational model. Although a few studies have explored a range of computational models used to describe choice behaviors during effort-based decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Klein-Flügge et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Prévost et al., 2010)</ref>, there is still an ongoing debate on the computational underpinnings of effort-reward integration, and it remains largely unclear if effort and risk have similar discounting effects on prospective outcomes.</p><p>The current study aimed to directly test the common currency theory by examining which brain regions represent subjective value information across effort-based and risky decisionmaking. Unlike previous studies, we used a combination of computational modeling and both univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses, to first reanalyze an existing dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aridan et al., 2019)</ref> and then conducted an independent study to confirm our results. While the univariate analyses showed rather divergent results between effort-based and risky decision-making, MVPA consistently indicated the dmPFC as a possible site of subjective value representations across effortful and risky tasks. Our results might help reconcile current debates on the neural basis of effort-based valuation and extend the scope of the common currency theory to include the dmPFC as a critical region in value processing independent of cost types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To examine both effort-based and risky decision making in a common paradigm, in study 1, we reanalyzed the choice and fMRI data from an open-access dataset by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aridan et al. (2019)</ref>.</p><p>This dataset includes two one-option decision-making tasks, with either effort <ref type="bibr">(N = 39;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fig. 1a)</ref> and risk (N = 38; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1b</ref>) as the cost on each trial, respectively. Effort requirements were defined as proportions of participants' maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), as measured in the calibration task at the beginning of the experiment. Risk levels were defined as the losing probabilities of an option. In addition to the cost, each option was associated with a potential gain and a potential loss. In each trial, participants decided to accept or reject an option. At the end of the experiment, a trial was randomly selected from each decision-making task. If the selected option was accepted, the outcome (gain or loss) depended on successful effort execution for the effortful task or losing probability for the risky task. Otherwise, if the selected option was rejected, participants would not get or lose any reward.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 1.</head><p>Experimental design of study 1 and study 2. Schematic design of the one-option effortbased (a) and risky decision-making tasks (b) used in study 1. Each trial included three components: a potential gain, a potential loss, and a cost (effort or risk depending on the task type). In study 2, prior to scanning, participants were asked to complete an effort-calibration task (c), a cue-effort association training (d), and a task to estimate indifference points for all combinations of rewards and effort levels (e). Participants also had to complete a cue-risk association training and an IDP task for risk (i.e., effort was replaced with risk in d and e). For effort-based (f) and risky decision-making (g) conducted in the scanner, the amount of the smaller reward was determined by the indifference point of the large-reward option (as determined in the IDP task shown in e) and a proximity value ( = • (1 + )).</p><p>The second study, which aimed to conceptually replicate the findings from study 1, was largely similar to the above described setup. On issue in in study 1 was that participants accepted more effortful options than risky options, which may reflect different decision difficulties in effort-based and risky decision-making. To maintain similar overall acceptance rates between tasks and to explicitly control the effects of decision difficulty on value processing, we therefore increased the overall effort requirements in study 2 (0.50-0.95 MVC). Moreover, in addition to the effort calibration ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1c</ref>) and cue-cost association training ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1d</ref>) tasks, we conducted another pre-scanning task ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1e</ref>) to estimate participant-specific indifference points for different combinations of rewards and costs (i.e., effort or risk) using a stepwise titration manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Westbrook et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Westbrook et al., , 2019</ref>) (see Supplementary Methods and <ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref> for details).</p><p>For the effort-based (N = 30; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1f</ref>) and risky (N = 31; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1g</ref>) decision-making tasks conducted within the scanner, we manipulated the amounts of smaller rewards around these indifference points. Specifically, each trial included two options, one associated with a larger reward and a certain effort or risk level, and another with a smaller reward but no cost. The amount of the smaller reward was varied around the indifference point of the large-reward option based on a proximity parameter (i.e., = • (1 + )). The proximity parameter specified the subjective value difference between two options. For example, a small absolute proximity value means that the subjective values of two options are close to each other, which leads to a difficult decision in this trial, and vice versa. At the end of the experiment, ten trials were randomly selected for each task outside the scanner. For effort-based decision-making, participants had to exert the effort requirement to obtain the corresponding reward. For risky decision-making, the computer decided if they would get the reward based on the losing probability of the chosen option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2.</head><p>Behavioral and modeling results. In study 1, (a) participants accepted less effortful and risky options when cost levels increased. (b) Discounting curves based on the two-parameter power function with mean parameter values showed that effort and risk had distinct effects on prospective outcomes. Shaded regions represent 95% highest density interval (HDI) of the mean fitted line. In study 2, (c) pre-scanning tasks showed that participants' normalized indifference points (i.e., indifference point/large reward) decreased when effort or risk cost was high. (d) For effort-based and risky decision-making conducted in the scanner, the overall high-cost option acceptance rate was around 50% for both tasks. Moreover, the probability of choosing a highcost option was influenced by the proximity value. (e) Similar to study 1, the effort discounting curve has a more concave shape compared with that of risk. The difference was more significant in study 2 because we increased the overall effort requirement in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of effort and risk on choices</head><p>We first conducted two one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to examine general effects of effort and risk on choices, respectively. In study 1, results ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2a)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral modeling of effort-and risk-related value integration</head><p>To precisely quantify how participants integrate effort and potential outcomes to calculate the subjective value of an option on a trial-by-trial basis, we examined a range of computational models (see Materials and Methods). These included five functions that have been used to characterize the discounting effects of effort (i.e., linear, hyperbolic, parabolic, twoparameter power, and sigmoidal functions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aridan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arulpragasam et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Klein-Flügge et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Prévost et al., 2010)</ref>, as well as two approaches to characterize prospective outcomes (objective amount and utility function; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>. The probability of choosing the effortful option was calculated using a softmax function.</p><p>Models were fitted under a hierarchical Bayesian framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahn et al., 2017)</ref>. A model comparison was conducted based on leave-one-out information criterion (LOOIC), which is a Bayesian criterion to evaluate the out-of-sample predictive performance of a model <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Vehtari et al., 2017)</ref>. A lower LOOIC indicates a better fit between the model and data. Model weight was also calculated using Bayesian model averaging based on Bayesian bootstrapping, with a higher weight indicating a higher probability of a model to have generated the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Yao et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Since the use of the utility function compared to objective amounts improved the model fit, we will focus on models with the utility function as the outcome (model comparison results for models based on objective outcomes are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table S2</ref>). The leave-one-out information criterion (LOOIC) is a Bayesian criterion to evaluate the out-ofsample predictive performance of a model, with a lower value indicating a better fit. Here we used the winning model as the reference and calculated ΔLOOIC compared to other models. Model weight was calculated using Bayesian model averaging based on Bayesian bootstrapping.</p><p>CPT: cumulative prospect theory.</p><p>For effort-based decision-making in study 1, model comparison results <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref> showed that choice behavior was best described by a model based on the two-parameter power function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= − • "<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where SV is subjective value, OC is prospective outcome, k and p are two free parameters, which reflect the discounting rate and cost sensitivity (i.e., effort in this case), respectively. Compared with one-parameter discounting functions (k as the only free parameter), such as linear and parabolic functions, the two-parameter power function can produce a larger range of discounting curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arulpragasam et al., 2018)</ref>. Importantly, although the effortful task used in study 2 had a different structure (e.g., two options and no losses involved), model comparisons showed that the two-parameter power discounting model also fit the data best. Together, these results suggest that the two-parameter power discounting model can best characterize the profile of effort discounting among the model space, which may help resolve the ongoing debate on the computational mechanisms of effort-reward integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Klein-Flügge et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Prévost et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding risky decision-making tasks, in addition to the ten candidate models sketched above, we added a model based on cumulative prospect theory (CPT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref> to the model space. Crucially, however, the model based on the two-parameter power function was also the winning model for the risky task in study 1, and the finding was confirmed in study 2. Hence, this pattern of results allows us to compare risky and effort-based decision making in a common computational framework.</p><p>Since model comparison only provides insights into the relative performance of the models in the model space, we further examined the validity of the winning model based on separate posterior predictive checks for each task. This analysis suggested that all winning models could generate posterior predictions that captured key features of the data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. S2</ref>).</p><p>Additionally, we conducted parameter recovery analyses for the winning model for each task.</p><p>The results showed that all group-and individual-level parameters could be accurately recaptured ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S3-S4</ref>). k and p are two free parameters of the two-parameter power function that control the shape of the discounting curve.</p><p>Having established that risky and effortful choices can be reliably captured in our winning model, we next asked whether effort and risk devalue prospective outcomes in a similar fashion. As mentioned above, the two-parameter discounting function can produce a wide range of discounting curves. Although it is the winning model for both effort-based and risky decisionmaking, it is still possible that effort and risk have distinct discounting effects on prospective outcomes. To directly test this question, we compared four variants of the two-parameter power model with either the same or separate and for the effortful and risky task, that is, the two parameters that determine the shape of the discounting curve. We found that the model with separate and showed the best fit in both studies <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 2)</ref>. Specifically, compared with risk, effort showed smaller discounting effects on outcomes when costs were low but larger devaluations when costs were high (i.e., more concave shape; <ref type="figure">Fig. 2b</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. 2e</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Univariate neural correlates of subjective value</head><p>To examine the neural correlates of subjective value during risky and effortful decision making, we next analyzed fMRI data using model-based trial-by-trial subjective values from the winning model of each task. We split trials based on the median subjective value and focused on the contrast of high versus low values in most analyses. We first used univariate general linear model (GLM) analyses to replicate previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aridan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021)</ref>. Based on the findings from a previous meta-analysis on effort-based value integration (Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021), we restricted our analyses within a frontostriatal mask (see Materials and Methods). Since we are particularly interested in the roles of the vmPFC and dmPFC, we extracted the mean effects from 6-radius spherical masks centered at the peak coordinates if there were significant clusters in these two regions. We used the independent coordinates (vmPFC coordinate: 0, 40, -4; dmPFC: 0, 22, 38) from an independent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Piva et al., 2019)</ref> to extract effects if there were no significant clusters in the vmPFC or dmPFC.</p><p>For effort-based decision-making ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table S3</ref>), we found that dmPFC activity was negatively associated with subjective value magnitude in both studies ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3c</ref>).</p><p>Conversely, vmPFC activity was positively associated with subjective value in study 1, but this effect was not significant in study 2 (t(30) = -0.10, p = 0.90, Cohen's d = -0.02).</p><p>For risky decision-making ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table S3</ref>), vmPFC activity was positively associated with subjective value in study 1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 3b</ref>).

In study 2, we therefore orthogonally manipulated subjective value and decision difficulty, which allowed us to test if the neural patterns of the dmPFC reported above were specific to subjective value. We split trials into highand low-difficulty conditions for each decision-making task in study 2 (see Materials and Methods). Notably, subjective value information could still be decoded in the dmPFC at a voxellevel uncorrected threshold of p &lt; 0.005 in both conditions of each task <ref type="table">(Table S4</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-task subjective value encoding in the dmPFC</head><p>The within-task multivariate decoding analyses described above detected subjective value information in the dmPFC during both effort-based and risky decision-making. However, it is still unclear if the dmPFC employs unique subjective value codes in different tasks, or encodes value information in a task-independent manner as suggested by the common currency theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kahnt, 2018)</ref>. To directly test this idea, we utilized a cross-task multivariate decoding approach by training the classifier based on data from one task and testing its performance in decoding value magnitude in another task <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 3)</ref>. If the decoding accuracy of a brain regions is significantly above chance level, it suggests that the neural patterns of this region represent subjective value in a similar fashion across effort-based and risky decision-making. Strikingly, we found that the anterior part of the dmPFC contained subjective value information independent of task type in study 1. The cluster extended into the vmPFC when using a more lenient voxellevel threshold of p &lt; 0.005. In study 2, task-independent value information was mainly represented in the posterior dmPFC, but not the vmPFC (t(30) = -0.92, p = 0.37, Cohen's d = -0.16). Importantly, although the significant clusters from the two studies did not perfectly overlap, the above-chance decoding maps converged in a cluster in the dmPFC <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5c</ref>) at an uncorrected voxel-level threshold of p &lt; 0.005. These findings thus provide support to the common currency theory and highlight the critical role of the dmPFC in subjective value representation across tasks and datasets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We used behavioral modeling combined with univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses to examine the neural and computational mechanisms underlying effort-based and risky decision-making. We found that effort-and risk-related costs showed distinct discounting effects on potential outcomes when calculating subjective values. At the neural level, although the univariate analyses yielded divergent results between tasks, the multivariate decoding analyses showed that the dmPFC represented subjective value information in a task-independent manner.</p><p>These findings further elucidate the neural response patterns within the medial prefrontal cortex during value integration and suggest that the dmPFC may serve as a potential hub in subjective value computations independent of the cost types involved in decision-making.</p><p>Previous behavioral modeling studies have used different discounting functions to describe the way that effort devalues prospective outcomes, yet yielded mixed results, possibly because they have relied on different model spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Klein-Flügge et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Prévost et al., 2010</ref>). In the current study, we compared a large range of winning models of previous research, and found that the two-parameter power discounting model showed a superior fit to effort-based decision-making in both studies compared with alternative models. A key feature of this model is that, except for the discountingrate parameter k, it includes another free parameter p to characterize effort sensitivity for each subject. Hence, this model could flexibly generate a wide range of discounting curve shapes to account for individual differences in effort valuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arulpragasam et al., 2018)</ref>. Importantly, risky choices were also best described by the two-parameter power discounting model, which thus allowed us to compare effort-based and risky decision making in a common computational framework. In follow-up analyses, we further compared models with same or separate k and p for effort-based and risky decision-making and found that the model with separate k and p provided best fit in both studies. These analyses showed that, compared with risk, effort devalued outcomes to a lesser extent when costs were low, but showed larger discounting effects when costs were high. Thus, contrary to previous assumptions that effort and risk discount reward in a similar fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Burke et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Prévost et al., 2010)</ref>, our findings support the view that these two types of costs have distinct discounting effects on prospective outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Apps et al., 2015</ref>).</p><p>There has also been considerable debate over the exact role of the dmPFC, particularly the dACC area, in effort-reward integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hogan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Klein-Flügge et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Massar et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Westbrook et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Although animal studies showed that lesions to the dACC could profoundly alter effort-related valuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rudebeck et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Walton et al., 2009)</ref>, fMRI studies in humans yielded rather divergent results <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hogan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Klein-Flügge et al., 2016)</ref>. One potential explanation is that the association between dmPFC activity and subjective value is often negative when using univariate analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021)</ref>, which might have been overlooked by studies focusing on positive neural correlates.</p><p>Moreover, neural activity within the dmPFC is highly heterogeneous <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Neubert et al., 2015)</ref>, which may cause the results to be undetectable when voxels within this region are treated as homogenous.</p><p>Therefore, one important advantage of the current study is that we utilized both univariate</p><p>and multivariate analysis approaches and tested the results in two independent studies. Indeed, at the univariate level, we observed negative correlates of subjective value in the dmPFC during effort-based decision-making. When using within-task multivariate decoding analyses, we found that the neural patterns of the dmPFC could be used to decode effort-related value information in both studies. These MVPA findings thus bridge the gap between previous findings based on univariate fMRI analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hogan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Klein-Flügge et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Massar et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Seaman et al., 2018)</ref> and animal lesion studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rudebeck et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Walton et al., 2009)</ref>. Moreover, despite diverse univariate results in the dmPFC during two risky decision-making tasks, multivariate analyses suggested that the neural patterns of this region represent subjective value information. These results are in keeping with a previous study based on intertemporal decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Wang et al., 2014)</ref>, in which MVPA yielded value codes in the dmPFC even in the absence of univariate effects. Taken together, these findings suggest that the dmPFC could represent subjective value based on distributed neural coding that may be beyond the detectability of univariate analyses.</p><p>A question that follows from these considerations is thus whether the dmPFC or other brain regions are involved in value encoding in a task-independent manner. To address this issue, we performed a more stringent cross-task decoding analysis by training the classifier on data from one task and testing its performance on data from another task. Strikingly, this yielded significant decoding of subjective value in the dmPFC, which was consistent across two independent studies, suggesting that subjective value information represented in the dmPFC might generalize across cost types and datasets. Although there is only limited evidence on value encoding across different forms of decision-making, our findings align closely with previous MVPA studies showing subjective value signals in the dmPFC across different decision-making tasks or reward categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gross et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Piva et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pogoda et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefore, these findings provide new insights into the common currency theory proposing that values of different options are converted into a single scale at the neural level to allow efficient value comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Levy &amp; Glimcher, 2012)</ref>. Most previous studies focused on the role of the vmPFC in this process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bartra et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Clithero &amp; Rangel, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Levy &amp; Glimcher, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Peters &amp; Büchel, 2009</ref>). Our cross-task MVPA findings suggest that the scope of this neural system is broader and that the dmPFC may also be critically involved in calculating subjective value regardless of cost types.</p><p>As mentioned above, the vmPFC has been regarded as a potential hub for taskindependent subjective value representation during decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Levy &amp; Glimcher, 2012)</ref>, since a plethora of research has demonstrated neural correlates of value in this region across different reward types and valuation stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bartra et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Clithero &amp; Rangel, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kahnt et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sescousse et al., 2013)</ref>. Indeed, both univariate and multivariate analyses identified neural correlates of subjective value in the vmPFC in two tasks of study 1. However, most analyses, except for multivariate decoding for risky decision-making, did not identified significant value signals in the vmPFC in study 2. These inconsistent results may be related to the differences in the experimental design, since participants could focus on computing the value of the single option in study 1, but may have relied on additional cognitive processes (e.g., attention distribution) in study 2 which represented two options simultaneously in each trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Westbrook et al., 2019)</ref>. Another study using a similar two-option choice paradigm also failed to decode subjective value from the neural patterns of the vmPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Piva et al., 2019)</ref>. However, further research is needed to test this speculation.</p><p>Moreover, the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal around the vmPFC is likely to be affected by susceptibility gradients, and these influences could be reduced by changing the scanning orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Deichmann et al., 2003)</ref>, as implemented in study 1. A potential limitation of study 2 is that it did not use the optimized orientation when collecting functional images.</p><p>Future studies on valuation processes related to vmPFC activity should thus consider changing the imaging slice orientation to reduce related signal dropout.</p><p>In summary, using a combination of computational modeling and multiple fMRI analyses, our study indicates that effort and risk costs have different discounting effects on prospective outcomes. At the neural level, the activity patterns of the dmPFC could represent subjective value across effort-based and risky decision-making, and the results are robust across two independent studies. Overall, the work we present here advances our understanding of the neural and computational mechanisms underlying effort-related value integration and suggests that the dmPFC emerges as a potential hub that utilizes a task-independent mechanism for computing subjective value.</p></div>

Participants were instructed that they did not need to execute the required effort during the task. Instead, a trial would be randomly picked at the end of the task.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental paradigm</head><p>For effort-based decision-making, participants were required to complete three tasks outside the scanner: First, a calibration task <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1c</ref>) was conducted to measure participants' MVC. Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamometer (Vernier HD-BTA, Beaverton, USA)</p><p>using their right hand as hard as possible for 6s, followed by a rest period of 5s. This procedure was repeated five times, and the MVC was defined as the averaged force above the median point over the last half of the squeezing period across these five trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Meyniel et al., 2016)</ref>. Second, participants were trained to remember four associations between effort level cues (level 1-4) and physical effort requirements (50, 65, 80, 95% MVC), because the effort level cues would be used in the subsequent effort-based decision-making task. In each trial, participants were presented an effort level cue. Subsequently, they were shown a thermometer, with the yellow line as the required force level and the height of the red filling as the real-time squeezing force <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1d</ref>). To complete a trial, participants were required to keep the red filling above the yellow line for a total of 6s. Each association was repeated twice, yielding eight trials. Third, participants made a series of choices to estimate indifference points based on a previously validated procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref>. In each trial, participants were asked to choose between an option associated with a larger reward (€2, 3, or 4) and an effort requirement (level 1-4) and an alternative with a smaller reward but no effort requirement. The amount of the smaller reward was changed in a stepwise titration manner (over 6 choices for each unique combination of the effort and larger reward) until the two options were indifferent to participants (see Supplementary Materials for details).</p><p>After the three pre-scanning tasks, another effort-based decision-making task was conducted in the scanner, which is the focus of this paper. Participants were asked to complete a similar decision-making task as used in the third phase <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1f)</ref>. To control the overall acceptance rate of effortful options and ensure sufficient variability in choice behaviors, we varied the amount of the smaller reward (SR) around the indifference point (IDP) of the corresponding larger-reward option using a proximity parameter γ <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Westbrook et al., 2019)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= • (1 + )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Therefore, the absolute value of γ specified the subjective value difference between two options. A positive value indicated that the effortless option was favored, and vice versa. Each run of the task included 48 slightly biased trials (unique combination of proximity parameter value from {-0.4, -0.1, 0.2, 0.5}, effort requirement, and large reward) and eight strongly biased trials (unique combination of proximity parameter value from {-0.8, 0.8} and effort requirement, randomly paired with a large reward). Please note that the amount of the smaller reward would not exceed that of the larger reward. This task included three runs and a total of 168 trials. In each trial, to isolate the motor component from the valuation process, participants were presented two options for 2s (evaluation period) first before getting the notice to make a choice within 2s (action period). A 2-4s interval was used between trials (ITI). At the end of the task (outside of the scanner), ten trials were randomly selected. If participants chose the effortful option, they could only get the rewards after exerting the required effort by squeezing the dynamometer.</p><p>The risky decision-making part was implemented in a similar procedure <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1g)</ref>, except that the calibration task was not required, and that four risk levels were associated with four winning probabilities (90, 70, 50, 30%). The risky decision-making task (168 trials) of the last phase was conducted in the scanner. Again, ten trials were randomly selected at the end of the task outside the scanner. Participants were shown the outcome of each trial generated by the computer based on the winning probability. The order of the effort-based and risky decisionmaking tasks was counterbalanced across participants.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Univariate analysis</head><p>To conduct the model-based fMRI data analysis, we first derived the subjective value of each gamble based on the winning model. For study 1, we focused on the choice period. Two general linear models (GLM1.1 and GLM1.2) were used to examine the neural activity related to the subjective value of each option during effort-based and risky decision-making, respectively.</p><p>These models included two regressors using a stick function: high-and low-value trials, which were split based on the median subjective value. We added the contrast of high-vs. low-value at the first level. Moreover, another two GLMs (GLM1.3 and GLM1.4 for the effort-based and risky decision-making task, respectively) similar to the ones used in the original study were also conducted for confirmation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aridan et al., 2019)</ref>. These models included a regressor of the choice period of all trials and trial-by-trial subjective values as a parametric modulator. We focused on the effect of this parametric modulator at the first level.</p><p>In study 2, to isolate the effects of motor action on valuation, we divided each choice into evaluation and action periods. In subsequent analyses, we focused on the evaluation period and included the action period as a separate regressor of no interest. Because there are two options in each trial, we derived the subjective value of the chosen option from the winning model, consistent with other two-option decision-making studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hogan et al., 2019)</ref>. We repeated the analyses used for study 1, but split trials based on the median chosen subjective value for GLM2.1 and GLM2.2. In another two control GLMs (GLM2.3 and GLM2.4), we used the subjective value difference (i.e., chosen -unchosen value) of each trial as the parametric modulator for effort-based and risky decision-making, respectively.</p><p>In all GLMs, trials without any responses were modeled as a separate nuisance regressor.</p><p>Moreover, six motion parameters from the realignment were included as regressors of no interest. Contrasts from the first-level analyses were taken to group-level random-effects analyses. Voxelwise analyses were conducted within a frontostriatal mask, including Brodmann area (BA) 9, 10, 11, 23, 32 and bilateral nucleus accumbens, caudate, and putamen from the Harvard-Oxford structural atlas, which covered most potential regions within the valuation network <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bartra et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Clithero &amp; Rangel, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021)</ref> and excluded most sensory and motor areas. Statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using a voxel-level uncorrected threshold of p &lt; 0.001 and a FWE cluster-level corrected at p &lt; 0.05 by the means of Gaussian Random Field Theory (GRFT). Since we are particularly interested in the roles of the vmPFC and dmPFC in cost-reward integration, for significant results in these two regions, we extracted the mean effects from 6-mm-radius spherical masks centered at the peak coordinates. If no significant results were detected in these regions, we used the peak coordinates (vmPFC: 0, 40, -4; dmPFC: 0, 22, 38) from a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Piva et al., 2019)</ref> to create spherical masks to comprehensively illustrate their effects in each analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multivariate decoding analysis</head><p>Multivariate decoding analyses were performed using a linear support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for binary classification implemented in The Decoding Toolbox <ref type="bibr">(TDT, v 3.999E;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hebart et al., 2015)</ref>. In study 1, we repeated the above mentioned first-level analyses on unsmoothed data and used the beta images from the choice period of GLM1.1 and GLM1.2 to examine neural representations of subjective value during effort-based and risky decisionmaking, respectively. For each task, a five-fold cross-run validation was used, in which the SVM was trained on all but one run and tested on the left-out run. We utilized the searchlight analysis (radius = 3 voxels) within the frontostriatal mask used in univariate analyses above. Voxelwise cross-validated decoding accuracy (minus chance-level accuracy) was calculated.</p><p>To examine subjective value representations independent of cost types, we further conducted a cross-task decoding analysis, which included the beta images from both GLM1.1 and GLM1.2. The SVM was trained on four runs of one task (e.g., run 1-4 of the effort-based decision-making task) and tested on one run of the other task (e.g., run 5 of the risky decisionmaking task), and the procedure was repeated ten times.</p><p>For study 2, because both decision-making tasks only included three runs, each run was divided into two halves (i.e., six datasets for each task) to increase the number of datasets used for the decoding analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jimura &amp; Poldrack, 2012)</ref>. GLM2.1 and GLM2.2 were performed on unsmoothed data, and beta images from the evaluation period were used for searchlight decoding analyses for each task. Moreover, to ensure that the results were driven by subjective value but not decision difficulty, we repeated the decoding analyses for chosen subjective value magnitude using high-(i.e., |γ| &lt;= 0.2) and low-difficulty (|γ| &gt; 0.2) trials in each task. Finally, the cross-task decoding analysis was conducted as described above in study 1.</p><p>Within-task decoding results were corrected for multiple comparison using a voxel-level uncorrected threshold of p &lt; 0.001 and a FWE cluster-level corrected p &lt; 0.05. For exploratory purposes, cross-task decoding analyses and other control analyses were corrected using a lenient threshold of voxel-level p &lt; 0.005 and a FWE cluster-level corrected p &lt; 0.05. Similar to the univariate analyses, we extracted the mean decoding accuracy from the vmPFC and dmPFC spherical masks, respectively. It should be noted that these ROI results reflect post-hoc signal extractions from the searchlight analyses but not a priori ROI-wise MVPA. <ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>.

Because the smallreward option is associated with no cost, its amount can be used as subjective value of the corresponding large-reward option.  . Parameter recovery for study 1. We simulated 200 sets of parameters (i.e., ground-truth parameters) by randomly sampling from the posterior distribution of each parameter of the winning model. Next, we simulated choice data based on the winning model using each set of parameters. We then fitted the winning model to the simulated choice data and obtained the posterior distribution for each parameter (i.e., recovered parameters). The results showed that, at the group level, for effort-based (a) and risky decision-making (c), the black lines (i.e., means of the true parameters) were located within the posterior distributions of simulated parameters. At the individual level, those parameters can also be accurately recovered <ref type="bibr">(b, d)</ref>. and are two parameters that control the discounting curve, is the parameter used to calculate utility, is the relative weight of losses compared with gains, and is the noise parameter of the softmax function. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S4</ref>. Parameter recovery for study 2. The procedure is the same as described above in study 1. Since no potential losses were used in both tasks in study 2, the two-parameter discounting model has four free parameters.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure to estimate indifference points</head><p>We used a stepwise titration method to estimate indifference points for each participant.</p><p>The stepwise titration method was inspired by adjusting-immediate-amount methods <ref type="bibr">(Holt, Green, &amp; Myerson, 2012)</ref> and has been validated in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Westbrook et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Westbrook et al., , 2019</ref>. Taking effort-based decision-making as an example, participants faced a series of choices between an option with a larger reward and an effort requirement, and an alternative with smaller reward but no effort requirement. For a specific combination of a larger reward (e.g., 2.00 credits) and an effort requirement (e.g., level 3), the amount of the smaller reward started from the half of its amount (1.00 credit in this case):</p><p>where 2 is the initial small reward amount, and is the corresponding larger reward.</p><p>If the large-reward option is selected by the participant, the amount of the small reward increases in the next iteration; in contrast, if the small-reward option is selected, its amount decreases in the next iteration. The rules that determined the amount of the smaller reward were listed as follows:</p><p>For example, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig S1,</ref> if the larger-reward option is associated with 2 credits and effort level 3, the initial amount of the smaller reward ( 2 ) is 1.

After five iterations, the amount of the smaller reward ( 4 ) was close to the subjective value of the larger-reward option.</p><p>This procedure was used for all combinations of larger rewards (2, 3, 4 credits) and effort levels (level 1-4), yielding a total of 72 trials. The order of the trials was randomized for each participant.
