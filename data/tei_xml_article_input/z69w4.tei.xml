			<abstract>
				<p>Motivational deficits are common in several brain disorders, and motivational syndromes like apathy and anhedonia predict worse outcomes. Disrupted effortbased decision-making may represent a neurobiological underpinning of motivational deficits, shared across neuropsychiatric disorders. We measured effortbased decision-making in 994 participants using a gamified online task, combined with computational modelling, and validated offline for test-retest reliability. In two pre-registered studies, we first replicated studies linking impaired effort-based decision-making to neuropsychiatric syndromes, taking both a transdiagnostic and a diagnostic-criteria approach. Next, testing participants with early and late circadian rhythms in the morning and evening, we find circadian rhythm interacts with timeof-testing to produce parallel effects on effort-based decision-making. Circadian rhythm may be an important variable in computational psychiatry, decreasing reliability or distorting results when left unaccounted for. Disentangling effects of neuropsychiatric syndromes and circadian rhythm on effort-based decision-making will be essential to understand motivational pathologies and to develop tailored clinical interventions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Our circadian rhythm aligns us with our environment, regulating physiological and behavioural processes to follow 24-hour rhythms <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Circadian integrity is pivotal to mental wellbeing and has been bidirectionally linked to numerous psychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> . Yet lidle is known about the cognitive or computational mechanisms of circadian dysfunction-and their alignment or diversion from mechanisms driving neuropsychiatric symptoms.</p><p>Inter-individual differences in circadian timing and alignment manifest behaviourally as chronotypes (i.e., diurnal preference) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , with individuals commonly categorized as early, late, or intermediate chronotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . A disproportionate number of psychiatric patients have a late chronotype, based on self-report <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and genetic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . Within clinical groups, late chronotype has been linked to depression severity and non-remission <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , higher rates of psychiatric and general medical comorbidities <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , more severe cognitive impairment, and higher symptoms of apathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . Converging evidence on the importance of circadian alignment in psychiatric pathology has led to proposals of a circadian psychiatric phenotype, either within disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> or cuding across diagnostic categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Syndromes of deficient motivational behaviour, such as apathy and</head><p>anhedonia, are also observed across neuropsychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> , suggesting transdiagnostic relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . Anhedonia and apathy are associated with worse clinical outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and are poorly targeted by current treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> . Empirical work suggests a common underlying neurocognitive mechanism: the integration of costs and benefits during effortful decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . Effort-based decision-making is commonly assessed using effort expenditure tasks: Subjects are asked to decide whether to pursue actions associated with varying levels of effort and reward levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . Computational models applied to effort-based decision-making tasks provide a formal mathematical estimate of a subject's integration of costs and benefits into a subjective value <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . Higher costs devalue associated rewards, an effect referred to as effort-discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> . This computational approach enables measurement of inter-and intra-individual differences on distinct aspects of effortbased decision-making.</p><p>One key source of individual differences in motivational behaviour and effort-based decision-making is likely dopamine signalling, especially dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the ventral striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . Preclinical animal studies show dopamine depletion reduces engagement in effortful behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> , while dopamine enhancement promotes motivational effort exertion <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> . In humans, dopamine depletion reduces willingness to exert effort for reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> , while pharmacological dopamine enhancement increases motivation in effort-based decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> . Further, naturally occurring variations in dopamine responsivity are correlated with effort-based decision-making: a higher dopamine responsivity (as quantified with positron emission tomography following d-amphetamine administration) is associated with willingness to exert greater effort for larger rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</p><p>Bi-directional links between chronobiology and several neurotransmider systems have been reported, including dopamine <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> . In animals, dopamine transmission and biosynthesis vary diurnally <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> , and growing evidence suggests a bi-directional regulation between dopamine signalling and circadian rhythm <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref> . In human studies, dopamine availability, dopamine transporter genes, and dopamine receptors have been linked to proxies of circadian rhythm <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55]</ref> and circadianregulating gene polymorphisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56</ref> . On a behavioural level, sleep deprivation, poor sleep quality, and insomnia were linked to low motivation in effort-based decisionmaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[59]</ref> and evening bright-light exposure enhanced effort willingness, possibly by enhancing dopamine through melatonin suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">60</ref> . Early chronotype predicted treatment effect on motivational behaviour in a sample of depressed subjects with comorbid insomnia <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">61</ref> . Chronotype effects are also reported for other reward decision-making tasks, with late chronotypes showing higher delay discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">62</ref> , less rational decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">63</ref> , and lower willingness to take risks for rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">65</ref> . A circadian effect on decision-making under risk is reported, with the sensitivity to losses decreasing with time-of-day <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">66</ref> . This suggests that chronobiology may contribute to individual differences in effort-based decision-making, potentially in parallel ways with neuropsychiatric syndromes.</p><p>Here, we tested the relationship between motivational decision-making and three key neuropsychiatric syndromes: anhedonia, apathy, and depression, taking both a transdiagnostic and categorical (diagnostic) approach. To do this, we validate a newly developed effort-expenditure task, designed for online testing, and gamified to increase engagement. Participants completed the effort-expenditure task online, followed by a series of self-report questionnaires.</p><p>Next, we pre-registered a follow-up experiment to directly investigate how circadian preference interacts with time-of-day on motivational decision-making, using the same task and computational modelling approach. While this allows us to test how circadian effects on motivational decision-making compare to neuropsychiatric effects, we do not test for possible interactions between neuropsychiatric symptoms and chronobiology. All analyses were pre-registered (except when labelled as exploratory): see hdps://osf.io/2x3au and hdps://osf.io/y4ke.</p></div>

By weighing up efforts against rewards, they decide whether to accept or reject challenges. We first use model-agnostic analyses to replicate effects of effort-discounting (i.e., devaluation of reward with increasing effort). Next, we took a computational modelling approach to fit economic decision-making models to the task data ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.    3A</ref>-D). The models posit efforts and rewards are joined into a subjective value (SV),</p><p>weighed by individual effort ( ! ) and reward sensitivity ( " ) parameters. The subjective value is then integrated with an individual bias to accept effortful challenges for reward (a) parameter to guide decision-making. Specifically, this acceptance bias parameter determines the range at which subjective values are translated to acceptance probabilities: the same subjective value will translate to a higher acceptance probability the higher the acceptance bias.  </p></div>

A total of 492 participants completed the study in the morning testing window and 458 in the evening testing window.

The positive link between effort-based decision-making and apathy and anhedonia has been observed in both patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">91</ref> and healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">93</ref> , though some did not find this effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">85</ref> .</p><p>Our work supports previous theories that impaired effort-based decisionmaking represents a common, transdiagnostic mechanism across the psychiatric and neurological syndromes of anhedonia and apathy (respectively).

We observed a difference in acceptance bias between chronotypes, with late chronotypes showing a lower tendency to accept to exert effort for reward.

This effect was driven by the late chronotype group, who showed a markedly lower acceptance bias in the morning, but a higher tendency in the evening.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , which should be considered in measurement (e.g., design</p><p>of computational psychiatry studies) and potentially treatment (e.g., administration</p><p>of motivation-based psychological interventions, which could be timed compatibly with chronotype).</p><p>To our surprise, we did not find statistical evidence for a relationship between Our study results should be considered in light of a few limitations. First, we used online self-report measures of neuropsychiatric symptoms and depression status. There has been a large shift toward online data collection in psychiatric research, and while online data is undoubtedly noisier, results (including our own, presented in the supplemental material) usually show excellent accordance with labbased studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">106</ref> . Similarly, we lack biological measures of circadian rhythm, the gold standard of chronotype assessment. However, this concern might be mitigated by previous reports of high covariance between biological-and questionnaire-based circadian measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">107,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">108</ref> , as well as significant chronobiological differences between the questionnaire-determined chronotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">109</ref> we use in our key findings.</p><p>Nevertheless, future work should incorporate biological measures in adempts to replicate circadian effects on effort-based decision-making.

To increase engagement, we gamified the task to take place in an underwater seding and each challenge is framed as a race in which an octopus catches a shrimp. The task structure is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2A</ref> and the trial-level structure in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>.</p><p>The task began with an individual calibration phase to standardise maximum effort capacity, followed by the main task, which used a semi-adaptive staircase design to maximise the informative value of each choice.</p><p>For the calibration, subjects were prompted to collect points by clicking as fast as possible for ten seconds, repeated three times. The second and third repetitions</p><p>were then averaged to serve as the maximum clicking capacity reference for the main task. One calibration trial was repeated at the end of the main task to monitor any notable changes in clicking capacity. Then, subjects were familiarized with their individually calibrated effort levels during a practice phase of the task. Effort levels were scaled to a given participant's mean clicking speed (based on the calibration phase), and the time clicking must be sustained for. We used four effort-levels, corresponding to a clicking speed at 30% of a participant's maximal capacity for 8 seconds (level 1), 50% for 11 seconds (level 2), 70% for 14 seconds (level 3), and 90% for 17 seconds (level 4). Therefore, in each trial, participants had to fulfil a certain number of mouse clicks (dependent on their capacity and the effort level) in a specific time (dependent on the effort level). Subjects were instructed to make mouse-clicks with the finger they normally use, and to not change fingers throughout the task (compliance was checked at the end of the main task). In the practice phase, all effort-levels were completed without reward associations, and failed levels were repeated until subjects succeed at each level. If a subject failed a level twice, the clicking capacity reference was adjusted to the speed reached in the practice. Finally, subjects needed to pass a six-question quiz to ensure task instructions were fully understood. If a subject failed any question on the quiz, they</p><p>were returned to the instruction screens and re-took the quiz until all questions were answered correctly. adapting by decreasing effort or increasing reward), the full range of effort-reward combinations will be represented in the task across the startingpoints of all staircases (and therefore before adaption takeplace).</p></div>

All subjects were native English speakers, none reported neurological conditions and four subjects reported current and/or past psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and personality disorder).</p></div>

Comparing predictive accuracy of subject-wise parameter estimates to group-level estimates, the subject-level outperformed the group-level for both session one predicting session two (t(3760.7)= 4.951, p&lt;.001), and session two predicting session one (t(3674.2)=7.426, p&lt;.001). A visualisation of model agnostic task measures relating to symptoms is given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S4</ref>, comparing subgroups of participants scoring in the highest and lowest quartile on the SHAPS. This shows that participants with a high SHAPS score (i.e., more pronounced anhedonia) are less likely to accept offers than those with a low SHAPS score <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. S4A)</ref>. Due to the implemented staircasing procedure, group differences can also be seen in the effort-reward combinations offered per trial. While for both groups, the staircasing procedure seems to devolve towards high effortlow reward offers, this is more pronounced in the subgroup of participants with a lower SHAPS score ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig S4B)</ref>. </p></div>

There was no relationship between average proportion of accepted but failed trials and SHAPS score (controlling for age and gender): M=0.01, 95% HDI=[-0.001,0.02]. However, there are intentionally few accepted but failed trials (M = 1.3% trials failed, SD = 3.50). This results from several task design characteristics aimed at preventing subjects from failing accepted trials, to avoid confounding of effort discounting with risk discounting.</p></div>

We then conducted a Bayesian GLM to test whether this subject wise click-exceedance measure can be predicted by apathy or anhedonia, controlling for age and gender. We found neither the SHAPS (M=-0.14, 95% HDI=[-0.43,0.17]) nor the AES (M=0.07, 95% HDI=[-0.26,0.41]) had a predictive value for the amount to which subjects exert "extra effort".</p></div>

For the SHAPS, we find that when adding the measures of chronotype and time-of-day back into the GLMs, the main effect of the SHAPS (M=-0.26, 95% HDI=[-0.43,-0.07]), the main effect of chronotype (M=-0.11, 95% HDI=[-0.22,-0.01]), and the interaction effect of chronotype and time-of-day (M=0.20, 95% HDI=[0.07,0.34]) on acceptance bias remain. Model comparison by LOOIC reveals acceptance bias is best predicted by the model including the SHAPS, chronotype and time-of-day as predictors, followed by the model including only the SHAPS. Note that this approach to model comparison penalizes models for increasing complexity.

The newly developed effort-expenditure task we present here may lend itself particularly well to such endeavours. First, it allows remote testing, meaning subjects can complete the task at different times of the day without in-person testing. Second, we demonstrated good test-retest reliability of task measures when time of testing was held constant within participants. This good test-retest reliability of our task contrasts with recent reports of poor test-retest reliability of other tasks and computational modelling parameters .Our reported analyses investigating neuropsychiatric and circadian effects on effort-based decision-making simultaneously are exploratory, as our study design was not ideally set out to examine this. Further work is needed to disentangle separable effects of neuropsychiatric and circadian measures on effort-based decisionmaking. One approach could be a group-based study design enabling the dissociation of the two effects (e.g., examining high-anhedonia participants with early chronotypes and low-anhedonia patients with late chronotypes, as well as the respective other, more common groupings, and testing each group in the morning and evening to examine time-of-day interactions with both anhedonia and chronotype).</figDesc></figure>

Exploratory analyses suggest these effects account for separable parts of the variance in effort-based decision-making. It unlikely that effects of neuropsychiatric effects on effort-based decision-making reported here and in previous literature are a spurious result due to multicollinearity with chronotype. Yet, not accounting for chronotype and time of testing, which is the predominant practice in the field, could affect results. This could take the form of either inflating or depressing results in the existing literature. On the one hand, reported neuropsychiatric effects may be inflated by systematic circadian differences between participants (i.e., overrepresentation of late chronotype in patient samples), which could be further amplified by time of testing (often the morning, incompatible with late chronotypes, and producing motivational impairments on neurocognitive measures). On the other hand, true effects may be masked by interactions between chronotype and time-of-day: Testing psychiatric subjects with a late chronotype in the evening (e.g., as a consequence of subjectselected testing times) may paint a false picture of group equivalence, as researchers are only observing part of a daily trajectory. Our growing understanding of the relationship between circadian rhythm and neuropsychiatry may allow for critical advances in improving therapeutic outcomes from treatments 111,112 . Such advances are particularly called for in the case of symptoms of apathy and anhedonia, as current treatments often fail to improve motivational deficits 27-29 , but could potentially be coupled with a patient's chronotype to increase efficacy. At minimum, clinical trials predicting change in motivational measures, such as effort-based decision-making, should assess patients at similar times of day, as this could reduce or inflate treatment effects. Circadian rhythm and neuropsychiatric syndromes may affect motivation via parallel, as well as distinct, mechanisms-but crucially, this overlap is dependent on time of testing. Our work suggests that chronotype and time of testing are essential variables to consider in future effort-based decision-making experiments, particularly those measuring effort-based decision-making in patient groups, such as those with depression, high apathy, or high anhedonia.

Reward was conceptualized as points (shrimp caught by the octopus) that could be collected in that trial. The points to win per challenge varied between four levels (2,3,4, or 5 points). If a subject accepted a given challenge, they needed to achieve the given effort-level to win the associated points. If a subject rejected a given challenge, they waited and received one point, with waiting times matched to the respective effort level to prevent confounding with delay discounting.Participants were able to infer their clicking progress from the distance between the octopus and the shrimp and the remaining time was indicated by a time-bar. Subjects completed 64 trials, split into four blocks of 16 trials. For each subject, trial-by-trial presentation of effort-reward combinations were made semi-adaptively by 16 randomly interleaved staircases. Each of the 16 possible offers (4 effort-levels x 4 reward-levels) served as the starting point of one of the 16 staircase. Within each staircase, after a subject accepted a challenge, the next trial's offer on that staircase was adjusted (by increasing effort or decreasing reward). After a subject rejected a challenge, the next offer on that staircase was adjusted by decreasing effort or increasing reward. This ensured subjects received each effort-reward combination at least once (as each participant completed all 16 staircases), while individualizing trial presentation to maximize the trials' informative value. Therefore, in practice, even in the case of a subject rejecing all offers (and hence the staircasing procedures always</figDesc></figure>

Participants had to have a clicking-calibration score of at least seven, as values below would lead to challenges with just one mouse-click (n=4). Subjects showing a large difference between minimum and maximum clicking speed (i.e., &gt;3 standard deviations (SD)) during calibration trials were excluded, as a misestimation of the calibration reference is likely (n=3). Finally, subjects showing a large change in their clicking capacity (i.e., &gt;3 SD) pre-to post-task were excluded, as it can be assumed the applied calibration was not valid during the task (n=1). We also asked two openanswer questions after completion of the main task to monitor participants' self-reported task strategies as a way of assessing rule adherence. Model-agnostic analyses Using the proportion of accepted challenges as the dependent variable, we investigated main effects of effort-and reward-levels and their interaction, using a repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVA) of repeated measures. This approach accommodates the unbalanced design resulting from the implemented staircasing procedure. Model space To model effort-based decision-making, we considered a model space of nine models. All models are variations of the economic decision-theory model, consisting of two basic equations. First, a cost function transforms costs and rewards associated with an action into a subjective value (SV):</figDesc></figure>

A sample of N=30 participants was recruited and tested in two sessions, about one week apart. Test-retest reliability of task parameters was assessed by intra-class correlation coefficients, Pearson's correlation coefficients (estimated both after model fiding and by embedding a correlation matrix into the model fiding procedure), and by testing the predictive accuracy of parameter estimates across sessions.

PLS regression allows joint modelling of questionnaire measures, without issues due to expected multicollinearity between questionnaires. Following the best practice of model validation , data was split into a training (75%) and a testing (25%) subset. The training data was used to obtain the optimal number of components, based on tenfold-cross validation, and to train the model. The winning model's predictive performance was tested out-of-sample using the held-out testing data. Statistical significance of obtained effects (i.e., the predictive accuracy of the identified component and factor loadings) was assessed by permutation tests, probing the proportion of root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) indicating stronger or equally strong predictive accuracy under the null hypothesis.</figDesc></figure>

In the subsamples of participants with an early or late chronotype (including additionally collected data), we first ran Bayesian GLMs with neuropsychiatric questionnaire scores (SHAPS, DARS, AES respectively) predicting acceptance bias, controlling for age and gender. We next added an interaction term of chronotype and time-of-day into the GLMs, testing how this changes previously observed neuropsychiatric and circadian effects on acceptance bias . Finally, we conducted a model comparison using LOO, comparing between acceptance bias predicted by a neuropsychiatric questionnaire, acceptance bias predicted by chronotype and time-of-day, and acceptance bias predicted by a neuropsychiatric questionnaire and time-of-day (for each neuropsychiatric questionnaire, and controlling for age and gender).</figDesc></figure>

Test-retest analyses were performed on the full parabolic model, given model comparison in our main sample identified this as the winning model. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess test-retest reliability using the ratio of intra-individual to inter-individual variability. We used two-way mixed effects ICCs considering consistency (reflecting rank order). ICCs below 0.4 indicate that a measure is not reliable, ICCs between 0.4 and 0.75 indicate moderate to good reliability and ICCs above 0.75 indicate excellent reliability 1 . To assess correlations between model parameters from the two sessions, we first calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients between mean posterior parameter estimates resulting from the separate model fiding procedures. Next, we re-fit the model jointly for both testing sessions, while embedding a correlation matrix into the model 2 . Thereby, the full posterior distributions of the model parameters are fed into the calculation of correlation coefficients, rather than solely point estimates. This offers multiple benefits of Bayesian inference: Uncertainty around parameter estimates can be incorporated into the correlation estimation and Bayesian priors can be set over possible values of the correlation matrix. Note that while this model fiding procedure fits the data of both testing sessions simultaneously, separate hyper-parameters are used for the different sessions. Therefore, shrinkage cannot bias the reliability estimates.Finally, we also made use of the predictive property of the computational modelling approach in the assessment of parameter reliability. If parameters are reliable, the estimates resulting from modelling the data from one session should be able to predict subjects' choices in the other session beder than chance 3 . To test this, we calculated the model-predicted choices for each subject and trial and compared this to the observed choices in the respective other session.Due to our hierarchical Bayesian modelling approach, individual model parameters are subject to shrinkage. To test whether the predictive property of individual parameters is solely due to shrinkage we repeated the procedure using hyper-parameters to make model predictions and then compared the resulting predictive accuracy to that of individual parameters.</figDesc></figure>

The proportion of accepted trials averaged across effort and reward levels was predicted by the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) sum scores (M=-0.07; 95%HDI=[-0.12,-0.03]) and the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) sum scores (M=-0.05; 95%HDI=[-0.10,-0.002]). Note that this was not driven only by higher effort levels; even confining data to the lowest two effort levels, SHAPS has a predictive value for the proportion of accepted trials: M=-0.05; 95%HDI=[-0.07,-0.02].</figDesc></figure>

However, research has rarely investigated how transdiagnostic mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric conditions may relate to inter-individual differences in circadian rhythm. Here, combining a large-scale online study with computational modelling, we replicate and extend previous work linking anhedonia, apathy, and depression to a lower bias to accept effort for reward.Crucially, we found participants with a late compared to early chronotype show the same decrease in acceptance bias. Moreover, by testing participants at chronotype-compatible and -incompatible times of day, we discovered late chronotypes show a decreased acceptance bias to exert effort for reward when tested in the morning compared to evening. This reveals neuropsychiatric symptoms and chronotype (interacting with time-of-testing) show paralleling effects on effort-based decisionmaking. Our results demonstrate a crucial role for circadian rhythm in computational psychiatry, potentially affecting our assessment and treatment of neurocognitive mechanisms.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

Aberrant effortbased decision-making may manifest behaviourally as deficient motivation, a symptom category that cuts across traditional disease boundaries of psychiatric, neurological, and neurodevelopmental disorders 32 .Our categorical (diagnostic-criteria based) analysis comparing depressed to healthy subjects likewise found depressed patients showed a lower acceptance bias, echoing our dimensional results in apathy and anhedonia. In addition, our categorical analysis revealed a distinct effect of group on effort sensitivity: depressed subjects had lower effort sensitivity, meaning their decisions were less influenced by effort changes. Possibly, this effect stems from decreased perceived differences in effort levels, as recently reported<ref type="bibr" target="#b96">94</ref> , indicating there are both dimensional (transdiagnostic) and potentially some diagnosis-specific effects of mental health on effort-based decision-making.It is possible that a higher acceptance bias reflects a more optimistic assessment of future task success, in line with work on the optimism bias<ref type="bibr" target="#b97">95</ref> ; however our task intentionally minimized unsuccessful trials by titrating effort and reward;</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_9"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>This suggests that chronotype effects on neurocomputational parameters such as acceptance bias depend on time-of-testing.

One interpretation of our cognitive synchrony effects may be that late chronotype participants show a diminished ability to adapt to suboptimal times-ofday due to reduced cognitive resources 100 .We also report a distinct effect of chronotype on effort-based decision-making that is not paralleled by effects of neuropsychiatric symptoms, nor dependent on time-of-day. Compared to early chronotypes, late chronotypes were more guided by differences in reward value, indicated by higher reward sensitivity parameters. increased diurnal mood variation 104 . Our finding of timeof-day differences in acceptance bias among late chronotypes illustrates a potential cognitive underpinning for the observed diurnal characteristic within depression and late chronotype. Together, these findings support the idea of a circadian psychiatric phenotype</figDesc><table /><note>Previous studies report altered reward functioning in late chronotypes, who show a reduced reactivity to reward in the medial prefrontal cortex, a key component of reward circuitry 101-103 . Note this is not incompatible with higher reward sensitivity due to our modelling approach, in which higher reward sensitivity does not imply higher reward valuation, but rather larger subjective value differences between reward levels. Therefore, reduced reactivity to reward could be compatible with late chronotypes devaluing low reward levels more, which in our models would emerge as a reduced reward sensitivity parameter. It is striking that the effects of neuropsychiatric symptoms on effort-based decision-making largely are paralleled by circadian effects on the same neurocomputational parameter. Exploratory analyses predicting acceptance bias by neuropsychiatric symptoms and circadian measures simultaneously indicate the effects go beyond recapitulating each other, but rather explain separable parts of the variance in acceptance bias. Overall, our results raise the possibility of altered effort- reward processing as a critical mechanism linking neuropsychiatric conditions and circadian rhythm.
