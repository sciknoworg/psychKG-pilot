				<p>Since Coyne&apos;s (1976) influential characterization of depression as an interactional disorder, there has been a large body of research on the social factors involved in the development and maintenance of depressive symptoms. By now, there is broad consensus that individuals with depression show marked distortions in the anticipation, perception, and processing of social information, as well as in their social behavior. For example, depressed individuals are more sensitive to rejection (Gao et al., 2017) and perform considerably worse at tasks measuring theory of mind (Nestor et al., 2022); they also reveal poor social problemsolving when interacting with others (e.g., Hames et al., 2013). While social impairments are well described in depression (for reviews, see Bird et al.,</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">On the maintenance of social symptoms in depression</head><p>One important question is why social perception and behavior do not normalize when the social context improves. Explanations from general and clinical psychology suggest several mechanisms are involved in this phenomenon -for example, learned helplessness , neurobiological dysfunction <ref type="bibr">(Porcelli et al., 2019)</ref>, greater neural effort processing social cues , pre-operational thinking , dysfunctional core beliefs , negative relational schemas , increased elaboration of negative information , blunted elaboration of positive information , persistent negative expectations , and cognitive immunization ).</p><p>Although we believe all these factors play an important role, we suggest that it is primarily how (and by what model of the social world) individuals with depression infer the characteristics of social contexts through social action (e.g., social decision making) that contributes to the maintenance of these symptoms (compare with "assimilation", . Thus, clinical observations indicate that individuals with depressive symptoms (and specifically those with a social-trauma history) reveal distortions in exploring their interpersonal context before making social decisions (e.g., choosing to withdraw from a social situation). Instead, they stick to schema-congruent social strategies (e.g., "better-safe-thansorry", ) that prevent new learning and promote "fitting" schema-congruent experiences ("As I said, no one talked to me at the party"). This notion is supported by research linking depression to social withdrawal (e.g., , highly inhibited behavior (e.g., , low social information seeking, passivity and social avoidance (e.g., , as well as higher levels of distrust, shame, and disappointment in social situations (e.g., . There is also evidence that depressed people have difficulty drawing the right conclusions from social interactions (for an overview, see AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION , and demonstrate aberrant patterns of reward learning and decision making in social contexts <ref type="bibr">(Safra et al., n.d., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Clinicians from different theoretical backgrounds are well aware of this problem, and try to improve the inference of social contexts through psychoeducation (e.g., , interpersonal context discrimination training (e.g., <ref type="bibr">McCullough, 2006a)</ref>, behavioral activation (e.g., , experiential and emotionfocused techniques (e.g., , role disputes (e.g., , training new interpersonal skills (e.g., , repeated social exposure (e.g., , disciplined personal involvement (e.g., <ref type="bibr">McCullough, 2006b)</ref>, and behavioral experiments (e.g., . A systematic review by  found that 17 of 24 studies which used interventions that facilitated social interaction (i.e., the sampling of social context information) reduced levels of depressive symptoms successfully.</p><p>Moreover, the literature from attachment and developmental psychology suggests that the maladaptive attachment styles that can develop as a result of social trauma can trigger pathological patterns in inferring social contexts in depression .</p><p>This might be because children develop internal "representations of attachment" with their attachment figures that serve as "templates" for interpreting and predicting behavior in later relationships <ref type="bibr">(Bifulco, Moran, Ball, &amp; Lillie, 2002, p. 60)</ref>. From this perspective, it seems plausible that depressed individuals with a primarily avoidant attachment style would seldom process social information to avoid being hurt. Vice versa, depressed individuals with a more anxious attachment style may initially exhibit excessive attachment behavior to cope with AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION thwarted needs to belong, but quickly respond with anger or resignation when there is no response ).</p><p>As we illustrate below, our computational model of biased social inference in depression offers a new operationalization of various attachment styles in terms of concrete social interactions that extends existing computational approaches (for more details, see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>; .</p><p>To summarize: individuals with depression seem to exhibit aberrant processing of various types of social information. A multitude of empirical findings suggests biases in how they interpret social cues and problem-solving in interpersonal contexts . These problems often seem to persist and exacerbate negative social beliefs acquired via early-life social trauma or lack of social support.</p><p>Meanwhile, the underlying mechanisms remain mostly elusive. In the following paragraphs we demonstrate how recent developments in computational neuroscience can be applied to (a) unify a variety of empirical findings on social impairments in depression under a common theoretical framework, (b) improve the operationalization of social impairments in depression, (c) shed light on the elusive computational mechanisms underlying these impairments (e.g., why they develop, are maintained, and manifest in different ways), and (d) functionally link heterogeneous social phenomena in depression to different biases in patients' internal social belief systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Active inference</head><p>In the past decades, emerging computational theories have changed the way/how we think about the mind in health and disease. In cognitive and computational neuroscience, the AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION active inference framework enables us to unify complex processes like perception, learning, action, and decision making under a Bayesian decision-theoretic umbrella (for a synthesis, see Da Costa et al., 2020; for decision-theoretic underpinnings, see . Central to active inference is the notion of the mind as an elaborate inference engine, trying to make sense of its environment from noisy, ambiguous, and partial sensory information .</p><p>The "reality" of the external world is not directly accessible to the agentthe state of these hidden factors needs to be inferred with the help of an agent's internal, generative model <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">Smith et al., 2022b</ref>). The generative model contains the agent's beliefs about how certain sensory information relates to an environmental factor. In other words, how latent factors or states cause observable (sensory) consequences. This probabilistic model of the world must be continuously updated (i.e., "optimized") by sensory input to ensure the correct inference of hidden states and for maintaining physiologicaland psychosocial -homeostasis.</p><p>It is matched with an agent's prior beliefs about certain hidden states or observations . Accurate priors and generative models are crucial for the agent's survival and for maintaining physiological homeostasis (for further information, see Da Costa et al., 2020).</p><p>A final component of active inference is action. By performing actions or action sequences (i.e., policies), the agent exerts an influence on hidden factors .</p><p>Inferring policies allows the agent to select action sequences that lead to desired or preferred sensory information, that is, actions minimize surprise in the long term. In the context of active inference, we can therefore speak of "Predictions, not Commands" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams et al., 2013</ref>): the motor system executes actions that lead to the expected sensory information. This basic view of sentient behavior can be summarized as choosing courses of action or plans that bring about predicted consequences. This basic idea operates at the level of simple reflexes, through to social narratives. In terms of simple movements, our actions can be viewed as fulfilling topdown predictions of a proprioceptive sort that supply setpoints or equilibrium points <ref type="bibr">(Feldman AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION &amp; Levin, 1995)</ref>. This is very reminiscent of ideomotor theory in the 19th-century .</p><p>When applied to social behaviors and decision-making, this is often cast as planning as inference ; in other words, committing to those courses of action that minimize the deviation from predicted or expected outcomes.</p><p>Mathematically speaking, we can approximate the minimizing of "surprise" by minimizing a quantity named "free energy" (FE). In the context of active inference, minimizing FE should lead to "optimal" perceptions and actions (for further information, see .</p><p>More generally, actions or policies are selected that minimize expected free energy . Technically, expected free energy subsumes two kinds of (Bayes) optimality. The first reflects the propensity to bring about preferred outcomes (e.g., being at home), which are just those 'states of being' that characterize the decision maker or person in question.</p><p>Mathematically, this preference-seeking can be read as maximizing expected value, where value is just the (log) probability of being in a characteristic state. The other part of expected free energy underwrites information-seeking and the resolution of the uncertainty inherent in minimizing expected surprise. Mathematically, this is usually expressed as expected information gain. In short, active inference entails a joint commitment to optimal Bayesian decisions (via maximizing expected value)  while, at the same time, complying with the principles of optimum Bayesian design (via maximizing expected information gain) . In effect, this accommodates the exploration-exploitation dilemma by placing epistemic and pragmatic imperatives on the same footing .</p><p>As a simplified example, consider a man who needs to infer his physical location in a town. He has no direct access to this information (hidden factor), but needs to infer it from the visual, auditory, and olfactory information his sensory organs take in from his environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION</head><p>The agent's observation model contains his specific beliefs about how certain sensory information relates to a certain neighborhood or location in space (e.g., a sign to a specific area).</p><p>The agent implicitly forms "hypotheses" about where he is located given his latest sensory information (the likelihood). Given such sensory information, the hypothesis with the highest posterior probability wins. Furthermore, his previous actions (i.e. walking down an avenue, then turning right, etc.) provide information about his location in space. Future actions or policies are selected so that the agent's desired sensory information is acquired. If the agent wants to go home, only those policies will be chosen that will lead to the expected visual, auditory, and olfactory information usually experienced while living at home.</p><p>From an evolutionary psychology perspective, active inference constantly involves making a trade-off between seeking new information through action (in this example, exploring the city) and maximizing access to known rewards (returning home quickly) in order to survive in an ever-changing environment (explore vs. exploit dilemma, Gopnik, 2020; . Agents failing to engage in any exploratory behavior who only seek to maximize known rewards "over-fit" their environment, and run the risk of being incapable of adapting to environmental changes (i.e., not finding home when the cityscape changes). Conversely, "under-fitting" agents who engage in a lot of explo atory behavior and show little reward maximization run the risk of failing to exploit resources and rewards in order to maintain their fitness (i.e., never find home).</p><p>In mental health terms, active inference suggests that mental disorders, like depression are the result of biased inference of hidden states of the world (although it is probably not the inference algorithm itself that is biased, but rather the generative model to which it is applied; . In this context, Bayesian formulations have proved useful in accounting for different symptom domains of MDD <ref type="bibr"></ref> AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION . <ref type="bibr">Smith and colleagues (2018)</ref>, for example, suggest that depressive schemas 3 may act as precise, internalized priors in patients with depression. Given a certain set of sensory information, the interpretation, or "hypothesis", with the highest posterior probability is selected to explain the sensory information. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In depression, this may be the depressive schema.</p><p>Moreover, they suggest that the core symptom of psychomotor slowing and loss of energy may result from biased beliefs regarding an action's utility in achieving a desired sensory state ; implicitly, the mind may infer that the cost of a certain action outweighs its utility, thus reducing an agent's motivation for action so that the depressed person feels compelled not to leave their bed. Particularly when processing social information , these costs may actually be high, presumably because positive social cues are less expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Active inference of social contexts in depression</head><p>Human social interactions are marked by tremendous complexity. In an everyday conversation, noisy verbal-and non-verbal information needs to be considered alongside ambiguous cultural, contextual, and situational factors, all evolving very dynamically and sometimes unpredictably over time. From a Bayesian perspective, the social agent needs to process highly uncertain information and react appropriately in real time, a skill that most humans surprisingly master with relative ease. In depressed individuals, however, interpersonal problems are highly prevalent. We propose here that the distorted interpersonal perception and behaviors in depression are due to various biases in their generative model of the social world's hidden states (i.e., their prior beliefs about how certain sensory information from the social 3 Here defined as "(…) maladaptive, pessimistic sets of beliefs/expectations that bias perceptual/conceptual interpretations of new sensory input, as well as the subsequent predictions, judgments, and decisions these interpretations inform (…)" <ref type="bibr">(Smith et al., 2018, p.</ref> 2) environment relates to certain characteristics of social contexts). For example, imagine a party where you only know a few people. A healthy person might go to this party with the prior belief that most of the guests will be kind, and that friendly conversations might ensue (prior belief that the social context will probably be positive). She will interpret the smile of someone sitting next to her as an expression of sympathy (belief that the observation "smile" is highly probable in a positive social context, and less likely in a negative social context) and would expect that she can enhance her social environment's positive state more by starting a conversation (belief that choosing the "start a conversation" policy would likely transform the current state of the social context into an even more positive one).</p><p>In contrast, a depressed person would go to this party with the prior belief that most people will show no interest in her and that probably no one will talk to her (prior belief that the social context is likely to be negative). She will interpret the smile of the person sitting next to her as an expression of pity (belief that the "smile" observation is less probable in a positive social context, and more probable in a negative social context) and would expect that she can improve her social environment's state by withdrawing socially and by not attracting attention (belief that choosing the policy "social withdrawal" would likely transform the social context's current state into a less negative one). On the one hand, this could bias further the social context's inference, since the "social withdrawal" policy enables very little sensory input (e.g., the depressed person gets no information about whether they have common interests or passions with other party guests). This can then lead to this person's internal belief system becoming stabilized (e.g., "immunization", <ref type="bibr">, or, "learned helplessness" Seligman, 1972</ref>).</p><p>On the other hand, as a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, this strategy could encourage the very experiences that the depressed person already feared, such as being largely ignored by other people, which could also cause the generative model to become entrenched. As a consequence, the biased inference of social contexts can trigger a self-reinforcing vicious cycle in depression that can result in increasing discord between the social environment and interpersonal behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION</head><p>Practitioners know that abnormalities in social perception and social behavior can be very heterogeneous in depressed individuals (e.g., more avoidant vs. more hostile/suspicious interpersonal styles). We believe this can be attributed to different forms of biases within these patients' given generative models. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The flexibility inherent to the active inference approach enables us to characterize these different "phenotypes" of pathological inference in depression as well as more "healthy" forms of social inference within the same framework (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).</p><p>We elaborate on this idea in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Creating a formal model</head><p>Clinical applications of partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) models have been described (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Smith et al., , 2022</ref>. We describe here the key concepts and parameters briefly again and apply them to the active inference of social contexts during brief social interactions. Agents have beliefs about the state of a social context (s) and about their possible action sequences in that context ( ). Agents make observations (o) mediated by their senses. Furthermore, agents have beliefs about the probability of being in a particular social context (sT) when making a particular observation (oT). This is the agent's observation model, which is represented by a probability distribution p(oT|sT), containing information about how <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In fact, any social experience and behavior must be expressed as deviations of some form in the probability distributions that constitute the generative model. This truism is known as the complete class theorem , which says that for any pair of behaviors and value functions, there exists some prior beliefs that render the behavior Bayes optimal. In short, the ideal Bayesian assumptions inherent in active inference (please see above) means that one can describe any behavior in terms of the agent's prior beliefs. This is one of the main motivations for computational phenotyping of the sort that characterizes a patient's choice behavior in terms of their underlying prior beliefs .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION</head><p>probable it is that states will bring about certain observations. Further, the agent entertains beliefs about the probability of transitioning from one state to another, possibly influenced by their own actions. This is represented by a probability distribution p(sT+1|sT, ). Finally, agents may possess initial beliefs about the hidden nature of a social context p(s1).</p><p>[ <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>]</p><p>From the perspective of this model, social experience and behavior in depression might be attributable to deviations from healthy participants in the probability distributions mentioned above. As previously discussed, there is evidence that patients with depression tend to have more negative beliefs about the hidden nature of social contexts. This could be modelled as a prior over the initial hidden social state (p(s1))where a negative, hostile state is assigned higher prior probability than a benevolent one at the onset of the social interaction (e.g. "they won't like me"). Patients may furthermore reveal biased beliefs about how likely certain observations are to occur in a given social context. For example, a patient may carry high expectations that a stranger will initiate a conversation with them if they are liked, otherwise inferring a hostile social state, i.e. that he or she is not liked by the other ("if they liked me, they would approach me and start a conversation"). This factor concerns the patient's observation model p(oT|sT). Patients may differ still more from non-depressed individuals in their pessimistic beliefs about how likely certain action sequences will alter the social contextsocially learned helplessness would dictate that the patient's actions would have no measurable consequences in the patient's prediction ("it wouldn't change anything if I smile at them"). This relates to transition-probabilities p(sT+1|sT, π).</p><p>Depression is a very heterogeneous disorder which active inference could account for by allowing for variations within the generative model. This may vary from patient to patient, depending on the individual's learning history. For example, depressed individuals whose early attachment figures were highly impulsive and ambivalent may reveal great uncertainty about AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION their present social context (which would correspond to imprecise priors on initial hidden states). In contrast, depressed individuals affected by devaluing and punishing attachment figures would predict with great certainty that they find themselves in a negative social context when encountering a social situation in the present (this would correspond, in turn, to very precise priors of negative hidden states). In addition to changes in parameter p(s1), changes in our model's other parameters lead to potentially additional problems in the inference of social contexts. For a brief outline, see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>[ <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Implications and future research</head><p>Our approach enables a new formalization of the active inference of social context characteristics in mentally healthy and ill individuals, which allows researchers to functionally link heterogeneous social phenomena in depression to different biases in patient's internal social belief systems. In consequence, it offers new perspectives for both etiological research in depression as well as improved diagnostics and treatment. Knowing how social trauma or the lack of social support affects certain parameters of the generative model and which parameters (or parameter configurations) are predestined for certain social experiences and behaviors has profound implications for prevention and treatment-selection, since treatment strategies affect the patient's generative model's parameters differently. To stay with the above-mentioned example: Individuals with "too low" and barely deviant scores on parameter p(s1) (i.e., with great uncertainty about which social context they will enter), are likely to benefit most from interventions that reduce social safety behaviors and provide consistent reinforcement schedule within the therapeutic relationship, since these interventions foster beliefs in the predictability of social contexts in the long term. Conversely, individuals with a strong negative prior (i.e., who are deeply convinced they will enter a negative social context in the future) are more likely to benefit from reparenting techniques and interpersonal discrimination training, as they AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION improve social context discrimination. This example illustrates that different parameter specifications in the generative model can lead to various treatment implications. Moreover, it illustrates how the treatment of depressive disorders can be individualized by our conceptualization, even when different distortions in the same parameter are involved.</p><p>In a similar way, the approach we suggest could deepen our understanding of the neural implementation of related processes. While the literature has yielded quite heterogeneous findings on the neural correlates of depression  a better description of impairments on a computational level might reduce variability across studies and reveal more suitable approaches for tailored interventions (e.g., brain stimulation, .</p><p>Finally, our conceptualization of social biases in depression sheds light on the issue of treatment-resistant depression . It seems plausible that the interventions these patients undergo often fail to address the "right" parameters in the respective generative In this context, we suggest adapting experimental paradigms from social psychology (e.g.,  or game theory (e.g., , as these paradigms require social decisions based on inferences about social contexts and can be easily applied in practice as well as formalized in terms of the model above (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Smith et al., 2022)</ref>. For example, social decision making in cooperative games that require inferences about social contexts (e.g., evaluating a co-players "trustworthiness"; cf.  could be used to estimate the generative model of depressed patients and systematically compare it to the model of healthy controls. In clinical practice, the availability of behavioral data throughout the diagnostic process could provide clinicians with a concrete idea of their patient's implicit internal models of their social environment. This could be exploited, again, to individualize therapies.</p><p>Our proposed research agenda is in line with a broader trend away from fixed clinical categories towards a more multidimensional perspective on diagnosing mental disorders . Multidimensional approaches can account for heterogeneity in patient populations and shed light on shared mechanisms in what have been assumed to be distinct disorders. In the future, computational markers of depression may prove to be beneficial in arriving at a precise description and selecting optimal treatment strategies. These formalizations could objectify the diagnostics of mental disorders in general, and strengthen research on shared mechanisms.</p><p>From a methodological perspective, future research shouldas the first stepspecify several prototypes of generative models that describe the active inference of social contexts in healthy vs. clinical samples, as well as between different "phenotypes" of the disorders under investigation. These models should be guided by theories regarding different etiologies of each disorder. As the second step, these generative models could serve to simulate behavior, and AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION then matched to empirical data from healthy and clinical samples. For example, parameter estimates could be obtained from (social) decision behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">(Smith et al., 2022b)</ref> in standard experimental paradigms (e.g., game theoretical tasks, . In the final step, researchers should identify those generative models that yield the best model fit and work on interventions to optimize their parameters with respect to mental health.</p><p>Finally, another important step would be to develop a model applied to describe the interaction of multiple agents with different generative POMDP models. This would enable researchers to study dynamic interaction patterns in health and disease, and their effects on the corresponding generative model of the agents involved.</p></div>

For example, no matter how many positive social experiences a depressed patient may have with other people during therapy, if he or she believes that positive social cues are unrelated to the social context's actual nature (concerns the observational model p(oT|sT)), then these experiences have no impact on the generative model. From an etiological and developmental perspective, research should examine further which social experiences affect model parameters over the life span. This would also constitute a thorough test of complex interpersonal theories on the development of depressive disorders, such as those assumed in attachment theory, schema therapy or the Cognitive-Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP).In this context, we assume that our model can also be applied to interpersonal experience and behavior in other mental disorders like personality disorders or social phobia (e.g.,.Furthermore, research should focus on accurately diagnosing patient's generative models, linking them to concrete treatment recommendations. From the practitioner's AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION perspective, the relevant questions are (a) how to diagnose generative models in practice and (b) which interventions are most suitable to influence certain model parameters.
