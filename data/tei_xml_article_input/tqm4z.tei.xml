			<abstract>
				<p>Social impressions from faces have been studied in psychology for over 100 years. These impressions are rapid, efficient, and consequential. Yet, disagreements about the content of face impressions remain. Across two studies (N = 4,526), we develop a taxonomy of spontaneous face impressions content by applying novel interdisciplinary methods from Artificial Intelligence text analysis to thousands of free-response descriptions of computer-generated faces. We identify a taxonomy of face impression dimensions, and describe their coverage, prevalence, directionality, and correlational structure. We characterize a diverse and nuanced taxonomy of content that, when compared to just the content that dominant low-dimensional models focus on, increases the coverage of spontaneous responses from about 50% to almost 100%. Our results describe general patterns of prevalence, indicating that dimensions from low-dimensional models (e.g., Sociability, Morality, Assertiveness) are highly prevalent, but that alternative dimensions such as Uniqueness and Health, among others, are also significantly prevalent in face impressions of naturalistic face photographs. Most dimensions show a positivity bias, and the correlational structure of the dimensions further supports the clustering of low-dimensional model&apos;s content as separate from the expanded taxonomy dimensions. Finally, this expanded taxonomy improves predictions of general evaluations and decision making in various real-world relevant contexts. The derived taxonomy of spontaneous face impressions content is a foundation for further theoretical development and practical applications in an area central to human behavior.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spontaneous content of impressions of naturalistic face photographs</head><p>Faces are central to social relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> , serving as salient sources of impression formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . Psychologists have most often studied these face impressions by asking participants to rate faces along researcher-determined dimensions. However, such constrictive measures are unable to measure the spontaneous content of impressions that come to mind upon seeing a face.</p><p>Here, we instead use open-ended measures and Artificial Intelligence (AI) text analyses and stimulus generation to provide a more nuanced account of face impressions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impression Content</head><p>Dimensionality reduction of face ratings across numerous traits results in two relatively orthogonal evaluative dimensions: Trustworthiness/Communion and Dominance (related to Agency) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , even across 41 countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . Communion and Agency evaluations are also wellestablished in other domains, such as stereotyping <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . Face evaluations along these dimensions predict a myriad of socially relevant outcomes. For example, Communion impressions predict healthcare prioritization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and Agency-related judgments predict elections' outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</p><p>Recent models have advanced additional dimensions, such as youthfulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and femininity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . See <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> for a visualization of the theoretical relations between prominent models' dimensions and the proposed taxonomy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Proposed Taxonomy Dimensions in the Literature Note. Relationships between the dimensions as organized in the current paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> and traditional low-dimensional models of face impressions and related domains (e.g., stereotyping). The specific naming of a dimension is relatively arbitrary and aims to avoid confusion between existing models for better theoretical integration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of Established Measurement</head><p>Despite the utility of existing low-dimensional models of impressions, they have limitations. First, because the models are derived from researcher-selected items, they may not capture the full diversity of perceivers' impressions.</p><p>For example, open-ended racial categorizations of Black-White mixed-race faces show a much wider diversity of categorizations than often-used forced-choice measures suggest <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . Additionally, researchers often approach dimension selection differently, with some focusing on personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , while others include physical traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . Here we incorporate a more data-driven approach to the identification of dimensions, without limiting impressions to a particular domain.</p><p>Second, although low-dimensional models aim for simplicity, nuanced taxonomies that more closely resemble complex real-world cognitions add unique value. For example, twodimensional stereotype models (Warmth/Communion and Competence/Agency 8 ) account for only ~55% of spontaneous stereotypes about American social groups. Instead, 13 dimensions are needed to identify over 80-90% of the content of spontaneous stereotypes. Moreover, these additional dimensions (e.g., Health, Uniqueness, Geography) predict decision making when controlling for Communion and Agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Thus, improving the predictive value of impressions models requires accounting for a larger number of dimensions.</p><p>Finally, spontaneous measures allow characterization of impression dimensions not only in their semantic differential direction, but also in their representativeness (i.e., prevalence) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</p><p>For example, while perceivers may reliably evaluate how healthy vs. unhealthy a face looks when asked on a scale, this dimension may not arise spontaneously. Dimensional prevalence may relate to accessibility in memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and associations with physical characteristics.</p><p>These limitations apply to all low-dimensional face models, but partial exceptions exist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Some models have</head><p>involved an initial open-ended task to choose scale items for dimensionality reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . Others have done limited open-ended analyses (e.g., subjective coding) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . We build upon these models to provide an in-depth characterization of the content of spontaneous face impressions, resulting in an interpretable higher-dimensional model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of Established Stimulus Generation</head><p>Most face impressions research uses either photographs or 3D digital faces. Photographs are realistic and ecologically valid, but their use is limited by small datasets and privacy concerns. Digital faces on the other hand can be generated in large numbers and are easily translated into face digital models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . However, digital faces used so far have been unrealistic and very homogeneous.</p><p>Here, we instead use recently developed AI methods to create realistic and diverse digital faces (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). This approach draws on models trained on large databases of naturalistic face photographs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> . Our results can be used to generate novel hyper-realistic face models of multiple dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . In addition, while almost all prior studies have used relatively small sets of faces (typically, less than 100), our approach can generate a much larger set of stimuli (Study 1 N = 3,022).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of a Spontaneous Content Taxonomy</head><p>To develop a taxonomy of face impressions, we initially identify relevant dimensions from the literature (as reviewed above) and using data-driven analyses (as presented in the supplement). Then, we focus on several criteria to evaluate the taxonomy's fit and properties.</p><p>The first criterion is coverage, which refers to how many of the face impressions provided by participants the taxonomy can account for. Thus, this first criterion measures the adequacy of the model. The second criterion is the prevalence of the model's dimensions, referring to how often each dimension spontaneously arises in face impressions. Prevalence is a measure of weight (primacy) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , with more important dimensions spontaneously coming to mind more often.</p><p>Third, we characterize directionality, that is, how high or low a dimension is evaluated in a semantic differential. For example, Morality impressions may be more often about low (i.e., immorality) than high morality.</p><p>Fourth, we examine the correlational structure of impressions, providing connections to low-dimensional models.</p><p>Finally, we establish the predictive value of the taxonomy. In Study 2, we show that the proposed dimensions improve predictions of general valence and decision-making, above established low-dimensional content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Studies</head><p>We present two studies using state-of-the-art face AI stimulus generation and text analysis, introducing a rich content taxonomy of spontaneous face impressions (a third study replicating findings with additional variations is in the Supplement). We examine properties of the taxonomy, including coverage, prevalence, direction, correlational structure, and predictive value.</p><p>This report is partly data-driven, which provides the necessary structure for making theoretical progress. However, we have several hypotheses. First, we expect that our model will achieve appropriate coverage of impressions (over 80% of open-ended responses accounted for by identified dimensions).</p><p>Second, we expect that prominent models' dimensions will be most prevalent, given their established role in predicting behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> . However, we hypothesize that many other dimensions found in parallel domains (e.g., stereotyping <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> ) will also be significantly prevalent, including socioeconomic Status, progressive-traditional Beliefs, Uniqueness, Health, Social groups, Emotion, and Occupation. Many of these dimensions have been previously studied in face research <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> , but are not incorporated into general models of impressions.</p><p>Third, we expect that the average impression direction will be high rather than low. For most dimensions this means positive (vs. negative) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> . Both the Pollyanna principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> and positive self-presentation tendencies in naturalistic photographs 34 support this hypothesis. However, it contrasts with negative evaluations in other domains (e.g., stereotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> ). We do expect relatively higher Ability and Sociability, and lower Morality and Health evaluations, given positive self-presentation and previous research on negativity biases for Morality and Health <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</p><p>Fourth, we expect the correlational structure of the dimensions' prevalence to reflect lowdimensional theoretical models. Specifically, we expect Communion facets of Morality and Sociability to cluster together, and Agency-related dimensions (Ability, Assertiveness, Status) to cluster together <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . We also expect to find differentiation based on more internal vs. more external traits.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>In Study 1, we present a taxonomy of content dimensions of face impressions. Then, we examine the dimensions' coverage, prevalence, and direction. Finally, we explore the correlational structure of the dimensions.</p><p>In an initial step presented in the Supplement, a more data-driven analysis suggests that the content arising from the participants' impressions largely overlaps with existing person evaluation dimensions and corresponding dictionaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> . In the main text we focus on the dictionary analyses, which confirm these data-driven results. Power analyses for all studies were calculated using G*Power <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> , and indicated &gt; 99% power to detect a small (d = .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Procedure</head><p>To generate stimuli faces we used StyleGAN2, a state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network (GAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> ). This AI model was pretrained on the Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset, which included 70,000 high-quality images. The generated faces do not depict real persons, yet they are highly photorealistic and retain the resolution and diversity of the training set <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36</ref> . Studies show that humans are barely better than chance in discriminating similar AI-generated faces from real faces (although AI-generated faces may be seen as more trustworthy) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref> .</p><p>Each participant evaluated one of 3,022 distinct faces (some faces were seen more than once). We presented only one face per participant to avoid elicitation of content based on comparison with other faces in the stimulus set. After providing consent, participants read the instructions: "In this study you will see a face, and you will be asked to provide the first 6 characteristics that you spontaneously think about when you see this person. These answers will be completely anonymous. We are interested in your immediate, gut reaction to the images.</p><p>There are no right or wrong responses. Please use single words (and no more than two words, for example, an adjective + noun) for each of your answers." Then, participants saw the face stimulus and the following instruction: "What are the first 6 characteristics that you spontaneously think about when you see this person?" along with six blank forms for typing responses. Finally, participants completed demographic questions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> provides demographic context for the stimuli, suggesting significant (perceived) demographic diversity. Note. Ratings ranged from 0 to 100 (for gender ranging from "feminine" to "masculine"; for the various racial categories ranging from, e.g., "Not Asian" to "Asian"; for age ranging from "young" to "old"). Scores derived from models, trained on the same set of faces, predicting various demographic categorizations based on ratings from over 4,000 participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis Strategy</head><p>First, we spell-checked and preprocessed the text responses to remove less-informative details (capitalization, symbols, inflections). Then, we used a multimethod approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> to reduce the dimensionality of over 3,600 distinct responses and obtain an interpretable taxonomy (see supplement for robustness analyses using clusters, embeddings similarity, and subjective coding, as well as discussion of strengths and limitations of each method).</p><p>Dictionary Coding. Dictionaries were used to evaluate coverage, prevalence, and direction. These dictionaries are word lists that are semantically associated with different dimensions of person evaluation, and have been shown to be internally reliable and valid (e.g., dictionary coding correlated with convergent human ratings) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> . The 15 dictionary dimensions are: Sociability, Morality, Ability, Assertiveness, Emotions, Social Groups, Status, Beliefs, Uniqueness, Family, Health, Occupation, Geography, Appearance, and a dictionary grouping Other smaller content (plus we subset a Beauty dimension from the Appearance dictionary, given its relevance; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> for example words in each dictionary). To further validate the dictionaries, we show that they correlate with scale ratings of face impressions as expected (see <ref type="table">Supplement)</ref>.</p><p>Prevalence &amp; Coverage. Prevalence coding involved matching responses to the dictionaries (available at https://github.com/gandalfnicolas/SADCAT), such that the response was coded as either 0 or 1 for each dimension, depending on whether the response was about the dimension (i.e., it was in the dimension's dictionary). For example, the words "friendly" and "unfriendly" are in the Sociability dictionary 32 , so a response using either of these words would Direction. Each response was assigned a value of -1 if the response was low on the dimension, 0 if neutral, and +1 if high. For example, "weird" scores high on the Uniqueness dictionary, while "typical" scores low; "friendly" scores high on Sociability, "unfriendly" scores low. For the Beliefs dimension, the endpoints are arbitrary, with high direction indicating conservatism/religiousness (e.g., "Republican"), while low direction indicating liberalism/secularism (e.g., "Democrat"). Given lack of clarity about appropriate endpoints, direction indicators are not available for some dimensions (e.g., for Occupations). For analyses, the direction across each participant's responses for a face was averaged. Direction is related to, but different from, valence (see Supplement).</p><p>Correlational Structure. Next, we examined correlations in dimensions' prevalence using text embeddings. Text embeddings are numerical-vector representations of text, encoding information about semantic relations between words and allowing quantitative analyses. For example, words such as "quick" and "fast" have more similar embeddings than pairs such as "quick" and "hair." The embeddings are retrieved from an AI model which "learns" semantic relationships by training on large text corpora (e.g., the common crawl, a vast sample of world wide web content; see https://commoncrawl.org/). Here, we use the SBERT embeddings model39,40. SBERT is a recent model which accommodates context and multi-word responses and returns 768-dimensional vectors for each response.</p><p>To obtain these correlations we first computed similarity scores between the embeddings for responses and for highly prototypical dictionary words for each dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> . For example, the words "friendly" and sociable" are highly prototypical of the Sociability dimension (see online repository for list). Thus, we obtained the text embeddings of multiple prototypical words per dimension and averaged them, resulting in an embedding for each dimension. After this, we correlated each response's embedding to each dimension's embedding, resulting in a score of how semantically related responses are to the different dimensions. Finally, we compute a correlation matrix and hierarchical clustering between these variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Software</head><p>All analyses were run using the R 4.3 41 lme4 42 and lmerTest 43 packages. We use estimated marginal means and two-tailed comparisons with Tukey corrections using the package emmeans <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44</ref> . We used maximally converging linear mixed models (participants and stimulus as random factors; alternative Poisson models for prevalence did not change conclusions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>The proposed dimensions and their top non-overlapping words (in our data), as derived from the dictionaries, are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. We found that</p><p>Appearance and Sociability contents were the most common. Emotion, Ability, Morality, Social</p><p>Group (e.g., gender, race), and Assertiveness (including dominance-related content) impressions followed, and then Beauty (i.e., attractiveness; a sub-category of Appearance). Largely, these patterns align with our expectation that dimensions from low-dimensional models would be highly prevalent, although some visually salient dimensions were more prevalent than some of these dimensions. We also find support for the significant prevalence of additional content dimensions not covered by traditional models, such as Uniqueness, Health, Status, and Beliefs.</p><p>Analyses using data-driven clusters, text embeddings similarities, and subjective coding showed largely congruent results (see Supplement). The Beauty dictionary is a subset of the Appearance dictionary but included separately due to its relevance to existing models. The "other" dimension includes content such as artistic, academic, and philosophical words that fell into smaller dictionaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Nicolas et al., 2022)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direction</head><p>There were significant differences in dimensional direction, F(8, 11,104) = 199.12, p &lt; .001, η 2 = 0.13, 95% CI = [.11, .14] (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). In line with our general positivity prediction, most evaluations were about high directions (e.g., faces were mostly evaluated as attractive and sociable). However, Health (e.g., "tired") and Beliefs ("liberal") impressions tended to be low, partially supporting our hypothesis about specific dimensions' direction. Note that this correlational structure refers to the extent to which, when one response is about a dimension, it is also about another dimension (i.e., prevalence). Also note that while correlations largely reflect semantic relatedness, they may also reflect social biases present in natural language (e.g., the word "gay" as a general negative term) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46</ref> .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Procedure</head><p>We obtained 210 neutral stimuli faces from a fine-tuned version of Study 1's model. The fine-tuning used faces from multiple sources (e.g., the FFHQ dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> ) that were coded as "neutral in appearance or minimally expressive" by human coders and automated methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">47</ref> . After the open-ended task, participants saw the same faces and rated each on direction along multiple dimensions, using a 1-not at all to 5-a lot scale. We asked: "to what extent do you view this person as," followed by items (in parenthesis: dimension name): "sociable" (Sociability), "trustworthy" (Morality), "intelligent" (Ability), "confident" (Assertiveness), "conservative" (Beliefs), "wealthy" (Status), "healthy" (Health), "experiencing a positive emotion" (Emotion), "unique/ different from most people" (Uniqueness), "American" (Geography), "physically attractive" (Beauty/Appearance), and "having recognizable features" (Appearance). After rating each face twice, in separate blocks, they saw them again to rate general valence in a 1-very negatively to 5-very positively scale ("In general, how do you feel about this person?").</p><p>Subsequently, participants saw each face one more time to rate them across decisionmaking scenarios, using a 1-none at all to 5-a great deal scale. We asked them "Suppose you are in a decision-making position for the scenarios below. How much would you prioritize this person for programs..." followed by multiple scenarios presented in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. Finally, participants completed demographic questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 5</head><p>Decision-making scenarios and predictors. To predict general valence we used the glmnet package 48 for regularized regression, reducing overfitting given the large number of predictor dimensions. We selected the lambda that minimized mean cross-validated error for each model. To predict decision-making scenarios, we used linear mixed models (participant and stimulus as random intercepts), with the hypothesized dimensions' prevalence and scale values as predictors of their corresponding decision rating, and controlling for Morality and Sociability (Communion facets), Ability and Assertiveness (Agency facets), and Attractiveness scales.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliability &amp; Consensus</head><p>For prevalence variables, test-retest reliability was fair-to-good <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">49</ref> for all dimensions (M = .62, range: .481-.718). Reliability was higher for direction (M = .85, range: .75-.935), suggesting that given that a dimension comes to mind, it is evaluated more consistently. This is in line with reliability for the traditional scales, which also measure direction (M = .824, range: .771-.918).</p><p>This difference between prevalence and direction was expected as what content comes to mind across two blocks in the same experiment is more susceptible to order effects and interpretation of instructions (e.g., whether the same responses are expected across two open-ended replicates). </p></div>

The social groups dimension predicting the face recognition scenario was the only unsupported pre-registered hypothesis. However, the closely related Geography dimension was predictive, p &lt; .001. Additional analyses are included in the Supplement and further support the insight that the expanded taxonomy dimensions are used in making decisions based on face impressions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>We introduce a taxonomy of spontaneous face impressions across two studies and a large set of realistic and diverse AI-generated face photographs. We delineate the taxonomy's properties by establishing its coverage of spontaneous impressions, the prevalence and direction of various dimensions of content, dimensional intercorrelations, and predictive value.</p><p>Furthermore, we test the robustness of our findings by using a variety of interdisciplinary methods.</p><p>First, we found that traditional content from low-dimensional models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , such as Third, our results provide insight into the directionality of face impressions. Overall, the direction of impressions was high (and the valence positive, see Supplement), potentially reflecting a general tendency of positivity towards relatively neutral stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> . This differs from negativity biases in other tasks (e.g., information integration 52 ) or domains (e.g., stereotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> ).</p><p>The distinction may lie in face impressions not depending on retrieval of negatively biased information, such as for stereotypes, or perhaps because face photographs do not typically exhibit negative expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> .</p><p>Fourth, dimensional correlations support a separation of external features and internal traits in impressions. These correlations also support the facet structure of some dimensions, with high correlations between Status, Ability, and Assertiveness and between Sociability and Morality.</p><p>Finally, the expanded taxonomy's dimensions show predictive value. Controlling for low-dimensional model's dimensions, the full taxonomy significantly improved predictions of general valence evaluations of the faces, as well as of various decision-making scenarios. This suggest that the taxonomy can improve our understanding of the consequences of impressions for both general and context-specific outcomes.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> we present a synthesis of our results, showing our proposed hierarchical organization of the dimensions identified here. This organization connects our taxonomy to existing low-dimensional models of content <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and identifies distinctions (e.g., internal vs.</p><p>external attributions) that may explain discrepancies and facilitate theoretical integration.</p><p>To develop the taxonomy, we used a recent face stimuli generation approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36</ref> . These stimuli were more representative of human diversity than many of the databases used in previous research. Moreover, these findings allow for future computational modeling of faces for stimuli generation, using the various dimensions' prevalence and direction indicators identified.</p><p>Given the centrality of faces to social interaction, understanding the content of face impressions has numerous implications. Here, we showed initial evidence of the role of the expanded taxonomy in evaluation and decision-making (in line with previous evidence in the stereotype domain) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Future research may show their role in a much larger set of outcomes, as has been done for established dimensions (e.g., criminal justice, voting behavior) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> . Moreover, spontaneous judgments, as studied here, go beyond previous research by shedding light not only on valence/direction, but also prevalence. Prevalence informs about the weight of a dimension in impressions, and may interact with direction to determine target evaluations, as shown in previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6</head><p>High-Dimensional Spontaneous Face Impressions Taxonomy and Properties Note. Proposed hierarchical organization based on a synthesis of the studies across methods and the existing literature. Size of circles indicates prevalence (based on Study 1 dictionary analysis) and color indicates average direction (green = high; red = low; grey = NA). We expect our findings to serve as an initial baseline U.S. model, but also that the patterns presented here may vary based on context, culture, individual differences, and other factors. This should provide a hypothesis-generating opportunity to examine the dynamic nature of face impressions along both direction and prevalence, and a more comprehensive set of dimensions. For example, future studies may measure differences in the extent to which participants vary along the taxonomy dimensions or their beliefs about how these dimensions correlate <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">53</ref> .</p><p>Here, we aim to characterize content without dimensionality-reduction methods that rely on interstimulus variability (e.g., factor analysis). When applied to data across participants, the latter methods may provide misleading conclusions when impressions are not shared equally across participants. For example, whether different participants believe a face is beautiful or moral may depend on the perceiver's social identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">51</ref> . In fact, our results suggest that, although responses were largely reliable within participants, consensus on the content of spontaneous impressions across participants was relatively low (see Supplement). This is consistent with work on partitioning the variance of judgments from faces to variance due to the stimuli (shared) and variance due to participants (idiosyncratic) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[57]</ref> . Thus, aggregating across participants can mask stable individual differences, resulting in an "averaging out" of evaluations. Because our methods operate directly on all participants' responses, they are not affected by this limitation.</p><p>However, other limitations arise, such as the resulting taxonomy including potentially overlapping dimensions (e.g., some dimensions may be more psychologically interchangeable).</p><p>An issue, present to some degree in all face databases, is the inability to completely control for emotional expressions. This may induce biases in descriptive analyses, which may be heavily influenced by predominant expressions in the stimuli. To illustrate, photographs may be biased towards positive self-presentation (e.g., smiles), leading, for example, to more Sociability impressions than expected. However, Study 2's neutral faces largely replicated the taxonomy.</p><p>Sociability remained amongst the most prevalent dimensions (however, direction for Sociability and Morality was lower in neutral faces; other differences in prevalence, such as slightly lower</p><p>Morality and higher Assertiveness occurred for neutral faces). Furthermore, multiple real-world contexts may also reflect self-presentational tendencies, including face impressions in social media, CVs, and politician photographs, among others, with relevant implications (e.g., biases in hiring). In fact, naturalistic photographs have several advantages compared to standardized stimuli, including potential higher ecological validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">58</ref> .</p><p>In general, we advocate a multi-method approach to balance methodological strengths and limitations (see Supplement for highly congruent replications across methods).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Faces are a significant source of information in social interactions. Here, we describe the coverage, content prevalence, directionality, dimensional intercorrelations, and predictive value of a taxonomy of spontaneous impressions of naturalistic face photographs. We used cuttingedge interdisciplinary methods from AI language models and computer vision to provide an account of impressions of a highly diverse and realistic set of human faces. A taxonomy of face impressions that is more comprehensive than current low-dimensional models is a foundation for further theoretical development and practical applications in an area central to human behavior.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>receive a score of 1 on Sociability.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head>First, a baseline</head><label></label><figDesc>regularized model using scales for facets of Communion, Agency, and Attractiveness as predictors resulted in an R 2 = .525. A model including all the scale items as predictors, covering additional dimensions such as Health, Emotion, Beliefs, Status, Uniqueness, Geography (foreignness), and Appearance, increased variance explained (R 2 = .554). This suggests that even for a broad variable such as global evaluations, the expanded taxonomy improves variance explained (see Supplement for additional supportive tests, including ANOVA comparisons).</figDesc></figure>

On the other hand, the taxonomy we introduce, including dimensions such as Emotions, Social groups, and Uniqueness, among others, resulted in coverage of over 95% of spontaneous impressions. Gaps in our understanding of the content of impressions can lead us to ignore relevant evaluations that may affect behavior.Second, prevalence results point at differences in the primacy<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> of various dimensions in spontaneous face impressions, as some dimensions come to mind more often than others. In line with low-dimensional models, Morality and Assertiveness were amongst the most prevalent dimensions. On the other hand, in contrast with group stereotypes<ref type="bibr" target="#b52">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">51</ref> , Beliefs was one of the least prevalent dimensions. The taxonomy also helps differentiate dimensions that have often been examined in conjunction in the past (e.g., Sociability and Morality as facets of Communion), but that show a clear dissociation in face impressions (e.g., Sociability is more prevalent than Morality content).</figDesc></figure>
