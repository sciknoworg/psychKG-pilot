			<abstract>
				<p>This chapter explores non-reinforced preference change, examining how preferences shift in the absence of external reinforcement. We differentiate between various types of reinforcements, including external, non-external, and internal reinforcement, to understand their roles in shaping preferences. The chapter highlights the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying preference changes, emphasizing how internal reinforcement influences decision-making processes. This synthesis of literature aims to advance our understanding of how preferences can evolve in the absence of overt rewards, shedding light on the complexities of human decision-making and the underlying cognitive mechanisms.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1 Preference changes 1.1 External Reinforcement Behavioral change refers to shifts in actions, thoughts, and emotions observed in individuals over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bandura &amp; Adams, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Duckworth &amp; Gross, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Lench et al., 2011)</ref>. These changes can be manifested in various ways, from subtle alterations in daily habits to significant transformations in personality or lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Cash et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Duckworth &amp; Gross, 2020)</ref>. Reinforcement has been a fundamental concept in behavioral psychology, shaping behavior through external rewards or the removal of aversive stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Jones et al., 1977)</ref>. The development of external reinforcement theory was further advanced by researchers like Edward Thorndike, who formulated the Law of Effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Thorndike, 1927)</ref>. This concept, which later became a foundation for B.F. Skinner's operant conditioning theory, has evolved significantly since its inception <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Skinner, 1963)</ref>. This principle states that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences are more likely to be repeated, while those followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to recur. This formulation has laid the foundation for understanding how external reinforcement shapes behavior and was used in most behavioral change interventions to change preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cameron &amp; Pierce, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Building on this foundation, recent research continued to explore and apply reinforcement principles. For example, external reinforcement principles were used to develop deposit contract methods to encourage smoking abstinence, demonstrating the practical applications of these concepts in health interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Naslund et al., 2017)</ref>. Another example is contingency management (CM), an effective behavioral intervention based on operant conditioning principles of reinforcing positive behaviors through tangible rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Petry, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>While CM shows relatively effective results in treating substance use disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bolívar et al., 2021)</ref> external reinforcement interventions has limitations that can impact the success of the intervention. CM relies on rewards to reinforce positive behaviors, such as abstinence, but once incentives are removed, individuals may struggle to sustain behavior change. This approach can also lead to dependency on external rewards rather than intrinsic motivation, reducing long-term effectiveness. A study that tested the effect of CM combined with cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) on participants with substance use disorder (SUD) found that adding CM to CBT improved smoking abstinence rates among individuals with SUD at the end of treatment. However, the positive effects declined over time, showing no sustained impact beyond treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Secades-Villa et al., 2022)</ref>. Moreover, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of CM in assisting other domains are less obvious. One meta-analysis that tested the long term effects of CM on different health-related behaviors (weight change, physical activity, medication/device adherence, and viral load) found mixed results, that suggests that the effectiveness of CM tends to fade once the incentives are no longer provided <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ellis et al., 2021)</ref>. Furthermore, researchers have found that providing external rewards or incentives for an activity that is already intrinsically rewarding can diminish its intrinsic appeal. It was found that although extrinsic rewards can boost motivation for straightforward or repetitive tasks, they might weaken intrinsic motivation in more complex or creative endeavors. The results indicate that offering external incentives can result in a decline in intrinsic interest and engagement over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Boedecker et al., 2013)</ref>. Thus, it seems that other alternatives for preference change should be put in place to achieve long term preference change without external reinforcements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Preference changes without external reinforcement</head><p>The earliest example of such preference change dates back to the mere-exposure effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Zajonc, 1968)</ref>. In this work the author demonstrated how looking at Chinese-like characters and faces led to greater preference for items that had more exposure. Interestingly, Zajonc himself explained this phenomenon using reinforcement theory, arguing that because nothing negative had occurred while looking at them, the connections were reinforced.</p><p>This work laid the foundation for further experiments in the field. One study investigated the relationship between attention and choice preference and found that manipulating visual attention can bias simple choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Armel et al., 2008)</ref>. They found that it was possible to increase the likelihood of an item being chosen by altering the relative amount of time subjects visually fixate on that item during the decision-making process. In another study a computational model was created to explain complex relationships between fixation patterns and choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Krajbich et al., 2010</ref>). Using the model, the authors found that visual attention plays a significant role in the decision-making process. Items that had longer fixation durations were more likely to be chosen, unless they were aversive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Preference changes without external reinforcement: errors leading to internal feedback</head><p>Different behavioral tasks, mainly from the research field of impulsivity, have been used to induce preference change. These tasks could be considered as non-reinforced preference change tasks as they do not include external reinforcements per se. However, the structure of these tasks could lead to the creation of internal feedback that leads to preference change:</p><p>A) The Go/No-Go (GNG) task examines the capacity to suppress prepotent responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Lappin &amp; Eriksen, 1966)</ref>. This task is a fundamental paradigm in cognitive psychology, and was first introduced by Donders <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Donders, 1969)</ref>. This method assesses response inhibition by requiring participants to respond quickly to certain stimuli (Go) while withholding responses to others (No-Go) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Gomez et al., 2007)</ref>. The Go/No-Go task has made significant contributions to the behavioral field, enabling researchers to quantify inhibitory control across various populations and conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Young et al., 2018)</ref> . It has been particularly valuable in studying developmental disorders, addiction, and neurological conditions characterized by impaired impulse control <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ding et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Dong et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Ladouceur et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Trommer et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Uzefovsky et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Waters &amp; Valvoi, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Yerys et al., 2013)</ref>. In the context of preference change, it had been demonstrated that GNG training could effectively modify food preferences, with participants showing a preference for Go food items over No-Go food items in subsequent choice tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Veling et al., 2021)</ref>. This task can be seen as inducing internal feedback, since participants recognize when they make an error or respond correctly-such as making a 'Go' response when a 'No-Go' was required, and vice versa.</p><p>B) The Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Neumann &amp; Strack, 2000)</ref>, has been used to study automatic approach-avoidance behaviors. AAT was developed by researchers studying implicit attitudes and automatic behavioral tendencies and has gained relative prominence in the 2000's <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Strack &amp; Deutsch, 2004)</ref>. The AAT typically involves participants responding to stimuli by either pulling a joystick towards themselves (approach) or pushing it away (avoidance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(van Dantzig et al., 2008)</ref>. The task measures the automatic tendencies to approach positive stimuli and avoid negative ones, providing insights into underlying cognitive and emotional processes. A significant application of the AAT was used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Rinck and Becker in 2007</ref>, who used it to study automatic avoidance tendencies in spider-fearful individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Rinck &amp; Becker, 2007)</ref>. Their work demonstrated that the AAT could measure implicit behavioral tendencies that were not captured by explicit self-reports. In the following years, other researchers used the AAT in addiction research, particularly in studying and modifying approach biases towards alcohol-related stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Wiers et al., 2007)</ref>. Their work has shown that training individuals to avoid alcohol-related cues could reduce drinking behavior. Current research continues to explore the applications of AAT in various domains, including anxiety disorders, addiction, and eating behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kakoschke et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kim &amp; Lee, 2015)</ref>. Importantly, Veling et al. found that both GNG and AAT influenced food choice in similar ways, with participants preferring Go over No-Go items and Approach over Avoidance items <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Veling et al., 2021)</ref>. We can regard this task as inducing internal feedback as participants are aware when they have made a mistake, i.e., they make an approach/avoidance response when the other response was required.</p><p>C) The Stop-Signal task (SST), measures the ability to suppress ongoing motor responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Logan et al., 1984)</ref>. The SST was developed as a method to study response inhibition, a crucial component of cognitive control. The task requires participants to perform a primary task (e.g., pressing a button in response to a stimulus) but to inhibit their response when a stop signal is presented shortly after the primary stimulus. Logan's work provided a quantitative framework for response inhibition, demonstrating that it is an active process that can be measured and quantified. Since its introduction, the SST has become a widely used paradigm in cognitive psychology and neuroscience <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bartholdy et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Lipszyc &amp; Schachar, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Li et al., 2006)</ref>. It has been used for behavioral change as it supports one's ability to adjust to a changing environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2008)</ref>. We can regard this task as inducing internal feedback since participants are aware when they have made a mistake, i.e., they do not stop on time for the stop signal. Support for this assertion comes from a study that showed that reward prospects influence strategic adjustments in the stop-signal task, with subjects adapting their behavior according to varying reward conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Giuffrida et al., 2023</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2">Preference change without external feedback and no errors</head><p>Another type of tasks that leads to preference changes does not include performance errors and thus, does not lead to internal feedback due to the task structure.</p><p>A) The "choice leads to choice" phenomenon, describes how initial choices increase the chance of choosing them again, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that progressively narrows the range of selected choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Sharot et al., 2010)</ref>. This concept relies on Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Festinger, 1957)</ref>. The cognitive dissonance theory offers significant insights into the relationship between choice and subsequent changes in preferences and attitudes. Festinger proposed that when we make a difficult decision between two similarly desirable options, we experience cognitive dissonance.</p><p>To reduce this dissonance, we tend to either enhance the positive aspects of the chosen option or downplay the positive aspects of the rejected option. This phenomenon is known as "spreading of alternatives" and has been demonstrated in various studies (Harmon-Jones &amp; Mills, 2019).</p><p>B) The Cue Approach Training (CAT) task, is a relatively novel behavioral training paradigm that induces preference changes without external reinforcements <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Schonberg et al., 2014)</ref>. This is a multiphase task (see <ref type="figure">Figure x</ref>.1). In the initial phase participants express their baseline preferences for items. In the training phase individual pictures of items are presented on a screen and participants are requested to press a button whenever a cue is presented (either auditory or visual). In the original CAT task, the mere association of snack food pictures with a neutral auditory cue and a speeded motor response, led to enhanced preferences towards the items that were associated with the stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Schonberg et al., 2014)</ref>. Preference change was measured in a subsequent binary choice phase, in which couples of items with similar initial value, one associated with the cue and the other not, were presented together and participants were requested to choose one of the presented items. Results indicate that participants preferred the items previously associated with the Go cue. Multiple studies had shown consistently that CAT induced behavioral changes, whereby Go items were chosen significantly above chance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bakkour et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Salomon et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Salomon et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Salomon et al., , 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Schonberg et al., 2014)</ref>. The CAT effect had since been demonstrated with various cues (visual or auditory), as well as various stimuli types (snacks, unfamiliar faces, fractal art images, and positive International Affective Picture System (IAPS) images) <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Salomon et al., 2018)</ref>. It has also been demonstrated using fruits and vegetables . The effect of behavioral changes had shown to be preserved up to six months after initial training <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020)</ref>, indicating that a memory element is putatively incorporated in this effect. Most of CAT studies included an initial choice phase, and so to address a 'choice leads to choice' effect, one study showed that preference modifications were still found, even if training occurred on one day and participants performed the choice session only three days later <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2021)</ref>. However, the effect seems to be limited to neutral and positive items as when Go items were negative IAPS images no choice effect was found <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Salomon et al., 2018)</ref>. Additionally, response time is another factor, as the behavioral effect was not observed when participants had longer choice times .</p><p>Over the past few years, new applications of CAT have been discovered across various research laboratories. One notable example is the work of Yao et al, who integrated CAT with sleep-based targeted memory reactivation (TMR) to enhance positive self-referential processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Yao et al., 2024)</ref>. Their study demonstrated that this combined approach not only facilitated quicker endorsement of positive traits immediately after training but also resulted in participants identifying more positive traits as selfdescriptive a week later. Another context in which CAT has been applied is leadership development <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Cavarretta, 2024)</ref>. The researchers used CAT to modify implicit attitudes towards leadership tasks, particularly focusing on enhancing positive associations with managerial activities. Their findings demonstrated that CAT could effectively help aspiring leaders develop a more positive "taste" for the often-challenging aspects of leadership, such as dealing with interpersonal issues and managing team dynamics. Participants who underwent CAT showed increased positive associations with managerial activities, suggesting potential improvements in their motivation and effectiveness in leadership roles.</p><p>A recent study applied a computational Bayesian learning model to data from 28 CAT samples and identified that a shift in reaction time during the training phase predicted the subsequent behavioral-change effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Salomon et al., 2022)</ref>. Specifically, participants who pressed the button earlier into the trial as training progressed, subsequently showed greater preference changes in the probe phase.</p><p>During the training phase, participants learn to associate a stimulus with a cue. While proceeding in training, they begin to press the button earlier, sometimes even before the cue appears. When participants start responding to the stimuli instead of the cue, and the cue eventually appears, it acts as internal feedback, similarly to missed trials in Go/NoGo or SST. This internal feedback further enhances the learning process via regular feedback mechanisms. Additionally, this learning could also rely on a stronger memory trace and enhanced attentional processes, which are difficult to discriminate from the overall learning process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Short-Term versus Long-Term change</head><p>The timescale of preference change varies significantly across different experimental paradigms. Preference changes induced by mere exposure, choice leads to choice, or Cue-Approach Training (CAT) operate on different timescales. MEE usually lasts for short term in a span of minutes or hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Bornstein &amp; Craver-Lemley, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">de Zilva et al., 2013)</ref>, CAT's behavioral effects have been observed to persist for months <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Salomon et al., 2018)</ref> and choice-induced preference changes can last for years <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Sharot et al., 2012)</ref>. This disparity in timescales suggests the possibility of distinct underlying mechanisms: long-term preference changes might rely more heavily on memory-related processes for value assignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Chammat et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Voigt et al., 2019)</ref>, while short-term effects could involve other mechanisms. However, differences in timescale might be a consequence of experimental design rather than indicative of fundamentally different mechanisms and it remains unclear whether the differences in the timescale of effects across paradigms truly reflect distinct underlying mechanisms or are simply artifacts of varying experimental designs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">Neural basis of non-reinforced preference change</head><p>The neural basis of preference change has been studied primarily in the context of external reinforcement and through the lens of reinforcement learning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Elliott &amp; Deakin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Folia &amp; Petersson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kustubayeva et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Stanger &amp; Garavan, 2015)</ref>. This process has been associated with the dopaminergic nuclei in the midbrain and their connections to the ventral and dorsal striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Schultz et al., 1997)</ref>. The representation of subjective value assigned to a stimuli or responses is closely linked to the activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which are believed to encode value in a unified and common currency <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bartra et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Levy &amp; Glimcher, 2012)</ref>. The vmPFC and <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Overview of the three main procedural components of the Cue-Approach Training (CAT) paradigm. (a) Initial Preference Evaluation: Baseline preferences for all stimuli were assessed using either a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction for consumable items or a forced-choice binary ranking task for non-consumable items <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Becker et al., 1964)</ref>. (b) Training Phase: Stimuli were displayed for one second, and participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible when a cue appeared (around 750 ms into the trial). Go items were paired with both the cue and a motor response, while NoGo items were not. (c) Probe Phase: Preference changes were assessed by presenting participants with a binary forced choice between pairs of stimuli of similar initial value, comparing one Go stimulus to one NoGo stimulus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Itzkovitch et al., 2022)</ref> adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020)</ref> OFC are thought to be interpreted by downstream areas that guide value-based decisions and actions, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and related regions within the frontoparietal network <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Gluth et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hare et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kennerley et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Pisauro et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Rich &amp; Wallis, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Rodriguez et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>When comparing brain regions activated by various internal reinforcement techniques, both similarities and differences emerge. A notable similarity is the engagement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) across all tasks, though it manifests in distinct ways for each technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Eagle et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Schonberg &amp; Katz, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Simmonds et al., 2008)</ref>. Go/NoGo and SST focus more on response inhibition and selection, engaging prefrontal-parietal networks such as right inferior frontal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Goghari &amp; MacDonald, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hughes et al., 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, both tasks share activation in the Pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Simmonds et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Tabu et al., 2011)</ref>. AAT has been shown to involve emotional and motivational circuits, including the amygdala and striatum <ref type="bibr">(McDermott et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Another study explored the neural mechanisms underlying choice-induced preference formation, emphasizing the relationship between resting-state brain connectivity and preference changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Voigt et al., 2020)</ref>. Their findings indicated that diminished resting-state excitation between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was linked to changes in preferences, while increased resting-state excitation from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to the left hippocampus and vmPFC correlated with preference stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Voigt et al., 2020)</ref>. These dynamic network configurations suggested that resting-state brain activity significantly influenced both the formation and consistency of preferences during decision-making processes. Additionally, it was proposed that the act of making choices could increase the perceived value of non-instrumental information. By fostering a sense of control, individuals became more engaged in learning, leading to an increase in their appreciation of non-instrumental information. This highlights how decision-making could actively shape individuals' evaluations and preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Jiwa et al., 2021)</ref>. Collectively, these studies contribute to our understanding of the interplay between cognitive processes and neural activity in the context of preference formation without external reinforcements.</p><p>Recent findings suggest that sensitivity to intrinsic rewards is domain-general, applying across various types of rewards such as visual, cognitive, and social stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Blain &amp; Sharot, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Blain et al., 2023)</ref>. In their recent research on intrinsic reward Blain et al. found that approximately 40% of response variance across different stimuli in the experiment was explained by a general sensitivity to all rewards, indicating a common underlying mechanism for reward processing. A significant finding was the association between affective aspects of mental health and sensitivity to intrinsic rewards, but not monetary rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Blain et al., 2023)</ref>. A related study used a neurocomputational model to understand and measure the inherent value of self-rewarding experiences, such as playing music without errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Chew et al., 2021)</ref>. It highlighted the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) as a critical brain region involved in processing these intrinsic rewards. Through neuroimaging and computational modeling, the researchers demonstrated those intrinsic rewards significantly influence subjective affective states, even in the absence of direct instrumental value. Additionally, the study compared intrinsic rewards with extrinsic ones, revealing that some individuals are more motivated by the intrinsic rewards than by external incentives, like money.</p><p>Functional MRI (fMRI) studies with CAT revealed enhanced activations in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), during choices of Go items in the binary-choice phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bakkour et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Salomon et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Schonberg et al., 2014)</ref>. A few CAT versions added an additional measurement of the change in neural activations for presented items, called passive viewing task <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020)</ref>. During this task, individual stimulus was presented on the screen before and after training, without any response from the participants. For Go items, BOLD activations during this task were found to increase after training in the lateral occipital cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020)</ref>. An fMRI study focused on training phase, found that BOLD activity in the striatum during the last training run was correlated with individual subsequent preference modification during probe <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Salomon et al., 2020)</ref>. This suggests the involvement of the reward system, even in the absence of external reinforcements, during the training phase. The results indicate that CAT task induces a robust effect that influences preferences for non-negative stimuli and suggests that the effect is driven by the involvement of attention, memory, motor, and reward systems. Relatedly, for participants who made more Go over NoGo choices in the binary-choice probe phase, a greater functional connectivity was found between higher-level visual regions, prefrontal cortices, and the striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Salomon et al., 2020)</ref>. These results were replicated for the GNG task <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Wu et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Xia et al., 2024)</ref> suggesting that attention processes took place in non-reinforcement learning procedures. These findings also align with Lim's work, which demonstrated that visual attention guides the relative value coding in the vmPFC and striatum during decision-making. This study tested how these brain regions compute relative decision values by comparing the value of the attended item to the value of the unattended item <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Lim et al., 2011)</ref>. The results suggest that attention biases the valuation process toward the attended item, making it more likely to be chosen. The modulation of value by attention indirectly impacts choice outcomes by favoring the item in focus. These results are consistent with earlier behavioral studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Armel et al., 2008)</ref>, and suggests that attention plays a crucial role in valuebased decision-making, providing a potential mechanism for how CAT and GNG tasks influence preferences through attentional processes.</p><p>To test overlapping regions active during CAT we performed a meta-analysis of studies that used CAT task scanned in fMRI. We used uncorrected maps uploaded to NeuroVault and computed an overlap of activation maps to analyze their aggregated activation patterns. We tested group-level statistical maps of the activation during the training and probe phases. We used the meta-analysis toolbox taken from Nilearn package in Python, with a smoothing of FWHM = 6 mm and a threshold of | | ≥ 2.3 at the group level. For the training phase, we found results from two studies displaying the fMRI response to 'Go' items and not responses for 'NoGo' items on the last training run <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Salomon et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Schonberg et al., 2014)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The dorsal value pathway or how can neuroscience data inform behavioral models?</head><p>The above mentioned neural mechanisms engage reward-related and habit-forming regions like vmPFC, striatum and insula, all related to dopaminergic circuits that could be named Ventral Value Pathway (VVP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Schonberg &amp; Katz, 2020)</ref>. The VVP relies on a feedback loop of rewardbased learning, a mechanism involves updating the expected value of actions based on recent outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Rangel et al., 2008)</ref>. The VVP shapes preferences through direct reinforcement from external outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(O'Doherty et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The same authors proposed that another neural pathway underlies the types of nonexternal reinforcement preference changes reviewed in this chapter. They termed it the Dorsal Value Pathway (DVP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Schonberg &amp; Katz, 2020)</ref>. The DVP involves several key brain regions, including the striatum and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), as well as higher perceptual and attentional areas such as frontal eye field (FEF) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Schonberg &amp; Katz, 2020)</ref>. Building on the involvement of attention in the value construction process the pathway flows by integrating information from these regions, with the striatum that plays a crucial role in valuation and reward systems, the vmPFC associated with decision-making, and the higher perceptual and attentional regions contribute to selective attention and item evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Schonberg &amp; Katz, 2020)</ref>. It has been offered that the DVP pathway is either integrated with or segregate from the well-established VVP, which is primarily related to external reinforcement learning, through the association to dopaminergic regions and projections.</p><p>The DVP plays a critical role in attention, salience and reward processing, which is essential for understanding changes in preferences that are not externally reinforced (Schonberg are marked by orange nodes, while regions associated with the ventral value pathway (VVP) are marked by blue nodes. Both sets of nodes are shown on a schematic of the human brain, with transparency indicating regions beneath the neocortex.

The interaction of different structures within the DVP, such as the ventral striatum's role in reward signaling, the dorsal striatum's role in habitual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Yin &amp; Knowlton, 2006)</ref>, and the PFC's role in decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001)</ref>, may support the stabilization of these preferences. Furthermore, the PFC integrates information from various neural circuits, allowing for complex decision-making and adaptive behavior, which is vital for the stabilization of newly formed preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Conclusions</head><p>In this chapter, we explored the diverse tasks through which preference changes can occur without external reinforcement. From the effects of mere exposure and cognitive dissonance to more structured interventions like AAT and Cue-Approach Training (CAT), we see that putatively internal feedback plays a significant role in shaping preferences. We highlighted the neural mechanisms underlying non-reinforced preference change that involve a network of regions named the Dorsal Value Pathway (DVP).</p><p>The findings presented here point to promising avenues for future research. Investigating the long-term effects of non-reinforced preference changes, especially in applied contexts like health behavior modification and therapeutic interventions, may provide valuable insights. Furthermore, advancements in neuroimaging and computational modeling will allow for deeper exploration of the DVP and its interactions with the VVP, that has been extensively studied as it underlying reinforced change. In summary, the study of non-reinforced preference change broadens our understanding of decision-making processes and highlights the potential for neuroscience to inform models that capture the intrinsic dynamics of preference formation. As research in this field progresses, we may uncover innovative ways to influence preferences sustainably and ethically, leveraging our understanding of internal motivations and cognitive control.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure x. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>(a) Dorsal and Ventral Value Pathways: Brain areas belonging to the dorsal value pathway (DVP)</figDesc></figure>
