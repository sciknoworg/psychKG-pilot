<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Barriers</head><p>Despite sexual minorities 1 attending mental health care at higher rates than their heterosexual counterparts, sexual minorities report more barriers to care, more unmet mental health needs, and a higher perceived need for mental health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Burgess et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Dahlhamer et al., 2016)</ref>. Sexual minorities are also more than two times more likely to experience a mental health disorder and three times more likely to experience a serious mental health disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Medley et al., 2016)</ref>. This elevated distress is the result of a complex interaction of stressors sexual minorities face, including discrimination and prejudice <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Hatzenbuehler, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Meyer, 2013)</ref>. Despite the relatively recent paradigmatic shift toward affirmative therapy, helpseeking for sexual minorities must also be contextualized within the fraught history of psychology and other mental health disciplines producing and perpetuating heterosexism, heteronormativity, and other intersecting forms of inequality (American Psychological Association, 2021). The inequitable access and increased mental health risks for sexual minorities underscores a need to better understand the help-seeking process in order to target interventions to better meet sexual minorities' mental health needs.</p><p>A comprehensive review of the literature concluded "there is little agreement in terms of what predicts service use" among sexual minorities <ref type="bibr">(Filice &amp; Meyer, 2018, p. 183)</ref>. Akin to other mental health research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Spengler et al., 2019)</ref>, models of help-seeking 2 often negate to report or consider respondents' sexual orientation. The two help-seeking models that considered participants' sexual orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Spengler and AEgisdóttir, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Vogel et al., 2011)</ref> did not account for key variables in other help-seeking models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Cramer, 1999)</ref>, such as social support, self-concealment (i.e., withholding vulnerable information from others), and public help-seeking stigma (i.e., perceiving others to stigmatize seeking out mental health care).</p><p>Moreover, unlike medical health help-seeking frameworks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Levesque et al., 2013)</ref>, previous mental health help-seeking models assume volitional control of the individual without considering structural factors (e.g., cost) that may impede one's ability to receive services. This approach negates to account for the impact of structural vulnerability on who is willing and able to receive mental health care. Structural vulnerability represents the social, psychological, historical, economic, and cultural forces that frame and constrain choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bourgois et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>To help clarify factors that impact help-seeking for sexual minorities, this study tests a helpseeking model to inquire whether structural barriers predict help-seeking intentions more than traditionally included help-seeking factors. This study also examines how key help-seeking factors interact with psychological distress to predict help-seeking intentions and whether factors of structural vulnerability explain unmet mental health needs. In doing so, this could help counseling psychologists better understand the factors that influence whether sexual minorities are willing to seek out mental health services when they want or need them in order to help inform proactive mental health care efforts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Structural Vulnerability Framework</head><p>Medical sociology, medical anthropology, and public health researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bourgois et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Levesque et al, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Pescosolido, 2006)</ref> have used the structural vulnerability framework to better illuminate how sociocultural factors can impede access to medical health care. This study seeks to extend this framework into mental health help-seeking. Nearly one-quarter (23.6%) of individuals with a mental health disorder reported they needed mental health services in the last year but did not receive them. Cost (40.7%), not knowing where to seek services (25.2%), and not having time (20.8%) were some of the most common reasons for these unmet mental health needs (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration; SAMHSA, 2019). Despite this, help-seeking research often neglects the role of these structural factors.</p><p>While previous research has examined structural barriers via descriptive, bivariate, or qualitative methods, we know of no study that compares variance accounted for by structural barriers relative to more traditionally studied help-seeking variables. Thus, previous help-seeking models assume "perfect volitional control" as they have not accounted for how "such barriers as lack of money, time, or other resources" (p. 613; Ajzen, 2020) contribute to help-seeking intentions and behaviors.</p><p>While structural barriers are certainly not unique to sexual minorities, they need to be considered as they are associated with lower intentions to seek out mental health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Schomerus et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Shea et al., 2019)</ref> and less future help-seeking behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Kung, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Sexual minorities who report unmet mental health needs often cite structural factors, such as a lack of insurance, insufficient financial resources, absence of affirmative clinicians, and limited knowledge about services <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dahlhamer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barefoot et al., 2015)</ref>. Much like how <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bowleg (2017)</ref> used structural vulnerability to frame health disparities as health inequities, helpseeking may be better understood through a lens of mental health inequity. Structural vulnerability may hinder members of marginalized social groups' access to mental health services due to structural inequality and institutional oppression. This lack of access could, in turn, contribute to increased mental health inequities <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Romanelli &amp; Hudson, 2017)</ref>. Critically examining help-seeking also means accounting for the sociohistorical forces of structural vulnerability.</p><p>Researchers consistently find help-seeking attitudes to be positively associated with helpseeking intentions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Cramer, 1999</ref>), yet these studies do not consider if or how these attitudes towards the "helper" are informed by historical (and ongoing) injustices. Psychologists historically pathologized same-sex desires and perpetuated stigma by attempting to "cure" these desires through heinous treatments, such as electroshock, nausea-inducing drugs, lobotomies, and castration <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Katz, 1976)</ref>. More recent studies document the ongoing mistreatment and maltreatment of sexual minorities in the process of seeking out mental health care. This includes clinical microaggressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Spengler et al., 2016,)</ref> recent legislation that undermines trust between sexual minority clients and potential providers , and sexual orientation change efforts (i.e., conversion "therapy;" <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Ryan et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, depending on how they perceive the profession, sexual minorities' potential reticence to seek out mental health care could be framed as rational and justifiable, rather than misguided and uninformed. Indeed, research illustrates perceived prejudice and affirmativeness of mental health professionals are separate but related influential factors in the process of seeking and receiving mental health care. A synthesis of empirical research found the two most consistent themes that dictated the process and outcomes of clinical work with sexual minorities were the importance of an affirmative counselor and the harmful effects of a prejudicial counselor <ref type="bibr">(O'Shaughnessy &amp; Spier, 2018)</ref>. Retrospective studies found sexual minorities purposefully sought out affirmative clinicians and/or delayed or avoided seeking out mental health care when they perceived clinicians as prejudiced <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barefoot et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Romanelli &amp; Hudson, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Willging et al., 2006)</ref>. The one help-seeking model with only sexual minorities found perceived counselor prejudice to be a significant predictor of help-seeking attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Spengler &amp; AEgisdóttir, 2015)</ref>, although no study includes perceived counselor affirmativeness.</p><p>In this sense, help-seeking research should recognize the reality that seeking out "help" for mental health "care" has been a source of harm for sexual minorities, particularly those who belong to other marginalized and stigmatized social groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Grzanka &amp; Miles, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hammack et al., 2013)</ref>. Accordingly, a holistic construct of help-seeking attitudes for sexual minorities should consider how affirmative and prejudiced they perceive the helper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Help-Seeking and Distress: The Question of Moderation</head><p>Ideally, people would be willing and able to seek out the help they need when they begin to experience significant distress. The treatment gap -that over half (56.7%) of adults living in the United States with a diagnosable mental health disorder do not receive mental health care (SAMHSA, 2019) -indicate this is not the case. Although some help-seeking models find the relation between distress and help-seeking intentions to be significant (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Cramer, 1999)</ref>, it is often statistically non-significant or weak (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Brenner et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Lannin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Vogel et al., 2005)</ref>. This understates a need to better understand factors that impact the willingness to seek out mental health care when experiencing distress for sexual minorities and in general. This reluctance or inability to engage in care is especially important to understand as clinical prognoses worsen the more distressed clients are upon starting services <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Buckman et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Robinson et al., 2020)</ref>. Specifically, the dose-response curve illustrates that every standard deviation increase in psychological distress is related to 31% worse clinical prognosis 3-4 months into treatment and a two-fold increase in symptom remission <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Buckman et al., 2021)</ref>. This raises important questions as to what factors interact with psychological distress to help explain this treatment gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kazdin, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Pescolido (2006)</ref> provides potential insight into the treatment gap by posing that individuals dynamically navigate distress differently depending upon their sociocultural networks and structural factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Pescosolido (2006)</ref> theorizes help-seeking as an interaction between an individual's illness characteristics (e.g., severity of psychological distress) and their sociocultural context, including attitudes toward health care, community beliefs about receiving health care (e.g., help-seeking stigma) and organizational constraints (e.g., cost). Researchers have used this framework to contextualize help-seeking in a more nuanced manner for other vulnerable populations, including older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Beatie et al., 2022)</ref> and youth at high risk for psychosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Boydell et al., 2013)</ref>. While some researchers have recently used moderation to investigate help-seeking patterns previously not uncovered via bivariate analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Booth et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Brenner et al., 2020)</ref>, no research has examined moderation in relation to help-seeking intentions. Moderation could provide a better understanding about what subsets of sexual minorities may be less willing to seek out mental health care when they are distressed.</p><p>Given the lack of significant relationship between psychological distress and helpseeking intentions, it is feasible that moderating factors could elucidate patterns for sexual minorities that change this relationship in consequential ways. For example, should help-seeking stigma enhance the effect of distress on intentions in a negative direction, it would indicate sexual minorities high in help-seeking stigma avoid mental health care when they are most in need, thereby exacerbating the treatment gap. Additionally, if interaction plots illustrate those with negative help-seeking attitudes are only willing to seek out mental health care when they are significantly distressed, it would indicate sexual minorities who perceive counselors as prejudiced and not affirmative are only willing to reach out when they are in dire need. This would likely decrease the effectiveness of treatment and potentially increase unmet mental health needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Buckman et al., 2021)</ref>. If either pattern emerges, this could help further clarify what factors impede sexual minorities from seeking out mental health care when they would most benefit. Moreover, this could guide psychologists and policy makers to tailor interventions and outreach efforts that help sexual minorities enter care earlier when there is a better clinical prognosis. Observing such novel dynamics could also inform research on help-seeking patterns among other populations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Present Study</head><p>The aim of this study is to better understand the role of structural vulnerability in helpseeking with sexual minorities. To do so, we inquired about the frequency of reasons for unmet needs (e.g., cost too high to seek services). We also tested a help-seeking model (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>) to examine the variance of help-seeking intentions accounted for by structural barriers compared to traditional help-seeking variables (e.g., help-seeking attitudes, public help-seeking stigma, social support, self-concealment; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Cramer, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Liao et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Vogel et al., 2005</ref>). This will allow us to better understand the consequences of structural barriers, which have been historically neglected in empirical inquiry in mental health help-seeking. We predicted sexual minorities' help-seeking intentions would be associated with (a) higher psychological distress, (b) more positive attitudes towards help-seeking, including perceiving mental health professionals as having lower prejudice and higher affirmativeness toward sexual minorities, (c) higher selfconcealment, (d) higher social support, (e) lower public help-seeking stigma, and (f) lower structural barriers. In addition to assessing frequency of unmet mental health needs and an extensive list of the reasons for them, we examined if or how help-seeking intentions may differ depending on how psychological distress interacts with latent moderators (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Supplementary   Figure 1</ref>). Rather than include all variables, we used the preeminent paradigm of help-seeking (i.e., the theory of planned behavior; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al., 2022</ref>) and a framework justifying interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Pescosolido, 2006)</ref> to guide selection of three latent constructs that align with these theories for this initial inquiry to elucidate if more complex patterns would emerge. Specifically, we ran the structural model with interactions for the constructs associated with personal beliefs (i.e., helpseeking attitudes), subjective norms (i.e., public help-seeking stigma), and behavioral control (i.e., structural barriers). Given the exploratory nature of our work, we made no further hypotheses about potential relationships among the interaction effects in the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedures</head><p>Survey respondents consisted of 398 individuals who self-identified as bisexual (64.1%), gay or lesbian (35.9%), queer (3%), pansexual (1.5%), demisexual (1.5%), and/or asexual (0.8 %), and none "other." 3 Participants identified as man (61.3%), woman (35.9%), transgender (2.5%), and/or non-binary (1.5%). No participants chose to write in an additional gender identity that applied to them. Participants were allowed to select as many gender identity categories as applied to them, and thus percentages are greater than 100%. Participants identified as White or European American (59.5%), Black or African American or African (29.5%), Latino or Hispanic (8.9%), Asian or Asian American or Asian Pacific Islander (4.1%), and/or Native American (2.8%). The mean age was 32.4 (SD = 7.5). Most participants (75.3%) had a college or postgraduate degree and reported living in urban (44.5%) or suburban (39.7%) areas. On a Likerttype scale ranging from 1 (lower class) to 10 (upper class) that assesses perceived socioeconomic status in relation to others, the mean socioeconomic status was 5.3 (SD = 2.1).</p><p>Nearly half of participants (46.5%) reported receiving previous counseling from a mental health professional (e.g., psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, counselor). For more detailed demographic information see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Supplementary Table 1.</ref> After institutional review board approval, we recruited participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). MTurk is an online platform where workers are compensated for completing research tasks. Researchers have shown MTurk produces valid data from samples that are more socioculturally diverse than traditional Internet methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Casler et al., 2013)</ref>. After reading a short description of the study, inclusion criteria, and that participation was voluntary, participants provided online consent and completed the questionnaires using QuestionPro software. In addition to the measures listed below, we asked participants if they had an unmet mental health need in the last 12 months. If participants reported they had an unmet mental health need, we asked them to select from the 14 reasons for the unmet mental health need provided in the SAMHSA (2019) National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Participants received compensation directly through MTurk that was contingent upon survey completion and length (i.e., $4 for 20 minutes). We used attention checks (e.g., "Please select strongly agree for this item") at various points in the survey to ensure valid responses. We report all manipulations, all measures used in the study, all data exclusions, and we follow JARS <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kazak, 2018)</ref>. All data, analysis code, and research materials are available upon request. Data were analyzed using SPSS 26 (IBM Corp, 2019) and Mplus 8.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2017)</ref>. This study's design and analyses were not pre-registered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological Distress</head><p>The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (KPDS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kessler et al., 2002</ref>) is a 10-item scale that measures the amount of psychological distress in the last 30 days (e.g., "During the last 30 days, about how often did you feel worthless?"). Items are rated using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time) with higher scores reflecting higher levels of psychological distress. <ref type="bibr">Kessler and colleagues (2002)</ref> reported good internal consistency reliability in four studies (α = .89-.93). <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Andrews and Slade (2001)</ref> showed evidence of convergent validity with the KPDS on scales measuring symptom severity and functioning.</p><p>Scores on the KPDS range from 10 to 50; respondents who score under 20 are likely well, 20-24 are likely to have a mild mental disorder, 25-29 are likely to have a moderate mental health disorder, and over 30 are likely to have a severe mental health disorder. Internal consistency for this study was high (α = .96).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attitudes towards Seeking Mental Health Care</head><p>The Mental Help Seeking Attitudes Scale (MHSAS; Hammer et al., 2018) is a 9-item scale that measures attitudes towards mental health care. Items are organized with a preface (i.e., "If I had a mental health concern, seeking help from a mental health professional would be…") and rated by a 7-point semantic differential scale from -3 (e.g., useless) to 3 (e.g., useful). Higher scores indicate more favorable attitudes.  showed evidence of convergent validity with other help-seeking attitudes measures, public stigma, and help-seeking intentions.</p><p>Hammer and colleagues also demonstrated high internal consistency (α = .93) and temporal stability over three weeks; we observed a high internal consistency (α = .90). This scale is one of three observed variables for the help-seeking attitudes latent construct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Mental Health Professional Sexual Minority Affirmativeness</head><p>To assess participants' perceived level of mental health professionals' affirmative beliefs toward sexual minorities, we slightly modified a previously adapted version of the Gay Affirmative Practice Scale (GAP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Crisp, 2006)</ref> so that participants, instead of therapists, could evaluate their perceived level of mental health professionals' affirmative beliefs toward sexual minorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alessi et al., 2019)</ref>. Items on the original 30-item scale are evaluated in two separately scored subscales: Beliefs (e.g., "Practitioners should be knowledgeable about gay/lesbian resources") and Engagement (e.g., "I inform clients about gay affirmative resources in the community"). We only used the 15-item Beliefs subscale as we were only concerned with perceived attitudes. The Beliefs subscale is anchored on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree) and assesses beliefs about affirmative practice with sexual minorities. We modified the reference to sexual minorities to be inclusive of all sexual minorities rather than just gay and lesbian individuals. For example, we changed the item "Practitioners make an effort to learn about the diversity of the gay/lesbian community" to "Practitioners make an effort to learn about the diversity of the sexual minority community."</p><p>Alessi and colleagues <ref type="formula">2019</ref>found their adapted subscale demonstrated evidence of high internal consistency (α = .95), good model fit for the adjusted subscales, and convergent validity with working alliance and the real relationship. Internal consistency for the present study was high (α = .93). This scale is one of three observed variables for the help-seeking attitudes latent construct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Mental Health Professional Sexual Minority Prejudice</head><p>To assess participants' perception of heterosexism in professionals, we slightly modified a previously adapted version of the Attitudes Toward Homosexuality (ATH) scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Kite &amp; Deaux, 1986)</ref> to reflect how participants believe a counselor would answer the items <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Spengler &amp; AEgisdóttir, 2015)</ref>. Items on the original 21-item scale are evaluated on a 5-point Likert-type scale anchored by 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) to measure attitudes toward lesbian and gay individuals. Higher scores indicate a higher level of prejudice. We changed "sex" to "gender/sex" following recommendations by <ref type="bibr">Hyde and colleagues (2018)</ref>. For example, we reworded the item "Two individuals of the same sex holding hands or displaying affection in public is revolting" to "A mental health professional believes that two individuals of the same gender/sex holding hands or displaying affection in public is revolting." Spengler and AEgisdóttir <ref type="formula">2015</ref>found their modified version demonstrated evidence of high internal consistency (α = .90) and convergent validity with attitudes towards counseling. Internal consistency for this study was high (α = .93). This scale is one of three observed variables for the help-seeking attitudes latent construct.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Cleaning and Initial Analysis</head><p>The final sample consisted of 398 participants after excluding 380 participants who identified as straight and 102 for failing at least one attention check or providing responses that suggested satisficing. Because all items had less than 1% missing data, we used expectation maximization in SPSS to impute missing data, which is an appropriate procedure for data missing completely at random (Scholmer et al., 2010). Observed variables met assumptions of univariate normality and lacked multicollinearity (Kline, 2016). Means, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unmet Mental Health Needs</head><p>A substantial amount of the sample (n =158; 39.8%) reported they had an unmet mental health need in the last 12 months. Out of the 120 participants who received mental health care in the last 12 months, they reported relatively more unmet mental health needs in the last 12 months (n = 82; 68.3%). Out of the 213 participants who had never received mental health care, they reported relatively less unmet mental health needs in the last 12 months (n = 48; 22.5%). Please see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> for the reason(s) participants identified for their unmet mental health need.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Analyses</head><p>We conducted structural equation modeling (SEM) using Mplus 8.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2017</ref>). The following model fit indices were used: CFI ≥ .95, TLI ≥ .95, RMSEA ≤ .06, SRMR &lt; .08 for good fit and CFI ≥ .90, TLI ≥ .90, RMSEA ≤ .10, SRMR &lt; .10 for acceptable fit <ref type="bibr">(Weston &amp; Gore, 2006)</ref>. According to best practices, we interpreted all model fit indices collectively. We used latent moderated structural equations (i.e., LMS method) to create a latent interaction from two latent constructs to examine moderating effects. In simulation studies comparing LMS method to other interaction methods, researchers found the LMS method had fewer Type I error rates and better performance across a variety of other conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Jackman et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers noted the LMS method is consistent, asymptotically normally distributed, provides unbiased standard errors, and allows for multiple latent interactions to be tested simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Klein &amp; Muthén, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>Before examining the structural model, we evaluated the adequacy of the measurement model. For the scales that had more three items (i.e., psychological distress, self-concealment, social support, help-seeking stigma), we parceled individual items into three observed constructs that loaded onto each latent construct in order for the model to be just-identified. We created these parcels based on item-to-construct rotated factor loadings (i.e., the serpentine method) to ensure all parcels had comparable cumulative rotated factor loadings <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Little et al., 2013)</ref>. Using parcels as indicators in structural models increases reliability and construct representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Little et al., 2013)</ref>. Due to having three observed variables or scales, help-seeking attitudes, structural barriers, and help-seeking intentions were not parceled. The measurement model resulted in acceptable model fit, CFI = .934, TLI = .918, RMSEA = .080 (90% CI [.073-.087]), SRMR = .075. As the model was saturated and no other model modifications were justifiable with both theory and statistics (e.g., modification indices suggested loading observed items on different factors 4 ), we deemed this model the final measurement model. The observed variables, including the parceled items, all significantly loaded onto their latent variable, b = .491 to .943, p &lt; .001.</p><p>As the LMS method does not have a mean, variance, or covariance with other parameters and is done in a subsequent step, it did not affect the model fit of the measurement model <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Maslowsky et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model</head><p>As the model was saturated, the acceptable model fit of the final measurement model was the same as the structural model. The structural model (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>) accounted for 47.6% of the variance in help-seeking intentions. As hypothesized, structural barriers (β = -.705) was significantly related to lower help-seeking intentions. Social support (β = .442) and help-seeking attitudes (β = .247) were also significantly related to higher help-seeking intentions. Selfconcealment (β = .111) was not significantly related to help-seeking intentions. Help-seeking stigma (β = .343) was significantly related to higher help-seeking intentions, which was the opposite relation as hypothesized. The structural model with moderators (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Supplementary  Figure 2</ref>) accounted for 55.7% of the variance in help-seeking intentions. The interactions of psychological distress with structural barriers, help-seeking attitudes, and help-seeking stigma were not statistically significant. For cross-loadings and factor loadings of both structural models, please see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Supplementary Tables 2, 3</ref>, and 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post Hoc Analyses</head><p>Considering the novel area of research (i.e., examining moderators with help-seeking intentions) and to gain a more complete understanding of the nature of the moderating variables, we conducted post hoc exploratory analyses. By evaluating the latent interaction effects independently across three structural models to see if evidence of moderation would emerge (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Supplementary Figures 3, 4</ref>, &amp; 5), this helped us examine whether the interaction terms were potentially competing for common variance in help-seeking intentions, which would increase the possibility of multicollinearity and obscure the findings.</p><p>When we examined the latent moderators independently in separate models, the association between psychological distress and help-seeking intentions was significantly moderated by structural barriers (b = .27, SE = .06, p &lt; .01), help-seeking attitudes (b = -.24, SE = .07, p &lt; .01), and help-seeking stigma (b = .17, SE = .07, p &lt; .05). Probing the three significant interaction terms revealed the following results. Psychological distress was significantly positively associated with help-seeking intentions when scores on structural barriers were one standard deviation (SD) above the mean (b = 1.07, SE = .29, p &lt; .01) and at the mean (b = .67, SE = .23, p &lt; .01), but not when scores on structural barriers were one SD below the mean (b = .28, SE = .23, p = .21). Psychological distress was significantly positively associated with helpseeking intentions when scores on help-seeking attitudes were one SD below the mean (b = 1.0, SE = .22, p &lt; .01) and at the mean (b = .67, SE = .22, p &lt; .01), but not when scores on help-seeking attitudes were one SD above the mean (b = .34, SE = .23, p = .14). Lastly, psychological distress was significantly positively associated with help-seeking intentions when scores on helpseeking stigma were one SD above the mean (b = .87, SE = .22, p &lt; .01) and at the mean (b = .63, SE = .20, p &lt; .01), but not when scores on help-seeking stigma were one SD below the mean (b = .38, SE = .22, p = .08). Examination of regions of significance revealed that psychological distress was significantly positively associated with health-seeking intentions at values higher than .61 SD below the mean for structural barriers, lower than .74 SD above the mean for helpseeking attitudes, and higher than .85 SD below the mean for help-seeking stigma. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> for the plots of all three interactions. When reviewing these interactions, it is important to consider them in the context of the cutoffs of the distress scale. 5 Specifically, the mean response in this sample was of someone who likely has a moderate mental health disorder and those one standard deviation was of someone who likely has a significant mental health disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Andrews &amp; Slade, 2001</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The purpose of this study was to better understand help-seeking and unmet mental health needs among sexual minorities. We examined this by testing a help-seeking model, assessing latent moderators, and investigating reasons for unmet mental health needs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical examination of a mental health help-seeking model that includes structural barriers (e.g., cost, time, knowing how to access services). Moreover, this study represents the first examination of help-seeking among sexual minorities that accounts for variables traditionally included in previous help-seeking models (e.g., social support, selfconcealment, help-seeking stigma) and the first to include perceived prejudice and affirmativeness of mental health professionals as part of help-seeking attitudes. The model exhibited acceptable fit and accounted for nearly half of the variance in intentions to seek out mental health care. Similar to previous research and in support of our hypotheses, higher helpseeking intentions significantly related to lower structural barriers, higher social support, and more positive help-seeking attitudes. In relation to traditional help-seeking factors, structural barriers were the strongest predictor of sexual minorities' help-seeking intentions. These findings support the structural vulnerability framework that emphasizes the influence of sociocultural factors on impeding access to health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bourgois et al., 2017)</ref>. These findings also align with previous qualitative research with sexual minorities that help-seeking intentions were related to higher social support <ref type="bibr">(MacKay et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">McNair &amp; Bush, 2016)</ref> and more positive helpseeking attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Spengler and AEgisdóttir, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>This study found cultural factors inform help-seeking attitudes and intentions. Sexual minorities' help-seeking intentions were positively related to help-seeking attitudes, which we conceptualized considering participants' perception of mental health professionals as prejudicial and affirmative toward sexual minorities. Bivariate correlations found all three variables significantly correlated with help-seeking intentions. These findings complement research that shows sexual minorities' perception of mental health professionals influence whether they delay or receive mental health care at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barefoot et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Romanelli &amp; Hudson, 2017)</ref>. Because sexual minorities are more than just sexual minorities, all of these dynamics may intersect with other systems of inequality (e.g., racism, sexism) that may likewise inform how they experience these institutions and seek help from varied intersectional standpoints <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bowleg, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Contrary to our hypothesis and previous research, help-seeking stigma was positively associated with help-seeking intentions. Additionally, the latent moderator illustrated help-seeking intentions increased as individuals reported more distress only for those high in helpseeking stigma. These findings are contrary to previous qualitative research that found sexual minorities delayed or impeded seeking out mental health care due to a fear of increased stigma or judgment by their support system <ref type="bibr">(MacKay et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">McNair &amp; Bush, 2016)</ref>. In the face of stigma, the findings from this study suggest sexual minorities may cultivate resilience due to experiences of (multiple) minority stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Vogel et al., 2011)</ref>. These findings are similar to the results of a previous help-seeking model with sexual minorities that found help-seeking intentions were related to more negative perception of one's sexual minority identity, which included internalized homonegativity, a difficult process of coming out, and wondering about acceptance by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Spengler and AEgisdóttir, 2015)</ref>. These findings underline how imperative it is that clinicians are prepared to work with clients who are accustomed to managing stigma from others due to oppressive circumstances. Previous research suggests public help-seeking stigma does not always show a link to intentions as this relationship is more often mediated by self-stigma (i.e., the internalization of public stigma applied to oneself; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Lannin et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, in addition to replicating these results with public stigma, future research is needed to understand how internalized stigma about help-seeking may influence sexual minorities' help.</p><p>Similar to previous research, the correlation between psychological distress and helpseeking intentions was non-significant, although the nuance of this relationship was illuminated in the model when accounting for other variables via latent moderation. None of the latent moderators of psychological distress with help-seeking attitudes, help-seeking stigma, and structural barriers significantly predicted help-seeking intentions when included simultaneously.</p><p>As these were exploratory analyses, we conducted post hoc analyses examining the latent moderators independently in separate models that revealed significant interactions.</p><p>Collectively, the interactions illuminated a pattern of reactive, rather than proactive, mental health care among the most vulnerable participants. As opposed to seeking care at the emergence of distress, these participants were willing to pursue mental health care only when they were experiencing significant distress. Specifically, these moderators illustrated participants with high structural barriers and negative help-seeking attitudes (i.e., perceived mental health professionals as prejudiced and non-affirmative) were only as likely to intend to seek mental health care as their counterparts when they were likely experiencing a severe mental health disorder. Alternatively, the help-seeking intentions of individuals with low structural barriers, positive help-seeking attitudes, and low help-seeking stigma were consistent regardless of their level of psychological distress. This pattern of reactive mental health care has significant clinical implications as symptom severity is the strongest indicator of prognosis. Individuals only being willing to seek out help when they are in dire need, in turn, increases the length of needed treatment and amount of required resources when individuals in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Buckman et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Robinson et al., 2020)</ref>. Especially considering the non-significant initial latent moderator analyses, future work is needed to replicate these findings and explore other factors (e.g., selfconcealment, social support, perceived prejudice and affirmativeness as independent factors) that may interact with psychological distress to predict when sexual minorities and other populations are willing to seek out treatment.</p><p>Nearly 40% of respondents reported an unmet mental health need in the last 12 months. These findings are substantially higher than the rate reported by SAMHSA's (2019) national sample (23.8%), which neglected to assess respondents' sexual identities. Three of the four most endorsed reasons for an unmet mental health need were structural barriers (e.g., could not afford cost, health insurance did not cover, health insurance did not pay enough). Along with the finding that structural barriers are the strongest predictor of sexual minorities' help-seeking, this showcases how structural vulnerability impedes sexual minorities who need or want mental health care from receiving them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>The integral role structural barriers play in help-seeking intentions and unmet mental health needs should inform how counseling psychologists and allied social scientists critically evaluate health differences and the treatment gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kazdin, 2017)</ref>. Previous help-seeking models that overlooked the influence of structural barriers assume 100% of volitional control, decisionmaking, and responsibility for mental health is on rational, individual agents. Instead of the traditional help-seeking paradigm that focuses on individual attitudes as the main contributor to future behavior (cf. Sugarman &amp; Thrift, 2017), we encourage counseling and other psychologists to move toward an interdisciplinary approach to inform the help-seeking process from more of a structural and cultural lens, including public health (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Levesque et al., 2013)</ref>, medical sociology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Pescosolido, 2006)</ref>, and medical anthropology <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bourgois et al., 2017)</ref>. Given the confluence of our results illustrating the importance of structural barriers in the help-seeking process, future research with other populations should likewise consider the potential impact of structural vulnerability on other groups' help-seeking practices.</p><p>Moreover, sexual minorities often do not get their needs entirely met in mental health care, as 68.3% of participants who received mental health care in the last year reported an unmet mental health need. Future training and outreach efforts should focus on promoting culturallyaffirmative psychologists and reframing psychotherapy and counseling as approachable and nondiscriminatory <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Levesque et al., 2013)</ref>. These efforts should also recognize the meaningful reasons individuals may be reluctant to pursue psychotherapy, including microaggressions that may happen within therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Spengler et al., 2016)</ref> and the harm done by psychology and psychologists in enacting and exacerbating heterosexism <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hammack et al., 2013)</ref>, among other intersecting forms of oppression (American Psychological Association, 2021).</p><p>Counseling psychologists are uniquely positioned to organize with community partners and other professionals to enact social change <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(DeBlaere et al., 2019)</ref>. Much like the paradigm of medical healthcare is moving from a reactive approach to a proactive approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Waldman &amp; Terzic, 2019)</ref>, proactive structural interventions may interrupt the pattern of reactive mental health care observed in this study. Outreach efforts could include advocacy for structural vulnerability assessments in healthcare settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bourgois et al., 2017)</ref>, interventions about how to look for and evaluate mental health care options, consideration of insurance parity, and using community-based participatory efforts with sexual minorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Fine et al., 2021)</ref>. Moreover, community-based interventions could foster increased social support, which also was a significant predictor of help-seeking intentions. Conceptualizing individuals' presenting issues and symptomology (i.e., the "downstream" implications) within the wider-level sociocultural and historical contexts (i.e., the "upstream" causes) would allow for a more equitable and efficient mental health care system <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Metzl &amp; Hansen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Warnecke et al., 2008)</ref>. For example, the community mental health movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Humphreys &amp; Rappaport, 1993)</ref>, which gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s before federal funding was diverted to individually-based treatments and research, is a framework for promoting structurally sensitive mental health care equity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>These findings may not be generalizable to the population of sexual minorities. The entire sample was over 18, lived in the United States, and had Internet access; most of the sample lived in an urban area, completed higher education, and identified as White, man, and bisexual.</p><p>Additionally, more research on help-seeking is needed with gender-diverse (e.g., transgender, non-binary) individuals. Although sexual minority identities are often conflated with genderdiverse identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hyde et al., 2019)</ref>, gender-diverse people encounter unique structural barriers to help-seeking (e.g., gatekeeping hormone replacement therapy, transphobia and cisgenderism;</p><p>Ashley, 2019) warranting separate empirical inquiry (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hunt, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Despite having the number of latent variables and similar sample size as other helpseeking models <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Vogel et al., 2005)</ref>, our observed acceptable model fit may be impacted by limited power due to lower than expected loadings. This misspecification could also be due to lower than expected factor loadings for some of the observed variables (e.g., structural barriers items, help-seeking attitudes scales). Future studies could work on model and scale refinement, including using separate latent constructs for general help-seeking attitudes and perceived prejudiced/affirmativeness of mental health professionals. Our structural barriers measure conflated the theory of planned behavior constructs of perceived (i.e., self-efficacy) and actual behavioral control (i.e., controllability), which is common in the application of this theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cheung &amp; Chan, 2000)</ref>. Moreover, the 3-item scale we used for structural barriers was limited in content validity as it did not encapsulate all structural barriers that accounted for unmet mental health needs (e.g., health insurance, transportation). Future help-seeking studies include a more comprehensive structural barriers measure, including separately measuring self-efficacy (e.g., knowing how to access services, mental health literacy; Jorm, 2012) and controllability (e.g., cost, time, transportation) to better understand their unique and related contributions. Given our decision to include affirmativeness, prejudice, and attitudes in one latent variable, it remains unclear the unique relationship between these variables and help-seeking intentions. The significant correlations of all three variables with help-seeking intentions suggest it would be a worthy pursuit for future help-seeking models to use separate latent factors for each construct for sexual minorities and other marginalized populations.</p><p>As we examined participants in one group through a variable-centered approach, structural equation modeling inherently cannot model help-seeking for multiply marginalized populations without reducing demographic variables to covariates <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Else-Quest &amp; Hyde, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers should consider statistical techniques that incorporate social structures, such as hierarchical linear modeling, or an intersectional approach using person-centered statistics, such as latent profile analysis. These could better account for the experience of multiply marginalized sexual minorities without reducing salient dimensions of difference into overly simplistic comparisons while also maintaining statistical rigor <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Grzanka, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>We also made slight modifications to three previously validated measures (i.e., structural barriers, perceived counselor sexual prejudice, perceived counselor sexual affirmation). It is important to replicate this approach to ensure the psychometric properties found in the current sample hold across other samples and contexts. While using help-seeking intentions as a proxy for actual behavior is common practice in this domain, our cross-sectional, self-reported data limit conclusions that can be drawn regarding actual behavior. We operationalized help-seeking intentions as only related to one particular type of help. Given that individuals evaluate alternative options when considering a behavior (Azjen, 2020), future help-seeking models should also account for intentions to engage in alternative mental health care systems, including friends, family, faith leaders, and teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Pescosolido, 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This study's findings underscore the notion that help-seeking is a dynamic, multifaceted, and interrelated process best understood in structural relief <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Grzanka, 2020)</ref>. Foregrounding attention to structural vulnerability in the study of mental health care equity can help to shift our collective focus beyond the individual and onto the systemic contexts that shape clinical encounters <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Metzl &amp; Hansen, 2014)</ref>. In this sense, social justice advocacy, clinical practice, and research should be conceptualized as mutually reinforcing and operating in concert with one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Miles &amp; Fassinger, 2021)</ref>. Simply put, help-seeking does not occur in a vacuum void of sociocultural and historical factors; rather, individuals' interactions with mental health care systems and professionals are best conceptualized as intimately tied to the context of these social systems.      </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>032 -.165** -.044 -.199** -.140** Note.
