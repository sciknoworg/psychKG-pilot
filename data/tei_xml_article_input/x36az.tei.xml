<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mixed-Effects Regression Weights for Advice Taking and Related Phenomena of Information Sampling and Utilization</head><p>New information technologies and social networks make a wide variety of opinions and advice easily accessible across different contexts. Therefore, assessing how much people are affected by informational influences is gaining importance in the social sciences.</p><p>However, it is an ongoing debate how much people make use of others' opinions, and a plethora of different approaches exists to investigate belief updating and judgment formation in light of external evidence. In this paper, we highlight critical aspects of common variants of the established modeling approach that is based on calculating descriptive weighting indices. More importantly, as a solution to the most crucial limitations of the state-of-the-art, we propose to alternatively implement a temporally consistent mixed-effects regression (MER) 1 model of belief updating.</p><p>Psychologists, economists, and other social scientists often rely on experiments to generate insights with respect to peoples' advice taking behavior. In the dyadic judge-advisor system (JAS) as introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Sniezek and Buckley (1995)</ref>, the participant is asked to judge stimulus items with the help of passively presented or actively sampled pieces of external information from one or multiple advisors. In most experiments, participants initially judge the same items free of any external influences. It is assumed that the shift (from initial to final) judgment indicates the amount of advice which was taken by that person. Specifically, a discrepancy between initial beliefs and advice may indicate some degree of initial bias or error, both of which can be compensated for by integrating external evidence into one's initial judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Deutsch &amp; Gerard, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Soll &amp; Larrick, 2009)</ref>. As a classic instance of capitalizing on the wisdom of crowds (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Galton, 1907;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Surowiecki, 2005)</ref>, the relative size of judgmental shift is accordingly called weight of advice (WOA) and commonly of central interest to most advice taking researchers.</p><p>In anchoring paradigms, external pieces of information are also integrated into one's judgment, for instance, by insufficiently adjusting away from unrelated numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Furnham &amp; Boo, 2011</ref>, for a review).</p><p>In contrast to WOA, the integration of information is referred to as "anchoring effect" because it is considered inappropriate. The same reasoning about (faulty) integration of external evidence applies to "hindsight biases" in memory research <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Hoffrage et al., 2000)</ref>, especially in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hawkins and Hastie's (1990)</ref> sense of systematically biased re-judgments in light of outcome knowledge. Essentially, there is no consensus in the literature on how to measure advice weighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bonaccio &amp; Dalal, 2006)</ref> or anchoring effects (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Turner &amp; Schley, 2016, Footnote 3;</ref><ref type="bibr">but also Jacowitz &amp; Kahneman, 1995)</ref>. We will focus on advice taking here but argue that most claims, formulas, and findings can be transferred to other cognitive phenomena with similar structure such as anchoring, hindsight, or persuasion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bochner &amp; Insko, 1966</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Yaniv, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Yaniv &amp; Milyavsky, 2007)</ref> due to conceptual and paradigmatic similarities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Harvey and Fischer's (1997)</ref> advice taking index, as formally introduced below, has dominated the recent literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Hütter &amp; Ache, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Schultze et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Soll &amp; Larrick, 2009</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bailey et al., 2022</ref>, for a review). In economics, random variables are divided into "endogenous" and "exogenous," with the former variables being determined by the model, such as modeling the process of updating judgments in response to receiving advice, and the latter variables being measured or manipulated <ref type="bibr">(Chiang, 1984, p. 8;</ref><ref type="bibr">Varian, 1992, p. 202)</ref>. Accordingly, the advice taking index reflects how much people may have adjusted their final judgments, that is, the endogenous components, in units of the distance between the advice and their independent initial judgments, which constitute the two exogenous components. Although initial judgments also emerge from an "internal sampling" and judgment process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Fiedler &amp; Kutzner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Henriksson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Stewart et al., 2006)</ref>, they are treated as exogenous variables because they represent the outcome of a self-contained process during the advice taking phase.</p><p>We suspect that it is the simplicity of this established ratio-of-differences <ref type="bibr">(ROD)</ref> formula paired with its capability to capture inter-and intra-individual differences that is responsible for its popularity. Capturing individual differences refers to explicitly accounting for variability between and within individuals. That is, to compute separate advice taking scores that describe participants' behavior on each experimental trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baayen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bauer, 2011)</ref>. Consequently, such metrics allow the measurement of idiosyncrasies of persons, items, and other clustering variables (e.g., multiple advisors) in specific situations (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Kämmer et al., 2023)</ref>. On the downside, however, and in contrast to the alternative modeling approach proposed here, they also require or impose critical paradigmatic peculiarities. For instance, the ROD-WOA cannot be used to measure informational influences if participants' prior beliefs are unobserved or unobservable (see the Second Empirical Application). Also, if participants are granted access to multiple pieces of advice, the ROD-WOA is limited in explanatory power, as demonstrated in the Third Empirical Application.</p><p>The same reasoning about popularity due to simplicity and capturing idiosyncrasies applies to other established criteria from traditional ROD-type modeling, such as the "anchoring index" of <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Jacowitz and Kahneman (1995)</ref> or the "hindsight bias index" of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Hell et al. (1988)</ref>. Crucially, however, intermixing endogenous and exogenous components to construct ROD scores implies a number of conceptual and measurement problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Cronbach, 1943;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Cronbach &amp; Furby, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Edwards, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Firebaugh &amp; Gibbs, 1985)</ref>. For instance, ratios are often not normally distributed (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Soll &amp; Larrick, 2009</ref>, for the characteristic W-shaped distribution of ROD-WOA) and imply a linear relationship between the numerator and denominator (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Schultze et al., 2015</ref>, for evidence of a linear relationship between absolute judgment shift and advice distance). Moreover, difference scores suffer from outcome ambiguity when the separate effects of independent variables on each score component are reduced to a single coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Edwards, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Regression-based methods, by contrast, are consistent with the recommendation to use endogenous components as criteria in an analysis that controls for exogenous components <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Cronbach &amp; Furby, 1970</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Allison, 1990)</ref>. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, some lines of research indeed assessed advice utilization by regressing final judgments simultaneously on all sources of information-advice in Brunswikian advice taking research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brehmer &amp; Hagafors, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Harvey et al., 2000)</ref> plus independent initial judgments in the forecasting literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Lim &amp; O'Connor, 1995)</ref>. The major limitation of regression-based approaches as available back then was their aggregate data analysis scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bonaccio &amp; Dalal, 2006)</ref>. MER modeling instead allows to simultaneously account for participant and stimulus item variation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baayen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002)</ref>. Thus, the major limitation of regression-based analyses according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bonaccio and Dalal (2006)</ref> can be resolved by explicit consideration of the multilevel structure that most experimental advice taking data inherits from repeated measures designs. In other words, as demonstrated formally and for several empirical examples below, the crossing of participants and stimulus items allows inferences about each individual trial of an advice taking experiment even for MER modeling of the data. Additional advantages of regression analyses include, but are not limited to, the easy handling of unbalanced data, missing observations, or arbitrary types of predictor and response variables, where the latter is the main reason to not distinguish between discrete choice and quantitative judgment here.</p><p>Our goal is to extend the toolbox for quantifying advice weighting by proposing a method which is technically more advanced than state-of-the-art modeling as assessed by the above-mentioned criteria. We will show that, by accounting for the (temporal) dependency of final judgments on exogenous sources of information, our approach will enable researchers to more flexibly measure the psychological construct "advice taking." Nevertheless, the proposed method is not restricted to situations of people taking advice but can also be applied to other information acquisition phenomena such as anchoring effects, hindsight bias, or attitude change. First, we will formally establish the intended data analysis approach and elaborate on its most important technical and statistical subtleties. Then, corresponding insights into established empirical phenomena will be provided before the article concludes with a critical discussion of limitations and merits of the proposed modeling approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling of Informational Influences in Advice Taking</head><p>It is common practice in advice taking research to rely on a formula involving ratios of differences of judgments to quantify advice weighting. The following formula as introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Harvey and Fischer (1997)</ref> measures how strongly people adapt their initial judgment toward advice:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ω A,ij = F ij − I ij A ij − I ij<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where I ij and F ij indicate the initial and final judgments of a participant i = 1, . . . , N about a given stimulus item j = 1, . . . , M , and A ij the advice received. This formula identifies the relative amount of judgmental shift from initial to final estimation that can be attributed to a single piece of new evidence which was passively encountered or actively acquired.</p><p>Thus, ω A,ij = 1 indicates complete adoption, ω A,ij = 0 entire disregard, and everything in between corresponding weighting of advice with ω A,ij ∈ (0, 1). 2 Exhibiting conceptual resemblance to <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Jacowitz and Kahneman's (1995)</ref> anchoring indices, it accordingly provides a "readily interpretable" but merely descriptive measure of advice weighting.</p><p>By definition, the traditional index implies a cognitive processing scheme according to which the final judgment is inherently defined as a weighted linear combination of all available sources of information-external (i.e., advice A ij ) and internal (i.e., initial</p><p>2 Theoretically, ω A,ij / ∈ [0, 1] is possible if participants shift in the opposite direction than advised.</p><p>Accordingly, <ref type="bibr">Önkal et al. (2009)</ref> interpret Equation 1 merely as a "positional measure" indicating the location of final judgments relative to advice and initial judgments (i.e., closer to one or the other).</p><p>estimates I ij ). This becomes apparent by rearranging the ROD formula as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F ij = I ij + ω A,ij (A ij − I ij ) (2) = ω A,ij A ij + (1 − ω A,ij )I ij ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>that is, to account for the endogenous formation of final judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Hoffman, 1960)</ref>.</p><p>Mathematically, "choosing" the advisor (self) is simply a special case of "averaging" where the weight has an extreme value of one (zero; <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Soll &amp; Larrick, 2009)</ref>. In that sense, averaging is just another term for a specific type of cognitive processing for which the weighting policy amounts to (adaptively) compromise between two (or more; see below)</p><p>exogenous sources of information. Notably, there is ample normative (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Clemen, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Mannes, 2009)</ref> and empirical (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Anderson, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Budescu &amp; Rantilla, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Slovic &amp; Lichtenstein, 1971</ref>) evidence for simple averaging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Mixed-Effects Regression Model of Advice Taking</head><p>By accounting for overall error ε ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) in Equation 2, a regression-based correspondence of <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Harvey and Fischer's (1997)</ref> ROD-WOA can be derived from the resulting regression model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F ij = ω A,ij A ij + (1 − ω A,ij )I ij + ε ij ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where the coefficient (or often "weight") ω A,ij measures the effect of advice on final judgment. Ordinary estimation techniques, however, do not enable estimating separate weights of individual pieces of adviceω A,ij or the self 1 −ω A,ij , respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bauer, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In repeated measures designs, multiple observations are usually available per participant and item. Therefore, the residuals of the coefficient can be disentangled from the overall error term ε such that individual regression coefficients of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ω A,ij = β A + α S A,i + α T A,j ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>become admissible <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baayen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bates et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Brown et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002)</ref>. In this equation, β A denotes the fixed effect of advice on the final judgment and α q ∼ N 0, τ 2 A,q the random effects of participants S and stimulus items T , respectively, with τ 2 A,S and τ 2 A,T mutually independent. In summary, the multilevel regression model specified in Equations 4 and 5 essentially consists of a regression of participants' observed judgments as the dependent and independent variables at level 1, henceforth the "judgment level," and a regression of these coefficients as the latent or unobserved dependent variable at level 2, henceforth the "weighting level." Consequently, the proposed MER-WOA simply corresponds to the estimated regression coefficients. 3</p><p>Formally, the proposed model assumes that participants and items, "although unique in many ways, have certain common characteristics that may be accounted for in the modeling process" <ref type="bibr">(Afshartous &amp; de Leeuw, 2005, p. 111)</ref>. For instance, different values of α S A,i capture that people differ in their selection of advice taking strategies from a disjunctive set of strategies including full adoption, disregard, and equal weighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Soll &amp; Larrick, 2009)</ref>. However, idiosyncratic characteristics of stimulus items may also influence participants' strategy selection or weighting. Specifically, participants may be more knowledgeable about judging a particular item j due to their experience with the underlying judgment domain, and thus need or accept less help, resulting in a relatively small value of α T A,j for that item. For instance, in Experiment 2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ache et al. (2020)</ref>, it was easier for participants to estimate the airline distance between native than non-native city pairs. Indeed, task difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Gino &amp; Moore, 2007)</ref> and level of expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Harvey &amp; Fischer, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Sniezek &amp; Buckley, 1995)</ref> were found to reliably affect advice weighting in respectively opposite directions.</p><p>3 Formally, the multilevel regression-based estimator of WOA is defined asω A,ij =β A +α S A,i +α T A,j , which denotes (empirical Bayes) estimated mixed-effects regression coefficients of the judgment model. Accordingly, participant-and item-wise idiosyncrasies of mean advice weightingβ A are captured by the conditional modes of the random effectsα S A,i andα T A,j . As such, the individual weight estimatesω A,ij are treated as observed draws of random variables at the respective grouping level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First Empirical Application</head><p>Level of expertise was also found to matter in research on algorithmic advice taking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Logg et al. (2019)</ref> provide initial evidence for "algorithm appreciation," that is, people integrating algorithmic advice more than quantitatively equivalent advice provided by human advisors. In contrast, previous findings report a reluctance to integrate advice from (erroneous) algorithms as compared to (erroneous) humans, which was accordingly termed "algorithm aversion" <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Dietvorst et al., 2015</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Burton et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Jussupow et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mahmud et al., 2022, for reviews)</ref>. In order to reassess the existence of algorithm appreciation by means of the proposed modeling procedure, we conducted a reanalysis of data from Experiment 4 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Logg et al. (2019)</ref>. Our aim is to demonstrate the approach in a rather standard, simplistic JAS situation before highlighting more flexible and powerful modeling solutions in the remaining sections. 4 A significance level of 5% was used throughout for statistical testing in all three empirical applications. Furthermore, reproducible analysis scripts and supplementary material containing plots of model diagnostics are publicly available online (https://osf.io/6gmhs).</p><p>In Experiment 4, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Logg et al. (2019)</ref> investigated the influence of judges' expertise (laypersons recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk vs. national security experts) and the source of advice (human vs. algorithm) on advice weighting. All groups received quantitatively equivalent advice for four different quantitative judgment/forecasting tasks related to weight estimation, business events, and geopolitical incidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Mellers et al., 2014</ref>). Consistent with their other experiments, participants in this study placed more weight on algorithmic than human advice indicating algorithm appreciation. However, the national security experts discounted all advice sources more strongly than lay participants. This result is consistent with the findings mentioned above that experts across various fields tend to be more resistant to advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Harvey &amp; Fischer, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Sniezek &amp; Buckley, 1995)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>For reanalyzing the data of Experiment 4 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Logg et al.

As in the original study, the set of additional explanatory variables included participants' familiarity with the word algorithm F am i , measured on a 7-point scale (1 = not at all certain to 7 = extremely certain), as z-standardized control variable at the weighting level. The variable Exp i ∈ {−0.5, 0.5} denotes the expertise of judge i, contrast-coded with −0.5 for laypersons and 0.5 for national security experts, and</p><p>Src i ∈ {−0.5, 0.5} corresponds to the source condition, also contrast-coded with −0.5 for human advice and 0.5 for algorithmic advice. Contrast-coding of the treatment variables and z-standardization of the control variable were implemented for the random intercepts α S A,i and α T A,j at the weighting level, which correspond to random slopes at the judgment level (see below), to capture participant-and item-wise random deviations in both experimental conditions and for an average level of familiarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Judd et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The model equation as fitted in the statistical software, in our case R Version 4.3.1 (R Core Team, 2023) using the packages lme4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref> and lmerTest <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Kuznetsova et al., 2017)</ref>, can be reconstructed by plugging Equation 7 into Equation 6:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F ij = I ij + β A (A ij − I ij ) + α S A,i (A ij − I ij ) + α T A,j (A ij − I ij ) + β A×F am F am i (A ij − I ij ) + β A×Exp Exp i (A ij − I ij ) + β A×Src Src i (A ij − I ij ) + β A×Exp×Src Exp i Src i (A ij − I ij ) + ε ij (8)</formula><p>Accordingly, we first computed the advice distance as a separate data column and then used these values as a predictor at the judgment level of the model. Moreover, the judgment-level intercept was fixed to zero and the initial judgments I ij were specified as offsets to estimate this sum-to-one constrained model version. The integrated model equation shows that the fixed control and treatment effects at the weighting level are simply modeled as interaction terms at the judgment level of the proposed model. More generally, some factors are included only as interaction terms with no main effects at the judgment level, which also applies to all subsequent reanalyses that include additional explanatory variables with effects only at the weighting level. Therefore, for the sake of brevity, the models are no longer written out explicitly in the following.</p></div>

In order to test our hypothesis, we fitted two additional multilevel regression models with dummy-coded expertise (i.e., adding 0.5 to Exp i ) and reverse dummy-coded expertise (i.e., subtracting 0.5 from Exp i and multiplying the result by -1), respectively. 5 Overall, laypersons indeed weighted algorithmic advice significantly more strongly than human advice (see Appendix, <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In general, contrast-coding should be preferred over dummy-coding for the estimation of MER-WOA with crossed clustering instances <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Judd et al., 2017</ref>, Footnote 1). The reason is that dummy-coding implies that any random effects-in our case these are the participant-and item-wise random intercepts at the weighting level-capture randomness only for the reference level, that is, the group coded as zero according to the corresponding explanatory variable. Therefore, we fit two models with the two expertise samples as the respective reference groups. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref>). The positive coefficient estimateβ A×Src in this model with dummy-coded expertise provided evidence for algorithm appreciation by laypersons. Descriptively, the same effect even pointed in the opposite direction for experts as indicated by the negative coefficient estimateβ A×Src in the reverse dummy-coded expertise model (see Appendix, <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table A2</ref>). In essence, the proposed modeling approach enabled us to extend the original findings by providing evidence that experts did not discriminate between the sources of advice as much as laypersons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In summary, our results using the proposed analysis method are not entirely consistent with the original findings reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Logg et al. (2019)</ref>, and extend them in crucial aspects. Based on the original analysis of variance of ROD-WOA, there was significant evidence for algorithm appreciation. In our reanalysis, the difference between the average weighting of quantitatively equivalent algorithmic and human advice is significant only for one-tailed testing of treatment effects on MER-WOA. However, both modeling approaches consistently provide evidence that experts weight advice significantly less strongly than laypersons.</p><p>So far, we have primarily demonstrated how it is possible to account for endogenous judgment formation and individual differences in advice taking using the proposed multilevel modeling framework. A more crucial question is why the results of our reanalysis differ from the original analysis with respect to the two main findings. Whereas the p-value for the main effect of the source of advice is substantially smaller here than in the original analysis, the opposite is true for the p-value of the interaction between source and expertise. In fact, the significant p-value of the interaction term being substantially lower in the reanalysis as compared to the original analysis suggests critical qualitative differences between expert and lay augmented judgment and decision-making. From the model with reverse dummy-coded expertise, we can infer that laypersons do indeed weight algorithmic advice significantly more than human advice, whereas experts do not discriminate as strongly between the two sources of advice. These observations suggest that modeling the data from more classical JAS experiments in a framework that reflects the endogenous judgment process provides stronger evidence for the focal effect predicted by <ref type="bibr">Logg et al. (2019, Experiment 4)</ref>.</p><p>There are many methodological and theoretical considerations that underlie the practical relevance of the proposed modeling approach. For instance, sum-to-one constrained weighted averaging at the judgment level in Equation 4 as well as linearity at the weighting level in Equation 5 eventually appear to be overly restrictive. Nevertheless, both constraints were also implemented in the MER-based reanalysis to promote comparability with the original ROD-based analyses of <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Logg et al. (2019)</ref>. Therefore, in the following sections, we will discuss two of the most valuable extensions of the multilevel modeling framework, which resolve at least some of these restrictions. Ultimately, we aim to illustrate why it is worth considering more flexible methods for analyzing advice taking behavior by providing additional empirical examples that convincingly demonstrate the practical applicability and substantiate the merits of the proposed modeling framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beyond Relativity to the Self</head><p>Harvey and Fischer (1997) called it "perverse" advice taking when a final judgment does not lie strictly in between the initial judgment and the advice.

Essentially, the same observation can even be interpreted in opposite ways depending on the pre-processing applied. For instance, consider a shift from 100 to 90 when the advice was 110. This behavior would be truncated from the data and classified as an outlier, considered as non-weighting according to the winsorizing approach, or full weighting as measured by the ratio-of-absolute-differences formula. Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bonaccio and Dalal (2006)</ref> recommended analyzing the data twice, with and without "problematic" WOA values, to ensure invariant conclusions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Himmelstein &amp; Budescu, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Hütter &amp; Ache, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Even if the results do not change, the central dependent variable is incomparable across advice taking studies applying different data pre-processing techniques, which thus renders advice taking research prone to replicability issues.

In contrast, more technical reasons include erroneous judgment responses, such as missing a trailing 0 and entering 100 instead of 1000, but also revisions based on the recognition of such errors and other inconsistencies in initial judgments, regardless of the advice received.</p><p>Additionally, cross-cultural differences may induce systematic variations in advice taking, for instance, the increased willingness to fully accept advice in collectivistic societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Mercier et al., 2012)</ref>. Whereas such systematic effects can be taken into account by including observed sample characteristics as additional predictors in the model, extreme distortions due to inattentiveness or technical errors can be minimized by excluding judgment outliers from the data. In general, however, we argue against (arbitrary) pre-processing or the exclusion of "odd" observations in terms of weighting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unconstrained Regression Modeling</head><p>The regression-based approach is much more flexible regarding the definition and interpretation of weights. Instead of restrictively conceptualizing advice taking as the weight of the advisor relative to the self, the sum-to-one constraint can be abandoned in favor of separate weights for each individual source of information. The system of Equations 4 and 5 can be rewritten as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">F ij = ω A,ij A ij + ω I,ij I ij + ε ij (10) ω p,ij = β p + α S p,i + α T p,j ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where p ∈ {A, I} indicates the weights of advice and the self with fixed effects β p and</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">random effects α q ∼ N ∥p∥ (0 2×1 , Σ q ), q ∈ {S, T },</formula><p>where 0 2×1 is the zero vector and the covariance matrices Σ q of participants q = S and stimulus items q = T being mutually independent by assumption.</p><p>The coefficient regressions of Equation 11 capture the partial effects (i.e., the value of the respective other source of information held constant) of advice ω A,ij and initial judgment ω I,ij on final judgment, respectively. Thus, the approach still allows comparing the weight of advice to the weight of the initial judgment. Moreover, sum-to-one constraining can be restored as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ω A,ij =ω A,iĵ ω A,ij +ω I,ij<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Applying the divide-by-total principle post hoc (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Harvey et al., 2000)</ref>  First, more than the traditional two sources of information in the JAS are available. For instance, additional cues to expertise or accuracy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Budescu et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Mannes et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Soll &amp; Larrick, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Yaniv &amp; Kleinberger, 2000)</ref>, multiple advisors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brehmer &amp; Hagafors, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Harvey et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Hütter &amp; Ache, 2016</ref>; see also below), "automated advice" from algorithms additional to traditional human judgments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Logg et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Prahl &amp; van Swol, 2017)</ref>, and so on. Second, advice and initial judgments are non-orthogonal. For instance, multiple regression with partial effects would be more appropriate than traditional analysis approaches for experimentally manipulated advice distance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Rebholz &amp; Hütter, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Schultze et al., 2015)</ref>. Moreover, non-orthogonality is highly ecological as judges often anchor advisors by including their own judgments in their requests for advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Reif et al., 2022)</ref>. Third, no initial judgments are recorded (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brehmer &amp; Hagafors, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Harvey et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Mayer &amp; Heck, 2022)</ref>. In these situations, the ROD-calculus cannot be applied, which is the main focus of the following second empirical application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Second Empirical Application</head><p>A blind spot of advice taking research is informational influence without prior formulation of independent judgments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Essentially, separate weights for individual sources of information can be calculated by means of mixed-effects regression even when advice is the only source of information observed.

The coefficient ω A,ij now captures the partial effect of advice on the final judgment, the determinants of which are discussed below. Put differently, weighting was operationalized as the change in F in response to a unit change in A. 6 Accordingly, whereas ω A,ij = 0 indicates unresponsiveness or no advice taking as usual, the interpretation of ω A,ij = 1 is slightly different: The final judgment exactly keeping pace with changes in A does not necessarily imply the complete adoption of the advice, or in other words, maintaining a previous participants' judgment.</p><p>As usual, ω A,ij ∈ (0, 1) indicates less than full but more than no responsiveness or weighting, and ω A,ij / ∈ [0, 1] captures effects akin to pushing away from or being over-responsive to advice.</p><p>The potential temporal dynamics of informational influences are the most interesting comparison for advice taking in sequential chains. Whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Mayer and Heck (2022)</ref> found that the change probability decreased for later collaborations and that participants changed their judgments less in absolute terms relative to the true value, the partial effect estimates may tell a different story.

According to the distributions of trial-wise partial effects plotted separately for each chain position, non-weighting is almost exclusively restricted to initial or earlier interactions. In contrast, the variances of the distributions for later sequential collaborations seem to stabilize at a relatively lower level than observed for earlier interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Independent initial judgments are irrelevant from an accuracy perspective as applied in the original study. However, they are key to traditional investigations of informational influence by means of calculating ROD-based weighting indices. While the original study found that accuracy increased with the number of collaborations, the proposed regression-based approach shows that this was not due to changes in informational influence along the chains. This observation contradicts findings that advice of (seemingly objective) higher quality, that is, for later positions in the scenario at hand, is weighted relatively more strongly <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Yaniv &amp; Kleinberger, 2000)</ref>. 7 Accordingly, the new evidence suggests that the positive effect of advice quality on weighting may be driven by implementing a reference point for advice quality assessment in the traditional paradigm.</p><p>Specifically, the distance of the advice from the independent initial judgment that serves as the benchmark is considered informative of the quality of the advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Zaleskiewicz &amp; Gasiorowska, 2023</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Rebholz et al., 2023)</ref>. In contrast, this reference point was not available in the experiments of <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Mayer and Heck (2022)</ref>, which focused on the effectiveness of sequential collaborations.</p><p>7 Although judgments were not independent, increasing advice quality is probably a consequence of the increasing crowd wisdom with more contributors <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Hogarth, 1978</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Davis-Stober et al., 2014)</ref>. This might explain why advice non-taking and the larger variance in weighting were particularly prominent features of relatively early inter-individual interactions (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2)</ref>.</p><p>Although not recorded, this does not preclude the possibility that participants may have formed independent judgments. Accordingly, their unobserved priors being represented in the overall error term ε may eventually imply omitted variable bias for the model as specified in Equation 13 (see also <ref type="bibr">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002, Chapter 9;</ref><ref type="bibr">Snijders &amp; Bosker, 2012, Chapter 14)</ref>. The formation of independent judgments without explicit request, and thus the possibility for the experimenter to record them, would imply that the reported effect of advice on the final judgment includes the effects of such missing variables that are correlated with the advice presented. Indeed, the influence of advice on judgment turned out to be surprisingly strong, at least as compared to traditional advice taking research (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bailey et al., 2022</ref>, for a meta-analysis on ROD-WOA). Notably, this observation could only be made by estimating unrestricted MER-WOAs.</p><p>By including random intercepts per participant and item in Equation 13 (but see Footnote 6), one could additionally obtain estimates of latent initial judgments, or control for their potential formation, respectively. On the one hand, however, the simultaneous presentation of stimulus items and collaborators' judgments constituted a strong procedural barrier to the formation of independent beliefs in Mayer and Heck (2022).</p><p>Additionally, it implies mental offloading in the sense that participants' effort to think through their task is reduced because someone else has already done it for them, which positively affects advice taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Sniezek &amp; Buckley, 1995)</ref>. On the other hand, omitted variable bias can also not be ruled out completely if initial judgments were incorporated into the model. Some of the reasons for this have already been mentioned above, such as the lack of data on other potentially correlated cues, for instance, advisor expertise or advice quality. In general, the inevitable temporal distance between initial and final judgments in the original paradigm could itself cause discrepancies in participants' judgments. For instance, advisees have limited working memory capacity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Cowan, 2010)</ref>, or they may deliberately change their minds for other unobservable reasons, such as continuing the internal sampling process after having already submitted their initial judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Juslin &amp; Olsson, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Thurstone, 1927)</ref>.</p><p>The simultaneous confrontation with the judgment task together with the collaborators' judgment in <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Mayer and Heck (2022)</ref> also carries the risk of having triggered an anchoring and adjustment process in the classical sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Minson &amp; Mueller, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Schultze et al., 2019)</ref>. Consequently, our findings provide evidence for participants having (insufficiently) adjusted away from earlier anchors of lower quality as much as from later anchors of higher quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Schultze et al., 2017</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Röseler et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Schweickart et al., 2021)</ref>. In the traditional paradigm, however, independent initial judgments also constitute anchors in a sense, from which participants tend to adjust away as they consider the external evidence provided by their advisors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bonaccio &amp; Dalal, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Harvey &amp; Fischer, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Lim &amp; O'Connor, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The possibility of omitting the initial judgment phase thus reduces the risk of self-anchoring in the JAS. As informational influences can still be estimated using the proposed analytical method, MER-WOA also helps to avoid confounding anchoring effects by resolving this critical paradigmatic peculiarity of advice taking research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Separate Weights of Multiple Pieces of Advice</head><p>In extensions of the traditional paradigm to multiple advice taking, participants receive advice from more than one single advisor. In sampling approaches, for instance, participants have the opportunity to freely and sequentially sample additional advice. In two of three experiments of Hütter and Ache (2016), participants were allowed to sample up to 20 pieces of advice about the caloric content of dishes (e.g., fish pasta) before stating their final, possibly revised estimates. Due to the lack of more advanced techniques, the factually sequential taking of multiple pieces of advice was modeled as the taking of the mean of all advisory judgments within a trial:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ωĀ ,ij = F ij − I ij A ij − I ij<label>(15)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">whereĀ ij = 1 K ij K ij k=1</formula><p>A ijk , for k = 1, . . . , K ij sampled pieces of advice per trial ij.</p><p>PluggingĀ ij into Equation 15 and rearranging the result to account for endogenous judgment formation yields: indicates the total weight of advice which is defined as the sum of all single, equally weighted pieces of advice that are sampled on a specific trial. In contrast, there are many empirical examples that provide evidence against equal weighting.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">F ij = ωĀ ,ij K ij A ij1 + • • • + ωĀ ,ij K ij A ijK ij + (1 − ωĀ ,ij )I ij .<label>(16)</label></formula><p>Similar to the influence of sequentially sampled anchors, there may be ordering effects (e.g., primacy or recency) in the weighting of sequentially sampled advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hogarth &amp; Einhorn, 1992)</ref>. Moreover, due to differences in perceived expertise, advisors are often egocentrically discounted or, in other words, weighted less strongly than the self <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Harvey &amp; Fischer, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Yaniv &amp; Kleinberger, 2000)</ref>. The same likely holds true for perceived or actual differences in expertise among a set of distinct advisors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Brehmer &amp; Hagafors, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Harvey &amp; Harries, 2004)</ref>. Further counterexamples include the stronger egocentric discounting of relatively more as compared to less distant advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Yaniv &amp; Milyavsky, 2007)</ref>, and that judgment updating was found to be proportional to multiple judges' consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Schultze et al., 2022)</ref>. In general, presupposing equal weighting of multiple advisors conceals potentially differential weighting with respect to, for instance, expertise or sampling position. Essentially, the latter is not limited to applications that only involve sequential sampling of multiple pieces of advice. Instead, the notion of sampling positions also applies to scenarios in which attention is sequentially allocated to different pieces of advice presented simultaneously. Therefore, our criticism of assuming equal effects of multiple social influences also applies to the behavioral experiment of <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Molleman et al. (2020)</ref>, in which participants received advice from multiple peers simultaneously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiple (Advisors) Regression Modeling</head><p>In mixed-effects regressions, each sampled piece of advice may be construed as additional predictor on the level of trials. Treating the advice coefficients of Equation 16 as free parameters, separate weights of individual pieces of advice can be estimated by fitting the following model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">F ij = K ij k=1 ω A ijk A ijk +   1 − K ij k=1 ω A ijk   I ij + ε ij (17) ω A,ijk = β A k + α S A k ,i + α T A k ,j ,<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where ω A ijk denotes the sum-to-one constrained weights of the k-th piece of advice A k encountered or sampled during the ij-th trial. In the past, utilization of multiple pieces of advice per judgment was indeed assessed by regressing final judgments simultaneously on all sources of information (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brehmer &amp; Hagafors, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Harvey et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Lim &amp; O'Connor, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Multiple advice taking scenarios provide an additional substantive reason against commonly used outlier criteria for advice weighting measures. Imagine a participant in the experiment of <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Molleman et al. (2020)</ref> who made an initial judgment of 100 and received advice of 80, 120, and 140. In general, it would be rather surprising to observe a final judgment that is smaller than 100 given the consensus of the majority of judges that the true value should be equal to or larger than 100. For instance, equal weighting suggests a final judgment of 110. Essentially, looking at the weighting of the first piece of advice in isolation, we would conclude having observed a "perverse" judgmental shift in terms of a ROD-WOA of −0.50, because this hypothetical advisee has shifted away from the first piece of advice of 80. Accordingly, given a certain sequence of advice, parts of which may also be unobserved in the real world, negative weights (e.g., of advice on the opposite side of the majority consensus) indeed constitute quite reasonable behavior in terms of deliberate linear combinations of multiple judgments. This example once again nicely illustrates why it is so important to be able to estimate separate weights for each individual piece of advice, as will be demonstrated in the following third empirical application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Third Empirical Application</head><p>Molleman et al. <ref type="formula">2020</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Molleman et al., 2019)</ref>. After making independent initial judgments on visual sliders ranging from 1 to 150, participants were provided with their own and three advisors' judgments from a pretest with no social information to incorporate into their final judgments. While fixing the distance between the sample mean of the distributions of social information and participants' initial judgment, the variance (low vs.</p><p>high) and in the high-variance condition also the skew (not skewed vs. skewed) of the distributions were systematically manipulated within participants. Crucially, the advisors' judgments always pointed in the same and correct direction. Advice weighting, or what the authors originally referred to as "social information use," was measured as shifting towards the sample mean of a particular distribution, that is, implicitly assuming equal weighting of all three sources of information.</p><p>According to the original results, participants egocentrically discounted advice in all treatment conditions.

However, participants were also shown to consistently exhibit inter-individual differences in their selections of advice weighting strategies across conditions (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Rebholz et al., 2023)</ref>. Also note that on trials in the control condition, which emulated the four distributions of the experimental conditions, but are excluded as participants only acted as the observers of four judgments of peers and did not see the stimulus items, their own judgments closely aligned with the sample mean of all observed peer judgments. Moreover, more weight was assigned to peer judgments that were closer to each other as analyzed descriptively and by means of a cognitive model that emulated Bayesian updating and implemented different proximity-based weighting mechanisms (see <ref type="bibr">Molleman et al., 2020, Figures 2 &amp; 3, respectively)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Significance testing for treatment effects on the separate MER-weights of multiple pieces of advice is one of the key advantages over the more established aggregate ROD-based modeling procedure as applied in the original study. In essence, there is no statistical evidence for the differential weighting of multiple individual pieces of advice in the behavioral experiment of <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Molleman et al. (2020)</ref>. Descriptively, however, the typical inverse-U-shaped relationship between advice distance and weighting can also be observed in their data. Together with findings from the literature on (conformity) effects of consensus on advice weighting (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Fiedler et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Larson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Minson &amp; Mueller, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Schultze et al., 2019</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Asch, 1946;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Deutsch &amp; Gerard, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Larrick et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Schultze et al., 2013)</ref>, this result can also explain the descriptive patterns as observed for the treatment effects.</p><p>In the HC condition, participants form a consensus cluster together with the first and second advisor, whereas advice A 3 represents the minority opinion (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, it is not surprising that the supporting majority of judgments is weighted relatively more strongly as compared to the minority <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Larson et al., 2020)</ref>. In contrast, in the HF condition, there are opposing opinion clusters of equal size. Thus, egocentric discounting implies that the single supporting judgment A 1 is weighted relatively more strongly, whereas the cluster containing two opposing judgments is discounted <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Schultze et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Yaniv &amp; Milyavsky, 2007)</ref>. Although the sign ofβ A 3 ×HF is positive, its relative size supports this interpretation <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(Table 5)</ref>. Finally, there is another possible explanation other than the inverse-U-shaped distance-weighting relationship for why the first advisor is weighted significantly more strongly in the LN condition than in the HN condition, despite being closer to I in the latter. Related to the salience of consensus in multiple advice taking scenarios that is absent in the traditional JAS paradigm, whereas the judge is part of the largest crowd (i.e., narrowest consensus region) on HN-trials, participants may overvalue/-appreciate the single advisor who is closest to them in a crowd of advisors that constitutes a relatively distant consensus region on LN-trials.</p><p>Participants' initial judgments consistently marked extreme values of the judgment distributions in the sense that all advisors were on the same side of it. On the one hand, this constitutes an important limitation of the ecological validity of the paradigm implemented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Molleman et al. (2020)</ref>. On the other hand, treatment effects might become more pronounced when the initial judgments can also lie within the range of advice, such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Yaniv and Milyavsky (2007)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Schultze et al. (2022)</ref>. Qualitatively different constellations in terms of the coverage and location of initial judgments can be included as additional predictors with fixed effects on the MER-WOA.</p><p>From a technical point of view, the risk of linear dependencies ("redundancy; <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">" Soll &amp; Larrick, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Yaniv et al., 2009)</ref> between the advice A ijk and A ijk ′ , ∀k ̸ = k ′ , or I ij naturally increases in K. Accordingly, the reliability of weights estimated from a regular, non-hierarchical regression model with fixed order effects implemented as separate coefficients is likely to suffer from multicollinearity for large K (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Hoffman, 1960)</ref>. In contrast, the proposed multilevel modeling framework implements separate coefficient regressions at the weighting level. And because multilevel modeling is mathematically equivalent to ridge regression, it provides multicollinearity stable shrinkage estimates of WOA by design <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baayen &amp; Linke, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Brown et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Helwig, 2017</ref>; see the General Discussion for more details). The downside of this property, however, is that the estimates for MER-WOAs are biased toward the sample means of the crossed clustering variables, typically participants i and stimulus items j. 9 A more thorough discussion of the technical properties of MER-WOAs is provided in the following section.</p><p>9 Consider a hypothetical single advice taking experiment with only one item per participant, and thus for simplicity no item-wise random effects α T A,j . If only one participant i ′ neglects the advice, and all other participants i ̸ = i ′ ∀i, i ′ = 1, . . . , N assign a non-negative weight to the advice, then a good model of participants' behavior would predict the lowest conditional mode across all participant-wise random effects α S A,i for this specific participant's random effect α S A,i ′ (see also Footnote 3). Nevertheless, it would be unreasonable to expectα S A,i ′ = −β A , implyingω A,i ′ =β A +α S A,i ′ =β A −β A = 0, due to the shrinkage property of the proposed MER-WOA. Instead, incorporating information from the whole sample's behavior in this hypothetical study, it is more likely to observeω A,i ′ &gt; 0, but ceteris paribus alsoω A,i &gt;ω A,i ′ ∀i ̸ = i ′ , such that at least the relative rankings of the different weighting strategies are preserved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>We proposed mixed-effects regression weights of advice <ref type="bibr">(MER-WOAs)</ref> to analyze advice taking behavior and data related to other information acquisition phenomena with similar structure (e.g., anchoring effects, hindsight bias, or attitude change). The method is based on exploiting or explicitly modeling the multilevel structure of most of the data collected in these paradigms. The multilevel data structure results from the experimental crossing of grouping factors, often at least participants and stimulus items, rarely additionally also advisors. As a consequence, and in contrast to state-of-the-art ratio-of-differences (ROD) modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bailey et al., 2022)</ref>, the proposed framework is consistent with the endogenous formation of judgments based on exogenous sources of information such as advice. It also has many technical merits, some of which are discussed in more detail below.</p><p>In several reanalyses of empirical data, the more advanced modeling approach has been demonstrated to be practically applicable and easy to implement. More importantly, the proposed method has been shown to provide more clear-cut as well as novel and extended evidence not only for more traditional advice taking paradigms, such as the one used by <ref type="bibr">Logg et al. (2019, Experiment 4)</ref>. In particular, the blind spot of informational influences without recording initial judgments, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Mayer and Heck (2022)</ref>, could be resolved for the first time. Also, in scenarios where participants are given access to multiple advisors, we provide initial insights into the differential weighting of individual pieces of advice. In fact, our results do not provide evidence for statistically significant differences in participants' separate weighting of individual pieces of advice, and thus support the more simplistic total weighting approximation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Molleman et al. (2020)</ref>.</p><p>In methodological research, "more advanced" is often connoted with "more complex" modeling. In fact, instead of calculating individual weights per trial using simple arithmetic, a statistical optimization procedure is required to estimate mean weights and predict individual deviations thereof, which is relatively more complex in practice.</p><p>However, at least parsimony within the multilevel regression framework can be controlled by means of model specification. For instance, modeling advisors as a third, crossed clustering instance would reduce the problem of estimating separate mixed-effects coefficient regressions for multiple advisors to estimating only one additional variance term at the weighting level. Although this can help reduce the statistical complexity of the estimation problem, the interpretation of the estimated weights is tied to their specification as random effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Rebholz, 2023)</ref>. To take advantage of all the benefits of MER-WOA that are presented in this paper, it seems worthwhile to sacrifice parsimony in favor of more complex model building and simultaneous statistical optimization. The prevailing demand for inferential conclusions anyway challenges the existence of factual differences in (model) complexity between our framework and the more established modeling approach.</p><p>The reason is that in the latter, researchers have to rely on a two-step procedure in which purely descriptive ROD-WOAs from the first step are used in the second step as dependent variables in statistical test procedures, such as multilevel modeling (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ache et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Minson &amp; Mueller, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Rebholz &amp; Hütter, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Schultze et al., 2015)</ref>. Therefore, these and other important merits and limitations of the two methods will be critically evaluated in the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Blind Spot of (Extremely) Close Advice</head><p>Reported evidence suggests that close advice is not taken in terms of judgmental shift but increased confidence instead <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Hütter &amp; Ache, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Moussaïd et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Schultze et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Soll et al., 2022</ref> for a more detailed discussion). Everything else being equal, ROD-WOA converges to infinity for closer advice as the denominator approaches zero for smaller distances between advice and initial judgment (see Equation 1). Therefore, the probability to be classified as outlier and excluded from the analyses or truncated to one is relatively high for close advice. Accordingly, conclusions from corresponding evidence do not reflect the most relevant cases with very high or even undefined (ROD) weights of extremely close advice. The proposed mixed-effects regression approach, by contrast, provides well-defined-in terms of person-and item-specific deviations from mean weighting tendencies-estimates of weights for these situations as well. For the limiting case in which advice and initial judgment are the same, we can still find informative partial effects as long as there is sufficient variance in advice distance over all trials. From a substantive point of view, MER-WOAs thus also carry the potential to clarify empirical findings about (extremely) close advice. In other words, research on judgmental shifts are enabled even in advice distance regions that are highly sensitive in terms of tiny distance changes implying huge judgmental shifts as measured by ROD-WOA.</p><p>For complete consideration of information from all experimental trials that were conducted, a healthy modeling strategy should be resilient to data pre-processing artifacts.</p><p>The outlier sensitivity of ROD-WOA, caused by its specific arithmetic as described above, often makes exclusions or truncation unavoidable in established empirical practice (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Hütter &amp; Ache, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Schultze et al., 2015)</ref>. By contrast, shrunken MER-WOAs do not require the implementation of often complex and ambiguous (see also the example in Beyond Relativity to the Self) outlier specifications. As data pre-processing implies researcher degrees of freedom, the proposed method can thus also be seen as a tool to counteract the reproducibility crisis. This is achieved in addition to enabling extensions of existing empirical findings or developing new substantive research domains.</p></div>

As investigations of treatment effects would thus require comparing dominance weights between different regressions models, <ref type="bibr">Önkal et al. (2009)</ref> favored ROD-WOAs instead.</p><p>reasons. First, ordinary regression coefficients do not reflect individual differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bauer, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bonaccio &amp; Dalal, 2006)</ref>. This is no longer a limitation of MER-WOAs from the proposed multilevel modeling framework. Second, regression coefficients are problematic indicators of variable importance in case of multicollinearity-especially for regressing on the judgments of multiple, interrelated judges <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Harvey et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Hoffman, 1960)</ref>. Thus, a limitation of the new approach is its proposal of potentially poor measures of information utilization. On the one hand, however, ROD-WOA as the most common utilization index in advice taking research also effectively conceptualizes importance in terms of beta weights as became obvious from rearranging the formula (see Equation 2). Accordingly, the proposed mixed-effects regression approach relies on a well-established convention. On the other hand, rearrangement additionally established a crucial qualification of this limitation.</p><p>In the most parsimonious case, sum-to-one constrained MER-WOAs can be estimated free of multicollinearity based on a multilevel model with advice distance as the only predictor (see Equation 4).</p><p>Multilevel modeling is mathematically equivalent to ridge regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baayen &amp; Linke, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Brown et al., 2018)</ref>. In classical ridge regression, coefficient stability is achieved by adding a penalization term of the squared coefficients to the optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Helwig, 2017)</ref>. Optimally balancing the bias-variance trade-off reduces the expected mean squared error of the resulting shrinkage estimates. Consequently, penalization is the key to stabilizing coefficients also from more complex regression models with many predictors, such as additional control variables. Put differently, MER-WOAs (i.e., shrinkage estimates) are generally stable against multicollinearity by design. Accordingly, the proposed regression-based measures of advice weighting are appropriate also for testing theories that involve additional predictors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Comparisons and Nonlinear Advice Weighting</head><p>Additional predictors can be added at any level of a multilevel regression model.</p><p>Modeling that explicitly considers endogenous judgment formation thus allows for the consideration of additional predictors at any of the grouping levels or on the level of trials, which may but do not necessarily have random effects on judgment too. By simply adding such variables (e.g., additional cues to expertise) to the regression model at the respective level, researchers can investigate the weighting behavior more holistically. In general, any number and type of main or (cross-level) interaction effects of additional predictors on judgment or weighting can be assessed. An accordingly extended system of Equations 4 and 5 thus also allows to test moderation effects on the WOA or to compare different weighting policies.</p><p>Often people combine different sources of information in a nonlinear way (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Ganzach, 1995, for clinical judgment)</ref>. Actually, ROD-WOA usually features an inverse-U-shaped relation with advice distance in many empirical studies: Close as well as more distant advice is typically taken less than advice of "intermediate" distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Hütter &amp; Ache, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Moussaïd et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rebholz, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Schultze et al., 2015)</ref>. As the regression framework allows to incorporate any number and type of additional predictors at any level, researchers no longer have to assume linear processing of advice for calculating the weights.</p><p>To model nonlinear weighting as requested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bailey et al. (2022)</ref>, the set of additional predictors can include higher-order terms such as polynomials (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Schreiner et al., 2023)</ref> or nonlinear transformations of advice (distance). Base expansions provide an even more flexible solution in the "generalized additive modeling" framework (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baayen &amp; Linke, 2020)</ref>. In essence, as already requested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Slovic and Lichtenstein (1971)</ref>, the proposed multilevel modeling approach allows statistical tests of alternative theoretical accounts of external information utilization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>On the Duality of Advice Utilization and Beyond</head><p>More recently, advice taking research focused on dimensions of advice utilization beyond judgmental shift (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Soll et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Yaniv et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Essentially, Moussaïd et al. (2013)</ref> were the first to find that the utilization dimension depends on the distance of advice. Instead of causing judgmental shifts from initial to final estimation, the confirmatory value of close advice is taken by participants in terms of enhanced confidence (as measured on 6-point Likert scales) in their initial estimates. This so-called "duality of advice utilization" <ref type="bibr">(Schultze et al., 2015, p. 170</ref>) is assumed to be responsible for the characteristic inverse-U-shaped relation of advice weighting and distance. In a regression framework, variables from different scales can be included side by side in the same statistical model, at both the independent and dependent levels. For instance, although ordinal confidence and numerical judgments were measured on different scales in the example above, MER-confidence weights of advice can be derived for confidence as a second dependent variable regressed on advice.</p><p>Extensions to multivariate multilevel regression, that is, multiple response variables modeled collectively in one larger regression model, are equally straightforward <ref type="bibr">(Snijders &amp; Bosker, 2012, Chapter 16</ref>). Such a model can capture advice taking simultaneously on multiple dimensions, for instance, judgment shift plus confidence change. In contrast to the "influence of advice" measure proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Soll et al. (2022)</ref>, the duality of advice taking is reflected by dimensional interdependencies of the coefficient regressions. In addition, judgment accuracy can further enrich the corresponding multivariate multilevel regression modeling and hypothesis testing on a third, wisdom of crowds-related dimension, and so on. Notably, multivariate methods are especially powerful if the set of dependent variables is strongly correlated, such as judgment and confidence as described above. Accordingly, a valid and powerful test of multidimensional advice taking naturally requires joint hypothesis testing of the multidimensional weights of advice, and thus ultimately a regression-based procedure.</p><p>For the sake of brevity, we refrain from discussing other valuable extensions such as the following two examples in detail. For instance, multilevel quantile regression could be used to examine statistics of distributions of weights other than their means. Furthermore, the ROD formula is extremely limited in its explanatory power for choices among a set of discrete, qualitatively different alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bailey et al., 2022)</ref>. For binary choice, ROD-WOA merely describes "matching" in terms of accepting or disregarding advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Sniezek &amp; Buckley, 1995)</ref>. Instead, implementing appropriate link functions such as logit or probit for modeling qualitative decisions in a generalized multilevel regression or linear mixed modeling framework allows for more informative weighting parameters, such as choice probabilities or odds ratios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toward a Process-Consistent Modeling of Information Sampling and Utilization</head><p>Unfortunately, multilevel regression models of advice taking will not be a panacea after all. For instance, the estimation of mixed-effects generally requires a relatively large number of observations. Beside being increasingly common in experimental research practice, however, it is nowadays at least possible to estimate the practical constrain (i.e., number of subjects and items required) of an experiment that is analyzed by means of multilevel modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Brysbaert &amp; Stevens, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Green &amp; MacLeod, 2016)</ref>. More importantly, the traditional modeling of advice taking is responsible for a variety of limitations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bonaccio &amp; Dalal, 2006</ref>, for a review). For instance, there may be sources of information other than a single piece of advice and, if any (see section Beyond Relativity to the Self), one's independent initial judgment. If multiple pieces of external evidence are presented simultaneously (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Molleman et al., 2020)</ref> the calculation of the established weighting index of <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Harvey and Fischer (1997)</ref> for each individual source of information is infeasible. Previous regression-based approaches have already taken into account the endogenous formation of judgments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brehmer &amp; Hagafors, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Harvey et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Lim &amp; O'Connor, 1995)</ref>. Put differently, we propose to model endogenous variables such as updated beliefs as-potentially nonlinearly-weighted combinations of exogenous sources of information. However, unlike these previous analytical methods, which are limited to aggregated inferences, the proposed multilevel regression framework still enables researchers to estimate individual weights for each experimental trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In summary, the main strength of the proposed mixed-effects regression weights (of advice) is that they enable research on individual differences in the sampling and utilization of information from a variety of sources, on multiple dimensions, and beyond social contexts. New information technologies and online networks make it increasingly convenient to access multiple opinions and advisors. Therefore, more flexible tools for examining informational influences in these situations are invaluable.</p></div>

Essentially, however, it is neither necessary to apply potentially problematic data preor post-processing approaches nor to analyze the data twice.

In their paradigm, participants received the estimate of a previous participant to answer general knowledge questions, such as "How tall is the Eiffel Tower?" in Experiments 1 and 2, or to locate cities on maps in Experiment 3. The most important difference from classical studies on advice taking is that no independent initial judgments were required. Consequently, although the provision of previous participants' estimates essentially constitutes an advice taking situation in the traditional sense, informational influence could not be assessed by indices of relative positioning such as ROD-WOA.The original study was limited to a performance perspective, providing evidence for increasing judgment accuracy along sequential collaboration chains. Although the number of previous contributors was unknown to the participants, positioning effects on informational influences would provide valuable additional insight into whether more accurate advice is weighted more strongly (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Yaniv &amp; Kleinberger, 2000;</ref> but see Fiedler   et al., 2019;<ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Schultze et al., 2017)</ref>.
