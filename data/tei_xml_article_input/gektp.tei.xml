				<p>Introduction: The current research explored the magnitude of professional industrial investigators&apos; bias to attribute cause to a person more readily than to situational factors, i.e., human error bias. Such biased opinions may relieve companies from responsibilities and liability, as well as, compromise efficacy of suggested preventative measures. Method: Professional investigators and undergraduate participants were given a summary of a workplace event and asked to allocated cause to the factors they found causal for the event. The summary was crafted to be objectively balanced in its implication of cause equally between two factors: a worker and a tire. Participants then rated their confidence and the objectivity of their judgment. We then conducted an effect size analysis which supplemented the findings from our experiment with two previously published research studies that used the same event summary. Results: Professionals exhibited a human error bias, but nevertheless believed that they were objective and confident in their conclusions. The lay control group also showed this human error bias. These data, along with previous research data, revealed that given the equivalent investigative circumstances, this bias was significantly larger with the professional investigators, with an effect size of dunb = .97, than the control group with an effect size of only dunb = .32. Conclusions: The direction and strength of the human error bias can be quantified, and is shown to be larger in professional investigators compared to the lay people. Practical Applications: Understanding the strength and direction of bias is a crucial step in mitigating the effects of the bias. The results of the current research demonstrate that mitigation strategies such as proper investigator training, a strong investigation culture and standardized techniques, are potentially promising interventions to mitigate human error bias. Keywords: cognitive bias, industrial incident investigation, human error bias, context effects, investigators, expert decision making Highlights  Quantified the magnitude of the human error bias in professional investigators.  Meta-analyses showed professionals had a stronger human error bias than students.  Professionals wrongly, but confidently, believed that they were objective.  Recommendations for mitigating bias in workplace investigation are presented.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Incident investigations are conducted in the wake of workplace events which claim the health and lives of workers. Regulatory and industry-based industrial investigators work to establish how and why events occur so preventative measures can be implemented to minimize such events from occurring again in the future. Investigations reach direct conclusions regarding who and what was causal with implication to safety, liability and compensation.</p><p>Investigative decisions are often made in evolving, complex and, at times, ambiguous investigative environments. Therefore, the cognitions of workplace investigators play a critical role in guiding the investigative process. Given the importance of investigators' judgements, it is disconcerting that research shows that workplace investigation professionals harbor a human error bias in which they tend to allocate more cause to workers in an event than the evidence dictates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">DeJoy, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">LaCroix &amp; DeJoy, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">MacLean et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">MacLean &amp; Read, 2019</ref>; c.f., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Woodcock et al., 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The attribution literature demonstrates that all people, not just investigators, are inclined to attribute more cause to individuals involved in an event than the evidence would support <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gawronski, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nisbett &amp; Ross, 1980)</ref>. However, additional factors, often present in the workplace investigation, may increase the magnitude of this human error bias for professional investigators. Indeed, research has revealed a significant difference in human error bias between professionals and the lay population <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(MacLean et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">MacLean &amp; Read, 2019)</ref>, but the research does not provide details about the magnitude of this difference. <ref type="bibr">Kahneman and colleagues, in their book 'Noise' (2021)</ref> state that unidirectional and targeted corrective debiasing strategies can be helpful in circumstances where there is a clear likelihood that the bias is present and the direction and magnitude can be anticipated. The difference of human error bias between the professional and lay population indicates a systematic difference in the base-rate expectations (the predicted probability) of human error for events in these two populations. However, research that directly demonstrated the effects of biased base-rates on professional investigative judgment is scarce (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Meissner &amp; Kassin, 2002)</ref>. The goal of the current research is to examine the magnitude of the human error bias in professional investigation and provide concise, empirical evidence of the biasing effect of base-rates on professional judgments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Sources of Bias</head><p>Cognitive bias may undermine honest investigators' good intentions and hard work (e.g.,</p><p>MacLean <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">&amp; Dror, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">MacLean et al., 2020)</ref>. Bias is not random error, it is the systematic deviation from evidence-based objective judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kahneman et al., 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dror (2020)</ref> provides a taxonomy of eight sources of bias. It shows how sources of bias range from the architecture and constraints of the human brain, to contextual factors that are both environmental and event specific. Inaccurate base-rates are the fourth source of bias presented in the sources of bias hierarchy. Base-rate knowledge is an understanding and expected probability of the event, that is, the rate of occurrence of some feature in a population. The intuitive understanding of base-rates can be helpful and informative when drawing conclusions, however they can also distort decision-making by leading people to believe something is more or less likely to have occurred than is true in their present circumstance <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Wickens et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Base-Rate Expectation</head><p>When determining how an event occurred it is appropriate to consider both how well the evidence represents the event and also the base-rate frequency of that outcome, that is, its probability. Information in the workplace investigation is often ambiguous and incomplete <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hofmann &amp; Stetzer, 1998)</ref>. In investigative circumstances that include little diagnostic information, it is logical for investigators to draw on appropriate base-rate information to suggest a cause. For instance, investigators faced with a tire explosion event may think about base-rates of the causes of tire explosions and use this as a data point in the investigation process. Biased judgments can occur when population base-rates (the actual frequency of an occurrence) are inconsistent with the investigators' beliefs (see classic work on the availability and representativeness heuristics; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.1">Human error bias</head><p>In the case of workplace investigators, a number of factors may converge to develop biased base-rate expectations of human error. People are not skilled at rationally considering the effect of situational variables on the behaviour of others and instead tend to attribute an actor's actions to his/her/their disposition (e.g., lazy, careless, inattentive, reckless; fundamental attribution error, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nisbett &amp; Ross, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">correspondence bias, Gawronski, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gilbert &amp; Malone, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>We use the term human error bias to refer to this cognitive tendency in workplace situations where people overemphasize worker action as causal for an event.</p><p>Unique to industrial investigation is that investigators encounter contextual and motivational factors that work to enhance their natural human inclination to overemphasize operator error. For instance, investigators are often employees of the company in which they are conducting the investigation and thus have knowledge of the workers and workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Vincoli, 1994)</ref>. A bias towards a worksite employee can be introduced via an investigator's expectations about a worker's behaviour if an investigator is familiar with that worker's unsafe history <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(MacLean et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">MacLean &amp; Read, 2019)</ref>. Human error bias may also be enhanced because industry investigators, who are employees of the organization, may have motivational allegiances to protect the company they work for <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Murrie et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Steensma et al., 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Although the investigation literature endorses the need for unbiased investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sklet, 2002)</ref> it also acknowledges that past recommendations have been skewed to be consistent with self interests, focus on those features that were preventable, and/or result in legal liability, rather than inclusive of all investigative findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hancock, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hopkins, 2000)</ref>. Explicit or implied organizational pressure to find "human error" may guide (perhaps unconsciously) investigators' conclusions about the responsibility of the worker.</p><p>Once an investigator has a theory of worker fault, confirmation bias demonstrates how this hypothesis can shape information collection and interpretation to endorse his/her/their predominant perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Nickerson, 1998)</ref>. For investigators, finding additional evidence to endorse their theory of worker cause is not difficult as workers often deviate from the specific working protocol suggested by the organization and use more common, established practical and pragmatic practices adopted by that worksite's employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Leveson, 2004)</ref>. Moreover, the industrial investigation is a feedback impoverished environment which makes it difficult for investigators to hone their decision-making ability. Investigators may never know if their recommended changes, that focused on worker behaviour, produced the future "non-event" or if it was simply the extremely low probability of a similar event reoccurring that led to it not occurring again <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Woodcock, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>For workplace investigators, the features discussed above should culminate in a rich network of cognitive associations that link different workplace events with operator error. These associations would generate an inflated understanding of the rate of human error in worksite events and ultimately, robust human error base-rate expectations. Thus, the first goal of this research was to investigate the effect that professionals' base-rates may have on their decisions about event cause compared to the undergraduate population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Meta-cognitive Evaluations of Performance</head><p>People do not have direct access to their thoughts and because of this, when asked about their accuracy or objectivity, they rely on available cues to make inferences about their performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dunlosky &amp; Tauber, 2014)</ref>. People may rely on the imprecise cue of retrieval fluency to inform them of how confident they should be about their decisions. Information that is deeply learned or encountered recently facilitates access <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Benjamin &amp; Bjork, 1996)</ref>. Thus, the familiarity professional investigators have with industrial events should result in them having relatively higher confidence levels than those in the lay population. People's ability to estimate their objectivity is equally flawed. When asked to estimate how objective they have been, people tend to turn inward and seek residue of bias in their decision making; any residue is largely undetectable <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wilson et al., 2002)</ref>. Hence, in addition to being confident, investigators likely see their choices as more objective than it really is. The second goal of this research was to explore the confidence participants had in their decisions and their impressions about their objectivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Research Questions</head><p>Do individuals have a bias to perceive people involved in events as causal? Would this tendency be demonstrated by participants allocating more cause to a worker than other factors when given industrial event information in which the evidence did not favour the equipment or worker as more causal (Experiment)? We also wanted to know, whether professional workplace investigators would have a stronger human error bias than the undergraduate population, given equivalent investigative scenarios (Effect size analysis)? Last, we wanted to know whether participants would believe that they were objective and, also how confident they were in their assessment of incident information.</p><p>To answer our research questions, we first explored the extent to which professional investigators and undergraduate participants allocated cause to a worker, versus an equally salient situational factor, when given a summary of a workplace event. The summary was crafted to be objectively balanced in its implication between two causal factors: a worker and tire (see Appendix A for the incident summary). The information given to the participants contained no diagnostic information that implicated either the worker or the tire as causing the event (Experiment). Participants in our experiment also rated their confidence and objectivity of their judgment.</p><p>Second, in addition to the data collection in our experiment, we conducted an effect size analysis which combined the findings from our experiment with two published research studies that used the same event summary. This was done to obtain a more robust measure of the extent to which the undergraduate and professional populations differed in the magnitude of the human bias.</p><p>Findings from these analyses reveal, in tangible terms, the magnitude of the human error bias that can be brought to an event scenario by professionals compared to those in the lay population. They will also examine the awareness individuals have for how their tendencies affect their judgements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method</head><p>Participants read a summary of a workplace event and developed an initial hypothesis of what most likely caused the event. They then reported their confidence in their cause allocation judgments and their level of objectively when making the judgment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Participants</head><p>Participants were undergraduate students, N= 50 (20 men, 28 women, 2 undisclosed) and professional industrial incident investigators from the forestry industry, N= 15 (12 men and 3 women). All participants were fluent English speakers. Undergraduates ranged in age from 18 to 28 years (M = 20.40, SD = 2.62) and professional investigators from 29 to 62 years (M = 43.80, SD = 9.34). Our sample size of 15 professional participants was reached after 9 were removed (three because they had previously taken part in an experiment that used the materials, three because they did not consent to include their data in the data set, and three who misunderstood the industrial event to be the bystander's injury and not the tire explosion). See <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> for demographic information of professionals. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Materials and Procedure</head><p>Participants completed testing booklets which contained the experimental task. The procedure was as follows: (i) participants provided consent, (ii) watched a brief PowerPoint presentation outlining the types of judgements that they would be asked to make in the experiment, (iii) read an summary of an industrial event (Appendix A) and were provided with two pieces of non-probative information about the event, (iv) reported their demographic information, <ref type="bibr">(v)</ref> hypothesized what cause the incident and then allocated a percentage of cause to each causal factor they indicated, (vi) rated their level of objectivity and the likelihood that their hypothesis was correct, and (vii) were debriefed about the purpose of the research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Introductory Presentation</head><p>A PowerPoint presentation showed participants the difference between underlying and direct incident cause. Direct cause(s) were described as worksite factors that immediately contributed to the event's occurrence such as a worker's action, faulty equipment, or environmental conditions. Underlying causes were described as the factors that underlie the direct causes, e.g., poor maintenance, housekeeping, management, funding, supervision or inadequate training. Participants were informed that their task was to provide their most likely hypothesis of what directly caused the event. We sought only direct causes in this research because they illuminate the conditions that were immediately responsible for the incident (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hollnagel, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Leveson, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Industrial Incident Summary</head><p>The summary described an event in which a worker was changing a tire on a truck (i.e., the tire man). When the tire man moved to the left to shut off the air flow to the tire the tire violently exploded, hitting a bystander who sustained serious injuries from the incident. The incident summary describes the environment, equipment, and actions of the worker that preceded the tire explosion. Initially developed for MacLean et al. <ref type="formula">2013</ref>, the summary is a modified incident report from the Forestry industry in British Columbia and was refined with the support of a subject matter expert in forestry investigation. Prior research demonstrates that participants understand details of the event by reading the summary.</p><p>Participants were to allocate cause for the tire explosion event, not the injury of the bystander. The bystander's injury was a consequence of the tire explosion and this distinction was made clear to participants at the time of testing. The event description did not provide the necessary detail investigators require to determine tire or tire man cause. For instance, an example of diagnostic information that the tire man caused the tire to explode would have been information indicating that the tire man did not follow the manufacturer's instructions for tire and rim servicing prior to mounting and filling the tire. A tire cause for the explosion would have been information that indicated that the structure and function of the tire was compromised. No such diagnostic information was shared in the incident summary.</p><p>The summary included an image of the tire man, tire, truck, and bystander. Two different pictures of the tire man and two different pictures of the truck/tire were combined to create four event summary documents. The four event summaries were counterbalanced across participants.</p><p>See Appendix A for one version of the incident summary.</p><p>Participants also received two pieces of additional information. This new information did not implicate or exonerate the tire or tire man as causal and was provided to enhance the resolution of the activity. The additional information about the tire man stated that "blood screening done after the incident demonstrated that there was no indication of drugs or alcohol in the Tire Man's blood stream." The additional tire information stated that "the rim of the tire had no visible cracks, dents or signs of metal fatigue." The order of evidence was counterbalanced across participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Demographics and Filler Activity</head><p>Participants reported their gender and age. Professionals were also asked if they had previously taken part in an experiment that used these materials and to state their experience in investigation. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> for professional-investigator demographic information. The experience questions we asked of professionals increased the number of items on their demographic questionnaire compared to undergraduates. To maintain a consistent 3-5 minutes interlude between receiving the event information and making their investigative judgments, undergraduates were given 3 short word games prior to making their judgments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4">Ratings of Event Cause</head><p>Participants used an open-ended box to state their hypothesis of what directly caused the workplace event and then allocated the cause of the event between the factors they identified as causal (e.g., tire man 50%; tire 20%; tire cage 30%). Identifying something as mostly versus marginally causal at an initial stage of an investigation has implications for focusing subsequent information collection and decision making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carlson &amp; Russo, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jolly &amp; Douglas, 2017</ref>). Using the percentage breakdown informed us about how causal participants perceive each worksite factor they identified. The purpose of the experimental activity was to assess individuals' base-rate tendency to infer worker causality when there is limited information;</p><p>hence, participants were encouraged to develop an initial theory of event cause rather than respond "I don't know."</p><p>The researchers then allocated the percentages associated with participants' responses into three direct cause categories: 1. tire man fault, 2. tire fault, and/or 3. other fault. Any responses that described the root cause of tire man's actions were coded as "tire man cause." Tire man causes were: overinflating the tire, not following procedures, not properly trained, lack of supervision, not inflating the tire in a cage, lack of procedure, inadequate risk assessment, not perceiving tire damage or, the most frequently stated and general cause provided by participants, substandard tire man action. Tire causes were: wear and tear, lack of maintenance, defect in tire, sidewall failure, or the generally category of defective tire. Other causes were: location of bystander, substandard equipment (e.g., pressure gauge, tire cage), environmental factors, or location of the vehicle. Two, independent, raters obtained 82% agreement in categorizing 20% of undergraduate and 40% of professional participants' statements into cause categories. All inconsistent categorizations were resolved through discussion and referencing the categorization criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5">Meta-cognitive Reports</head><p>Participants used 9-point Likert scales to make their meta-cognitive judgments. They rated the likelihood that their hypothesis would be proven correct (1 = extremely unlikely to 9 = extremely likely) and the number that best reflected how objective they believe they were in their evaluation of the evidence (1 = not objective to 9 = extremely objective).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Causal Attributions</head><p>Given equal information about the tire and the tire man, all of which was non-diagnostic, both undergraduates and professionals allocated greater cause to the tire man compared to the tire (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). For undergraduates, the estimated difference between the average amount of cause allocated to the tire and the worker was 44.2% (95% CI <ref type="bibr">[29.37, 59</ref>.03]). For professionals, the estimated difference between the average amount of cause allocated to the tire and the worker was larger than the undergraduates, 63% (95% CI [37.07, 88.93]). However, the magnitude difference in the human error bias between undergraduates and professionals was not explored in this research activity due to our small professional sample size, yet our results suggest a systematic stronger effect in the professional sample. The meta-analyses we present below have adequately robust sample sizes to inform us of the between-group differences on the human error bias.</p><p>Undergraduates Professionals </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Meta-cognitive Reports of Causal Conclusions</head><p>Participants reported that it was likely that their hypothesis would be proven correct and that they were somewhat objective in their assessment of the incident information (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>).  To explore the relationship between participants' metacognitive reports and their cause allocation a difference score was calculated. This difference score calculated the percentage of cause allocated to the tire subtracted from the percentage of cause allocated to the worker.</p><p>Undergraduates' difference scores ranged from -90 to 100 (M = 44.2, SD = 52.17) and professionals difference scores ranged from -60 to 100 (M = 63, SD = 46.82). There was no correlation between participants difference scores and their (i) confidence that their hypothesis would be proven correct, undergraduates r(49) = .16, p = .26; professionals , r(15) = .26, p = .34 or (ii) level of objectivity, undergraduates r(49) = .22, p = .13; professionals , r(15) = .16, p = .56.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Our experiment revealed a robust human error bias in both the undergraduate and the professional-investigator samples. Participants provided with the basic details of a serious industrial incident, and no information that indicated cause for the event, tended to a priori hypothesize that the worker was more causal than other factors. This human error bias is fueled by the cognitive tendencies discussed in the attribution literature. Investigators' conclusions may also be supported by one or more of the cognitive and/or motivational factors that reinforce causal conclusions of human error in the workplace environment.</p><p>Our findings were consistent with the metacognitive literature that has demonstrates that people have difficulty monitoring their cognitive processes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benjamin &amp; Bjork, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ehrlinger et al., 2005)</ref>. Participants rated themselves as fairly objective and fairly confident that their hypothesis would be proven correct; their ratings were unrelated to their cause allocations.</p><p>Interestingly, we did not find a difference in the level of confidence demonstrated by professional investigators and the undergraduates. The importance of confidence in the investigation is that it can be used as a cue to third-party observers to assess credibility of a person's information <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Weinsheimer et al., 2017)</ref>. Our findings demonstrate that participants' confidence was not calibrated to their cause allocation pattern. The implications of this miscalibration between judgments and confidence is that safety initiatives could proceed based more on the persuasiveness and confidence of the investigator rather than on the quality of their findings. In interpreting our findings, one must be careful, as professionals differ from undergraduates in a number of ways that make professionals not only susceptible to biases due to wrong or misapplied base-rates, but also due to organizational culture, loyalties, ideology, motivations, age (although individuals who are middle-aged generally score lower on the fundamental attribution error than younger adults; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Follett &amp; Hess, 2002)</ref> and other factors that distinguish them from non-professionals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Effect Size Meta-Analyses with Previous Research</head><p>The central aims of this paper were to explore if professional investigators are more inclined to allocate cause to the worker, versus an equally salient situational factor, and whether such an effect of professionals is comparable to that of lay population when given equivalent investigative circumstances. We addressed these aims by conducting two small random effects model, meta-analyses. One meta-analysis was conducted for undergraduate participants and the other meta-analysis for professional investigators. For each of the meta-analyses we used the data from three experiments, the current experiment, MacLean et al. <ref type="formula">2013</ref>, and MacLean and Read (2019). These three experiments were all conducted with both undergraduate and professional populations; used the same tire explosion event stimuli; and asked participants to allocate cause to the factors that they perceived as directly responsible for the incident. In each one of the three experiments, both undergraduate and professional participants experienced the same experimental protocol. Collectively these three studies represent the reporting of 471 undergraduates and 118 professional industrial investigators which are adequate sample sizes to derive measures of effect size.</p><p>These three experiments, however also differed in three ways. We detail the experimental differences below for transparency and for showing the contribution of the present study above.</p><p>These differences do not preclude the three studies from being combined in our two metaanalyses. <ref type="bibr">First, in MacLean et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">MacLean and Read, (2019)</ref>, prior to learning about the industrial event, half of the participants received information that the tire had a history of unsafe behaviour and the other half that the tire man had a history of unsafe behaviour. In the experiment presented above we did not provide participants with such additional biasing contextual information prior to reading about the event and allocating cause.</p><p>Second, in all three experiments participants were provided with a balanced amount of information about the causality of both the tire and worker. <ref type="bibr">However, in MacLean et al. (2013)</ref> and MacLean and Read, (2019) participants were given evidence that indicated that both the tire and the tire man were equally causal for the event prior to allocating cause. In the experiment presented above participants did not receive any information that indicated cause.</p><p>Third, all three studies educated participants about direct cause and asked that they only allocate cause to factors immediately causal for the event. However, in MacLean et al. <ref type="formula">2013</ref>and MacLean and Read (2019) participants indicated the category that the percentage of cause should be allocated to (tire man, tire or other). In the present experiment participants provided percentages with open-ended responses and researchers categorized those responses as "tire man cause", "tire cause" or "other cause." As stated above, despite the differences in experiment format, they are appropriate to be include in our two meta-analyses. All experiments compared the amount of cause allocated to the tire man and tire in participant samples which were balanced on the diagnosticity and amount of information that they received about the tire and tire man.</p><p>The difference in cause allocated to the tire man and the tire was calculated for both , which reflects that undergraduates demonstrated a relatively weak tendency to allocate cause to a worker (when given information equal in its probative value, about the worker and tire involved in the event). In contrast, the professional random effects meta-analysis showed a cumulative dunb of 0.97 (CI [0.31, 1.63]), demonstrating that professionals had a much stronger bias to report that the worker is causal when given the same information about the tire and worker (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> for the full meta-analyses results).</p><p>The heterogeneity calculations for the undergraduate meta-analysis revealed a significant (p &lt; .001) I 2 value of 96.7 (Q = 91.51, T = 0.54), illustrating considerable heterogeneity between studies. The heterogeneity calculations for the professional meta-analysis also revealed heterogeneity with a significant (p &lt; .001) I 2 value of 87.5 (Q = 15.39, T = 0.52). These sizeable heterogeneity results support our use of the random effects model as it is appropriate to assume that the variability demonstrated between studies is larger than what could be reasonably accounted for by sampling variability.  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.

Cohen's d was computed for the paired designs by dividing the mean difference by Sav= . Cohen's dunb was then calculated by ESCI using the following formula dunb = �1 − 3 4 ( −1)−1 � x . The positive dunbs represent a greater percentage of cause being allocated to the worker than the tire. Two undergraduate samples were included for MacLean and Read (2016) as the total sample size (N = 285) was larger than what ESCI could accommodate for one study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Overall Discussion</head><p>The current paper aimed to empirically examine the biasing effect of base-rates on professional judgments, and reveal the relative strength of the human error bias in the professional investigation population. The cumulative results of the experimental activity and meta-analyses showed that both undergraduates and professionals are inclined to allocate cause to a worker, over other factors, given the same workplace event, but professionals significantly more so. This significantly higher effect in the professional population illuminates the effect of biasing factors, such as experience and expectation in judgments of event cause.</p><p>A method suggested to manage the effect of neglected, misapplied or misunderstood base-rates in decision making is to find the most up-to-date population rates for the event individuals are judging and to use those rates as a comparison point <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kahneman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Neal &amp; Grisso, 2014)</ref>. Decision makers are encouraged to assess the strength and credibly of the evidence they are evaluating by comparing it to the population base-rate. Unfortunately for professional investigators, human error bias is inherent to the population data investigators would use to establish the "objective" population base-rates. Investigator cognition is the method by which the population data is generated. The safety literature reports that 70%-80% of incidents are caused by operator error <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Leveson, 2004)</ref>. Our results, which were produced by using evidence that implicates a piece of machinery and the worker equally, demonstrates how different investigators conclusions may be from what would be an objective evaluation of the evidence.</p><p>A potentially fruitful method of managing the effects of the bias presented in this paper is to focus efforts on minimizing the human error bias; which is the foundation of investigators' base-rate expectations. Because human cognitive tendencies make it quick and efficient for people to conclude human error, investigators must make an effortful second step to thoroughly consider the circumstantial factors that may have contributed to the incident <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gilbert et al., 1988</ref>). This effortful second step is akin to a strategy discussed in the debiasing literature which is to consider alternatives. Considering alternatives has been moderately successful at dislodging biased patterns of thought and expanding professionals understanding the evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson &amp; Sechler, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hirt &amp; Markman, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lord et al., 1984)</ref>.</p><p>Debiasing activities like considering alternatives require cognitive investment from the decision maker. Hence, for these strategies to work investigators must have the cognitive resources to engage in a more effortful evaluation of the evidence, as well as, the motivation to do so. Professionals under time pressure or fatigued will be less likely to engage the second, more cognitively-involved, step of considering the potential situational variables affecting a worker's behaviour and will be at greater risk of over attributing cause to a worker (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Danziger et al., 2011 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fraser-Mackenzie &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dror, 2011</ref> for illustrations of the effect of state on decision making).</p><p>Organizational culture also has a meaningful role in reducing this human error bias. The effects of allegiance to protect the company will be reduced with professionals who work in an organizational that supports evidence-based decision making regardless of outcome. Also, prioritizing accuracy versus efficiency in the investigation will lead to more comprehensive investigative judgments. An emphasis on accuracy should offset the effect of quick and efficient cognitive tendency to conclude human error and promote deeper consideration of the evidence (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ask et al., 2011)</ref>. Maintaining a balanced investigative practice, however is important. An emphasis on accuracy should be kept in perspective and not propel investigators to over analyse.</p><p>Investigators with a compulsion to be flawless would experience increased stress and pressure.</p><p>Organizations that support comprehensive, data-driven investigations will likely also support the use of standardized practices and procedures. Standardization is a useful strategy as it reduces the level of subjectivity in decision making. Reducing subjectivity increases the reliability of the judgments and can support bias mitigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kahneman et al., 2021)</ref>. Hence, it is beneficial to employ protocols for information collection, triaging of acquired evidence, and employing a third-party, independent investigator to have a "fresh look." These organizations will also have a higher likelihood of pursuing investigator training about cognitive bias.</p><p>Cognitively informed training, when done properly, is a valuable first step in mitigating bias as it educates individuals on how sources can bias decision making and that bias occurs outside of awareness, which then paves the way to accepting and adopting steps to minimize bias. Our experimental data demonstrated the lack of insight participants had regarding their behaviour. Regardless of how they allocated cause, participants were consistently confident in their decisions and believed their choices were based on an objective assessment of the evidence.</p><p>Investigators with knowledge that bias is affecting and subversive will be motivated to use strategies to mitigate its effects in their decision making.</p><p>The current research revealed interesting questions for future study. For instance, research shows that individuals' propensity to demonstrate different biases varies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gertner et al. 2016)</ref>. Is it useful to obtain a finely-tuned understanding of an individual investigator's tendency to engage in the human error bias? Perhaps this could be achieved via items imbedded in their investigation tools. Once the magnitude of the bias is detected, how might that information be integrated into the process and procedures of the investigation or future training?</p><p>Future research may also consider how an investigators' organizational culture affects their base-rate expectations of human error. Person-centered theories of safety emphasis human traits as a leading factor of event cause and this approach prevails in many organizational settings. However, government and regulatory safety agencies are known to encourage a systems-centered approach to investigation which teaches that events are caused by multiple, interacting human and non-human factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Holden, 2009)</ref>. Agencies adopting a more systemscentered approach tend to use information collection techniques that support broad canvassing of information. One such information collection model is SHELL (Liveware, Software, Hardware, Environment; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Edwards, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hawkins, 1993)</ref>. SHELL encourages information collection about the people involved (Liveware), procedures and resources (Software), physical environment and workplace operations (Environment), as well as, physical structures and equipment (Hardware).</p><p>The professionals in our meta-analysis were largely from industry. Future research should consider if the structure of system-based investigations yields different levels of human error bias at the initial stage of the investigation.</p><p>Future research may examine the generalizability of our findings by conducting experiments that use a variety of industrial incident scenarios and include those findings in the meta-analyses shared in this research. We would also welcome research that explores human error bias and investigative decision making beyond the initial hypothesis stage of the industrial investigation. This would expand the understanding of how numerous complexities found in real-world investigations interact with base-line biases (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Woodcock et al. 2005</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>The current research provided evidence of the biasing effect of professionals' base-rate expectations on their judgments. People have a general tendency to interpret an actor's behaviour more as a function of the actor's disposition than the evidence would support. The current research shows that professionals are not immune from his bias -in fact, this human error tendency is actually amplified with professional investigators. The origins of professionals' stronger bias to see the worker as causal compared to the lay population may be multifaceted, but the implication is singular. Allocating a disproportionate amount of cause to a worker involved in an event undermines the safety of work environments as the role of causal factors, other than the worker, may be underreported and thus not given sufficient attention. Investigator cognitive training, a strong investigation culture and standardized techniques are directions to mitigating human error bias in industrial investigation. Reducing the effect of human error bias will support more complete and accurate understanding of the factors that threaten worker safety and wellbeing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Cause allocation.
