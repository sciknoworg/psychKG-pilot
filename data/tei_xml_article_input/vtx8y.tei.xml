			<abstract>
				<p>Intertemporal choice tasks are used to measure how people make decisions between outcomes spaced out in time. Measurements from those tasks are often used to study impulsivity and self-control, concepts central in theories and empirical research concerning addiction, substance use, psychopathology, and organisational behaviour, among many. Accordingly, preferences for smaller rewards received sooner, over larger rewards received later, have been linked to higher impulsivity and less self-control. This paper is a critique of that approach. To present our argument, we first provide a historical overview of research on time preferences tracking the theoretical link between intertemporal choice, impulsivity, and self-control. Our subsequent conceptual analysis reveals that impulsivity concerns a lack of reflection on one&apos;s choices, not a lack of concern with the future, and self-control concerns internal conflict due to temptation, rather than future-orientedness. People may, and do, use self-control to choose a &quot;smaller-sooner&quot; reward or impulsively select a &quot;larger-later&quot; reward. We also address technical limitations pertaining to the reliability, external and predictive validity of intertemporal choice tasks. We argue that, therefore, impulsivity and self-control cannot be measured</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Many everyday choices have consequences occurring at different timescales. Do I buy a coffee or save my money for later? Do I cycle to work or take the car? Should I eat pizza for dinner or opt for something healthier? Similar dilemmas are faced by organisations and governments, some involving consequences that shape nations. Do we lower fuel taxes to combat inflation, or do we reduce dependency on fossil fuels by building green energy capacity?</p><p>The ubiquity and importance of these choices have resulted in a wealth of research on intertemporal choice. Intertemporal choice involves rewards or costs that can occur at different moments in time. Generally, humans and non-human animals prefer rewards that arrive sooner rather than later, a pattern economists refer to as time preferences. The most prominent economic framework to account for this phenomenon is called delay discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chabris et al., 2010)</ref>. Researchers use delay discounting to explain time preferences by assuming diminishing utility of an option as it moves further away into the future. The rate at which a decision-maker devalues an option as a function of time is known as a "discount factor".</p><p>Delay discounting models can be described as "as-if" models, that is, if agents discount outcomes in the future with some function f(t), where t denotes time, then their utility function takes the form of u(f,X), where X includes sources of enjoyment (positive or negative).</p><p>The agent makes decisions as if they walk around with a (discounted) utility function in their head, using it to adjudicate between options. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fisher (1930)</ref> suggested that discounting the future was fundamental to the economy more generally: the price of capital is merely the discounted value of its expected future income streams. Early delay discounting models <ref type="bibr">(notably, Fisher, 1930;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Samuelson, 1937)</ref> then served as a normative account of intertemporal choice to assist with economic modelling for how interest rates come to be. Though it is fundamental, delay discounting was not developed as a decision-making process model for trading off money and time; it is a parsimonious post-hoc explanation of common decisionmaking patterns. Currently, however, delay discounting models are commonly taken to be both a normative and descriptive account of how people make decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chabris et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ericson &amp; Laibson, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Odum et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The concept of delay discounting found many applications in behavioural sciences. Indeed, many researchers over the years sought to measure individual differences in time preferences to link them to a range of different attitudes and behaviours. To learn more about people's time preferences, behavioural scientists, psychologists, and psychiatrists commonly use the so-called intertemporal choice paradigm. In intertemporal choice tasks, participants are typically asked to choose between options comprised of rewards arriving at different points in time. In each trial, participants must therefore trade off a smaller reward arriving sooner against some larger reward that arrives later, usually (hypothetical) monetary amounts for humans and food rewards for non-human animals. Based on people's responses across multiple trials, researchers then fit people's choices to a delay discounting model and estimate discount factors to quantify individual differences in time preference.</p><p>Central to the thesis of the current work is our observation that researchers who measure time preferences with intertemporal choice tasks, often use these measurements to estimate the level of impulsivity and/or self-control exhibited by an individual decision-maker. More specifically, it is customary across many domains of behavioural sciences to denote those who discount the future strongly as impulsive and those who do not as self-controlled.</p><p>In this paper, we challenge the preconception that impulsivity and self-control are implicated in time preferences, questioning the assumption that they can be measured using intertemporal choice tasks. We begin by providing a historical overview of research on time preferences to track the link between impulsivity, self-control, and time preferences. Using these insights, we conceptualise impulsivity and self-control based on definitions and theories from various relevant disciplines. Next, we evaluate whether impulsivity and self-control are implicated in time preferences, before we discuss issues with estimating reliable discounting parameters, predictive of real-life behaviour. Finally, using these insights, we canvass possible new directions for research on impulsivity and self-control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impulsivity, Self-Control, and Time Preferences in the Literature</head><p>It is common in behavioural science to refer to people's tendency to discount future rewards as impulsive or lacking self-control. To illustrate how commonly this occurs, we have compiled a table with examples of representative, influential articles that discuss impulsivity and self-control in the context of time preferences. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Going back to its roots, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ainslie (2021)</ref> formulated the role of self-control (though he normally refers to "willpower", seemingly taking it to be equivalent) as "choices that evoke willpower typically compare options that pay off over different time courses, with poorer but fasterpaying ones weighed against the better but slower paying".</p><p>In clinical psychology and neuroscience this type of formulation is also common, (for a prominent example, see "Impulsivity: the neurological and behavioural study of discounting";</p><p>Madden <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">&amp; Bickel, 2010)</ref>. For example, Nigg (2017) writes: "Impulsivity: Nonreflective stimulus-driven action when a later-rewarding goal-relevant response was also available ... Mediated by both bottom-up processes (e.g. spontaneous reward valuation/discounting) and top-down processes (e.g. biasing from prior goals; response inhibition)".</p><p>Linking time preferences to impulsivity and self-control is also not uncommon in non-human animal behaviour research; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Laude et al. (2012)</ref> write: "The steepness of the discounting function can be taken as a measure of the degree to which an animal is characterized as impulsive or, the degree to which it lacks self-control ... That is to say, behavioural measures of discounting are often interpreted as indicating the degree of impulsivity". In other texts, the equivalence between present-oriented and future-oriented intertemporal choice patterns, and impulsivity and self-control are tacitly accepted rather than explicitly asserted (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Doyle, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Stevens &amp; Stephens, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>It is worth examining why impulsivity and self-control have come to be conceptualised in this way. Many authors, including some mentioned in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, either reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ainslie (1975),</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Logue (1988)</ref>; Logue, in turn, references <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ainslie (1975)</ref> who is concerned with preference reversals (more on this phenomenon below) and calls this "impulsiveness". Ultimately, this view of time preferences appears to date back to <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fisher (1930)</ref>, who names weakness of will as one of several drivers of discounting future outcomes. That line of reasoning is subsequently continued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Strotz (1955)</ref>, who theorises about why people do things against their best interests. </p></div>

He acknowledges that there are many situations where a preference for smaller-sooner rewards is adaptive and justified, and thus these situations were not of interest to his project.</p><p>According to Ainslie, one is impulsive if by choosing the smaller-sooner reward one reduces their lifetime utility. In this, he focuses on what we now call preference reversals (also known as dynamic inconsistency or common delay effects). A preference reversal occurs when an agent prefers larger-later option A over smaller-sooner option B when both options are temporally distant, but as time goes on (and no new information presents itself in the interim) option B becomes more immediate, at which point the agent prefers B to waiting for option A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ainslie (1975)</ref> suggests that this type of choice is due to curvature in the delay discount function, which was later formalised in the following equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Mazur, 1987)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f (D) = 1 1 + kD (1)</formula><p>where f is the discount factor applied to a reward received after delay D and k is the discount parameter. This is in contrast with the discounted utility model function <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Samuelson, 1937)</ref>, based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fisher (1930)</ref> his theory of interest:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f (D) = e −kD<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where f and D mean the same as above, k is the discount parameter, and e is the base of the natural logarithm. Discounting future rewards through this exponential function never leads to preference reversals. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for a depiction of the different parametric forms of these models.</p><p>In the clinical psychology and neuroscience literature on "choice impulsivity" (i.e., delay discounting), however, Ainslie's more nuanced point that impulsivity and self-control are related to the parametric form of the discount function is often lost. What is denoted as choice impulsivity is instead often associated with the degree of discounting (i.e., the value of k ). Crucially, in the hyperbolic discounting model, the steepness of the function and the parametric form are indissociable because they are both captured by one parameter. The hyperbolic model therefore has no "impulsivity" parameter but a single parameter, partially influenced by impulsivity (in Ainslie's view of the construct). The other common measurement The exponential discounted utility model (blue) and the hyperbolic discounting model (green). As the reward moves further away in time, the decision-maker values it less in the present. In the hyperbolic model, this devaluation is stronger when the reward is closer to the present and attenuates when rewards arrrive further into the future. For the discounted utility model, the devaluation occurs at a constant rate.</p><p>taken is the area under the curve, a mostly theory-neutral measure of the value of future rewards lost to delay discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Myerson et al., 2001)</ref>, which is also uninformative about the convexity of the discount function. There is, thus, a lack of information provided by the parameter estimates most widely taken from intertemporal choice experiments. The entanglement of steepness and convexity in single parameter estimates renders making theoretical claims about impulsivity based on intertemporal choice task responses difficult.</p><p>Yet, this approach is common. In their review on choice impulsivity, Hamilton et al. <ref type="formula">2015</ref>write that choice impulsivity refers to "making impulsive decisions and involves tendencies to select smaller-sooner rewards over larger-later rewards (e.g., the choosing of immediate but smaller versus delayed and larger rewards)". And, that impulsivity can be measured through indifference points, the discount rate, area under the curve, or even, in a model-free way, just by taking the percentage of larger later choices made, noting that "a higher k reflects greater CI [choice impulsivity]".</p><p>In the context of intertemporal choice, impulsivity and self-control are often treated as antitheses. That is, they are not only both implicated in various ways in intertemporal choice, but they are opposites-if you are high in impulsivity, you are low in self-control and vice versa. Authors endorsing this view explicitly put the concepts on opposite ends of the future-oriented decision-making spectrum. Along these lines, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Duckworth and Kern (2011)</ref> write "Several authors have noted the challenge of defining and measuring self-control . . . and its converse, impulsivity or impulsiveness" (emphasis added).</p><p>Taken together, then, it is common to relate measurements of people's time preferences to impulsivity and self-control. Drawing such inferences can be problematic for a number of reasons; we discuss the conceptual issues in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Need for Conceptual Consensus</head><p>There have been many discussions about the relationships between intertemporal choice, impulsivity, and self-control, and indeed, many before us have taken the important step in arguing, much as we will, that self-control does not equate to a lack of present bias or delay discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bulley et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Goschke &amp; Job, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Inzlicht et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Loewenstein, 2018</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Strickland and Johnson (2020)</ref> have suggested that impulsivity should be rejected as a psychological construct, and thus that it cannot be measured using intertemporal choice tasks. We are, however, currently unaware of researchers arguing that time preferences on one hand, and impulsivity and self-control on the other hand, are theoretically distinct.</p><p>Therefore, we intend to go further and examine the possible links impulsivity and self-control might have to time preferences. Given the proliferation of research in this area, we believe a comprehensive discussion is warranted because clarity on this topic will define boundaries and future directions for scientific inquiry.</p><p>One of the problems with a lack of conceptual consensus on a construct is that it could lead to conclusions that do not translate to other domains, or only apply in limited circumstances.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bickel and Marsch (2001)</ref> note in one of their papers: "By identifying such behavioural processes [that result in impulsivity and loss of control] delay discounting may also suggest potential interventions for modifying impulsivity and self-control failure". If delay discounting is not an important part of impulsivity and self-control, their claim could be challenged. For if the concepts are orthogonal, knowing more about delay discounting would not necessarily suggest potential interventions for modifying impulsivity or self-control.</p><p>Another issue with tying impulsivity to short-term rewards and self-control to long-term rewards is that it severely limits the scope of research on the topics. Few studies examine people who are troubled by frequent impulsive future-oriented behaviours (such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kivetz &amp; Keinan, 2006)</ref> or a lack of self-control in attaining short-term rewards. These patterns could play a role in anorexia nervosa (though more research is needed, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Howard et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Levitt et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Steinglass et al., 2012)</ref>, compulsive behaviour patterns such as attentional capture and cognitive hijacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Muela et al., 2022)</ref>, and workaholism <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Taris &amp; de Jonge, 2024)</ref>. It has been argued that in some domains many people are too future-oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Loewenstein, 2018)</ref>. Workaholism is a good example of this because workaholics frequently put work, an activity that predominantly rewards them in the future, before any immediate rewards. In doing so, they often harm their connections with family, community, and their mental health.</p><p>For workaholics, it can take considerable self-control to tear themselves away from their work (more on this in the next section) and do something that is more immediately rewarding (though this depends on the specific preferences of the decision-maker, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Urminsky &amp; Zauberman, 2017)</ref>. In addition, especially with regards to economic decision-making, there has been little discussion of self-control outside the temporal domain. One may, for example, use self-control to overcome selfish motivations to regularly donate money to charity.</p><p>preference, and yet have little to do with the notion of impulsivity and self-control. This would then restrict our ability to draw strong conclusions about impulsivity and self-control based on people's preferences for rewards received at different point in time.</p><p>We illustrate our argument with the following hypothetical decision. Consider Charlie, who</p><p>is an accountant at a large company and is moving to a new city for a different position. Charlie's decision is the type of situation meant to be approximated by intertemporal choice tasks. Researchers want to learn how people like Charlie make decisions with outcomes spaced out over time. The idea, here, is that if Charlie chooses smaller-sooner rewards in the choice task, she would be more likely to choose those in real life too. And, if that is true, then because smaller-sooner rewards are typically associated with impulsivity (e.g., risk-taking, substance use, online shopping) and larger-later rewards are typically associated with self-control (e.g., saving, investing, health, career), intertemporal choice task outcomes are frequently assigned labels of impulsivity and self-control.</p><p>Admittedly, the extent to which Charlie's behaviour reflects impulsivity and self-control depends on our definitions of these constructs. We now turn to different conceptualisations of impulsivity and self-control, linking them with time preferences.</p><p>Conceptualising Impulsivity and Self-Control Impulsivity and self-control both enjoy longstanding philosophical inquiries (for some historical insight, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Goschke &amp; Job, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Madden &amp; Bickel, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Stroud, 2021)</ref>. The constructs were already discussed among the ancient Greeks. The Aristotelian term akrasia (loosely translatable to "weakness of will"), comes in two forms: astheneia, where one has deliberated and decided on the best course of action, but then succumbed to a passion (i.e., a self-control lapse), and propeteia, where the same result occurs but one never deliberated before the act (i.e., impulsivity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Stroud, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>It is not until recently, however, that research on impulsivity and self-control gained momentum.</p><p>As such, it has been susceptible to considerable concept-creep, and as with most topics that use a variety of measures, the jingle-jangle fallacy is common <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dang et al., 2020)</ref>. The phenomenon of concept-creep refers to the application of constructs to tangential phenomena, causing the understanding of those constructs to broaden, as has been observed in the psychology and neuroscience literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Haslam, 2016)</ref>. For impulsivity and self-control, an additional limitation is that research has historically seen a lack of consistency in their conceptualisation.</p><p>Therefore, even in tracing these concepts to their origin, it remains difficult to disentangle exactly how the concepts are expanding. To that effect, De <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wit (2009)</ref> wrote that different definitions of impulsivity incorporate "seemingly unrelated maladaptive behaviours including, for example, inability to wait, difficulty withholding responses and insensitivity to negative or delayed consequences". Since then, we have made little progress on the front of conceptual clarity. It appears prudent to now delineate our understanding of what impulsivity and self-control are.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Conceptual Framework for Impulsivity</head><p>Currently, the most widely used meanings of impulsivity in the literature are derived from various influential works published around the change of the millennium <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Evenden, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Moeller et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Whiteside &amp; Lynam, 2001)</ref>. Impulsivity is considered to be multidimensional <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Huang et al., 2024</ref>). In the model developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Whiteside and Lynam (2001)</ref> and then adapted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cyders (2013)</ref>, impulsivity consists of five dimensions: sensation-seeking, negative urgency, lack of perseverance, lack of premeditation, and positive urgency. Some dimensions can be loosely mapped onto other conceptualisations, for example, one where impulsivity consists of motor impulsivity (response inhibition), cognitive impulsivity (making quick cognitive decisions), and choice impulsivity (delay discounting) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Caswell et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dick et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Green &amp; Myerson, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Patton et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Vassileva &amp; Conrod, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Lastly, impulsivity could be divided into information impulsivity and temporal impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Fenneman et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>There are also widely differing definitions of impulsivity. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Stedman (1995)</ref>: "Impulsive:</p><p>relating to or activated by an impulse rather than controlled by reason or careful deliberation". <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Evenden (1999)</ref> writes "Impulsivity refers to behaviours or acts that are unduly hasty, risky, and inappropriate, leading to negative outcomes", and this conceptualisation is still commonly used.</p><p>Given the diverging schools of thinking on impulsivity, it is important to settle on a conceptualisation that captures the key components of the construct to facilitate clear discussion.</p><p>We will conceptualise impulsivity as both:</p><p>• A predisposition toward unplanned reactions to stimuli.</p><p>• A disregard for the consequences of these reactions.</p><p>This conceptualisation largely follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Moeller et al. (2001)</ref>, which is one of the most commonly used definitions and reflects the complexity of impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Stanford et al., 2009)</ref>. For these reasons, we use it here as our target, although we note that current definitions of impulsivitysuch as this one-have problems (mostly because they are overly inclusive; see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Strickland &amp; Johnson, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>A Conceptual Framework for Self-Control</p><p>There is also disagreement about the proper conceptualisation of self-control. An important factor is that some researchers think of a self-control conflict as tension between short-term temptations and long-term goals (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Duckworth et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Milkman et al., 2008)</ref>,</p><p>while more recently others relax this assumption (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Goschke &amp; Job, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Inzlicht et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Common conceptualisations are that self-control entails a want/should conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Milkman et al., 2008)</ref>, or a conflict where one has emotional desires, drives and motivational feeling states (such as pain) on the one hand, and deliberation on the other hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Loewenstein, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Loewenstein et al., 2015)</ref>. These views correspond with elements of our commonsense (pre-theoretical) concept of self-control but are not without their disagreements. The want/should conflict is also unduly cast in a short-term versus long-term conflict. And even when abstracting away from that issue, it appears that the deliberative option in such a selfcontrol conflict might not always entail a "should". The deliberative option in a self-control conflict often also represents or stems from, a "want" (unless, perhaps, wants are taken to be equivalent to affect). For instance, one could, after much deliberation, decide to take a day off in a few weeks to go to a theme park because they want to spend time with the kids (i.e., a deliberative want).</p><p>Baumeister and Alghamdi (2015) are not far off from these views. They write "self-control is what enables people to override impulses and responses so as to do something else, especially something that is more highly valued". Self-control could otherwise be understood as the opposite of weakness of will (an over-readiness to revise a resolution; <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Holton, 2009)</ref>, or as enkrateia -the opposite of akrasia <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kraut, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Mele, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Mele, , 2012</ref>, where an agent fails to act in accordance with reason or better judgment (i.e., an individual judges X to be best but does Y instead).</p><p>Another class of theories conceives of self-control as goal-based. That is, self-control is either something that can be used to protect superordinate goals from temptation or habitual responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013)</ref>, or to advance certain goals (or motives) over others <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Fujita, 2011)</ref>. For example, depending on their goals, a person could fail to exhibit self-control by eating chocolate in the evening or by biting their nails when nervous.</p><p>There are many distinct theories of self-control, and an exhaustive discussion of them is beyond the scope of the present paper. For the purpose of our work, we will broadly conceptualise self-control conflicts as those that concern deliberation versus temptation. That is, situations</p><p>where the agent has a view on the best course of action but has conflicting desires. We take self-control to entail both willpower or interventive self-control-adopting strategies to avoid giving into present temptation-and preventive self-control or precommitment strategieschanging the decision-making environment such that the temptation is removed or made less attractive in some way (e.g., not buying any unhealthy snacks to take home; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baumeister &amp; Vohs, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>To evaluate how intertemporal choice relates to self-control, we will not take self-control to necessarily entail temporal aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Goschke &amp; Job, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Inzlicht et al., 2021)</ref>. The reasons for using self-control may also extend into the social domain, for example. Our conceptualisation can handle these situations: an individual may see that it is best to donate a large sum of money to those in need, but be tempted to spend it on their new smartphone of choice.</p><p>The Relationship Between Impulsivity and Self-Control</p><p>Based on the above conceptualisations and definitions, impulsivity cannot be the converse of self-control. Impulsivity mainly consists of acting with a disregard to consequences, or lack of deliberation or premeditation, and does not need to involve an imbalance of want over should, nor of temptation over judgment. It is possible, for instance, to use self-control to be impulsive:</p><p>"I should do more things I enjoy doing without thinking about all the consequences; I should live a little!". Or, for the alternative understandings of self-control, we may think it best to, or have a goal to enjoy life and discard the weight of society's expectations, rather than be tempted to or habitually think about consequences all the time. If we then act impulsively, we have not necessarily experienced a lapse in self-control.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Control</head><p>To understand the roles of impulsivity and self-control in time preferences, we must evaluate whether intertemporal choice patterns fulfil the necessary and sufficient conditions of impulsivity and self-control (as we defined them above). In other words, we must evaluate whether time preferences map onto impulsivity and self-control in a meaningful way, to see if it is valid to measure individual differences in impulsivity and self-control using intertemporal choice tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions of Impulsivity</head><p>Steep delay discounting, or temporal myopia (short-sightedness), is implicated in impulsive behaviours, such as substance use and behavioural addictive disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Verdejo-García et al., 2008)</ref>. People with substance use disorders, for example, are regarded as impulsive in their inability to suppress the urge to consume their drug of choice (i.e., succumbing to the smaller-sooner reward). However, this correlation does not mean that steep delay discounting is necessary or sufficient for an individual to be impulsive. It is just as likely that impulsivity and time preferences contribute separately to addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(De Wit, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>One example of this would be a person who is prompted by their employer to pick a pension scheme. They are asked to answer a multiple-choice question on the proportion of their salary they would like to put into their pension fund. Courtesy of some behavioural economists working for the company, the default option is the one with the highest proportion of income that goes to their pension. Without thinking too much about their budget constraints, the person proceeds with the default option <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Jachimowicz et al., 2019)</ref>. Here, their choice of a future-oriented option was impulsive. This shows that making present-oriented decisions, or excessively discounting time delays of rewards, is not necessary for someone to be impulsive.</p><p>Next, to see whether excessive delay discounting or preference reversals are sufficient for impulsivity, we will use the earlier example of Charlie, who had clearly thought through changing her earlier decision to choose the smaller-sooner reward, at a cost of $25,000. Her preference reversal should tell us her discounting fits the hyperbolic model better than the exponential model, and the amount she pays for speeding up her move indicates steep</p><p>discounting. Yet to say she was impulsive in her subsequent decision to move in at the earlier date would be inaccurate because there was no lack of deliberation or hasty reaction associated with her choice. Therefore, strong delay discounting is not sufficient for impulsivity.</p><p>Indeed, one may say that her initial decision to wait with the move until December was impulsive. She may not have thought through the consequences that moving twice would have on her wellbeing and performance. Does her choosing the larger-later reward preclude her initial decision from being impulsive? We think not.</p><p>Therefore, even though impulsive behaviours may correlate with delay discounting in some cases, that does not mean that steep delay discounting reflects impulsivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions of Self-Control</head><p>In the intertemporal choice literature, a tendency to choose larger-later options is often denoted as a self-controlled choice pattern. A plausible explanation of this time-bound conceptualisation of self-control is that choosing the larger-later option connects with some aspect of self-control, namely delay of gratification (such as in the marshmallow test <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mischel et al., 1989)</ref>. However, the temporal aspect of these delay of gratification experiments is not the part that indicates self-control in the subject.</p><p>If the most famous version of the marshmallow test experiment (i.e., waiting 15 minutes for a second marshmallow) is changed marginally, such that the first reward is an apple, while the second reward that requires waiting ten minutes is two marshmallows, it is easy to see that choosing the apple-the smaller-sooner reward, hardly as rewarding for most children as two marshmallows-could be the reward that indicates self-control. Children are generally aware that the apple is something they should eat, whereas the marshmallows are something they want to eat, even if they must wait for them (as evidenced by the findings of Mischel and colleagues). This indicates that waiting for a larger-later reward is not necessary for self-control; one can be self-controlled without choosing the larger-later option.</p><p>To establish whether shallow delay discounting (i.e., the discounting curve has a gentle gradient) is sufficient for self-control, consider an extremely future-oriented (i.e., hyperopic) agent, who wishes they made more present-oriented decisions because they want to enjoy themselves more in the present moment <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Kivetz &amp; Keinan, 2006)</ref>. This sophisticated hyperopic agent may judge it best to enjoy themselves today and go to dinner with their friend. They therefore intend to not do any penny pinching; to just be in the moment. When the waiter comes, however, they cannot help but succumb to temptation, even though they realise their goal was to forget about these considerations. As a result, they choose the cheapest wine on the menu-the others are so expensive! Such hyperopic behaviour would be indicative of a lack of self-control because the tempting option wins out over the deliberative option. or a discrepancy between deliberation and temptation).</p><p>Thus, unless we can prove that a participant feels that they think it best to pick the $100, but are tempted by the $80 today, and ends up choosing the latter, it is difficult to argue that they lack self-control if they choose the smaller-sooner option. Therefore, elicited time preferences on their own cannot be seen as self-controlled or not self-controlled.</p><p>Considering that time preferences do not satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions of impulsivity and self-control, we can conclude that the three constructs are dissociable. In future writing about time preferences (e.g., in intertemporal choice research), we recommend using specific descriptors about the patterns we observe instead, such as present bias, degrees of future-orientation, and apparent uses of heuristics.</p><p>What Can Be Learnt About Impulsivity and Self-Control Through</p><p>Intertemporal Choice?</p><p>If we accept that time preferences are neither necessary nor sufficient for impulsivity and self-control, or even that the study of these constructs with standard measurements from the intertemporal choice task is uninformative, then we should critically evaluate what we can learn from this paradigm at all.</p><p>Recall that Ainslie's original position was that impulsivity corresponds to preference reversals.</p><p>In other words, intertemporal choice tasks could tell us about people's "impulsive" tendency to switch from larger later to smaller sooner rewards as the time progresses. However, this position is also problematic for several reasons. To illustrate why, we return to the example of Charlie facing a choice of when to move to her new home.</p><p>Some time has now passed since Charlie opted for moving in in December (the later date), at a lower cost. Now, in September, Charlie reconsiders accepting David's proposal for expediting her move. She thinks it will be a great home to start her new job from. It is within cycling distance to her office and the house was recently renovated, thus needing minimal work. Given the size and location, it is also reasonably priced. If she chose to wait, she would have to move twice and start her new job in temporary housing (which she would also have to spend time looking for). She would like to avoid this because she wants to be in a good head-space for her new job. Ultimately, Charlie changes her mind and decides that it would be best to take the option to move in earlier. In other words, she would now prefer to incur the $25k cost to forego these inconveniences.</p><p>Charlie's decision to incur additional costs and move in sooner, most would agree, is not impulsive. Equally, it would appear odd to claim that Charlie lacks self-control. Indeed, her decision seems deliberate and based on sound and careful evaluation of the pros and cons of each option, which speaks against labelling her behaviour as impulsive. Her decision can also be explained with respect to Charlie's goals; she was not tempted by something that works against her goals. Yet, the decision made by Charlie is regarded as analogous to intertemporal choice tasks. In such a task, if a person opted for a smaller-sooner reward (or in this case, larger cost sooner) this person would be assumed to be impulsive or lacking (or failing to exercise) self-control.</p><p>Certainly, given Charlie's preference reversal (she prefers the later outcome initially, then changes her preference to the sooner outcome), her decision-making would be better described by hyperbolic discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ainslie, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Thaler, 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Thaler, , 1981</ref> than exponential discounting.</p><p>Though Charlie's discounting may not follow the traditional normative decision-making model, it is not clear why she was impulsive or lacked self-control.</p><p>Our argument here is that even if we use intertemporal choice tasks to record people's tendency to reverse their preferences, we would still be limited in our ability to make claims about decision-makers' impulsivity and self-control.</p><p>A counter-argument is that a reader might endorse different definitions of impulsivity or selfcontrol. It could then be possible that intertemporal choice task outcomes speak to impulsivity or self-control processes beyond ones that we defined here. In other words, there could still be value in estimating either a discount factor or the hyperbolic-ness of ones preferences.</p><p>We would note that even if readers do not agree with our definitions of impulsivity and/or self-control, the majority of our conclusions about the intertemporal choice paradigm would still hold. Broader conceptions that incorporate time preferences would need to admit multiple sub-dimensions of the construct. See, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fenneman et al. (2022)</ref> split impulsivity into information impulsivity (most closely aligned with how we describe impulsivity here) and temporal impulsivity (time preferences). If such terms are preferred by the reader, it is possible to swap the terms and take the arguments relating to impulsivity, for example, to be an examination of the dissociability of information and temporal impulsivity.</p><p>It is also possible that even though delay discounting does not meaningfully represent impulsivity or self-control as we define them, it may be used as an instrumental variable in cases where the validity of self-report responses on clinical questionnaires is especially tenuous (e.g., for individuals with memory deficits). To be useful in this respect, impulsivity and self-control measures would need to correlate strongly with delay discounting parameters.</p><p>However, research correlating impulsivity with delay discounting has produced mixed results (for extensive discussion, see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Odum, 2011)</ref>. Some studies have found no correlation, or even negative ones (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lane et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Mitchell, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Reynolds et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">White et al., 1994)</ref>. Other studies did report a positive correlation of varying magnitudes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cherek et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">De Wit et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kirby et al., 1999)</ref>. More generally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cyders and Coskunpinar (2011)</ref> conducted a meta-analysis of 27 studies comparing self-report and behavioural measures of impulsivity and failed to demonstrate a strong relationship between 'delay response' tasks, of which intertemporal choice is one, and dimensions of impulsivity, even before correcting for publication bias (for Sensation Seeking: r = 0.031-0.094). In a more recent work, Huang et al. (2024) collected data from 1676 participants who completed 10 behavioural tasks and 10 self-reported tasks designed to measure impulsivity. The bi-factor solution showed a general factor of impulsivity, along with four latent factors, two of which related to some survey-based measures, and two that corresponded to behavioural tasks. Crucially, however, the intertemporal choice tasks were neither strongly correlated with the general impulsivity factor, nor with any of the remaining factors. In fact, behaviour on the task was only weakly correlated with other behavioural tasks (e.g., Balloon Analogue Risk Task). All of these results reinforce the idea that any intertemporal choice outcome would be a poor measure of any definition of impulsivity.</p><p>Evidence of convergent validity (strong correlations between different instruments designed to assess a common construct) is the minimum requirement for the validity of any psychological test <ref type="bibr">(Fiske, 1971, p.164)</ref>. Although one could also attribute this lack of convergent validity to poor reliability, validity, or inadequate measurement invariance (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Enkavi et al., 2019)</ref>. Additionally, behavioural measures are generally designed to maximise within-subject variability rather than between-subject variability, and tend to measure granular state information rather than accumulated trait information (but see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Odum, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Odum &amp; Baumann, 2010)</ref>. Regardless of which interpretation is correct, it appears unlikely that intertemporal choice measures are directly measuring impulsivity, and further, that they might not be good instrumental variables for this construct.</p><p>A potential reason for this lack of correlation between time preferences, impulsivity and self-control is that the effect of non-exponential discounting on real-life behaviour may be modulated by whether one is naïve or sophisticated about future self-control problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Rabin, 2015)</ref>. That is, if one realises that their preferences will revert when a tempting reward approaches, they can employ strategies to reduce their chance of succumbing to temptation (e.g., by precommitment strategies or by removing the temptation). This illustrates that an important aspect of impulsivity and self-control is taken away in intertemporal choice experiments: there is no temptation to go back on the initial decision. Thus, there is no deliberation-temptation conflict. In other words, we find out whether Odysseus decides to tie himself to the mast, but we attain no information on the journey past the sirens.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(O'Donoghue &amp; Rabin, 1998) (further discussion in O'Donoghue &amp;</formula><p>Another problem is that eliciting true time preferences with the money-earlier-or-later type of intertemporal choice experiments is difficult because there are problems such as trust in payment reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andreoni &amp; Sprenger, 2012)</ref> and because time preferences for money should be, and often are, different from preferences for consumption (for a discussion of limitations, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cubitt &amp; Read, 2007)</ref>. Moreover, true time preferences may only be elicited when individuals face exceptional liquidity restraints (only then participants show how they allocate their budget over time) or if they engage in narrow choice bracketing (i.e., deciding without taking outside options into account; <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Rabin &amp; Weizsäcker, 2009)</ref>, an assumption that is often violated (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Oberrauch &amp; Kaiser, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, another possible reason for the lack of evidence on convergent validity is that the influence of time preference on impulsive behaviours and self-control varies depending on the domain. That is, time preferences are likely important for the extent to which people deliberate the consequences of their actions, and how tempted they are to choose temptations over better judgment. However, the direction of the influence depends on what the stimuli, rewards, shoulds and wants are <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Harris, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hursh &amp; Schwartz, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Weatherly &amp; Terrell, 2010</ref>). If we again consider a hyperopic agent: their time preferences play a role in causing them to make (potentially impulsive) future-oriented decisions, whereas, for someone with a substance use disorder, their time preferences contribute to high valuation of rewards that are immediately available. Time preferences may inhibit both types of agents' ability to consider the consequences at the time or to act in accordance with their better judgment.</p><p>Therefore, both future-oriented time preferences and present-oriented time preferences can cause impulsivity and (lapses of) self-control.</p><p>Taken together, intertemporal choice research appears to be an ineffective way to investigate impulsivity and self-control. Part of the reason for this ineffectiveness is the lack of consideration of the broader context in typical experiments. Yet that need not deter us from researching the impact of time preferences on impulsive behaviour and lapses in self-control, since time preferences may have a different role in the manifestation of these behaviours that has not captured by traditional intertemporal choice task-based research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational Modelling</head><p>One possibility for decision-making models would be to develop an impulsivity parameter.</p><p>As such, many models developed since the hyperbolic discounting model focus on accounting for a particular set of choice anomalies <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Loewenstein &amp; Prelec, 1992)</ref>, or on incorporating additional, more psychologically plausible parameters.</p><p>A prominent alternative is quasi-hyperbolic discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Laibson, 1997)</ref>, where discounting is composed of two parameters where one represents present bias, while the other is the discount rate. Such a model resolves the under-specification issue discussed before, of having one parameter govern both the steepness and convexity of the discount function.</p><p>Another commonly used model is the Constant Sensitivity model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ebert &amp; Prelec, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>This model is attractive because it can achieve a similar convex shape as the hyperbolic model, while it can also have the shape of the exponential model. It can can also functionally resemble the quasi-hyperbolic model, allowing for immediacy effects. This model can, thus, capture many different behavioural patterns in intertemporal choice.</p><p>Some of the other most commonly used alternative models belong to a class called "hyperboloid" models (for a comprehensive list, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">He et al., 2022)</ref>. These usually add a time sensitivity parameter. The Myerson-Green model <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Myerson &amp; Green, 1995)</ref> and the Modified Rachlin model <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Rachlin, 2006)</ref>-the original suffers from muddled units so using that one to estimate discounting parameters is ill-advised <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Vincent &amp; Stewart, 2020)</ref>-are examples of this.</p><p>Even though these models have many virtues and their iterations render the delay discounting framework closer to the psychological processes underlying human time perception and preferences in the lab, most of the problems we have discussed remain. This is due to two reasons. First, much of our critique challenged the notion that intertemporal choice task measures anything about a person's impulsivity or self-control. Model fitting exercises are typically restricted to data from simple intertemporal choice tasks, and so this renders them particularly ill suited for estimating anything about people's propensity to be impulsive or lack self-control. Second, we note that the delay discounting framework was not intended as a process model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ericson et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">He et al., 2019)</ref>, so by design it is unlikely that psychological concepts such as impulsivity and self-control will map onto discounting model parameters in any variation.</p><p>To illustrate this point: there have been many reports of anomalies and biases in intertemporal choice that cannot be accounted for by traditional delay discounting models, including findings of subadditive discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Read, 2001)</ref>, query-order effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Loewenstein &amp; Thaler, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Weber et al., 2007)</ref>, date/delay effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Read et al., 2005)</ref>, similarity effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Rubinstein, 2003)</ref>, and delay/speedup asymmetry <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Loewenstein, 1988)</ref>, suggesting that intertemporal choice is not well described by either exponential or hyperbolic delay discounting models.</p><p>If delay discounting is not the right way to describe what humans do because it is not the mechanism through which they "solve" intertemporal choices they typically face, then we might need to seriously reconsider claims made based on differences in delay discounting parameters (not limited to those concerning impulsivity and self-control). It might be, for</p><p>instance, that what most people actually do can be captured by an attribute-based additive model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ericson et al., 2015)</ref>. The researchers who use such models will then need to figure out what it is about the application of this model (e.g., the weights allocated to attributes)</p><p>that is indicative of addictions and other disorders, for example. Even if we do know what model fits best on aggregate, though, there will be between-person variance in how people make decisions. Making inferences about any individual's cognitive processes based on a parameter estimate from the best-performing model for the aggregate will, in many cases, not be justified.</p><p>But even if we could all agree on a single model, the chances are that choices from the standard intertemporal choice task would not be sufficient to estimate model parameters.</p><p>Indeed, in a systematic analysis of 11 prominent discounting models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ballard et al. (2023)</ref> found that parameter recoverability was generally poor and correlations between parameters across different models were low.</p><p>Though it is clear that computational modelling solutions will have limited success if they are fitted to standard intertemporal choice task data, it is good to define the boundaries of what the wide range of extant models can do or explain <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(He et al., 2022)</ref>. Many useful insights can be drawn from fitting cognitive process models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Konstantinidis et al., 2020)</ref>, such as the Drift Diffusion Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Krajbich &amp; Rangel, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Peters &amp; D'Esposito, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2019)</ref>. It is likely such modelling methods could enable insights on impulsivity and self-control, partly because they are not tied to the intertemporal choice paradigm. We could foresee, for example, that the drift rate in the Drift Diffusion Model may correlate with impulsivity measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context Dependence</head><p>Using non-intertemporal choice modelling methods to study impulsivity and self-control allows for research to move away from the current focus on time preferences. Intertemporal choice can then be studied as merely one of the domains where these processes are in play (just as in risky choice, multi-attribute choice, prosocial/altruistic behaviour). The relationship between time preferences, and impulsivity and self-control will only matter for choices and behaviour where a) the outcomes of options vary meaningfully along the temporal axis and b) those outcomes are known and salient to the agent. This limitation means that, for example, knowing the interplay between an agent's impulsivity, self-control and time preferences will tell us little about whether they will buy an ice cream or use their self-control to donate to charity.</p><p>The importance of considering context in interpreting intertemporal choices as self-controlled or impulsive highlights the inherent incommensurability of everyday choice. Often the options available sooner or later are very different, mapping on different goals and objectives of a decision-maker. Although intertemporal choice tasks are an attempt to elicit preferences as context-free situation as possible, many everyday choices are difficult, and maybe even impossible on account of their incommensurability and incomparability <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Walasek &amp; Brown, 2023</ref>).</p><p>Research on impulsivity and self-control should turn toward contexts outside of the intertemporal, especially because the adaptivity of those traits or states is context-dependent (for evidence on this regarding impulsivity, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fenneman et al., 2022)</ref>. Moreover, people are known to employ many self-control strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hennecke et al., 2019)</ref>, which are likely to vary in prevalence and success rates across domains.</p><p>As of yet, little is known about dynamic use of such strategies in everyday choices.</p><p>Our position, therefore, is that standard intertemporal choice tasks should not be used to assess impulsivity or self-control. But, tasks can be conceived that measure impulsivity and self-control as cognitive processes, while measuring time preferences as outcomes. For instance, this could come in the form of physiological measurements or decision process modelling during intertemporal choice tasks or a modified delay of gratification paradigm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>The policy implications of the arguments we presented concern the targeting of interventions at the right cognitive construct. For instance, if the policy goal is to increase savings, then it is good to have a clear understanding of how time preferences for consumption, and impulsivity and self-control relate. In this scenario, one potential strategy is to temporarily change time preferences by getting banks to suggest in-app savings goals that prompt episodic future thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Peters &amp; Büchel, 2010)</ref>. Or, by capitalising on people's impulsivity, banks could prompt people with a suggested contribution of 5% of their paycheck to their investment account. Self-control can also be facilitated by offering savings accounts that only unlock deposited money after a fixed term, or accounts that offer higher interest rates when the money is untouched for longer. Understanding how these three concepts differ increases the number of conceivable policy options and allows decision-makers to choose according to their goals. This all is of course not to deny that there are more standard policy instruments, such as raising interest rates.</p><p>The most important implication of the current work for the general public concerns the stigmatisation of behaviours associated with time preferences, impulsivity, and a lack of self-control. This work, hopefully, elucidates some of the (sometimes conflicting) cognitive mechanisms that lead up to people's decisions. Not knowing the details of the situation or thinking process surrounding Charlie's decision to speed up the purchase of the house in our earlier example may prompt certain judgments about her decision, such as that she was capricious or irrational. Arguably, the same stigmatisation processes occur for people who suffer from addiction and a variety of mental health issues (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Delfabbro et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Hing, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Sheehan et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, we believe it is important that people know how the cognitive processes we discuss may conflict and how this relates to their goals. For example, if one tends to do things without thinking, and if this tendency produces issues in everyday life, one could consider to only make that choice when not in an impulsive state (e.g., not going to the supermarket when hungry) or remove the choice in question altogether (e.g., swap chores with someone, so you are not tempted by the unhealthy foods at the supermarket at all).</p><p>More generally, it is worth exploring how impulsivity and self-control relate to wellbeing in different contexts and in relation to different goals. As we discussed earlier, some people may wish to improve their wellbeing by being more impulsive in their decisions what movie to watch, or by working less and enjoying themselves in a moment. Excessive future-orientation can be harmful in many contexts but not in others. For example, some eating disorders but stimulating more future-oriented preferences could be beneficial for someone battling gambling disorder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We discussed how impulsivity and self-control are conceptualised in the intertemporal choice literature, and how they are used to denote choice patterns in intertemporal choice and thus time preferences. We considered whether various time preferences satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions for impulsivity and self-control, and whether they may play a different role in impulsive and self-controlled behaviours.</p><p>We suggest that common ways of conceptualising impulsivity and self-control would require us to conclude that time preferences, impulsivity, and self-control contribute independently to real-world choices between options involving different timescales. Resulting from this observation, we argue that impulsivity and self-control are unlikely to play an important role in standard intertemporal choice tasks. We also discuss whether we should attach any cognitive labels to delay discounting parameters because delay discounting models were not designed to capture cognitive processes.</p><p>We conclude that we should, therefore, a) dissociate time preferences from impulsivity and self-control, and thus b) not assume that we measure impulsivity and self-control through delay discounting parameters, and thus also not c) assume that people who tend to be impulsive (self-controlled) will prefer present-oriented (future-oriented) options.</p><p>We suggest that time preferences play a separate causal role from impulsivity and self-control in manifestations of impulsive behaviours and lapses in self-control through affecting the emergence and intensity of desires and temptations. We speculate that the direction of this influence depends on the stimulus and context. This would mean that, for example, future-oriented time preferences could cause more impulsive behaviour in certain domains. Such a causal model strikes us as a useful future research target, the workings of which are, however, difficult to discern as long as impulsivity and self-control remain tied too closely with time preferences in research.</p><p>Our conceptualisation puts pressure on preconceptions about the connections between time preferences, impulsivity, and self-control. We are hoping that this invites scrutiny, where this scrutiny leads us to a clearer understanding of the role of time preferences in impulsivity and self-control.</p><p>Declarations org/10.3758/s13423-019-01579-9</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The exponential discounted utility model (blue) and the hyperbolic discounting model (green).

After showing her the property, David says he would accept an offer from Charlie of $1 million if she moved in December. But Charlie notes that she might want to move in right away when she arrives to start her new job in October. David tells her they could arrange for this to happen, but that this would be inconvenient for him. To accommodate Charlie's plan, David and his family would need to stay somewhere else and move all their belongings twice. Therefore, David suggests that he would accept Charlie's offer and let her move in October if she added $25,000 to the $1 million initially proposed. That is, Charlie now faces a choice between speeding up the purchase by two months for a 2.5% increase in cost. At this point, since that her moving date is still a long time away, Charlie says she would be fine with December.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

The story shows that the contrary is true: shallow delay discounting, or a lack of curvature in the delay discounting function is not sufficient for self-control because it was a lapse of self-control that led the agent to this future-oriented choice.Finally, taking this reasoning one step further, what this example shows is that eliciting preferences via an intertemporal choice task without knowledge of contextual factors is incompatible with the study of self-control. A preference, in the economic sense relevant to intertemporal choice, is a combination of wants, shoulds, goals, temptations, and other social and contextual factors (i.e., there is no way of telling whether there is a want/should conflict,</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
