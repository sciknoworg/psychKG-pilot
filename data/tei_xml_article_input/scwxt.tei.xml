			<abstract>
				<p>There is an urgent need for scalable mental health interventions, particularly for workers in under-resourced settings who experience high stress and limited access to mental health resources. One promising approach is enhancing workers&apos; emotion regulation skills. Although previous literature suggests promise, the long-term effectiveness of this approach is unknown. The present study evaluated a scalable intervention that taught reappraisal-an emotion regulation strategy that alters how individuals interpret challenging situations. We tested this intervention nationwide among low-and middle-income workers (e.g., drivers, teachers, food service workers) in early education, one of the most stressful and under-resourced sectors in the United States. Study 1 (n = 1,967), a pre-registered field survey, found positive correlations among reappraisal use, emotional well-being, and job performance. Study 2, a pre-registered longitudinal field experiment (n = 4,054), found lasting improvements in some emotional wellbeing and workplace outcomes (e.g., job performance, quit intentions, and impatient decisionmaking) from the reappraisal intervention (vs. active control) six months later. These studies provide the first evidence of reappraisal&apos;s durable effects over time in the workplace, establishing it as a scalable and enduring strategy for improving worker well-being and performance across diverse occupational settings. Globally, a growing number of people report low levels of emotional well-being 1-3 , which is undesirable not only in itself but also because it can lead to numerous adverse physical, psychological, and behavioral consequences 4-16. One particularly important domain is the workplace, where low levels of emotional well-being can undermine job performance and job commitment, potentially putting their own employment and the organization&apos;s objectives at risk 17,18. In fact, most people tend to experience their lowest emotional well-being while working compared to other daily activities 19-21 , making workplace well-being both a pressing concern and a prime target for intervention. Can we develop scalable interventions to enhance emotional well-being at work-and, in turn, improve workplace outcomes? Emerging evidence points to one promising candidate: an emotion regulation strategy called reappraisal. Reappraisal involves changing how one thinks about situations in order to change one&apos;s emotional reactions 22. For example, instead of thinking of a child&apos;s challenging behavior as a sign of disrespect, a teacher can reappraise it as an unintentional act designed to attract attention-one that presents the opportunity for skill development. This shift in perspective may reduce frustration and increase patience. Given reappraisal&apos;s previously demonstrated adaptability, simplicity, and efficiency 23-26 , it holds potential for enhancing emotional well-being among workers in a variety of workplace contexts. While promising, the long-term effectiveness of reappraisal interventions, especially in a scalable format, on emotional well-being remains an open question. Reappraisal interventions&apos; impact on emotional well-being has not been shown to persist beyond two months 27. While some research showed that a two-week reappraisal intervention improved emotional well-being up to four weeks 28 , its approach presents scalability challenges by requiring a one-on-one live session followed by two weeks of daily writing. Additionally, their control condition was a passive</p>

Other work attempted to develop a reappraisal intervention in a highly scalable format (online, self-guided, no more than an hour), but found no significant effects on emotional well-being against an active control condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">29</ref> . This was likely because, for scalable reappraisal interventions to work durably, they need to take an ecologically-valid account of participants' contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">31</ref> .</p><p>In the current study, we examined the longer-term (six-month) effects of a scalable reappraisal intervention against an active control condition and drew on community-based participatory research strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref> in designing the intervention. We conducted 35 qualitative interviews with the target population (see supplementary information for details), presented our findings, and actively solicited feedback from the target population and related stakeholders. The insights gained from these preparations allowed us to gain a more precise understanding of the target population's contexts and to design materials-such as videos, examples, and quotes-that aimed to be as helpful as possible.</p><p>Beyond contributing to understanding the durability of reappraisal interventions, this study is the first to evaluate their effects among workers in the field and include downstream workplace outcomes. Although reappraisal interventions have demonstrated benefits for emotional well-being in university samples and the general community <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref> , the evidence primarily comes from short-term laboratory studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">38</ref> . No studies have examined reappraisal intervention's impact among workers. This gap matters because stressful workplace contexts may serve as a critical test of the boundary conditions for reappraisal interventions. Attempts to use reappraisal can fail under stress or even backfire for certain types of stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref> , leaving its applicability to workplace stressors uncertain. Moreover, reappraisal might heighten mental fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">43</ref> , making it less suited for workplace settings.</p><p>In the current study, we examined a nationwide sample of workers affiliated with publicly funded Head Start agencies. Established in 1965, Head Start is the oldest and largest program of its kind, providing comprehensive early childhood education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement services to low-income children and families. A diverse range of workers supports these services, with occupations that include, but are not limited to, education, health, food service, transportation, and management (see supplementary information for a breakdown of participants' occupations). Many of these workers have low incomes, as the early childhood education field ranks among the most underpaid professions in the U.S., receiving wages lower than 98% of all other occupations and grappling with poverty rates 7.7 times higher than teachers in the K-8 system <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">45</ref> . In many ways, the challenges faced by early education workers reflect those of the primary education sector and service provision sectors as a whole, where stress and job dissatisfaction levels are significantly higher than in most other fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">47</ref> . Unsurprisingly, the early childhood education and child care sectors are facing a national shortage of care providers and teachers, driven by factors such as chronic low compensation and challenging job conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref> . This crisis is evident in the closure of many classrooms due to staff vacancies and high turnover, disrupting the much-needed continuity for children from vulnerable families.</p><p>Given the urgency of the issue and its national scope, developing a scalable emotional well-being intervention would be particularly useful. While a reappraisal intervention by no means obviates the need for broader structural changes e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">50</ref> , the easy implementation and scalability of the reappraisal intervention make it a good target for population-level impact, even if it addresses only some of the pressing problems these workers face.</p><p>Most prior intervention programs for supporting workers in the education sector have required significant time, effort, and resources to deliver and complete, leading to difficulties with feasibility, acceptability, uptake, and scalability <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">51</ref> . A recent review concludes that the effort to improve education workers' well-being is "still in its formation phase," and that "interventions -as well as the scientific study of such interventions -are quite novel in this context" 52 .</p><p>To address these gaps, we conducted two pre-registered studies. Study 1, a field survey, tested the hypothesis that greater reappraisal use would correlate with better emotional wellbeing and job performance among a nationwide sample of Head Start workers. Study 2, a longitudinal field experiment, tested the hypothesis that a scalable reappraisal intervention would lead to long-term improvements in emotional well-being and workplace outcomes in the same population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Open science statement. In keeping with guidelines for open, fully reproducible science <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">53</ref> , we pre-registered both studies and posted all pre-registrations, materials, data, and analysis code at: https://osf.io/9awj3/?view_only=6a2645fdda164851a51be07c00f0b3d3. We report any deviations from our pre-registrations in the Methods section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>We conducted a field survey at a national conference run by the National Head Start Association.</p><p>We promoted the online survey in the conference app and a plenary session. Participants were a nationwide sample of Head Start workers (n = 1,967). We pre-registered the hypotheses that selfreported reappraisal use would be positively associated with emotional well-being and self-reported job performance. As expected, reappraisal use was significantly associated with higher scores on the pre-registered, multifaceted index of emotional well-being (r = 0.16, 95% CI = [0.12, 0.21], t(1,965) = 7.35, P &lt; 0.001) and higher scores on the self-reported job performance measure (r = 0.05, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.10], t(1,965) = 2.32, P = 0.020). Unregistered exploratory analysis showed a largely similar magnitude of relationships across different occupations and that reappraisal use was significantly associated with higher scores on every facet of emotional well-being (see supplementary information for details). Hence, the findings illuminate the positive associations with reappraisal in a national sample of workers across various occupations and emotional well-being indicators. These encouraging results paved the way for our subsequent study, aimed at exploring the causal impacts of reappraisal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>We conducted a pre-registered longitudinal field experiment, examining the causal impacts of teaching reappraisal versus an active control condition. We invited Head Start workers across the U.S. to participate in three sequential online wellness activities.</p><p>The first online activity taught participants an emotion regulation strategy (reappraisal in the reappraisal condition, or reflection in the active control condition) through five interactive components. The first component involved watching two brief video clips (developed by our team) that introduced a technique (reappraisal or reflection), followed by answering attentioncheck questions. The second component involved reading two examples of the technique's application. The third component involved participants writing about an emotional challenge they faced at work and outlining how they would apply the technique to address the challenge.</p><p>The fourth component involved reading quotes from peers discussing their use of the technique.</p><p>The fifth component involved participants composing a letter to a new colleague, wherein they taught the technique, leveraging the saying-is-believing effect to enhance learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">54</ref> . The two follow-up activities served as assessments and boosters.</p><p>Below, we first describe the immediate effects of learning reappraisal, and then describe the long-term effects (measured at six months). We report raw means and standard deviations for relevant measure in supplementary information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random Assignment Checks and Exclusion Rules</head><p>We elected to report the results without applying pre-registered exclusion rules for two reasons.</p><p>First, some thresholds in the pre-registered exclusion rules were arbitrary (e.g., the number of words in a writing task), and applying these rules unexpectedly excluded more than a third of participants (38.63%), compromising generalizability. Second, applying the pre-registered exclusion rules unexpectedly led to significant differences in a few baseline measures between conditions, which compromised the balance of random assignment (see supplementary information for details). Without applying the pre-registered exclusion rules, tests revealed no evidence that participants were unevenly assigned to different conditions (i.e., no significant baseline differences). By reporting results without pre-registered exclusions in the main text, we aim to provide a better understanding of the intervention's effectiveness (how well it works in real-world, practical settings) rather than its efficacy (how well it works under ideal, controlled conditions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">55</ref> . In supplementary information, we report results after applying the pre-registered exclusion rules (with and without controlling for baseline differences).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immediate Effects: Manipulation Checks</head><p>We pre-registered the hypotheses that the reappraisal (vs. active control) condition would trigger larger increases in reappraisal beliefs (i.e., believing that reappraisal can change emotions) and reappraisal intentions (i.e., planning to use reappraisal to change emotions). Consistent with our hypotheses, the reappraisal (vs. Further support for differentiation between the conditions came from unregistered topic modelling of written responses about applying the technique. After asking participants to describe a distressing or overwhelming aspect of their work life, we asked them to "try reappraising the situation" in the reappraisal condition and "try reflecting on your feelings and thoughts about the situation" in the active control condition. We pre-defined two topics to maximize interpretability given the two conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56</ref>  As <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows, the most frequent words exclusive to the reappraisal topic included "help," "best," "better", "new," and "different," consistent with the theme of finding new, helpful perspectives. Participants in the reappraisal (vs. active control) condition wrote a significantly higher proportion of words on the reappraisal topic (83% vs. 44%, b = 1.37, SE = 0.02, t(4041) = 60.00, P &lt; 0.001, d = 1.89, 95% CI = [1.82, 1.97]), Thus, participants complied with the writing instructions, producing strongly differentiated responses. Additional results regarding reflection (the strategy in the active control condition) can be found in supplementary information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immediate Effects: Primary Well-being and Workplace Outcomes</head><p>We pre-registered the hypotheses that the reappraisal (vs. . Although sadness and resilience at work did not differ significantly between conditions, within each condition, sadness significantly decreased from baseline to postintervention, and anticipated resilience at work was significantly greater than its retrospective baseline (unregistered analysis, Ps &lt; 0.001). This pattern suggests that the intervention activities in both conditions were likely beneficial.</p><p>To provide a broader understanding of findings, we conducted an unregistered exploratory factor analysis on these four outcomes, which resulted in a single "workplace wellbeing" factor (see factor loadings in supplementary information). The reappraisal (vs. Moreover, unregistered exploratory mediational analyses revealed that the higher the proportion of words participants wrote on the reappraisal topic in the writing task (about applying the technique to address their emotional challenge), the more improvements they experienced in </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Long-term Effects: Manipulation Checks</head><p>We pre-registered the hypotheses that the reappraisal (vs. Alternatively, participants may have had difficulty accurately reporting their reappraisal beliefs.</p><p>To explore which interpretation aligns best with the data, we examined six unregistered exploratory items assessing reappraisal engagement, including questions such as, "In the last two weeks, I've tried changing how I think about a situation in order to feel better." Notably, five out of six unregistered exploratory items assessing reappraisal engagement showed significant results (see supplementary information for details), supporting the effectiveness of the manipulation. As before, results regarding reflection (the strategy in the active control condition)</p><p>can be found in supplementary information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Long-term Effects: Primary Emotional Well-being and Workplace Outcomes</head><p>We first tested the effects on emotional well-being outcomes, with pre-registered hypotheses that the reappraisal (vs. active control) condition would lead to less frequent stress, more frequent happiness, greater sense of control over stressors, and more frequent action-taking to solve problems six months later. These pre-registered outcomes intentionally differed from those in the initial session in several ways. First, while we were tightly constrained on the number of items in the initial session because participants had already spent considerable time learning the technique, at follow-up we expanded items to include sense of control over stressors and actiontaking to solve problems. Second, while we focused on sadness and hope in the initial session, at follow-up we refined this focus to stress and happiness to better capture dominant negative and positive affect. We prioritized stress given its higher prevalence and increases compared to other negative emotions in recent decades 2 . We prioritized happiness as it better captures general positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">58</ref> . Although maintaining consistency across time points would have improved comparability, we anticipated that the reappraisal effects would be broad rather than specific to particular outcomes. In supplementary information, we analyzed factor scores combining all measures of emotional well-being, regardless of pre-registration status, and found that reappraisal primarily influenced negative affect rather than positive affect.</p><p>Data revealed supportive evidence for three out of the four pre-registered well-being outcomes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 1, first</ref>   These results signify an overall sustained improvement in emotional well-being and workplace outcomes resulting from the reappraisal intervention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Long-term Effects: Mediators</head><p>With respect to the mechanisms underlying observed effects, we pre-registered the hypotheses that reappraisal beliefs and/or reappraisal intentions would significantly mediate the differences in stress and happiness between conditions. Data revealed no statistically significant support for these hypotheses (see supplementary information for details). In retrospect, pre-registering all emotional well-being indicators would have been preferable.</p><p>In addition to the pre-registered mediation analysis reported above, unregistered exploratory mediational analyses revealed a pattern consistent with the mediation results in the initial session: The higher proportion of words participants wrote on the reappraisal topic in the writing task in the initial session, the more improvements they experienced in the workplace well-being factor six months later (indirect effect b = 0.17, 95% CI = [0.08, 0.27], SE = 0.05, z = 3.74, P &lt; 0.001, proportion = 1.28). Although the preregistered mediators did not yield support, the latter pattern supports the view that reappraisal engagement is the mechanism underlying the intervention's enduring effects on workplace well-being. Clearly, assessing mediation across a six-month period when two conditions differ in meaningful but subtle ways is challenging and requires further follow up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Long-term Effects: Moderators</head><p>We conducted an unregistered exploratory analysis of potential moderators of the workplace well-being factor, including demographics, baseline measures, engagement with the intervention (e.g., word count), and time gaps between sessions. We found that the reappraisal (vs. active control) condition was more beneficial six months later for participants who reported higher </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contributions of This Research</head><p>This research makes two key contributions. First, it advances understanding of the durability of reappraisal interventions. We provide evidence for the longest-lasting effects of a reappraisal intervention on emotional well-being and workplace outcomes to date. Our use of communitybased participatory research strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref> in designing the intervention likely helped us overcome the challenges in prior attempts to create more durable effects of reappraisal interventions. The finding on durability is important not only specifically for reappraisal but also for addressing a key unanswered question about the long-term effectiveness of well-being interventions more broadly <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">60</ref> .</p><p>Second, it reveals the effects of reappraisal interventions on workers and workplace outcomes for the first time. Despite reasons to believe stressful workplace contexts might be boundary conditions for reappraisal interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">43</ref> , the reappraisal intervention benefited nationwide workers in diverse occupations. Not only did we observe significant differences in self-reported workplace outcomes such as quit intentions and job performance, but we also found a significant difference in an incentivized decision-making measure of impatience. Impatience has wide-ranging effects on a variety of life decisions, including job search behaviors and earnings <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">62</ref> . In addition to the results reported above, indicators of engagement also showed that workers found our intervention helpful: Most participants completed the entire intervention once they started, agreed that our activities were engaging, said they would recommend them to other colleagues, and anticipated little to no difficulty practicing the technique in their daily lives (we report the details in supplementary information). Very few participants reported confusion.</p><p>Participants expressed liking that "it's simple and can be used anywhere at any time" and "it doesn't take long and it's easy to share with others."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>The current study took steps to build the most robust reappraisal intervention possible, grounded in theory and supported by prior research, within the given constraints. One important direction for future research is to better identify the most powerful ingredients. For instance, investigating the contribution of various forms and timing of boosters could enhance intervention effectiveness. Additionally, it is vital for scalability to understand the impact of different intervention framings (e.g., whether provided by researchers or the organization itself) and</p><p>incentives.</p><p>We administered the intervention at the individual level to maximize statistical power and participation opportunities. However, we acknowledge the potential for spillover between conditions due to participants sharing intervention content. While our study found reappraisal effects not just immediately, but also six months later, across a wide range of differentiated affective and workplace outcomes, there was variability in the magnitude and statistical significance of these effects across different outcomes.</p><p>Additionally, beyond measuring impatience in a decision-making task with financial consequences, we couldn't measure actual job performance or access administrative data due to logistical constraints. Future research might consider factors contributing to the variability in the magnitude of effects across outcomes, such as effects of the active control condition or measurement issues. Future studies might also undertake more comprehensive evaluations, including assessments of objective workplace outcomes, thereby providing a more holistic understanding of intervention effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>As a complement to structural improvements, a scalable reappraisal intervention can bring durable improvements in emotional well-being and workplace outcomes among a nationwide sample of workers in a variety of service-sector occupations. Our research thus provides a template for adapting emotion regulation interventions to diverse workplace contexts.</p></div>

We preregistered to measure six facets of emotional well-being.</p><p>Adhering in all respects to our preregistration, the first facet asked about the frequency of negative emotions over the last two weeks, including two items on anxiety from the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">64</ref> , two items on depression from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">65</ref> , and one item on anger <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">66</ref> . Participants rated their frequency from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Nearly every day). The second facet inquired about stress. We asked, "In the past year, how would you rate the amount of stress in your life?" <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">67</ref> . Participants rated their responses on an 11-point scale that ranged from 0 (No stress) to 10 (Extreme stress). The third facet asked about productivity loss due to emotional problems.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>Pre-registration. This study was pre-registered at https://osf.io/bnjv4, https://osf.io/hec3g, and https://osf.io/3tn8b. As explained above, we chose to report the results without applying preregistered exclusion rules in the main text, and to report the results after applying these rules in supplementary information. There was no other deviation from the pre-registration.</p><p>Experimental design. We carefully considered the qualitative responses from interviews (see Supplemental Information for details) when designing the intervention materials in Study 2, employing a community psychology approach. A tradeoff emerged during the design phase of the Study 2 between maximizing internal validity and addressing the urgent emotional needs of the workforce. On the one hand, to achieve the highest levels of internal validity, it was useful to implement a control condition that was psychologically inert, and clearly different from the intervention condition. On the other hand, to provide at least some relief to all participants, it was useful to employ an active control condition that could benefit participants. We chose to favor the latter consideration and acknowledge that there is no consensus regarding the optimal control condition in emotion well-being research <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">60</ref> . The selected active control condition entailed teaching participants reflection, defined as paying attention to feelings, the accompanying thoughts, and bodily changes. Reflection, a traditional coping strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">73</ref> , contains several elements that are beneficial, including emotional awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">74</ref> , affect labeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">75</ref> , and expressive writing <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">76</ref> . By instructing participants in this condition to actively use a strategy likely to have a positive effect, we aimed to align expectancy and demand across conditions, while also providing at least some relief to all participants. This approach builds on prior research indicating that reflection typically has small effects on emotional well-being compared to a passive control condition, and these effects are typically smaller than those of reappraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37</ref> .</p><p>Overview of recruitment. We aimed to help as many workers as possible while evaluating the impact of our online intervention. We shared this goal and asked prospective participants to help us customize our research on emotional wellness to be maximally useful to them. Due to the decentralized nature of Head Start as an organization-wherein much of the administration happens at an agency or site level-it was difficult to streamline communications to reach large groups of workers at once. We therefore invited workers to participate in the study by reaching out to individual site leaders and professional associations, as well as announcing the study through online forums (e.g., MyPeers), social media, and the National Head Start Association's newsletter. We informed participants that this study involved three sequential online wellness activities (initial session, midpoint booster session, and six-month follow-up session; note that we did not use these labels with the participants). We provided personalized certificates of completion and offered lotteries for a chance to win a $100 prepaid gift card after each activity.</p><p>Additionally, to incentivize longitudinal participation, we provided electronic gift cards of $15 and $20 for the two follow-up activities, respectively. We provided both Spanish and English versions of the activities to accommodate the language needs of employees (3% of participants completed the Spanish version of the intervention in the initial session). We collected participants' email addresses and phone numbers in the initial session for subsequent contact.

Specifically, six months later, the reappraisal (vs. active control) condition led to significantly less frequent stress (b = -0.12, SE = 0.04, t(2344) = -3.10, P = 0.002, d = -0.13, 95% CI = [-0.21, -0.05]), greater sense of control over stressors (b = 0.11, SE = 0.04, t(2344) = 2.62, P = 0.009, d = 0.11, 95% CI = [0.03, 0.19]), and more frequent actiontaking to solve problems (b = 0.14, SE = 0.04, t(2344) = 3.37, P &lt; 0.001, d = 0.14, 95% CI = [0.06, 0.22]), with non-significant differences in the frequency of happiness (b = 0.02, SE = 0.04, t(2344) = 0.52, P = 0.606, d = 0.02, 95% CI = [-0.06, 0.10]).</figDesc></figure>

The red lines show 95% confidence intervals, and the red dots show point estimates. In addition to the pre-registered outcomes reported above, unregistered exploratory analyses provided additional evidence regarding effects on emotional well-being: The reappraisal (vs. active control) condition led to significantly less frequent anxiety (b = -0.10, SE = 0.04, t(2344) = -2.77, P = 0.006, d = -0.11, 95% CI = [-0.20, -0.03]). Other unregistered measures of emotional well-being did not show significant differences (e.g., depression; see supplementary information for details). Thus, the reappraisal intervention was able to improve some (but not all) aspects of emotional well-being. We next tested the effects on workplace outcomes, with pre-registered hypotheses that the reappraisal intervention would lead to higher job satisfaction and resilience at work among people who reported lower support at work. These hypotheses draw on prior findings regarding the compensatory role of reappraisal for lack of social support 59 . For job satisfaction, data revealed a non-significant interaction between perceived support at work and reappraisal intervention (b = 0.02, SE = 0.03, t(2081) = 0.46, P = 0.645, η² = 0.0001) and a marginally significant main effect for reappraisal intervention (b = 0.06, SE = 0.03, t(2081) = 1.80, P = 0.073, η² = 0.002; Fig. 1, the fifth row shows the effect size without the interaction term to be comparable with other outcomes: b = 0.08, SE = 0.04, t(2083) = 2.21, P = 0.027, d = 0.10, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.18]). For resilience at work, data revealed a non-significant interaction (b = 0.05, SE = 0.04, t(2081) = 1.40, P = 0.162, η² = 0.001) and a non-significant main effect (b = 0.03, SE = 0.04, t(2081) = 0.79, P = 0.433, η² = 0.0003; Fig. 1, the sixth row shows the effect size without the interaction term to be comparable with other outcomes: b = 0.05, SE = 0.04, t(2083) = 1.29, P = 0.197, d = 0.06, 95% CI = [-0.03, 0.14]). In addition to the pre-registered outcomes reported above, some unregistered measures provided suggestive evidence regarding effects on workplace outcomes six months later: The reappraisal (vs. active control) condition led to significantly higher self-reported job performance (b = 0.10, SE = 0.04, t(2345) = 2.43, P = 0.015, d = 0.10, 95% CI = [0.02, 0.18]), stronger intentions to continue working in the current organization (b = 0.12, SE = 0.04, t(2181) = 2.80, P = 0.005, d = 0.12, 95% CI = [0.04, 0.20]), and less impatience in an incentivized measure of receiving $100 today or a larger amount later (a real lottery prize; b = -0.10, SE = 0.04, t(2345) = -2.51, P = 0.012, d = -0.10, 95% CI = [-0.18, -0.02]). The latter two were measured after the refresher content and might also reflect immediate effects of the refresher (see supplementary information for details). These results indicate that the reappraisal intervention benefited a couple of workplace outcomes, influencing not only self-reported measures but also impatient decision-making with financial consequences. While some unregistered measures, such as job search behavior (see supplementary information), did not show significant differences, future research should further investigate these workplace outcomes to extend the intervention's impact.To provide a broader understanding of findings, we conducted an unregistered exploratory factor analysis on the six pre-registered outcomes (i.e., stress, happiness, sense of control, problem-solving, job satisfaction, and resilience at work). Results indicated a single "workplace well-being" factor (see factor loadings in supplementary information). The reappraisal (vs. active control) condition led to significantly higher workplace well-being six months later (b = 0.14, SE = 0.04, t(2084) = 3.13, P = 0.002, d = 0.14, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.22]).</figDesc></figure>

The latter finding may reflect the benefits of tailoring intervention materials, as we intentionally included more examples relevant to preschool education in the intervention. Discussion Among a nationwide sample of workers in various occupations, reappraisal not only positively correlated with emotional well-being and workplace outcomes (Study 1), but also had a causal effect on improved emotional well-being and workplace outcomes six months later (vs. an active control condition; Study 2).</figDesc></figure>

There was one deviation from the pre-registration: for the job performance question, the scale ranged from 0 to 100 as opposed to 1-100.Procedure and participants. At a national conference run by the National Head StartAssociation in May 2022, an online survey was announced and promoted through the conference app and presentation in a plenary session. To incentivize participation, four $100 gift cards were offered as lottery prizes. With approximately three thousand conference attendees, the survey aimed to secure around two thousand participants to detect small effects. We preregistered to exclude participants who reported not being Head Start members, resulting in no exclusions among the 1,967 complete responses (92.07% females, 7.78% males, 0.15% other genders; Mage= 45.58, SDage = 11.29; see information about race/ethnicity and occupations in supplementary information). Indicating that the sample was also diverse geographically, participants represented work sites in all 50 U.S. states and two territories (Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands). Given the final sample size, sensitivity power analyses indicated that correlations could detect r ≥ 0.06 under standard criteria (two-sided tests, alpha = 0.05, and 80% power).</figDesc></figure>

To maximize retention at the final timepoint and to remind participants of the practice, we provided a brief midpoint booster session (i.e., the second activity out of the three) from January 17 to February 12, 2023 (details provided below). Data collected during the midpoint booster session appear in supplementary information. The final six-month follow-up session was open from April 6 to May 15, 2023. The sample without pre-registered exclusions included 4,054 individuals in the initial session, with 2,119 completing the midpoint booster session, and 2,347 completing the sixmonth follow-up session. Thus, from the initial session to the six-month follow-up session, the overall attrition rate was 42%, with no significant difference in attrition between conditions (1% differential attrition, b = -0.04, SE = 0.06, z(4052) = -0.70, P = 0.483). These overall and differential attrition rates are acceptable under the U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences standards and reflect low expected bias 77 . The median duration was 184 days (M = 180.76, SD = 28.11, Min = 106, Max = 248), approximately six months.

For information about race/ethnicity and occupations, see supplementary information. Participants represented Head Start communities from all U.S. states and two territories (Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands).Thus, the final sample was diverse in terms of race/ethnicity and geographic region but showed a gender asymmetry consistent with the underlying Head Start workforce<ref type="bibr" target="#b79">78</ref> .Considering the final sample size, sensitivity power analyses indicated that t-tests could detect effect sizes of d ≥ 0.09 and 0.12 under standard criteria (two-sided tests, alpha = 0.05, and 80% power) for the initial session and the six-month follow-up session, respectively. We could detect smaller effect sizes with ANCOVAs, while the power would differ due to the different degrees of association between covariates and outcomes.Procedures. In the initial session, participants first completed the consent form, then answered some pre-intervention questions, engaged in the intervention section, and finally answered some post-intervention questions. The median completion time for the initial session was 35.53 minutes.In the midpoint booster session and the six-month follow-up session, participants first answered some check-in questions, then engaged in a refresher section, and answered some post-refresher questions. The refresher section had two components. The first component involved watching a video clip that reiterated the definition of the technique and shared quotes from peers. The second component involved participants writing about how they would apply the technique to address a recent or upcoming challenge. The median completion times for the midpoint booster session and the six-month follow-up session were 18.23 minutes and 24.72 minutes, respectively.</figDesc></figure>
