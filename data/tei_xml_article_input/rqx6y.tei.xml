			<abstract>
				<p>Multisensory integration (MSI) allows the brain to combine information from different sensory modalities to form a coherent perception of the environment. Externalizing disorders with impulsivity as a key symptom such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been associated with altered sensory processing and decision-making. This study investigated the relationship between impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours, and multisensory integration. Participants had to discriminate between two visual gratings, and/or two sounds presented to the right and left ear based on respectively contrast and loudness in a two-alternative forced-choice task. The study included 44 participants, 13 of whom were diagnosed with ADHD or Disruptive Behaviour Disorders. Results show similar task performance across participants. Performance accuracies were highest on audiovisual trials and participants responded fastest on auditory trials, independent of impulsivity levels. Examining the timescale of evidence weighting revealed that early sensory information contributed most to decisions, with dynamic dominance switching between visual and auditory modalities. We found no evidence that the temporal dynamics were affected by impulsivity. These findings suggest that impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours do not significantly affect MSI during our task and that sensory processing mechanisms remain robust against individual impulsivity levels.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Multisensory integration (MSI) is a process during which information from different sensory modalities is integrated in the brain. MSI allows us to detect and discriminate between sensory events in our environment. As our environment is not static but changes dynamically over time, sensory signals are in addition integrated over time. These integration processes are crucial to create a coherent representation of the world and to effectively adapt to it <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . For example, when you are crossing a busy street, the sounds of vehicles and the changing brightness of headlights have to be integrated correctly. This is vital in order to interpret whether a vehicle is approaching or not and to react accordingly, i.e., to cross the street or not.</p><p>The field of perceptual decision-making has made considerable progress in understanding how we accumulate sensory evidence over time. Studies demonstrated that different strategies for sensory evidence accumulation are used. A number of studies examining the contribution of visual evidence to visual decision-making have shown that observers base decisions more heavily on early information compared to late information <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Nevertheless, late sensory weighting profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and flat weighting profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> have also been demonstrated. A recent study revealed that during multisensory decision-making, early visual and early auditory evidence are weighted most heavily <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</p><p>Interestingly, this early weighting was followed by modality dominance switching during which vision dominated first and auditory dominance finalized the decision-making process.</p><p>Moreover, this study showed a performance benefit for multisensory compared to unisensory processing, a phenomenon demonstrated by numerous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</p><p>Impulsivity, defined as a pattern of unplanned actions without regard for the negative consequences that might follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , can result in impulsive decision-making. Impulsivity is a hallmark of several externalizing disorders and is a key bridge symptom of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Disruptive Behaviour Disorders (DBDs). ADHD is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity as core symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . DBDs encompass a group of conditions which are marked by irritable moods and impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</p><p>There are many studies that have investigated the assessment and treatment of DBDs in clinical practice. However, how (multi)sensory processing is affected in individuals with DBD remains unclear.</p><p>The empirical findings on how MSI is affected in adolescents and young adults with ADHD vary considerably and might be related to task complexity. A study using a simple reaction time task found that young adults with ADHD experienced multisensory benefit just like the neurotypical controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . This was reflected by faster reaction times on audiovisual trials where participants had to detect a colour based on a spoken word combined with a coloured circle on a screen compared to unisensory trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . A later study from the same group increased the task complexity by transforming the task into a 2-AFC task including a distracting colour on the other side of the headphones and screen. They showed that the multisensory benefit for reaction times lacked compared to visual trials, and in addition that young adults with ADHD were overall faster <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . Another study examining speech-in-noise found that multisensory benefit was not present when lip movement was added to videos of speaking individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . A study investigating MSI in young adults with ADHD using simple and complex audiovisual illusions demonstrated that processing simple illusionary visual flashes and auditory beeps induce illusions at a similar scale as in healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</p><p>However, adults with ADHD were on average less successful in integrating audiovisual stimuli during the McGurk illusion. An explanation for these changes in MSI in individuals with ADHD could rely on the altered attentional system associated with ADHD and might not be related to other traits such as impulsivity. A study comparing task performance of individuals with ADHD like traits, specifically impulsivity, on a Simultaneity Judgement (SJ) task and a Temporal Order Judgement (TOJ) task found that the high impulsivity group had a smaller temporal integration window during multisensory processing compared to the low impulsivity group <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</p><p>The present study aimed to further investigate the relationship between impulsivity and MSI during a 2-AFC task. We included young adults diagnosed with ADHD and DBD and young adults without these externalizing disorders to establish a range of self-reported impulsivity levels. The task we used was based on the experimental design of a previous study by Tuip and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , during which adolescents had to discriminate between two visual gratings, two sound sources, or a combination of both, based on contrast and loudness.</p><p>Performance accuracy and reaction times of participants were compared. Based on studies that showed altered auditory information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> and that increased task complexity is suspected to be associated with less multisensory benefit in individuals diagnosed with ADHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , we hypothesize a lack or partial lack of multisensory benefit on our task for individuals with high scores on the impulsivity scale and impulsivity related behaviours scales compared to low scores. Specifically, we expected reaction times on audiovisual trials to be similar compared to auditory trials and potentially to visual trials. Performance accuracy on audiovisual trials was expected to be similar compared to visual trials and potentially to auditory trials. In addition, to further understand how MSI would change with impulsivity, we tested whether sensory evidence weighting was altered for participants who scored higher on impulsivity scales compared to participants with lower scores during visual, auditory and audiovisual decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants.</head><p>This study was approved by The Faculty Ethics Review Board of the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences of the University of Amsterdam. Forty-four participants contributed to the study (M = 17.1, SD = 0.8, age range = <ref type="bibr">16 -19)</ref>. Thirteen participants (eight males and two females) were diagnosed with ADHD or DBD according to the DSM-5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> and were recruited via Levvel, an organization specialized in youth mental healthcare. Thirty-one typically developing control participants with no history of ADHD or DBD (23 males and 8 females) were recruited from vocational colleges. Participants were screened to exclude those with visual or auditory impairments, with the exception of corrected-to-normal vision and audition. They provided written consent and were naive regarding the experimental design and goal of the study. Participants received a monetary reward of 25 euro after participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaires.</head><p>At the start of the experiment, participants filled out the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> and the Youth Self Report (YSR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) is a selfreport questionnaire designed to assess impulsivity through 30 items. We used the Dutch version for the current study <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> . Responses are provided on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 'rarely/never' (1) to 'almost always' (4). Sample items include "I plan tasks carefully," "I do things without thinking," and "I am restless at lectures or talks." In this study, the total BIS-11 score was used. The Youth Self-Report (YSR) consists of 112 items, each rated on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = 'Not true', 1 = 'Somewhat or sometimes true', and 2 = 'Very true or often true'). These items are organized into nine problem subscales. The three subscales attention problems (YSR_AT), aggressive behaviour (YSR_AG), and rule breaking behaviour (YSR_RBB) show high concurrent validity for ADHD and DBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> . Moreover, scores on these subscales were correlated with BIS scores (BIS and YSR_AT: r(39) = 0.80, p &lt; 0.01; BIS and YSR_AG: r(39) = 0.63, p &lt; 0.01; BIS and YSR_RBB: r(39) = 0.57, p &lt; 0.01).</p><p>Therefore, we included these three subscales as a proxy of impulsive behaviour (i.e., impulsivity related behaviours). Sample items include "I can't sit still" for the YSR_AT subscale, "I argue a lot" for the YSR_AG subscale, and "I set fires" for the YSR_RBH subscale. The YSR_AT subscale comprises nine items, the YSR_AG subscale 19 items, and the YSR_RBH subscale 11 items. Scores for each subscale were calculated by summing the individual item scores, with higher total scores indicating greater severity of the respective problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli and Procedure.</head><p>To measure how modality, difficulty and impulsivity influence multisensory decision-making, we used a two-alternative forced-choice task similar to the one described by a previous study by Tuip and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . The task was designed with the Psychtoolbox library 37 in MATLAB R2017a. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> illustrates the task design. The task consisted of three different modality conditions (visual, auditory and audiovisual) and two different difficulty conditions (easy and hard). There were 612 trials in total divided in 51 blocks of four visual trials, 51 blocks of four auditory trials and 51 blocks of four audiovisual trials. The task started with a block of visual practice trials followed by a block of auditory practice trials, after which visual, auditory and audiovisual blocks were presented in a random order.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task presentation and response collection was carried out using a 17.3 inch MSI</head><p>Bravo gaming laptop with a screen refresh rate of 144 Hz. Participants were centred at a viewing distance of roughly 60 cm from the centre of the gamma-corrected screen. During visual trials, two Gabor gratings with different contrast intensities were shown on the screen on a grey background <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1B)</ref>. The centre of the patches were 10 degrees to the left and right from the centre of the screen and had the same random orientation. Participants were instructed to press the 'f' key if the stimulus with the highest contrast (i.e., the visual target) was presented on the left side of the screen and the stimulus with the lowest contrast (i.e., the visual distractor) on the right side. The 'j' key was the correct response if the visual target was presented on the right side of the screen and the visual distractor on the left side. After each key press participants were provided with response feedback, a grey screen with the text 'correct!' or 'incorrect!' corresponding with the outcome <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1E</ref>). During auditory trials, two pink noise bursts starting at 7 kHz and linearly decaying to 32 kHz were presented to the left and right ear using headphones with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz (MD-5000DR, IMG stageline) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1C</ref>). Participants were asked at which side the sound was highest in amplitude (loudness), i.e., the auditory target, by pressing the same corresponding keyboard keys as during visual trials. During audiovisual trials the auditory and visual stimuli were presented simultaneously and the visual target and auditory target were always on the same side ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.   1D</ref>,E).</p><p>The task included trials of two difficulty levels: easy and hard. The intensity of the distractor stimulus determined the difficulty level while the intensity of the target stimulus was always set at 60%. Throughout the experiment, excluding the practice trials, we used a 1down-2-up staircase procedure on the hard unimodal trials to determine the visual and auditory distractor baseline intensities for these levels. For the first two trials, the intensity level of the distractor was set at 80% of that of the target. From the third trial on, the distractor intensity decreased with 1% when the trial was incorrect. As a result, the difference between the target and distractor intensity (i.e. the evidence) was increased. When two consecutive trials were correct, the intensity increased with 1% to decrease the evidence. This method resulted in an average of 77.8 ± 5.0% accuracy on hard visual trials, an average of 69.2 ± 8% accuracy on hard auditory trials and an average of 86.6 ± 6.2% accuracy on hard audiovisual trials. We applied a factor of 1.5 to the difference between the target and distractor on the previous hard trials to create the distractor baseline intensity for easy trials.</p><p>The stimulus intensities fluctuated every 48.6 ms (seven frames on a 144Hz monitor) over a baseline value <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1F</ref>,G) to create time-varying contrasts and sounds. We included these fluctuations to retrospectively test which moments in time significantly contributed to the decisions. For the auditory stimulus, the sound level gradually approached the intensity of the next fluctuation over the last 10 ms period to avoid clicks caused by volume transitions.</p><p>The change in visual contrast was abrupt. The fluctuation range was 14% from baseline intensity resulting in fluctuation intensities between 46% and 74% for the target stimulus.</p><p>Depending on the task performance and difficulty level, the fluctuations could cause the evidence for the distractor location to be close to or even stronger than evidence for the target location at random points in time <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1F,G)</ref>. The motivation for this was to drive participants to evaluate evidence and integrate it over time in order to solve the trial. The majority of the fluctuations, however, were higher on the side of the target. Furthermore, the onset of the fluctuations of the target and the distractor stimuli were simultaneous but the specific intensity values of the fluctuations were calculated randomly. This caused the fluctuations of the target and distractor to be asynchronous at the level of fluctuation direction.</p><p>The trial duration was determined using the reaction times (RTs) of each participant. To examine how Modality, Difficulty and Impulsivity affected performance accuracy we carried out generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMs) using JASP. Choice outcomes (correct/incorrect) of all participants on all trials were used to model the probability to make a correct decision with predictors Modality, Difficulty, BIS score and YSR subscale scores:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= [1 + exp (−( 0 + 1 * + 2 * + 3 * , + 4 * * + ))] −1 (equation 1)</formula><p>Where Y is the response accuracy of the trial (i.e. correct or incorrect), β0 is the intercept term and β1 reflects the Modality, β2 is the Difficulty on trial i for participant j, β3</p><p>includes Imp which reflects the separate BIS, YSR_AT, YSR_AG or YSR_RBB scores for participant j and β4 reflects the interaction between Modality and Difficulty. bj, is a randomeffects term comprising an intercept and slope for each participant j that accounts for potential participant-specific variation in task performance. For post-hoc comparisons of the significant main effects and interaction effect, we tested contrasts with the estimated marginal means using Holm's p-value adjustment. Modality and Difficulty were the only significant predictors and Bayesian GLMs supported this result. This model was described by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= [1 + exp (−( 0 + 1 * + 2 * + 3 * * + ))] −1 (equation 2)</formula><p>Next, we sought to investigate the temporal dynamics of auditory and visual evidence accumulation and how impulsivity influences this. The first step was to pinpoint which moments in time the contrast and sound information contributed to the decisions. We performed different GLMs for the trials of different modalities using MATLAB R2023b</p><p>(MATLAB function fitglme with binomial distribution and logit link). A detailed description of this analysis can be found in a previous study by Tuip and colleagues 12 . To model the probability to make a correct decision on visual trials we used the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= [1 + exp (−( 0 + 1, * , + , ))] −1 (equation 3)</formula><p>Auditory trials:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= [1 + exp (−( 0 + 1, * , + , ))] −1 (<label>equation 4)</label></formula><p>Audiovisual trials: weights.

Results from these GLMs revealed no significant effects for the predictors BIS, YSR_AT, YSR_AG and YSR_RBB (all p-values &gt; 0.07). To further examine this absence of an effect of impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours, we performed Bayesian GLMs to test the evidence in support of the null hypothesis. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the 95% credible intervals of BIS, YSR_AT, YSR_AG and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>The 95% credible intervals (CI) of the following questionnaire (subscales) predictors in Bayesian GLMs: BIS total score and scores on YSR subscales attention (YSR_AT), aggressive behaviour (YSR_AG) and rule breaking behaviour (YSR_RBB).</p><p>The results show that the predictors were centred around zero and support the null model without these predictors.  visual trials (green), auditory trials (red) and audiovisual trials (blue) for the two difficulty levels (easy: triangle, hard: circle).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence weighting during visual, auditory and audiovisual decision-making</head><p>To further asses the relation between impulsivity and MSI, we next studied audiovisual decision-making at a finer temporal resolution. Even though impulsivity might not affect overall performance, it is possible that the temporal weighing of visual and auditory evidence is modulated by impulsivity. We therefore first performed GLMs per time point (equations 3-5) to generate the weighting plots of auditory evidence on auditory trials, visual evidence on visual trials and auditory and visual evidence on audiovisual trials similar to our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . We next included BIS score and YSR subscale scores in the models of the significant time points (equations 6 and 7) to test whether the weighting of sensory evidence at these time points were influenced by impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> shows the Beta coefficients per time point up until 75% of the trials were finished. Significant Beta coefficients are marked with an asterisk. We report the statistics of the significant Beta coefficients (p &lt; 0.05). In what follows, we first discuss the results of the general weighing profiles before investigating the influence of impulsivity. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>The results of the post-hoc tests for the effects of modality and difficulty on reaction times. Depicted are the modality comparisons per difficulty level, the degrees of freedom (df), the t statistic (t) and the p-values (p). Responses were faster on easy audiovisual trials compared to easy visual and easy auditory trials and that on hard audiovisual trials responses were similar to auditory trials while the significant difference with visual trials holds.  The weighting profiles relative to the stimulus onset were characterized by a high contribution of early auditory evidence on auditory trials (W-stat range: 7.75-69.06) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3A)</ref>, visual evidence on visual trials (W-stat range: 11.04-94.26) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3B</ref>) and visual evidence on audiovisual trials (W-stat range: 24.12-28.91) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3C)</ref>. During audiovisual trials, only the first two time samples of the visual stimulus significantly contributed to the decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Difficulty</head><p>However, the contribution of these two contrast samples were not significantly higher than the contribution of the first two sounds samples. This indicates a lack of modality dominance. To quantify the shape of the sensory weighting profiles, we fitted an exponential distribution to the coefficients of auditory evidence in auditory trials, visual evidence in visual trials, and visual evidence in audiovisual trials. The model statistics and visual inspection revealed that exponential models accurately represented the decline in sensory evidence contribution during this task (auditory weights on auditory trials: R 2 = 0.92, SSE: 0.01; visual weights on visual trials: R 2 = 0.90, SSE: 0.04; visual weights on audiovisual trials: R 2 = 0.65, SSE: 0.07).</p><p>Weighting profiles aligned to the stimulus onset captured the influence of the first stimulus samples to the decision. However, samples close to the RTs may be underestimated due to the variability in RTs between trials and participants. To address this, we calculated the evidence contribution relative to the response. These weighting profiles are shown in figures 3D-F for auditory (W-stat range: 0-58.28) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3D)</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3F)</ref>. The increasing trend of weights were a consequence of the distribution and underestimation of the first samples when aligning to the response. Focusing on the auditory trials, we observed that participants weight the samples until 100 ms before they respond <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3D</ref>). On visual trials evidence contributed until 250 ms before the response and was finalized by a negative contribution of the last sample <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3E)</ref>. Notably, on audiovisual trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3E)</ref>, a period of visual dominance occurred from 350 until 200 ms relative to the response (F-stat: 6.42 -26.82) and at 200 ms a period was carried by the weighting of an auditory evidence sample which leaned towards auditory dominance (F-stat:</p><p>4.05, p = 0.09). The final auditory sample was characterized by auditory dominance (F-stat:</p><p>11.15).</p><p>These results reveal that evidence integration throughout the trials is characterized by an exponential decrease in the contribution of evidence. Evidence closer to the response did not contribute to the decision with the exception of the final sample on visual and audiovisual trials. This supports the notion of an overall early weighting profile. Moreover, our results suggest that integration during audiovisual trials can be divided into three distinct epochs. The first epoch involved the weighting of the indistinguishable contribution of both visual and auditory evidence, a pattern most apparent when coefficients were aligned to the stimulus onset. When aligned to the response, the second epoch showed that participants rely solely on visual information until 350-200 ms before the response. During the third and last epoch, the final auditory sample was weighted before the response was registered.</p><p>Impulsivity does not affect sensory weighting over time.</p><p>Next, we included predictors BIS, YSR_AT, YSR_AG and YSR_RBB in the models of the significant time points to test whether the weighting of sensory evidence at these time points were influenced by impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours. Results from these GLMs revealed no significant effects for the predictors BIS, YSR_AT, YSR_AG and YSR_RBB (all p-values &gt; 0.13). Therefore, we suggest that there is little evidence that BIS score nor YSR_AT, YSR_AG and YSR_RBB scores influenced the weighting of auditory and visual information during this decision-making paradigm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study investigated how impulsivity affects MSI during audiovisual decision-making. Our results demonstrate that there is no evidence that performance accuracy and reaction times are influenced by impulsivity in our decision-making paradigm. Multisensory benefit was present regardless of the scores on the impulsivity measure, as well as on behavioural measures related to impulsivity. The temporal weighting analyses revealed that early sensory information exerts most influence on decision-making during this task. Furthermore, enhanced audiovisual decision-making was linked to a sequential modality weighting. Early visual and auditory evidence contributed equally to the decision, followed by visual dominance and finalized by auditory weighting. Impulsivity did not influence these temporal dynamics of sensory integration.</p><p>To answer the first question how impulsivity affects general performance during our task, we examined the performance accuracies and reaction times. We found no significant influence of the scores on the impulsivity scale and impulsivity related behaviour subscales on performance accuracy or reaction times suggesting that impulsivity does not affect MSI in our study. ADHD is associated with a variety of symptoms among which impulsivity. Therefore, previous studies on how MSI is affected in individuals with ADHD might provide insights in which mechanisms underlie the influence of impulsivity on MSI. On the level of behaviour, previous studies have shown that those with ADHD respond faster on audiovisual trials compared to visual and auditory trials during a simple reaction time task <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and overall faster when task complexity is slightly increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> compared to those without ADHD. Studies by Schulze and colleagues provided more evidence for the relationship between task complexity and MSI. They found that susceptibility for simple sound-induced-flash illusions was not different for adults with ADHD compared to controls whereas the susceptibility for the</p><p>McGurk effect was lower <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . Moreover, perceptual load did not influence MSI in adults with ADHD during an auditory flanked visual search task <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</p><p>Altered MSI in (young) adults with ADHD and the related neurophysiological differences have been ascribed to reductions in attention in ADHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . For example, decreased activity in parietal regions during sensory processing for young adults with ADHD compared to controls has been found <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . Activity in the parietal cortex is associated with MSI as well as attention, which is crucial for MSI <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> . The lack of significant differences in performance related to impulsivity in this study might be explained by equal attentional allocation towards the sensory stimuli on all conditions. This in turn could be a result of high overall motivation related to the monetary reward. Another explanation is that the low-level stimuli (i.e. moving gratings and pink noise tones) we used here are low in complexity to a degree that the integration of these properties might occur pre-attentively in a bottom-up fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> . This idea is supported by the unsuccessful integration of complex stimuli during the McGurk illusion 27 which might be a result of an enhanced early bottom-up and a suboptimal late top-down MSI in groups with ADHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . We hypothesize that MSI during our task relies mostly on bottom-up processes. In a later processing stage the internal representation of the stimuli might be refined by intact top-down modulation.</p><p>The second question we aimed to answer with this study was how visual and auditory evidence is integrated over time and whether this is affected by impulsivity. For this aim, we zoomed into the temporal dynamics of evidence weighting and tested its relationship with impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours. The weighting profiles revealed early weighting of sensory information on all conditions. In addition, we observed that audiovisual decision-making was associated with equal contribution of early visual and auditory information after which visual integration dominated followed by the final weighting of auditory information. We found no indication that weighting of visual or auditory evidence was affected by impulsivity or impulsivity related behaviours. Based on these results and the Bayesian statistics that provided strong evidence that the various impulsivity subscales did not influence the decision outcomes and RTs during our task, we suggest that sensory processing and evidence accumulation mechanisms during our task are immune to individual differences in impulsivity. The weighting profiles mimicked those observed by Tuip and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> which reinforces the reliability and robustness of this finding.</p><p>For a comprehensive discussion regarding the factors that influence the shape of weighting profiles and the underlying processes we refer to the discussion of the study by Tuip and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . To summarize, within the framework of signal detection theory (SDT), weighting profiles are thought to reflect an interaction between sensory integration and decision-making processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> . Early weighting profiles likely correspond to a bounded accumulation process, where information is integrated until a decision threshold is reached.</p><p>Early sensory information is weighted heavily while later information has diminished impact once the decision bound has been made. Given the improved accuracy and shorter RTs on audiovisual trials and the observed visual dominance, it is plausible that visual and auditory information streams may be processed separately in early sensory areas after which they are integrated in regions such as the superior colliculus <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> or higher-order cortical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> . The dominance switching that we observed might be driven by dynamically changing connection strengths within and between early sensory areas and frontal and motor regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</p><p>There were some differences in the results that we demonstrated here compared to the study by Tuip and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . First, participants responded faster and more accurate during this study. This difference could be related to the monetary reward participants received here compared to the course credits the students in the previous study received. Our results corroborate findings of other studies that monetary reward can increase speed and accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">56</ref> . Second, the weighting profiles differed slightly despite the strong similarities.</p><p>For example, the first auditory evidence sample was not weighted significantly during audiovisual decisions in this study <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3F</ref>). The contribution of the visual evidence was however not significantly higher than the auditory evidence sample, which argues for the contribution of auditory evidence during the first time point. Moreover, the evidence weighting on audiovisual trials was characterized by sequential weighting of visual evidence and auditory evidence. In the previous study, the visual evidence weighting period was reflected by a visual dominance period in both the stimulus aligned and response aligned weighting profiles. The auditory evidence weighting period was reflected by an auditory dominance period right after the visual dominance period in the response aligned weighting profile. In the current study, visual dominance was only observed in the response aligned weighting profile and auditory dominance nearly reached significance (p = 0.08) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3F</ref>). An explanation for this might be that the weighting profiles have been compressed compared to the weighting profiles in the previous study as a result of shorter RTs. This could underlie the less pronounced dominance periods. Another difference is the negative contribution of the visual sample right before the response on visual trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3E</ref>) and the positive contribution of the final auditory sample on audiovisual trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3F</ref>) in the response aligned profiles. It has been shown that people can initiate an action around from about 200 ms after cue presentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57</ref> and can successfully withhold an action if a stop cue is presented 200-290 ms before the action is initiated <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60</ref> . Therefore, it is unlikely that evidence up to 48,6 ms before the response influenced the choice outcome.</p><p>To summarize, our results suggest that general performance on our audiovisual decision-making paradigm was not affected by impulsivity or impulsivity related behaviours.</p><p>Furthermore, there is no evidence that impulsivity or impulsivity related behaviours influenced the temporal integration of visual and auditory information streams. These results add to a set of mixed results described by a short list of previous studies that investigated MSI in adults with impulsivity associated disorder, ADHD. Our findings corroborate the hypothesis that low complexity stimuli do not engage the sensory processing mechanisms that are disrupted in ADHD.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Design of the experimental task.

After trial 20, the RTs of the 20 most recent trials were averaged.

Using this method, the trial length felt natural (i.e. under the control of the participant).Data Analysis.Three participants who were diagnosed with ADHD or DBD experienced technical issues during data collection and were excluded from the analyses. Data of one typically developing control participant was excluded as the median correct reaction time was above two standard deviations relative to the average. The results are based on the data of the remaining 40 participants who all performed above chance level. Due to the low number of participants with ADHD/DBD, a clinical group versus matched control group comparison yielded low statistical power. Instead, we pooled the data of all participants and included the total BIS score and the scores on the YSR subscales attention problems (YSR_AT), aggressive behaviour (YSR_AG) and rule-breaking behaviour (YSR_RBH) as continuous variables in the analyses to test for the effect of impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours.A 3 (Modality: Visual, Auditory and Audiovisual) × 2 (Difficulty: Easy and Hard) repeated measures ANOVA (rmANOVA) on the median RTs on correct trials was done to test how modality and difficulty influenced the RTs. This analysis was carried out in JASP<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .BIS scores and YSR subscale scores as a covariates did not explain the variance significantly and thus we performed Bayesian rmANOVAs to further examine this lack of significance.
