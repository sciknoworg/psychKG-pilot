			<abstract>
				<p>Motor sequence learning is well-studied using the Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT). The task has demonstrated that motor sequence learning is developed through repetitive practice of tapping a provided sequence of keyboard keys guided by external cues (e.g. visual images). Yet, it has remained unclear how we develop motor sequence learning when there is no provided sequence in a free-choice condition, where a key selection is open to multiple options and up to an intentional selection of learners. This present study designed a modified SRTT with sequenced and free-choice conditions and demonstrated in Experiment 1 that participants showed a larger performance improvement across training in the free-choice condition than the sequenced condition. Then, Experiment 2 showed motor sequence learning in the free-choice condition by repetitively letting participants make biased action-and stimulus-selections between binary options of a sequence, that also led to choice-preference formation across training.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Our daily actions typically consist of personalized and sequentially structured body movements, such as rhythmic body swaying during walking, that is unique to each individual.</p><p>In the laboratory setting, learning of motor skills with sequentially structured patterns has been well-studied using the Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> , training a sequential pattern of key-tapping guided by external cues (e.g. visual cues) to press corresponding keys on a keyboard. A series of work with the SRTT has shown that motor sequence learning is developed through repetitive practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , speeding up learners' reaction times across training, but some healthy participants and patients with Korsakoff's syndrome or Amnesic symptoms were not able to articulate the trained sequence verbally <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , inferring that motor sequence learning is developed implicitly. Correspondingly, patients impairing implicit learning skills, such as those with symptoms of developmental dyslexia <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> , Huntington's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , or with Cerebellar lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> showed little or less learning in this task.</p><p>Furthermore, a study showed that motor sequence learning in the SRTT transferred from knowledge of individual finger-key associations to a situation where a finger was responsible for multiple keys, without a decline in performance, indicating that motor sequence learning does not solely depend on a motor component of the learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . Another example work with the SRTT showed that motor sequence learning was maintained across two different tasks if the ordered structure of the sequence (e.g. a sequential order of tapping middle -index -ring -pinky fingers) was maintained but switched to different paired visual cues, suggesting that motor sequence learning is not necessarily bound to the paired visual stimuli, neither <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . Altogether, it has been theorized that motor sequence learning is acquired through repetitive practice by building unified sequential representations between perceptually-guided stimuli and action-based motor responses, which suggests that this is one of reasons why our motor sequence learning is flexibly adjustable to new tasks, environments and (e.g. from visual to auditory) modules, as well as introducing an important role of internal states of learners which bridges to represent, understand unified rules of the sequential pattern and makes action planning as a medium between the two components <ref type="bibr">2,10-13 .</ref> In parallel, brain imaging studies have revealed that training on motor sequence learning gradually reorganizes related neural networks, from the fast-labile learning stage maintaining the motor learning for a short term by integrating with activity of striatum, cerebellum, hippocampus, task-related motor cortical regions and prefrontal areas to the slow-stable learning stage linking with activity of cortico-striatal networks, where performance becomes stable for a long term <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> . Years of research has demonstrated that a post-training sleep facilitates the over-time neural reorganizations and resulting performance enhancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> , but see recent discussion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> .</p><p>However, it has remained uncertain how a unique sequential motor pattern is built by each individual in the SRTT when one is not given a sequence to follow. In other words, the mechanism has not been examined explicitly how our cognitive systems form endogenously generated motor sequence patterns across keyboard tapping training in the SRTT in a free-choice condition, where a key selection is open to multiple options and up to intentional selections of learners.</p><p>Drawing from extensive research on intentional decision-making, defined by internallydriven stimulus-selections among freely selectable options within a short time, a theoretical framework suggests that our intentional selection of a choice arises from a consequence of competitions between emerging actions of stimulus-selection within one's mind, and an action of stimulus-selection is determined when neural evidence of a stimulus-selection reaches a decision threshold earlier than alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> .</p><p>Accordingly, combining the intentional decision-making principle and integrated sequential representations between stimulus-action components through repetitive practice offers a potential mechanism for motor sequence learning in the SRTT under a free-choice condition. That posits that, over repetitions of training in the free-choice condition, participants make intentional stimulus-selection that gradually builds a self-chosen sequential representation of stimulus-action pairing internally. After a sufficient amount of practice, that builds biased intentional stimulus-selections for trials of a sequence and benefits motor sequence learning when the self-generated sequence is followed.</p><p>To test the proposed mechanism, we designed free-choice and sequenced conditions in a modified SRTT and conducted Experiment 1 to test if motor sequence learning improved in the free-choice condition across training, and whether the free-choice condition showed a better performance improvement than the sequenced condition. As Experiment 1 showed a larger improvement in the free-choice condition than the sequenced condition, Experiment 2 restricted the degree of the free-choice condition from four fully selectable options to two options with an underlying sequence. Consequently, participants were allowed to learn a sequence of the free-choice pairs and then had self-control on stimulusselection between the pair. In Experiment 2, we examined whether training a sequence of the free-choice pairs showed performance improvement over all trials, or whether participants developed choice-preferences between the binary options, and if they had to follow their self-designed sequence to show motor sequence learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In Experiment 1, 50 participants (Mage = 25.90 ± 4.19 years, 58% female) were trained on a sequence of eight consecutive trials of pressing corresponding keys guided by visual cue(s) (i.e. circle(s) highlighted in blue colors, <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a</ref>) presented on the computer screen in three different conditions. One condition shuffled a sequence with one highlighted cue every eight trials, which was defined as the Random (R) condition. The second condition repeated a pattern of an eight-trial-long sequence with one highlighted cue in the rest of trials, which was defined as the Sequenced (S) condition, and the third condition repeated another eight-trial-long sequence with one highlighted cue in one trial and then four highlighted cues in every other trial, which was defined as the Free-choice (F) condition ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1B; Methods)</ref>. Within the F condition, the sequenced trials with one highlighted cue was called as the Fs sub-condition, and trials with fully four highlighted cues was called as the Ff sub-condition. An order of R/S/F conditions was randomized to each participant and repeated the order four times in total <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1c</ref> top; Methods). The R condition was also added in the first block, which was defined as the Baseline (B) block, whose data was discarded for later analysis. In total, 13 blocks with 80 trials per block were run for each participant. Experiment 1 was designed for testing the proposed hypothesis whether participants' reaction time (RT) improved from the first (Repetition1) to the last repetition block (Repetition4), especially within the Ff condition in this modified SRTT. A mean RT across R/S/Fs/Ff conditions in Repetition1-4 showed main effects of condition, F <ref type="bibr">(2.12,103</ref>.63) = 15.99, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .14, and repetition, F(3,147) = 99.29, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .15, and an interaction effect of condition and repetition, F(5.55, 271.95) = 14.67, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .05.</p><p>Further planned repeated t-tests showed that a mean RT changed across Repetitions (Repetition4-1) in the R (MR4-R1 = -0.02 ± 0.04, t(49) = -4.00, p &lt; .001 , Cohen's d = .57), S (MR4-R1 = -0.06 ± 0.06, t(49) = -6.51, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = .92), Fs (MR4-R1 = -0.08 ± 0.08, t(49) = -7.47, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = 1.06), and Ff conditions (MR4-R1 = -0.14 ± 0.08, t(49) = -11.81, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = 1.67). After that, we ran other planned paired t-tests to see if RT changes differed across conditions, specifically between the R-S, R-Fs, R-Ff, S-Fs, S-Ff, and Fs-Ff conditions. The analysis showed that RT changes did not differ between the S-Fs conditions, t(49) = 2.37, p = .13, Cohen's d = .34, but the rest of comparisons showed differences, R-S (t(49) = 3.11, p = .02, Cohen's d = .44), R-Fs (t(49) = 4.45, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = .63), R-Ff (t(49) = 8.40, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = 1.19), S-Ff (t(49) = 6.03, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = .85), and Fs-Ff comparisons (t(49) = 4.20, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = .59), respectively, demonstrating that the RT improvement in the Ff condition was the largest among the four conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 2a</ref>).</p><p>Similarly, we tested if an intra-individual variability on RT, measured by a mean coefficient of variance (CV), changed across repetitions of training among conditions. There was no interaction effect of repetition and condition, F(4.88,229.37) = 1.70, p = .14, η 2 = .01, but there were main effects of condition, F(1.93,90.59) = 35.46, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .23 and repetition, F(3,141) = 8.01, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .02. Same planned paired t-tests as that of RT were run, and that revealed that only the Ff condition showed a CV change across Repetition4-1, (MR4-R1 = 0.08 ± 0.14, t(49) = 3.73, p = .002, Cohen's d = .53). We ran further paired t-tests to examine if this CV change was differed from other conditions, but the CV change in the Ff condition (MR4-R1 = 0.08 ± 0.14) was only differed from that of the R condition (MR4-R1 = 0.01 ± 0.04), t(48) = 2.96, p = .015, Cohen's d = .42 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 2b)</ref>. Moreover, a raincloud graph in the Ff condition ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 2c)</ref> showed that the CV increase in the Ff condition was specific to some fractions of participants(sharp green cloud converted to flattened orange cloud).</p><p>We further investigated if such individual differences existed on a distribution of choice proportion among the four free choices per trial across training, and tested if the choice distribution got narrowed down into a fewer choices to speed up a RT. As a measure of choice distribution, we used entropy sum (as bits) differing across training, in a formula of -Σ(p(x)*log(p(x))), p(x) as a proportion of each choice over total events per block for each sequence and averaged out the entropy sum among the four Ff sequences. A paired t-test on the averaged entropy sum in Repetition1 and 4 showed that the entropy measure in the Ff condition reduced across training (Repetition4-1), t(49) = -5.15, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = 0.73, indicating that participants reduced their choice distribution across training. Still, a raincloud graph in the Ff condition ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 2d</ref>) showed that its distribution was a bimodal in Repetition4(orange cloud) with the taller peak around 0, suggesting that some participants reduced their entropy substantially by choosing a same key over most of trials in Repetition4.</p><p>Next, we tested if the RT improvement across training in the Ff condition was correlated with other behavioral measures, and the Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the RT improvement (indicated by negative difference) and CV change (indicated by positive difference) across training in the Ff condition was negatively correlated, r(47) = -.43, p = .006, Fisher's z = -.46, but the entropy reduction was not correlated with the RT change, r(48) = .16, p = .79, Fisher's z = . <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> (See correlation graphs in <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 1a</ref>). This finding was matched to previous work suggesting that increasing CV linked to emerging awareness of trained sequential patterns or wandering about task strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> , suggesting that participants in this present study might form and become aware of a selfpicked sequential pattern across training in the Ff condition. Yet, what was not consistent with the idea was that the RT improvement was not linked to an entropy reduction or a reduction of choice distribution across training, if participants determined to choose the self-designed sequence. This inferred that the study setting of Experiment 1 might give participants too much freedom on a stimulus-selection in the Ff condition. Based on the bimodal distribution of entropy in Repetition4 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 2d</ref>) with a peak at around 0, some participants might not learn a sequence but develop a strategy to focus on speed improvement, for example by selecting a same key over most trials, as there was no wrong answer to choose any one of the four options in the Ff condition. In order to restrict participants to develop motor sequence learning in a quasi-free-choice and -sequenced condition, another systematic setting was necessary to implement, for example reducing a number of selectable choices from the four to two choices in the free-choice condition. This setting allowed to set a binary-free-choice condition per trial and construct a underlying sequential pattern in connected trials. Then, we aimed to examine if participants developed a preferred choice (e.g. more frequent stimulus-selection on a "W" key within freely selectable "W"-"D" options) between binary options of a sequence and if that helped to facilitate motor sequence learning.</p><p>After identifying the advantage of performance improvement in the free-choice (i.e. Ff) condition in Experiment 1, we next examined if this advantage would be merely linked to the free-choice condition, or also required repetitive practice of the actions (thus, participants had to choose a same cue frequently in each trial of a sequence to become familiar with an own created sequence) and a sequence of the actions (i.e. the benefit also shown on connected trials longer than one trial). In order to test this, new 50 samples (Mage = 25.14 ± 4.25 years, 54% female) were collected in Experiment 2, and we slightly modified procedures of the SRTT so that participants had to decide a choice between two freely-selectable options in each trial (blue circles in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1d</ref>). Again, the random (R) condition shuffled a sequence of the six possible combinations (see the patterns in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1d</ref>) in each six trials, while the sequenced (S 2 ) condition repeated a same sequence in the rest of trials. In Experiment 2, each block was contained of 78 trials. We also fixed the order of the R/S 2 conditions as B</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1)-R(2)-R(3)-S 2 (4)-S 2 (5)-...-S 2 (14)-S 2 (15)-R(16)-R<label>(</label></formula><p>17) (a number in the parentheses indicated a block number) to all participants, and defined R(2-3) as the "preR", S 2 (4-5) as "earlyS 2 ", S 2 (14-15) as "lateS 2 " and R(16-17) blocks as "postR" conditions ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1c bottom)</ref>. This setting allowed us to test if this study replicated prior work with the SRTT, by seeing RT improvement across the preR to postR conditions as an overall motor improvement and a RT slow-down across the lateS 2 to postR conditions as an acquisition of motor sequence learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . In addition to that, we also tested if Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1 that participants improved their performance across training from the earlyS 2 to lateS 2 condition within the S 2 condition and whether RT improvement across training was linked with CV increase and entropy reduction.</p><p>By comparing a mean RT among conditions (preR/earlyS 2 /lateS 2 /postR) with one-way repeated ANOVA, we found a main effect of condition, F(1.72, 84.34) = 57.91, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .54, and further planned paired t-tests showed the postR (MpostR = 0.44 ± 0.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 3a middle)</ref>. This confirmed that our study replicated an overall motor improvement (postR-preR) and motor sequence learning (postR-laeS 2 ) in Experiment 2, as well as a replication of Experiment 1 that participants improved their performance within the S 2 condition (lateS 2 -earlyS 2 ). See a mean RT change per block across all 17 blocks, in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3a</ref> left.</p><p>We used a same repeated ANOVA on CV with an expectation of increasing CV across training in the S 2 condition, as shown in Experiment 1 in the Ff condition. This analysis showed a main effect of condition, F(1.20, 58.57) = 16.20, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .25, and a further planned paired t-test confirmed that participants increased their CV across training in the S 2 condition, (MlateS2 = 0.18 ± 0.14, MearlyS2 = 0.10 ± 0.04, t(49) = 4.04, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = .57) ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3a right)</ref>. Again, a raincloud plot showed that this CV increase was specific to some fraction of participants increasing a substantial CV within the S 2 condition <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3b)</ref>.</p><p>In a same manner as Experiment 1, we used a paired t-test on the entropy measure (i.e. mean entropy sum per condition) with an expectation of decreasing entropy across training within the S 2 condition. This analysis showed a decrease of entropy across training in the S 2 condition, MlateS2 = 0.39 ± 0.24, MearlyS2 = 0.48 ± 0.25, t(49) = -2.58, p = .01, Cohen's d = .37 ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3c)</ref>. A raincloud plot also showed a shift of a mode of its distribution from higher to lower entropy across training, indicating that participants narrowed down their stimulusselection into a fewer choices. A peak of the distribution in the lateS 2 condition(orange cloud) was not located around 0, suggesting that participants' stimulus-selection was no longer based on a strategy to choose a same key over all trials but probably based on developing biased stimulus-selection over binary options of a provided sequence.</p><p>Next, we used Pearson correlation analysis to examine if the overall motor improvement (i.e. postR -preR) as a baseline showed any correlation between behavioral measures and that revealed no correlation between the RT improvement and CV change, r(48) = -.04, p &gt; .99, Fisher's z = .04, and the RT improvement and entropy change, r(48) = 0.23, p = .11, Fisher's z = 0.24. Compared to the baseline, Pearson correlation analysis on the performance improvement within the S 2 condition (lateS 2 -earlyS 2 ) revealed that there were a negative correlation between the RT improvement and CV change, r(48) = -.76, p &lt; .001, Fisher's z = -.99, and a positive correlation between the RT improvement and entropy reduction, r(48) = .41, p = .009, Fisher's z = .43 (see correlation graphs in <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 1b</ref>).</p><p>After confirming the overall motor improvement (postR-preR), the motor sequence learning (postR-lateS 2 ) and the performance improvement within the S 2 condition (lateS 2 -earlyS 2 ) in Experiment 2, we divided trials into two cases in the six combinations ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1d)</ref> when participants preferentially pressed a key more frequently within the binary options (e.g. pressing a "W" key 90% of the time in the "W-D" pair) than the alternative key (e.g. pressing a "D" key 10% in the "W-D" pair) in the lateS 2 condition, and these choices were defined as the High-and Low-frequent choices across the four conditions, respectively. Then, we examined if motor sequence learning and RT improvement in the S 2 condition were specific to the high-frequent choice. A two-way repeated ANOVA on condition (preR/earlyS 2 /lateS 2 /postR) and choice (High-/Low-frequent choice) revealed that there were main effects of condition, F(2.15, 105.39) = 42.57, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .28, and choice, F(1, 49) = 26.17, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .05, and an interaction effect of condition and choice, F(1.40, 68.66) = 10.52, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .05 ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3d left)</ref>. Further planned paired t-tests showed that the high-frequent choice showed both overall motor improvement, t(49) = 5.79, p &lt; .001 Mlow-earlyS2 = 0.48 ± 0.12). Then, we used additional paired t-tests to check if the performance improvement within the S 2 condition showed a stronger RT reduction than that of the overall motor improvement in the High-and Low-frequent choice similar to a comparison of the R's and Ff's RT change in Experiment 1. The analysis revealed that the high-frequent choice showed a stronger performance improvement within the S 2 condition (M = -0.11 ± 0.10) than that of overall motor improvement (M = -0.05 ± 0.06) (t(49) = 4.12, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = .58), whereas the low-frequent choice did not show a difference (t(49) = 0.83, p &gt; .05, Cohen's d = 0.12), suggesting that this advanced performance improvement within the S 2 condition was specific to the high-frequent choice. These results identified that motor sequence learning and performance improvement within the S 2 condition were specific to high-frequent choice and participants needed to execute same stimulus-selection repetitively to get the benefit, while overall motor improvement were more generic and transferable across all trials.</p><p>After that, we examined again if there was a correlation between RT improvement and corresponding entropy change, by analyzing data of overall motor improvement as a baseline, and data of performance improvement within the S 2 condition as a core data in the high-and low-frequent choice trials. Due to a limitation of available trials, there was no data of CV here. The Pearson correlation analysis revealed that, the overall motor improvement was not correlated with entropy change in high-frequent choice, but positively correlated in low-frequent choice,  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Supplementary Fig. 2</ref>). Here showed that orchestrating RT improvement and entropy changes within the S 2 condition was specific to trials of the highfrequent choice.</p><p>We also examined how a proportion of the high-frequent choice changed across conditions. This analysis showed a main effect of condition, F(2.42, 118.59) = 37.09, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .43 ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3d right)</ref>, and further planned paired t-tests showed differences of preR-earlyS <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref>  Extended to the above results, we examined if the motor sequence learning through highfrequent choice existed in a sequence of two consecutive trials in the S 2 condition. This analysis revealed that, there were main effects of condition, F(2.35, 115.14) = 42.96, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .30, and choice, F(1, 49) = 20.72, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .04, and an interaction effect of condition and choice, F(3, 147) = 3.80, p = .01, η 2 = .02 ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3e left)</ref>. ). Again, we tested additional paired t-tests to check if the performance improvement within the S 2 condition showed a stronger RT reduction than that of the overall motor improvement in the high-frequent choice. The analysis revealed that the high-frequent choice showed a stronger performance improvement within the S 2 condition (Mhigh-performance-improvement-within-S2 = -0.11 ± 0.09) than that of overall motor improvement (Mhighoverall-motor-improvement = -0.06 ± 0.09) (t(49) = 4.12, p = .006, Cohen's d = .44), but the lowfrequent choice did not show a difference (t(49) = -0.60, p &gt; .99, Cohen's d = -0.08, Mlowperformance-improvement-within-S2 = -0.06 ± 0.11, Mlow-overall-motor-improvement = -0.07 ± 0.10), suggesting that this stronger performance improvement within the S 2 condition than overall motor improvement was specific to the high-frequent choice. Due to a limitation of available trials, entropy data was not collected and further analysis was not done.</p><p>Finally, we examined if a proportion of the high-frequent choices in a sequence of two consecutive trials also changed across conditions. This analysis showed a main effect of condition, F(2.05, 100.50) = 50.74, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .51 ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3e right)</ref>, and further planned paired t-tests showed differences of preR-earlyS <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref>  22. In the R conditions, a proportion of the high-frequent choices were substantially low in this analysis. This was probably because there were substantially few cases to have a same sequence in two consecutive trials in the R condition as the S 2 condition, thus future studies were required to control this condition. Yet, within the S 2 condition, participants showed development of preference on high-frequent choices across training (earlyS 2 -lateS 2 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this present study with the modified SRTT, we consistently found that the free-choice condition (the Ff condition in Experiment 1 and the S 2 condition in Experiment 2) showed performance improvement on RT, an increase of intra-individual variability (CV) on RT and a choice narrow-down(entropy reduction) among selectable options across training, as well as correlations between them. In addition to that, Experiment 2 showed that this benefit was specific to the items (high-frequent choices) participants repetitively favored in stimulus-selection between binary options of a sequence. These findings collectively supported the proposed mechanism derived from combined work of research in motor sequence learning and intentional decision-making, that motor sequence learning is developed in a (quasi-)free-choice condition by repetitively selecting a personally preferred pattern of a sequence that gradually builds up internal sequential representations between stimulus-action components.</p><p>To test the proposed mechanism further, future studies will help to examine, for examples, if a personally preferred choice in each trial of a sequence will match with personally biased perceptional decision-making on the item (e.g. deciding which side of two horizontally-lined degraded blue circles becomes visible initially), similar to previous work of intentional decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> , or if personally designed sequential pattern developed in an initial training will be a distractor for learning a subsequent new sequential pattern if the initially acquired sequential pattern distracts new learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , or if repetitively selected sequential pattern at initial training boosts new learning if the new sequence pattern is compatible with the previously acquired sequential pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , similar to previous work of motor sequence learning.</p><p>Further brain imaging studies with paradigms similar to this present study will also help to delineate which brain networks and activities play a critical role in motor sequence learning under a free-choice condition. As decision-making studies with stimulus-driven and intentional decision-making tasks have shown that there are overlapped neural networks for both types of decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , overlapped neural networks would be also expected for the stimulus-driven and intentionally-chosen motor sequence learning.</p><p>A key finding in this present study was that, choice-preference (i.e. the high-frequent choice) was developed through repetitive biased stimulus-selection between binary options of a sequence (i.e. the earlyS 2 -lateS 2 period), that survived distractions after an initial acquisition (i.e. the lateS 2 -postR period), by continuously improving a RT speed and narrowing-down into a fewer choices across training as a positive reinforcer for choosing same stimuli of a sequence. One possible application of this finding is to use it for education to encourage pupils to start their preferred pattern of a sequence of drawing images, reading words, playing musical tones or athletic body movements, for example moving a football with their leg, for a short period of time repetitively, that gradually develops their own preferred pattern of behaviors, as well as RT speed-ups and proficiency of the task.</p><p>The other key message of this present study is that stimulus-driven and endogenouslygenerated motor sequence learning shared similar learning processes, both requiring a sufficient amount of repetitive training to maintain the trained sequential pattern. Recently, the inside-out framework has been proposed that brain systems for functioning for pastrecalling, present-simulation, and future-planning in declarative memory are overlapped each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and such flexible overlapped brain functioning has also been seen for neural correlates of stimulus-driven (reward) and endogenously-generated (curiosity) motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> . Similarly, we postulated that our motor skill learning also involve flexible brain functioning overlaps (e.g. acquisition of motor sequence learning, practice of actionstimulus pairing and action planning that is also extended into choice-preference formation), and that might be a reason why motor sequence learning and choicepreferences developed concurrently across training in this task. This present study also raised a possible important role of the intentional decision-making principle that suggests how our motor sequence learning, action-/choice-selection and choice-preferences are formed through a consequence of competitions between neural evidence.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that motor sequence learning was developed through repetitive selection of a same sequential pattern under the free-choice condition, that also synchronized with a choice-preference formation. Further brain imaging studies are essential for understanding the brain mechanisms of the endogenously-generated motor sequence learning and also for comparing how that is different from stimulus-driven motor sequence learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Participants and pre-registration. Both Experiment 1 and 2 were consisted of 50 participants recruited from an online recruitment portal (Prolific, https://www.prolific.co/), and participants conducted an online experiment on Pavlovia (https://pavlovia.org/), an online experiment platform. Experiments were designed by PsychoPy(https://www.psychopy.org <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> ), a Python-and JavaScript-based software package. Participants were pre-screened to criteria of age range 18-35 years old and fluent in English. All participants gave informed consent prior to experiment. Experiments were approved by the Cardiff University School of Psychology's Ethics Committee.</p><p>Final sample size for data analysis, exclusion criteria, experiment procedures and analysis plans were pre-registered prior to data collection (https://osf.io/a2n8r for Experiment 1 and https://osf.io/fsgx8 for Experiment 2). For Experiment 1, an exclusion criteria of multiplekey presses more than 50 times were added later due to unexpected excessive multiplekey presses by some participants (See details in the Task procedures and Measures subsections of Methods).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task procedures. Participants completed a modified version of the Serial Reaction Time</head><p>Task (SRTT), a cognitive task widely-used for measuring implicit motor skill learning across training <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . In this present study, each trial presented an image of four white circles in a horizontal row at the center of the computer screen, and one or more circle(s) were highlighted in a color of blue one at a time for 2.5 seconds. Participants were instructed to position their left and right hands with middle and index fingers to "W"(left hand-middle finger), "D"(left hand-index finger), "K"(right hand-index finger) and "O"(right hand-middle finger) keys on their keyboard and asked to press a corresponding key (moving from a leftmost to a rightmost circle, pairing to "W", "D", "K", "O" key, respectively; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a</ref>) when circle(s) were highlighted. They were instructed to press a corresponding key as quick and accurately as possible. If participants' response was correct, this trial was counted as a correct response and a next trial started after a fixed 500 millisecond inter-trial interval(ITI), where all circles were empty(white). If participants made an incorrect response or did not give any response, the trial continued until they made a correct response or until a full 2.5 second presentation period passed, and this trial was counted as an incorrect response. When participants pressed multiple keys simultaneously within a trial, the response was counted as an incorrect response as well. Before starting the SRTT, participants gave informed consent and filled up demographic information and were instructed to do some trials of practices with visual and text instructions on the computer screen.</p><p>The first experiment (Experiment 1) consisted of 13 blocks with four different conditions: the Baseline (B), the Random (R), the Sequenced (S), and the Free-choice (F) conditions. The B condition was the first block of the R conditions, whose data was discarded for later analysis. After that, an order of the R, S and F conditions were randomly shuffled to each participant (e.g. S-R-F), and the three conditions in the assigned order were repeated for four times in total <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1c)</ref>. Between blocks, there was a break of 30 seconds. All types of conditions were made up of a sequence of the four unique keys (i.e. "W", "D", "K", "O") twice for each 8-trial, and that were pseudo-randomized (e.g. O-W-K-D-O-D-K-W), such that there was no pattern of four cues stepping from left-to-right or right-to-left consecutively. Also, the same cue was not repeated consecutively. The pseudo-order of the eight trials repeated for 10 times for each block. Thus, each block contained a total of 80 trials. The 10 repetitions were referred to as 10 bins and the first bin was discarded for later analysis. Between bins, same cues were not repeated and also no pattern of four cues were stepping from left-to-right or right-to-left consecutively. The R condition had 8-sets of keys randomly shuffled every bin. The S condition repeated the first pseudoordered eight trials in the rest of the trials. The F condition also repeated in a same manner as the S condition with different eight sequential pattern, but within the eight sets of consecutive trials, every other trial had the Free-choice condition, which highlighted all four circles in a color of blue, and participants were allowed to press any one of the four keys. Thus, in the F condition, there were four fixed sequence trials and four Free-choice trials within the eight sets of consecutive trials, which were sub-categorized as the Fs and the Ff conditions, respectively <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1b)</ref>. The Experiment 1 was designed for an initial examination if the S (and Fs) condition showed performance improvement (e.g. faster reaction time and better accuracy) across training compared to the R condition, and then testing which direction the Ff condition went, either stronger or weaker improvement than the S(and Fs and R) condition in this task.</p><p>The second experiment (Experiment 2) consisted of 17 blocks with three different conditions: the Baseline (B), the Random (R), and the Sequenced (S 2 ) conditions. Again, the B condition was the first block of the Random conditions, whose data was discarded. After that, this version of experiment fixed an order of blocks to R(1)-R(2)-S 2 (3)-S 2 (4)-S 2 (5)-...-S 2 (14)-S 2 (15)-R(16)-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> for all participants (a number in the parentheses indicated a block number). Then, blocks were classified further into R(1-2) as the "preR", S 2 (3-4) as the "earlyS 2 ", S 2 (14-15) as the "lateS 2 " and R <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> as the "postR" conditions <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1c)</ref>. This design was set to compare a RT change in the R conditions before and after learning a fixed sequence pattern in the S 2 condition (postR-preR), and to compare a RT slow-down at the postR after learning a fixed sequence pattern in the S 2 condition (postR-lateS 2 ), the two frequently used measures for measuring overall motor performance improvement and implicit motor sequence learning, respectively, in previous work <ref type="bibr">3,29 .</ref> In Experiment 2, all conditions were made up of a sequence of the six unique combinations of two freely selectable cues highlighted simultaneously per trial (i.e. "W-D", "W-K", "W-O", "D-K", "D-O", "K-O") for each 6-trial, and that were pseudo-randomized (e.g. W-D(1), D-O(2), W-K(3), W-O(4), D-K(5), K-O(6)), such that there was no pattern of a same cue repeated three times consecutively. A two consecutive repetition of a same pair was also avoided. The pseudo-order of the six trials was randomly shuffled 13 times for each block. Thus, each block contained a total of 78 trials. The 13 repetitions were referred to as 13 bins and the first bin was discarded for later analysis. Between bins, same pairs and cues were not repeated two and three times, respectively. In the S 2 condition, the first pseudo-randomized six trial sequence was fixed across entire trials <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1d)</ref>. The Experiment 2 was designed for examining if and how choice preferences were formed within the two freely-selectable choices across blocks, especially in the lateS 2 condition, and investigating if and how such choice preferences affected participants' motor sequence learning across training.</p><p>Measures. In this study, we employed measures of reaction times (RT), accuracy, and coefficient of variation (CV) as a measure of intra-individual variability on RT and an entropy sum as a measure of a choice distribution (or expected amount of information in information theory) among available choices in Experiment 1 and 2. A CV was calculated in a formula of a standard deviation of RT divided by a mean of RT <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> . An entropy sum (as bits) was calculated in a formula of -Σ( p(x) * log( p(x) ) ), where p(x) was as a proportion of each choice over total events per block for each position of a sequence and averaged out the entropy sum among the four Ff positions in Experiment 1 and the six positions in Experiment 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . At first, participants with accuracy for overall trials of each condition (i.e. B,R,S <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> , in Experiment 1-2 and also F in Experiment 1) lower than 85% and multi-key presses more than 50 times in Experiment 1 and 65 times in Experiment 2 were excluded.</p><p>Then, data of these measures was cleaned at first by removing incorrect responses, and then removing 2.5 standard deviation outliers on the RT. Then, data of individual trials were aggregated into a median per bin, and then they were aggregated into a mean and a CV and proportions of choices for entropy calculations per block. Then, if a mean RT of a participant across blocks was more or less than 2.5 standard deviation of a group on RT, those people were excluded too. Participants with missing data on RTs were also excluded for further analysis. In total, 50 samples were used for further analysis in Experiment 1.</p><p>In addition to that, Experiment 2 collected a proportion of response between two Freechoices (e.g. a number of choosing the "W" cue over the "W-D" pair trials) in the lateS 2 condition and classified two different choices into a high or low frequent choice depending on a relatively larger or smaller size of proportion between the two choices, respectively (e.g. choosing the "W" cue more frequently than the "D" cue in the "W-D" pair trials, thus the "W" cue choice was classified as a high frequent choice). Experiment 2 collected response proportions, RTs and entropy sum of those high and low frequent choices in the lateS 2 condition in the preR, the earlyS 2 , the lateS 2 , and the postR conditions, in order to examine if choice proportions, RTs and entropy changed across training, as well as relationship between them. Due to a limitation of trials, there was no data of CV. Furthermore, Experiment 2 examined if such high and low frequent choices existed in a longer than one trial, thus in a sequence of two consecutive trials (e.g. two consecutive choices of "W" and then "K" keys in "W-D" and then "W-K" pair trials), by collecting a proportion of responses of high and low frequent choices of two trials in a row. In this measure, we defined a high frequent choice in two trials in a row as a proportion of responses larger than 0.25, indicating that a pattern of the two consecutive choices was more than one-fourth among four possible combinations of choices in two trials in a row (e.g. based on the above example, there were four possible choice combinations of "W"-"W", "W"-"K", "D"-"W", "D"-"K"), and low frequent choice was a pattern of two choices lower than or equal to 0.25. We collected a proportion of responses and RT of those high and low frequent choices in two consecutive trials in the lateS 2 condition, and then collected same choices in the other three conditions to see if those consecutive choices also changed across conditions. In order to keep sufficient samples of those high and low frequent choices in a trial and two trials in a row, only incorrect and multi-key presses were removed and then aggregated into a median per bin and then aggregated into a mean per block. Due to a shortage of data on an entropy sum of high and low frequent choices in the two consecutive trials, further analysis was not conducted on the data. Participants with missing data of RTs in this data were excluded and a total of 50 samples were used for further analysis.</p><p>Statistical analyses. Experiment 1 mainly focused on RT changes across repetitions of training in each condition and compared if those RT changes differed between conditions. In order to examine this, we employed a repeated two-way ANOVA on RT with withinsubject factors of repetition (Repetition 1 to 4) and condition (R/S/Fs/Ff). If the sphericity test was failed, a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied. Then, planned paired ttests were used, and we hypothesized that RT changes, especially between Repetition 1 and 4, would show in the S and Fs conditions, and probably also in the R and Ff condition. After that, we ran other planned paired t-tests and hypothesized that the RT changes differed between the S and Fs vs the R conditions, and inspected if there were differences between the Ff vs the S, Fs, R conditions. A same ANOVA with within-subject factors of repetition and condition was also run on CV. Yet, we did not have a strong hypothesis on this analysis, but we did same planned paired t-tests on CV as we did on the RT analyses. For the analysis on entropy, we focused on an entropy change from Repetition 1 to Repetition 4 in the Ff condition with paired t-test accompanying with raincloud plot, to see if choice distribution changed across training in the Ff condition. After that, we examined if there was a correlation between measures of RT, CV and entropy to see if those quantitative measures linked each other. If not explicitly mentioned, the Bonferroni correction was applied to each multiple comparison analysis and sphericity was examined with Mauchly's test prior to any of ANOVAs. Any p-value results were based on two-tailed tests, unless specified.</p><p>In Experiment 2, we initially ran a sanity check test with a repeated one-way ANOVA on RT with a within-subject factor of condition (preR, earlyS 2 , lateS 2 , postR) to replicate the Experiment 1's results. Then, further planned paired t-tests examined whether participants showed a RT speed-up (i.e. preR&gt;postR) as a marker of overall motor learning and a RT slow-down (i.e. postR&gt;lateS 2 ) as a marker of motor sequence learning, which has been widely shown in prior work with the SRTT <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> . Similarly, Experiment 2 also examined CV with a repeated one-way ANOVA. As Experiment 1 showed an increase of CV and entropy sum decrease across repetitions of training in the Ff condition, we also ran planned paired t-tests on lateS 2 -earlyS 2 difference of CV and entropy sum to see a similar CV increase and entropy reduction within the S 2 condition with Free-choice trials in Experiment 2. After that, we examined if there was a correlation between those quantitative measures (i.e. RT, CV and entropy). Then, we used a same one-way ANOVA on a response proportion of the high frequent choice in the lateS 2 condition across the four conditions and planned paired t-tests to examine if the response proportion was consecutively elevated across the preR to the lateS 2 conditions and decreased at the postR condition. Then, a repeated two-way ANOVA on RT was utilized with within-subjects factors of condition (preR, earlyS 2 , lateS 2 , postR) and choice (high-, low-frequent choice). Planned paired t-tests were used and hypothesized that RT of high-frequent choice sped up across the preR -lateS 2 conditions, but slowed down at the postR condition, while RT of low-frequent choice was expected to show either a milder or no change across conditions. After that, we examined again whether there was a correlation between those collected measures (i.e. RT, CV, and entropy) in either high-or low-frequent choice trials. Similarly, a same repeated two-way ANOVA and planned paired t-tests were used to examine if same patterns of RT changes across conditions were shown on high-and low-frequent choices in two trials in a row. Yet, further correlation analysis was not done in the two connected trials due to data shortage. <ref type="figure">Figures   Fig. Study design.</ref> (a) Schematic drawing of where participants were instructed to place index and middle fingers of their left and right hands on their physical keyboard. The "W", "D", "K", and "O" keys were paired to "the left-most", "the second left-most", "the secondright-most" and "the right-most" circle cues, respectively and participants were instructed to press one of those keys whenever corresponding cues were presented on the computer screen. (b) An example of a provided eight trials-long sequence with each trial with cue(s) highlighted in blue colors in consecutive trials in Experiment 1. Each participant was given a unique sequential pattern randomly. white circle cues were instructed to be ignored. In the Ff trials, all circles were highlighted and participants made their own decision to choose one. (c) Here drew study designs of Experiment 1(top) and 2(bottom). In Experiment 1, each participant was randomly given a unique pattern of R, S and F conditions, repeating the same order four times in total. In Experiment 2, the same order of the R and S 2 conditions shown here was given to all participants. Both conditions only showed two highlighted circles per trial. A sequential pattern of the R condition was shuffled every 6 trials, while the S 2 condition repeated the same pattern in the rest of trials. The R and S 2 conditions were categorized further into sub-conditions as depicted on the image. (d) An example of a given six trials-long sequence with each trial with two cues highlighted in blue colors in consecutive trials in Experiment 2. Each participant was given a unique sequential pattern randomly. RT (left) meant a slower response, and vice versa. A negative RT change (right) meant a RT speed-up across training and vice versa (b) A mean coefficient of variation (CV) as an intra-individual variability measure in each condition in each repetition(left) and a CV difference between repetition 4 and 1(right). A larger CV (left) meant that the participant had more variable RTs within the repetition, and vice versa. A larger positive CV change (right) meant that the participant increased CV across training and vice versa (c) A raincloud plot of mean CV drawn each individual as a dot in block repetition 1 and 4 in the Ff condition. Specially, a distribution graph in this plot clearly showed a change, especially curve flattening, across block repetitions. (d) A raincloud plot of mean entropy drawn each individual as a dot in block repetition 1 and 4 in the Ff condition. Specially, a distribution graph in this plot showed a change of mode situated from higher to lower mean entropy value, across block repetitions. A larger entropy meant that a distribution of choice proportion was widely distributed to the four available options within the repetition, and vice versa. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> Results in Experiment 2. (a-e) Each error bar was calculated by the standard error of the mean (SEM), except boxplots of raincloud plots in (b) and (c), where the maximum error bars were calculated as Q3 + 1.5*IQR and the mimimum error bars were calculated as Q1 -1.5*IQR and the thick middle black lines were medians.

Again, the earlyS 2 and lateS 2 conditions showed two highlighted circles per trial, while a same pattern of a six-trial-long sequence was repeated across conditions. The R condition showed two highlighted circles per trial, but a six-triallong sequence was shuffled every six trials. (a) Here drew results of a mean RT per block(left) and per condition (middle), and a result of a mean CV per condition (right). Only planned paired t-tests were done. (b) A raincloud plot of mean CV drawn each individual as a dot in the earlyS 2 and the lateS 2 conditions. Specially, a distribution graph in this plot clearly showed a change, especially curve flattening, across training, as same as in Experiment 1.
