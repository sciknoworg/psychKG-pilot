				<p>Self-control-the ability to pursue long-term goals over short-term temptations-is a critical faculty of human cognition, but the cognitive processes enabling self-control are not well understood. Traditional models have focused on impulse inhibition: effortfully inhibiting prepotent motor responses towards a temptation, yielding a stage-based evolution of choice. Other models emphasize dynamic competition between goal and temptation, yielding a more integrative evolution of choice. Although these models represent fundamentally different conceptions of self-control, current methods are inadequate for investigating real-time dynamics, leaving the question of which model best describes self-control unresolved. We investigate these models using mouse-tracking: a dynamic, real-time measure of decision-making in which we measure participants&apos; computer mouse movements as they navigate tradeoffs between immediate and delayed gratification (e.g., $5 today vs. $20 in 3 months). We develop a novel quantitative approach that integrates the rich spatial and temporal information contained in mouse trajectories, and find evidence for both impulse inhibition and dynamic competition. Notably, impulse inhibition is less frequent, occurring in only one-quarter of choices favoring larger later rewards over smaller sooner ones. We further find substantial individual variability on who relies on impulse inhibition, with more present-biased individuals more likely to use impulse inhibition to choose larger-later options. Finally, our approach reveals the diverse variability within impulse inhibition and dynamic competition, and accounting for this variability greatly strengthened models predicting out-of-sample choices. Our findings clarify the mechanisms underlying self-control and introduce a robust tool for quantifying real-time decision-making dynamics.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance Statement</head><p>For many, self-control is synonymous with impulse inhibition: effortfully exerting willpower to overcome automatic desires. Recently, some researchers have proposed alternatives that deemphasize or eliminate the importance of impulse inhibition. No consensus has emerged because existing methodologies are ill-suited to studying how people succeed at self-control. We develop a new quantitative approach to analyzing computer mouse movements that reveals how choices evolve in real-time. We find that, although impulse-inhibition does occur, it is uncommon and characteristic of impatient individuals. Additionally, mouse movements substantially outperform reaction time in predicting subsequent choices. This work thus resolves a long-running debate regarding the importance of impulse inhibition for self-control and showcases the advantages of using dynamic measures of choice.</p><p>Self-control-the ability to pursue long-term goals in the face of short-term temptations-is central to, and reflective of, the zeniths and nadirs of the human condition: our potential for achieving great things, regularly challenged by short-sightedness and impatience.</p><p>Our goals (e.g., for health, career, relationships, etc.) are constantly beset by temptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, and our choices in self-control conflicts have major consequences for our long-term wellbeing. The importance of self-control has generated a massive interdisciplinary research effort attracting attention from psychologists, economists, neuroscientists, nutritionists, and public health researchers. While these research programs have developed a comprehensive understanding of the individual and situational factors that promote self-control success, there is surprisingly little consensus on exactly how we succeed at self-control-the real-time operation of cognitive processes that facilitate resisting temptation. Specifically, researchers hold different assumptions about the temporal evolution of successful self-control: are temptations initially appealing but then overruled by better judgment? Or do temptations and goals simultaneously compete for selection? The lack of clarity surrounding how self-control unfolds in real-time has led to diverging perspectives about the nature of self-control as well as how best to support it.</p><p>Unfortunately, current methods are not well-suited to examining the precise nuances of how such choices evolve. In the present paper, we present a novel approach to understanding how selfcontrol conflicts unfold in real time. Specifically, we develop a new quantitative approach and apply it to a dynamic measurement technique (mouse-tracking) to assess the structure and variability of the in-vivo decision-making processes that lead to successful self-control. Overall, we aim to provide clarity of what self-control is and how it operates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stage-Based Impulse Inhibition</head><p>One long-dominant perspective on self-control is that the effortful inhibition of impulses is core to electing long-term over short-term goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. These conceptualizations, often built off of dual systems theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>, suggest a discrete evolution of choice, wherein one first experiences an impulse-an automatic urge often coupled with a prepotent motor response (i.e., <ref type="bibr">System 1)</ref>. After a delay, higher-order cognitive processes (i.e., System 2) can be engaged to override these impulses, provided that individuals have the motivation and ability to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>In this way, impulse inhibition models belong to a class of models in decision-making known as "stage-based" models that posit a sequential, stage-based evolution of choice. In the case of impulse inhibition, this manifests with the first stage dominated by automatic processes favoring indulgence, and the second stage dominated by controlled processes that can override these impulses ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1a</ref>).</p><p>Although such models have been highly generative for the study of self-control, the challenges inherent in decomposing a choice into its component stages have left many questions about impulses and their inhibition unresolved. For instance, what does inhibition look like (e.g., is it a sharp or gradual transition between the two systems?), how strong are these impulses, and when in the choice process does inhibition occur? Although impulse inhibition is the most prevalent model of self-control across disciplines, surprisingly little is known about its operating characteristics. Further, recent difficulties replicating early impulse inhibition findings (i.e., ego depletion, 12), coupled with experience sampling studies finding that those who succeed at selfcontrol are those who do not experience impulses <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>, have raised questions of the centrality of impulse inhibition for successful self-regulation, with some calling for the abandonment of the concept altogether <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Together, there remain many outstanding questions of the nature, scope, and relevance of impulse inhibition for self-control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrative Dynamic Competition</head><p>A growing body of work has begun to offer alternatives to these stage-based conceptualizations of self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. For instance, research on automaticity and goal pursuit suggests that temptations are not isomorphic with automatic processes, and that automatic processes can be crucial for avoiding temptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. In contrast to the stagebased models in which impulses are experienced and then inhibited (thereby presumably giving a discrete temporal evolution to the choice), alternative models (known as integrative models, 27-32) suggest both goal and temptation dynamically compete from choice onset, resulting in a push-pull where neither goal or temptation is given temporal precedence. One example is the drift diffusion model <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>, which suggests that we continuously accumulate evidence towards one option or the other-generally at a constant rate dictated by the difference in subjective value of the two options-and make a decision once sufficient evidence has been accumulated ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1b)</ref>. Thus, rather than an initial disposition towards indulging, followed by a discrete correction back towards the goal, integrative models suggests that the conflict between immediate and delayed gratification is resolved more continuously across the time-course of the decision.</p><p>These two theoretical approaches-stage-based impulse inhibition and integrative dynamic competition-propose fundamentally divergent accounts of how the mind handles difficult choices. One suggests a stage-based cognitive process that is aligned with dual-mode accounts of mental architecture, and which has been used to explain a diverse array of psychological phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. The other aligns with emerging dynamic approaches to the mind that is largely inconsistent with dual-mode approaches <ref type="bibr">(27-32, 41, 42)</ref>, raising intriguing questions about how the mind toggles in a continuous manner between options.</p><p>Beyond fundamental questions of dual versus dynamical systems, achieving a more nuanced understanding of the cognition underlying optimal and suboptimal self-control directly influences interventions for facilitating self-control (e.g., impulse inhibition accounts suggest giving people more time for System 2 to kick in, 8), as well as the moral meaning we ascribe to failure (with models focusing on impulse inhibition viewing failure as arising from mental weakness). These models also make diverging predictions about who uses impulse inhibition. If impulse inhibition is the defining feature of self-control, then people who are good at self-control should be successfully inhibiting more impulses relative to people with poor self-control.</p><p>However, if impulse inhibition serves as a last line of defense when other processes fail, those with better self-control should be less tempted by immediate gratification to begin with, and in turn should lead to fewer impulses that need to be inhibited, and a lower prevalence of impulse inhibition compared to those with poor self-control. Overall, then, knowing how self-control evolves will simultaneously deepen our understanding of the cognitive processes supporting selfcontrol, as well provide insight into why some people are more successful than others. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Depiction of both the temporal evolution of choice (top panels) and how these would manifest as mouse trajectories (bottom panels) for both stage-based impulse inhibition (left panels) and integrative dynamic competition (right panels). (A) Stage-based impulse inhibition predicts an evolution of choice such that automatic processes are dominant early and drive participants towards temptations (initial arrows highlighted in red), before controlled processes come online and inhibit these impulses, directing participants back towards the goal (second arrows highlighted in grey). Here, we depict three possible evolutions in which the impulse varies in magnitude and timing of correction. (B) Integrative dynamic-competition models predict a noisy accumulation of evidence, such that once evidence has accumulated beyond a certain threshold (dashed lines), a choice is made. Such models do not predict temporal precedence to either goals or temptations. Here, we depict three possible evolutions that vary in their drift rate. (C) How the impulse inhibition depicted in (A) might manifest in mouse trajectories: movement towards the temptation proportional to the strength of the impulse, followed by a discrete correction back to the goal once controlled systems come online. (D) How dynamic competition depicted in (B) might manifest in mouse trajectories: graded trajectories in which the directness is proportional to the drift rate.</p><p>Despite the fundamental differences between these models, it remains unclear which model-if either-most accurately describes self-control. Indeed, it is unclear whether impulse inhibition and dynamic competition are even the correct candidate models, and whether or not they are mutually exclusive. A central reason that the evolution of self-control is poorly understood is that current methods are not well equipped to investigate the real-time evolution of choices. Recent work using experience sampling has provided intriguing initial evidence that that those with good self-control report feeling fewer impulses and rely less on willpower to resist temptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. However, as these data rely on self-report, they do not allow for a precise quantification of whether choices evolved via stage-based or integrative manner. Similarly, although suggestive work from neuroscience and reaction time data suggests dynamic models better fit the data than dual process models <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>, neuroscience data generally lacks the temporal resolution to see how choices unfold in real time. Further, although these approaches can provide evidence as to which model is more likely given the entirety of the data, they require collapsing across trials, meaning that they are not well equipped to explore alternative structures of the data (e.g., if both impulse inhibition and dynamic competition are occurring) or explore variability within each self-control approach (e.g., how do impulses and their inhibition vary across trials?).</p><p>Ideally, we would like a method that can examine the systematic variability of the temporal evolution of self-control on a trial-by-trial basis to both explore the space of possible models, as well as allow us to go deeper and understand the rich ways in which self-control choices produced by these approaches can vary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mouse-Tracking: A Dynamic Measure of Choice</head><p>One recent approach that has been touted as a potential real-time window into decisionmaking is mouse-tracking: measuring participants' computer mouse movements while they make a choice. Depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, each choice starts with the cursor in the bottom-center of the screen, and then once the choice options are presented participants use their mouse to navigate to response options in the top-left and top-right corners of the screen to make a selection, all while their cursor location is recorded several hundred times per second. This offers a data-rich window that represents the spatial and temporal evolution of a choice. Built off of cognitive models that emphasize the dynamic interplay between motor movements and underlying cognitive processing, a large body of work suggests that mouse movements reflect the underlying cognitive processes when categorizing an object or making a decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. For instance, in categorization tasks (e.g., categorizing animals as fish vs. mammals), participants' mouse trajectories are more direct when they are categorizing typical exemplars (e.g., cow) than when categorizing atypical exemplars (e.g., whale). Similarly, in decision-making research, the directness of a mouse trajectory is strongly related to the difference in subjective value of the two  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b c</head><p>In this way, mouse-tracking allows researchers to "see" into the real-time evolution of choice, and how conflict within choice manifests and resolves with millisecond level precision.</p><p>This approach is thus ideally suited to study the temporal evolution of self-control. Indeed, the two accounts of impulse inhibition versus integrative dynamic competition make markedly different predictions regarding the evolution of choice in the context of mouse-tracking. Stagebased impulse inhibition, as noted above, should predict an early impulse towards the temptation, followed by a correction back towards the goal, resulting in a discrete trajectory evolution ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1c</ref>). Integrative dynamic competition, on the other hand, predicts a simultaneous pushpull between goal and temptation, with one eventually winning out, resulting in a more continuous trajectory evolution ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1d</ref>). 1</p><p>Notably, although mouse-tracking provides an extremely data-rich window into the decision process, mouse-tracking has yet to fully realize its potential  <ref type="figure">Figure S11</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62)</ref>. This has clear weaknesses: by setting a relatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> It is important to note that some dual-systems models can accommodate more graded trajectories (e.g., by having System 2 active from choice onset) and that some integrative models can accommodate discrete trajectories (e.g., by having different starting times for evidence accumulation, or by tying evidence accumulation to attention, 58, 59). However, we believe that stage-based and integrative models are most readily suited for explaining discrete and graded trajectories (respectfully), and that the ability to accommodate for the alternative approach is often not a central part of these models. We return to this point in the discussion.</p><p>arbitrary threshold, we risk overlooking trials that appear to be impulses that were just corrected relatively early. Another approach analyzes the distribution of trajectory curvature, with unimodal distributions reflecting dynamic competition and bimodal distributions reflecting impulse inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(63)</ref>. A third approach simply uses brute force, and has research assistants eyeball trajectories to classify them as either discrete or graded <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(64)</ref>. In addition to the inherent noise of these approaches, perhaps their biggest drawback is that their top-down nature imposes a narrow view of the diversity of self-control: they assume a relatively strict dichotomy such that self-control should look one of only two different ways. This is problematic because the actual evolution of self-control may not fit neatly into one of these boxes (i.e., it may involve different evolution profiles than the ones described above, or a combination of them), and therefore this approach collapses across any nuance that might exist within these rigid categories. Put differently, they are incapable of investigating systematic variability within these trajectory categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Research</head><p>In the present research, we develop a novel data-driven quantification approach to fully Broadly, our new approach, which we term "Functional Trajectory Analysis" (FTA)</p><p>consists of the three following steps. First, following standard practices, we time-normalize each trajectory yielding 101 x-y pairs for each trajectory <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(65)</ref>. Second, we smooth the x-and ycomponents of the mouse trajectory separately, using a functional data analysis approach known as basis splines (b-splines; 66-68). We first specify a collection of 103 basis functions, and for each trajectory estimate what linear combination of these functions best estimates the trajectory.</p><p>Estimation is performed using penalized regression, where the penalty term reflects the smoothness of the estimated curve. The b-splines approach is particularly useful for mouse tracking trajectories for two reasons. First, it smooths out noisy variations in the trajectories that may reflect errant motor movements, while capturing the shape and dynamics of the trajectory itself (see the supplement for analyses confirming that these smoothed trajectories reflect the originals in important forms). Second, this approach allows us to retain both the spatial and temporal information of the trajectories, without biasing the clustering algorithms towards minor variation in the beginning and end of the trajectory.</p><p>Finally, we apply agglomerative hierarchical clustering to the estimated b-spline coefficients for each mouse-tracking trajectory (both x-and y-simultaneously). Hierarchical clustering begins by treating each trajectory as its own cluster, and then combines the two most similar clusters (according to average Euclidean distance between the function coefficients) into one cluster. The algorithm then repeats this process iteratively, at each step combining the next two most similar clusters, until the two most dissimilar trajectories have been combined. This results in a binary tree, known as a dendrogram, that details when each trajectory was combined.</p><p>Dendrograms enable the investigation of homogeneous collections (clusters) of trajectories that are the most dissimilar from other clusters in each split (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>). The top cluster of the dendrogram contains all trajectories. The first split divides the data into two clusters, such that the trajectories in each group are more similar to one another than they are to any in the alternative cluster. As one goes further down the tree, these large clusters further subdivide into their subcomponent parts (we further replicate all results using k-means clustering, reported in the supplement).</p><p>Overall, this approach provides a data-driven way for researchers to explore the latent structure of how we arrive at self-control success. In the present research, we apply this tool to an existing dataset (54) consisting of four studies in which we measured 522 participants' mouse movements as they made between 180-210 intertemporal choices: choices of whether to accept some money now (e.g., $25 today, the "smaller-sooner") versus a larger amount of money some distance in the future (e.g., $40 in 180 days, the "larger-later"). Intertemporal choices such as these represent a distilled version of a self-control dilemma, as they directly pit immediate gratification against delayed gratification. Further, for two of the four studies, participants were (truthfully) told that one participant would be selected at random to have one of their choices (also selected at random) played out with real money, thus making the choices incentive compatible. In total, this dataset contains 100,575 total choices, with 46,774 decisions in which participants elected delayed over immediate gratification. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We submitted the functional form of the 46,774 trajectories in which participants elected long-term over short-term to a hierarchical clustering analysis. When examining the first split of the data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3)</ref>, which represents the two most dissimilar groups of trajectories, larger-later Impulse Inhibition: 26.3%</p><p>Dynamic Competition: 73.7%</p><p>choices appear to categorize into two primary classes: (1) a trajectory that appears consistent with impulse inhibition: a discrete evolution characterized by an initial and immediate deflection towards the smaller-sooner, followed by a correction back towards the larger-later, and (2) a trajectory that appears consistent with dynamic competition: a gradual evolution towards the larger-later. These results are notable for two reasons. First, these results suggest that the predictions of impulse inhibition and dynamic competition models indeed best describe the variability in our data. In other words, using this data driven approach, we find that the largest differentiator of choice evolution is whether trajectories appear discrete (i.e., arriving via impulse inhibition) or graded (i.e., arriving via dynamic competition). Notably, we find evidence for both</p><p>approaches, suggesting that a strict dichotomy (one model or the other) does not capture the rich variability in how people choose long-term over short-term. Indeed, this suggests that the question of which model is "right" or "wrong" is not the right question-we see evidence for both approaches to self-control. Second, however, is that the two clusters are not of equal sizein fact, trajectories were almost three times as likely to be clustered as dynamic <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr">465</ref> trajectories, 73.7%) as impulse inhibition (12,309 trajectories, 26.3%). This suggests that, while both impulse inhibition and dynamic competition represent real routes to choosing long-term over short-term, dynamic competition appears to be considerably more frequent. This is particularly important given the relative dominance of impulse inhibition in the literature and in popular understandings of self-control-these results suggest that impulse inhibition accounts for long-term choices roughly one third as often as dynamic competition approaches.</p><p>Robustness: Easy versus Difficult Trials. One alternative interpretation of these data is that we find relatively low levels of impulse inhibition because not all trials constituted a true self-control conflict-perhaps participants use dynamic competition for "easy" choices, and impulse inhibition for "hard" choices. To test this, we first modeled participants' intertemporal choices using a 2-parameter quasi-hyperbolic discounting model (69, 70):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= !! * * "</formula><p>where D corresponds to the delay of the larger-later option (in days), !! corresponds to the value of the larger later (in dollars) and and corresponding to the two parameters of the model (expanded on below), which are estimated for each person using their choices (see the supplement for details). These parameters allow us to compute, for each participant and trial, the subjective present value of the larger-later option. We then calculate the relative dominance of representing strongly overlapping distributions (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4a</ref>). Further, when examining 'count density' plots ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4b</ref>)-density plots that are not normalized for sample size and thus illustrate the number of trials in which participants chose the larger-later using impulse inhibition vs. dynamic competition-the impulse inhibition distribution is fully subsumed within the dynamic competition distribution. In other words, at every point along the subjective difficulty axis, we see that using dynamic competition is as likely or more likely than impulse inhibition.</p><p>Together, these data suggest that the difficulty of the decision is not able to account for the different strategies-instead, we see both impulse inhibition and dynamic competition across the spectrum of self-control difficulty. In the supplement, we further provide two additional robustness tests investigating these mouse trajectories. First, we demonstrate that impulsive trajectories are not the byproduct of motor biases (e.g., choosing smaller-sooner previously). Second, when we apply the same hierarchical clustering to the trials in which participants chose the smaller-sooner option (for which we might not expect as much impulse inhibition), the trials do not appear to cleanly divide into dynamic/impulse evolutions, and indeed there appear to be fewer of certain sorts of impulse trajectories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Variability: Impulsiveness and Present-Focus</head><p>The preceding results suggest that we can ask nuanced questions of when and which people are likely to rely on impulse inhibition versus dynamic competition-is there systematic individual variability in reliance on impulse inhibition to choose long-term over short-term? In particular, we have thus far argued that the impulsive trajectories reflect impulsive decisionmaking rather than some alternative evolution of choice (e.g., changing one's mind half-way through a decision, but not in a way typically viewed as impulsive). To provide evidence that  . Relationship between participants' parameter (higher values corresponding to lower present-bias) and participants' reliance on impulse inhibition when selecting larger later (0 = never used impulse inhibition when choosing larger later, 1 = used impulse inhibition every time when selecting larger later).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trajectory Subclusters: Probing the Diversity of Self-Control Approaches</head><p>Our approach is further unique in that it allows us to investigate deeper divisions of the clusters identified by hierarchical clustering, enabling a more nuanced understanding of the heterogeneity of impulse inhibition and dynamic competition. To this end, we examine four subdivisions each for impulse inhibition and dynamic competition(although we illustrate our findings with 8 subclusters here, we note that a major strength of our approach is that it allows for investigation at any granularity desired by researchers). These eight subclusters <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 6b</ref> and c) offer a richer window into both impulse inhibition and dynamic competition. towards the temptation only slightly before being corrected. Together, these provide some support for the dual systems notions that impulses can occur at varying strengths, with inhibition sometimes occurring relatively early in the processing stream. These data further demonstrate the power of our approach-that these more minor impulses can be correctly categorized as impulse inhibition rather than being lumped into dynamic competition.</p><p>We can similarly examine the dynamic competition trajectories. When examining the three most common trajectories (all except the bottom-right green trajectory in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 6b</ref>), it appears these trajectories vary along two dimensions. deflects towards the larger-later before reversing towards the smaller-sooner, then back again to the larger-later-in other words, it appears to be a 3-stage evolution of choice (though we note that this trajectory was the least common trajectory of all trajectories). As was the case with impulse inhibition, then, our approach allows for insight into the variable ways in which dynamic competition unfolds.</p><p>Predicting choice. We have thus far argued that delving into the variable and diverse approaches to choosing long-term over short-term is critical for a more nuanced understanding of the processes underlying self-control. To demonstrate the benefits of delving deeper into the variability of self-control, we investigate the predictive strength of tapping into the diversity of self-control approaches-does knowing how someone arrived at their choice prove diagnostic for their future decisions? To test this, we divide our dataset into quarters (based on the trial number modulo 4, such that trials were assigned to a group according to their remainder when dividing the trial number by 4), with the first two quarters of decisions constituting our training data, and the second two quarters of decisions constituting our testing data. Using our training data, we trained random forest models predicting the proportion of larger-later choices a participant made in the second quarter of choices (e.g., 20% choices of larger-later) from metrics corresponding to how people decided in the first quarter of choices. In our first two models, we predicted choices from the average reaction time while making a larger-later choice (Model 1) and the average Area Under the Curve (AUC) while making a larger-later choice (Model 2). We include these two metrics because they correspond to the most common dynamic method (reaction time), and the most common mouse tracking metric (AUC, which quantifies the average area between participants' trajectory and a straight trajectory when selecting larger-later choices), and thus serve as good comparison points. In Model 3, we predict choices from the proportion of largerlater choices made using impulse inhibition vs. dynamic competition (i.e., the two-cluster partition). In the remaining models, we predict choices from the proportion of individual subclusters from more granular hierarchy divisions. Because the choice of number of subclusters is inherently arbitrary, we test 3-cluster partitions through 30-cluster partitions (Models 4-31). I Models 3-31 then allow us to investigate the utility of examining how choices evolve, as well as test whether more nuanced cluster partitions provide better predictive leverage than the blunter dichotomous partition.</p><p>We then apply these four models to our testing data, which constitutes predicting the fourth-quarter decisions from third-quarter choice-metrics, and calculate the variance explained (R 2 ) by each model in this out-of-sample data (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>. Although all models significantly predicted out-of-sample choices, there was considerable variability in their performance.</p><p>Specifically, reaction time performed the worst (R 2 = .086), and considerably underperformed the model trained on area under the curve (R 2 = .214). Notably, including information about how larger-later choices were selected (impulse inhibition or dynamic competition) further improved model accuracy (R 2 = .294). Most striking, however, was that models trained on more granular partitions strongly outperformed these other models, with R 2 exceeding 50% with a 5-cluster partition (R 2 = .531), 60% with a 9-cluster partition (R 2 = .602), and eventually asymptoting at around 70% with a 23-cluster partition (R 2 = .705, with full numbers given in <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>). In other words, by accounting for the diverse ways that people arrived at self-control success, we gain substantial leverage for predicting subsequent choices Together, these results highlight the strength and importance of investigating how conflict is evolving and resolving (beyond just how much conflict is present or how long it took participants to make a choice), and further shows that tapping into the variable ways in which impulse inhibition and dynamic competition manifest offers substantial leverage for predicting choices. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. Random forest model performance predicting out-of-sample choices from different decision metrics. Models were trained on data predicting the second quarter of choices (% of LL choices made) from first quarter metrics -either reaction time (RT), area under the curve (AUC), or the proportion of choices in each cluster partition (from 2-30 clusters). These models were then applied to the testing data, which predicted fourth quarter decisions (% of LL choices made) from third quarter choice metrics. For each, we graph the R 2 of the resulting predictions (with RT and AUC indicated via dashed lines).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The cognitive processes underlying self-control are poorly understood. In the present paper, we developed Functional Trajectory Analysis to investigate the real-time dynamics of self-control choices. We find evidence for two of the predominant models of self-control: stagebased impulse inhibition and integrative dynamic competition. Notably, despite the centrality of impulse inhibition to many models of self-control (as well as public discourse), choices of long-term over short-term were almost three times as likely to evolve consistent with dynamic competition (73.7%) compared to impulse inhibition (26.3%). We also found that more presentbiased people (i.e., those with lower parameters), appear to rely on impulse inhibition more than less present-biased individuals, suggesting that individuals with better self-control are those who are not experiencing impulses to begin with. This research thus dovetails nicely with recent experience sampling data suggesting similar patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref> and recent theoretical pieces advancing alternatives to impulse inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41)</ref>. Taken together, the present results suggest that an emphasis on impulse inhibition as the central or defining feature of self-control may be misplaced.</p><p>Our approach further allows us to systematically investigate the heterogeneity of impulse inhibition and dynamic competition. By investigating the four subcomponents of impulse inhibition, it appears that such stage-based choices can be described by (a) the strength of the impulse, (b) the timing of the impulse (immediate vs. after a delay), and (c) the timing of inhibition. Similarly, when investigating dynamic competition, we find that trajectories differ primarily on when in the time-course of the decision they deflect towards the larger-later.</p><p>Importantly, taking advantage of the diverse ways in which people arrive at self-control success enabled markedly stronger prediction for out-of-sample decisions, with models trained using more granular partitions substantially outperforming those using a 2-cluster partition (i.e., impulse inhibition vs. dynamic competition), as well as those using reaction time or choice conflict (area under the curve).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models of Self-Control</head><p>One implication of the present work is that models of self-control need to be able to account for the prevalence of both stage-based impulse inhibition and integrative dynamic competition. It is important to note that some versions of existing models of self-control can account for both types of decisions. For instance, some dual systems models note that System 2 can be online from choice onset, thus producing choices that may appear similar to dynamic competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>. We believe the present approach may constitute a way for dual systems researchers to more formally investigate nuanced questions about the interplay between System 1</p><p>and System 2. Indeed, in order to account for the present data, such models may need to predict when System 2 is likely to be online from the beginning, and when it is recruited relatively later.</p><p>Similarly, some variants of the drift diffusion model allow for temporal asymmetries in the accumulation of evidence. For instance, the attentional drift diffusion model suggests that we accumulate evidence towards whichever option we are looking at, and therefore to the extent that attention is drawn to tempting options first, we might see a choice evolution similar to that of impulse inhibition (59), a proposition that could be tested by combining eye-tracking and mousetracking. Similarly, other diffusion modeling work suggests taste begins accumulating evidence faster than health in food choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(58)</ref>, which could similarly account for stage-based trajectories. We note, however, that both of these might predict more impulse-like trajectories than we see in our data, and such models must be specified such that they are able to predict the relative prevalence of stage-based and integrative trajectories. Together, although we believe that these models are generally better suited at explaining one type of decision profile, our goal is not to say that the presence of certain trajectories refutes these models, just that these models must be able to account for both types of data. Ultimately, we believe any model of self-control must take seriously the fact that successful self-control can arise in a way that is consistent with either stage-based or integrative choice evolution, and hope that functional trajectory analysis can serve as the basis for developing future models that integrate both types of decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrative vs. Stage-Based Decision-Making</head><p>In the present research, we have focused on self-control, in which integrative versus stage-based models of choice represent diverging philosophies of the nature of self-control.</p><p>However, debates between stage-based (or "sequential") and integrative models are common across other domains of decision-making and psychology. For instance, one popular model of attribution suggests a stage-based process whereby people initially make a dispositional attributions, and then correct those attributions with situational information during a second stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">75</ref>). An alternative model, however, suggests this information is integrated from choice onset, and eschews a stage-based evolution of attribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">77)</ref>. Functional trajectory analysis is uniquely positioned to adjudicate theoretical disputes between stage-based and integrative models across areas and topics. This approach thus has the potential to transform dynamic approaches to cognition and decision-making, and we invite future research using functional trajectory analysis to quantify the evolution of judgments, decisions, and categorizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications and Future Directions</head><p>The present work suggests a certain perspective on self-control that is relevant for individuals, psychologists, economists, and public policy makers. Specifically, it suggests that effortful impulse inhibition constitutes just one way that individuals choose long-term over shortterm. Approaches that seek to bolster inhibition, such as increasing the time before making a decision (e.g., to allow more controlled systems to engage, 8), or protecting the cognitive resources necessary to engage inhibition (78) may only work where failure reflects an inability to inhibit an impulse. The present work suggests that the most effective interventions will be those that are likely to work for both impulse inhibition and dynamic competition. For instance,</p><p>interventions that attempt to undermine the attractiveness of the temptation itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(79)</ref> or those that facilitate the reconstrual of tempting objects (80) may help both to make impulses less likely, and shift value-based choice toward long-term options. Our work suggests that those seeking to intervene to promote long-term decision-making must take a broad view of selfcontrol, and recognize the myriad ways in which people forego immediate gratification for longterm outcomes.</p><p>We Similarly, simply seeing a picture of a cookie (or the word "cookie") may be less likely to generate an impulse than the sight and smell of a real cookie. We invite future work investigating when and why impulses arise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Researchers have long sought for clearer and more direct windows into the mind. Our limited view has spawned multiple competing theories and conceptualizations of self-control. By applying functional trajectory analysis to mouse-tracking data, it appears that there are multiple routes to successful self-control-stage-based impulse inhibition and integrative dynamic competition. By quantifying the diverse ways in which participants elect long-term over short-term, we can begin to build models of self-control that more comprehensively reflect the realities of the decision-making process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Procedure</head><p>Participants. A total of 532 undergraduate students participated in exchange for research credit. Individual studies consisted of 191, 140, 93, and 108 participants (for Studies 1-4, respectively), from which we exclude the participants who selected only the smaller-sooner or larger-later option, leaving a total analyzable sample of 522 (188, 137, 90, and 107 for studies 1-4).</p><p>Mouse-tracking procedure. Participants next completed the mouse tracking decision portion of the experiment. Participants were instructed about the nature of the task, and asked to start moving their mouse once the decisions appeared on screen (even if they had not yet made a decision). Each trial started with a screen that was blank except for a "start" button placed at the bottom-center. Once participants clicked this button, their cursor disappeared and the delay amounts (e.g., "today" and "180 days") appeared beneath the response buttons in the upper-left and upper-right hand corners. After 500 milliseconds, the magnitude information (e.g., "$25"</p><p>and "$40") appeared on the response options and participants' cursors reappeared at the bottomcenter of the screen. We used this asymmetric information presentation, in which we first showed the delay information before the magnitude information, to alleviate the amount of information participants had to process at once. In addition, participants completed trials in blocks of 15, in which the delay amount was kept constant (and participants were informed of the delay amount in advance). Once participants regained control of their cursor, they then made their choice by navigating the mouse to one of the two response options and clicking on the response button (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>), which would then start the next trial. If participants did not start moving their mouse in at least 750 milliseconds, they were given a reminder to start moving the mouse as soon as the options appeared onscreen.</p><p>In total, participants completed 180 (Study 1), 195 (Studies 2-3), or 210 (Study 4) trials.</p><p>As mentioned above, choices were completed in blocks of 15. Smaller sooner values consisted of either $15, $25, or $45. Full larger later magnitude and delay information are provided in <ref type="table">Table   S4</ref>. The side of the screen that each option was presented on was constant (i.e., for one participant the larger-later would always be on the right), and counter-balanced between participants. For studies 1 and 4, participants were instructed that one participant would be selected at random to have one of their choices (also selected at random) played out with real money.</p></div>

Following established procedures and prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">65)</ref>, we first time-normalized the data, resulting in 101 x,y pairs such that point 1 = the beginning of the trial, and point 101 = the end of the trial. We then excluded trajectories that were +/-3 standard deviations from the mean on reaction time, area under the curve, and time to begin moving the mouse (we note these choices are not excluded for calculations of discount rate below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functional data analysis.</head><p>We then separated the x and y components of the trajectory, such that we had two time-series vectors each of length 101. For each of these, we generate a smoothed trajectory using basis splines (b-splines). We specify knots at each of the 101 timepoints, resulting in a collection of 103 basis functions. For each trajectory we estimate the linear combination of these functions using penalized regression such that result curves are penalized proportional to their smoothness (assessed via their second derivative). We set lambda (the weight on the penalty term) to 1. This resulted in 206 coefficients (103 for x and 103 for y) per trajectory.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering. We next subjected these 206 coefficients to agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Specifically, we calculated the Euclidean distance between the 206 coefficients of each of the 46,774 trajectories, resulting in a 46,774 × 46,774 distance matrix that served as the basis for the hierarchical clustering algorithm. As noted in the main text, agglomerative hierarchical clustering begins by treating each trajectory as its own cluster, and then combines the two closest clusters (according to the above distance matrix) into one cluster.</p><p>The algorithm then repeats this process iteratively, at each step combining the next two most similar clusters, until the two most dissimilar trajectories have been combined. This results in a binary tree, known as a dendrogram, that details when each trajectory was combined.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>options ( 49 -</head><label>49</label><figDesc><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54)</ref>, and is predictive of subsequent behavior<ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(57)</ref>.

For our individual difference variables, we use individuals' parameters of the quasihyperbolic discount model described above ( = !! * * " ). Here, (which varies between 0 and 1) corresponds to an exponential discounting parameter: every subsequent day of delay corresponds to some decrease of the present value of the larger-later option (median value in our dataset = .9987). This form of exponential discounting is typically thought of as rational, as it allows the individual to incorporate opportunity costs of not having the money immediately (73). In contrast, (which also varies between 0 and 1) corresponds to the drop in utility resulting from any delay of rewards (median value in our dataset = .8571). Unlike exponential discounting, this parameter represents a discontinuity such that rewards not available immediately are devalued to some degree. Because of this, this parameter is generally discussed interchangeably as representing impulsiveness and present-bias. In this way, the parameters from a quasi-hyperbolic model can quantify both economically rational ( ) and irrational ( ) patterns of human intertemporal choice. If impulse-inhibition trajectories indeed are the output of an impulsive process, we would predict that those with greater impulsivity/present bias (quantified as lower values of ) would be more likely to rely on impulse inhibition compared to dynamic competition. To test this, for each participant we calculated the relative reliance on impulse inhibition versus dynamic competition by calculating the proportion of larger-later choices in which participants used impulse inhibition versus dynamic competition (e.g., if a participant chose the larger-later option 100 times, and 75 of those 100 choices were classified as impulse inhibition trajectories, then their relative reliance on impulse inhibition would be .75). We then predicted this reliance on impulse inhibition from individuals' and parameters. As predicted, we see a significant relationship such that as participants' parameter decreases (i.e., they are showing greater present-bias/impulsivity), their reliance on impulse inhibition increases, b = -.23, SE = .03, t(509) = 7.42, p &lt; .001 (Figure 5). Further, when we predict reliance on impulse inhibition simultaneously from both impulsivity ( ) and exponential discount rate ( ), the impulsivity parameter still significantly predicts reliance on impulse inhibition, b = -.21, SE = .04, t(508) = 5.51, p &lt; .001, but exponential discount rate does not, b = -.05, SE = .04, t(508) = 1.22, p = .224. 3 Taken together, these results suggest that impulsivityrather than other valuation processes such as exponential discounting-is uniquely predictive of the impulse-inhibition trajectories. These results thus show that there is important systematic variability in who relies on impulse inhibition-those who are more present-biased-and further supports our claims that impulse inhibition trajectories indeed reflect impulsive processes rather than an alternative psychological account.</figDesc></figure>

(A): Depictions of average trajectories when dividing the data into two clusters (each black line corresponds to one trajectory). These appear to correspond to impulse inhibition (left) and dynamic competition (right). The four clusters beneath each of these trajectories (B) correspond to how these two overarching clusters further subdivide into 4 subclusters each. (C): Alternative visualization of the 8 sub clusters in (B) in which we plot the x-coordinate against normalized time (y-axis) from point 1 (beginning of the trial) to point 101 (end of the trial). These plots more clearly demonstrate the temporal separation of the different subclusters.a b Examining the impulse inhibition trials allows us to probe the variable ways in which impulse inhibition can unfold. Inspection of the resulting clusters suggest that three interrelated components of impulse inhibition are (a) the strength of the initial impulse (strong vs. weak), (b) when in the time-course does this impulse occur (immediately versus after a delay), and (c) when in the time-course of the decision do impulses begin to be inhibited (early vs. later). For instance, three of these clusters (top-left red cluster in Figure 6b: 1540 trials, 3.3% of all trials, top-right orange cluster: 2832 trials, 6.1%, and bottom-left green cluster: 1582 trials, 3.4%) display relatively strong impulses, in which the mouse fully reaches the smaller sooner response option before correcting back over to the larger-later. Investigating the time-courses of these trajectories(Figure 6c) reveals that what distinguishes them is when in the decision the impulse occurs (early versus later), and when it is corrected. In contrast, another form of impulse inhibition (bottomright blue, 6355 trials, 13.6%) constitutes a much weaker impulse, with the mouse heading</figDesc></figure>

For instance, one possibility is that impulse inhibition may be particularly helpful for variable or unpredictable environments, where one cannot easily avoid temptation or reinforce negative construals of it. Future work should investigate when each strategy is most effective. Additionally, the present research exclusively used intertemporal choices. Although such choices have long played a foundational role in selfcontrol research, it is possible that more evocative choices might produce more impulses.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
