			<abstract>
				<p>When breaking bad news (BBN) in pediatric oncology, effective triadic communication among healthcare professionals (HCPs), pediatric patients, and their families is essential. The quality of BBN influences the entire cancer care trajectory, impacting BBN receivers&apos; (patients and their families) shared decision-making abilities, treatment adherence, distress reduction, and coping skills. BBN is considered challenging for both transmitters and receivers. Unlike for adult oncology, there is no specific support for pediatric oncology in Germany, such as guidelines, protocols, or comprehensive BBN skill training. In order to provide practice-based evidence guidance for HCPs in pediatric oncology, the research project OKRA (Orientation Compass for Breaking Bad News in Pediatric Oncology) created a comprehensive BBNsupport instrument: the OKRA Compass. This Compass aims to facilitate the navigation of BBN transmitters during the preparatory, transmission, and subsequent follow-up phases of BBN. The initial phase of this study involved formulating high-quality BBN theses (recommendations) through a participatory group Delphi, focusing on multiperspective, practice-based knowledge. Representatives from four groups were constantly engaged: BBN transmitters and receivers, family support organizations, and researchers. Then, based on the theses, a pilot Compass was refined through practical application in five pediatric oncology clinics in Germany. This paper aims to elucidate how the OKRA Compass has engendered novel developments or alterations in the daily BBN routine. Applying the OKRA Compass in daily routines has yielded significant insights across four domains: (1) Considering BBN as a complex process, (2) addressing the multi-layered needs of BBN receivers, (3) encouraging new paths for shared decision-making, and (4) cultivating awareness of the needs of BBN transmitters. Providing a BBN support instrument at no cost is imperative to foster high-quality BBN processes. The OKRA Compass underscores the significance of effective communication by offering a structured, comprehensive, and context-tailored orientation to novice BBN transmitters and serving as a catalyst for experienced BBN transmitters. The OKRA Compass is expected to be widely accepted as it not only fills a gap. Incorporating diverse experts during its development was crucial for ensuring its comprehensive utility across all HCPs in pediatric oncology. Incorporating the OKRA Compass&apos;s theses into daily routines requires organizational openness to change, which must be enforced at the individual, team, and organizational levels. This process demands a readiness to adapt, allocate resources, and invest in enhancing team communication skills.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Irreversible: The challenges of breaking bad news in pediatric oncology</head><p>In her poem Unaufhaltsam (Irreversible), the German lyric poet Hilde Domin posits the theory that any verbal utterance (e.g., that of a physician communicating a cancer diagnosis) invariably strikes at the core of the listener's being, cannot be retracted, and leaves an indelible mark upon the memory of those who receive it (e.g., pediatric patients and their families) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Breaking bad news (BBN) refers to those conversations that may change the patient's future view in a drastic, life-changing way <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. BBN may cover different types of information, including cancer diagnosis, progression, recurrence, therapy failure, and the need to modify treatment goals from curative to palliative <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. During BBN, effective communication among the interdisciplinary team of healthcare professionals (HCPs), the patients, and their families is indispensable for exchanging information bidirectionally, developing or maintaining a trusting relationship and therapeutic alliance between the BBN transmitter and receiver, as well as encouraging shared decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. High-quality BBN processes have been shown to enhance BBN receivers' ability to process the information, adjust to their diagnosis, adhere to treatments, alleviate their distress, and enhance their psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. BBN in pediatric oncology is characterized by a high degree of complexity, necessitating effective communication among HCPs, patients, and their parents. This collaborative effort is often called "trialogue," a term that encapsulates the collaborative and informed discussion between all involved parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">The challenge of transmitting bad news</head><p>BBN requires high sensitivity to the unique dynamics involving the child and their parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Despite the critical role of BBN in the care trajectory, many HCPs are insufficiently prepared for this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. A survey of HCPs in 40 countries revealed that only 35% received formal training in BBN <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. BBN is perceived by transmitters as significantly more stressful in pediatric oncology than in adult oncology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Canadian and Swedish studies in pediatric oncology have indicated that many clinicians perceive BBN as a challenge and often experience a sense of uncomfortableness, vulnerability, or inadequate preparation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. A trialogue is compulsory and is experienced as demanding since it requires specific skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Few studies have comprehensively explored the needs of both BBN transmitters and receivers in pediatric oncology <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Moreover, outpatient HCPs have indicated a dearth of knowledge, experience, and/or skills to facilitate the trialogue in a manner that is both successful and appropriate <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Unsatisfactory BBN experiences have been shown to induce secondary trauma in transmitters, potentially resulting in compassion fatigue, burnout, or communication avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">The challenge of receiving bad news</head><p>Receiving a life-threatening diagnosis may overwhelm both children and their parents. It may lead emotional and physical symptoms to manifest (e.g., anxiety, despair, attention deficits, or memory disorders), provoke a withdrawal into oneself to the point of freezing, rushing to the point of an escape reaction, and disorientation, which is considered a shock state <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. This state impairs BBN receivers' ability to process information and engage in shared decision-making. Reactions in the shock state often leave families struggling to reconcile the diagnosis with their existing worldview, reducing their capacity to understand medical details and participate effectively in critical decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. HCPs can mitigate the effects of shock by building trust, communicating in a receiver-friendly manner, and acting appropriately <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Inadequate guidance, a paucity of time, and insufficient BBN communication skills can potentially adversely affect pediatric patients and their families <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Requirements for expanding the effectiveness of Breaking Bad News in Germany</head><p>Despite its critical importance, German research on BBN in pediatric oncology remains limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Some international studies have addressed requirements from the receivers' perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. In Germany, only one study has explored the experiences and wishes of young cancer patients with BBN in clinical settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Despite the evidence that trialogue communication skills can be acquired, this subject remains insufficiently addressed in both medical curricula and professional training programs for HCPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The established body of evidence-based communication training guidelines and protocols currently available for adult oncology is currently missing for pediatric oncology <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. In order to foster high-quality BBN, four areas require urgent attention: providing practical guidance for HCPs, ensuring quality through clear structures, investing in trialogue communication skills, and empowering families for shared decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Therefore, there is a crucial need to expand the scope of BBN research and develop context-specific support instruments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Developing an orientation compass for BBN in pediatric oncology based on practical evidence</head><p>A pioneering step in this direction was undertaken by the research project OKRA (Orientation Compass for Breaking Bad News in Pediatric Oncology), funded by the German Leukemia and Research Aid (German: Deutsche Leukämie und Forschungshilfe e.V.). OKRA's overarching goal was to develop a comprehensive instrument to support HCPs in the preparation, transmission, and follow-up of BBN in pediatric oncology <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Its participatory development process aligned theoretical frameworks and practice-based evidence with clinical needs, fostering a sense of ownership among HCPs and improving BBN practices in pediatric oncology. The OKRA Compass was developed in two consecutive steps. The initial phase involved formulating highquality BBN theses (recommendations) through a participatory group Delphi, focusing on multiperspective, practice-based knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Representatives from four groups were constantly engaged: BBN transmitters and receivers, family support organizations, and researchers. Then, based on the theses, a pilot Compass was refined through practical application in five pediatric oncology clinics in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The OKRA Compass contains 122 onco-pediatric theses (recommendations), case scenarios describing the "ideal" course of the BBN discussion, illustrative quotes, information boxes, and a glossary ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Its appendices provide several structural aids, including checklists to assist in the preparation and follow-up of BBN, and the OKRA interview pocket-sized communication guide. It can be downloaded at: https://www.kinderkrebsstiftung.de/downloads/okra-kompass/. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Eye-opening stimuli when utilizing the OKRA Compass</head><p>This paper aims to elucidate how the OKRA Compass has engendered novel developments or alterations in the quotidian BBN routine. Utilizing the OKRA Compass in daily routines has yielded several crucial insights, which can be grouped into four domains: (1) Considering BBN as a complex process, (2) addressing the multilayered needs of BBN receivers, (3) encouraging new paths for shared decision-making, and (4) cultivating awareness of the needs of BBN transmitters. The following sections discuss those insights and embed them in practical recommendations ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Considering BBN as a complex process</head><p>The availability of the OKRA Compass has prompted HCPs to recognize that high-quality BBN encompasses more than transmitting factual information. Instead, it is a multifaceted process involving various skills, including the capacity to respond to emotions, manage uncertainty, and make decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. HCPs appreciated that the OKRA Compass divided BBN into three phases: preparation, transmission, and follow-up. Its users observed that better preparation and follow-up led to the BBN being better perceived by both transmitters and receivers. Comprehensive preparation, including developing a strategy to communicate the diagnosis, acquiring information from the receivers, and managing emotions sensitively, were considered essential for high-quality BBN, as previously stated by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Concurrently, HCPs recognized the significance of allocating dedicated time for structured follow-up to address the needs of both BBN receivers and transmitters. HCPs expressed that expanding BBN from a single consultation to an ongoing, multi-step process was an advantage in the pediatric context, enabling them to better address the multifaced needs of the patient's family <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. However, it suggests an openness to having more than one conversation, such as by separating transmitting the diagnosis from treatment planning, willingness to restructure the process, and resource allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. In pediatric oncology, interdisciplinary collaboration is vital for ensuring the delivery of high-quality, personalized care to patients. The OKRA Compass reinforces this notion. Observations have revealed certain advantages to having a physician supported by members of the psychosocial and nursing services during BBN. This collaborative approach has been shown to facilitate the clarification of profession-specific content and to encourage the consideration of diverse perspectives on individual patient or family circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</p><p>It became evident that HCPs experienced an increase in their sense of skills upon becoming cognizant of the diverse communication categories, including both verbal and non-verbal. In addition, they were provided with bespoke communication aids, such as the NURSE Model (Name, Understand, Respond, Support, Empower) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> or Taxi principle, as outlined in the OKRA Compass (Compass, pp. 30). Furthermore, it was asserted that the utilization of structure aids (e.g., checklists) was pivotal in elucidating significant issues, including the need for translators, and in allocating tasks and responsibilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Addressing the multi-layered needs of BBN receivers</head><p>When utilizing the OKRA Compass, it was evident that a more inclusive, personalized care approach to BBN would be beneficial. Therefore, establishing a comprehensive framework encompassing the patient's needs, resources, desires, preferences, and concerns, along with those of their family, seems crucial in fostering a more nuanced understanding of the situation. Recommendations regarding timing with children (Compass, p. 23) and rules for talking with children (Compass, p. 32) were experienced as helpful. Within the context of a cancer diagnosis, this represents a unique opportunity to impart positive and hopeful messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. When BBN, it is important that patients and their families gain a general orientation about the situation. Therefore, to develop a "sense of coherence," the communication must be comprehensible, and the situation should be perceived as manageable <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Methods such as Keep It Short and Simple -KISS (Compass, p.27) or drawing the trajectory were experienced as helpful within the trialogue. The HCPs reported feeling better equipped to make credible assertions, such as "there are options and expertise to deal with the cancer," which may permit patients and their families to allay the fears of those around them and contribute to developing their coping mechanisms. The Kansas Experiment, a landmark study by Erik Wright in 1976, demonstrated the efficacy of positive suggestions and the healing effect of words in medical emergency settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref> . The formulation aids, which were integrated into the Compass (p. 16) and OKRA Pocket Size Communication Guideline (Compass, Annex), prepared the HCP to use clear and receiver-friendly language and the thoughtful use of words. Paying greater attention to welcoming emotions and responding accordingly was considered important. Addressing common emotional responses (e.g., grief, anger, fear, and hope) and incorporating moments of silence were identified as beneficial, as recommended by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Encouraging new paths for shared decision-making</head><p>In the developmental phase of the OKRA Compass, a primary concern was considering pediatric patients within the BBN framework. After thoroughly evaluating the associated benefits and drawbacks, it was determined that this substantial issue should be addressed through a flexible recommendation. We recommend that the initial consultation is envisioned as a concise and exclusive meeting with the patient's parents, with the option for the child's voluntary attendance and possible departure at any time. This approach is based on the rights and needs of pediatric patients regarding inclusion in their healthcare process <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. While Compass users have expressed support for this recommendation, its feasibility in practice remains to be demonstrated. It is more beneficial to involve pediatric patients and their parents in medical decisions than to provide them with selective, ready-made information <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Per legal mandates and consistent with existing research <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, it was observed that families typically expressed a desire to be involved in the decision-making process to discuss their treatment options <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Consequently, exploring the family's position and current state of information, as elucidated by the Taxi principle in the Compass, was perceived as central <ref type="figure">(Compass, pp. 30</ref>).</p><p>Employing open-ended questions, facilitating discussions and dialogues, and encouraging the formulation of propositions according to the specific needs of the receivers (e.g., school needs) were identified as pivotal catalysts for initiating and progressing shared decision-making, as promoted by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Cultivating awareness of the needs of the transmitter</head><p>Many researchers have emphasized the significance of transmitters' critical reflection skills in their posture <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The OKRA Compass has been shown to encourage HCPs to introspect and reflect on their values (e.g., religion, culture, and beliefs) and become more aware of troublesome problem-solving strategies. Pediatric patients and their families prefer BBN transmitters to be authentic, empathic, honest, clear in communicating, courageous, and open to questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. The Compass content enables HCPs to invest courage and clarity in their communication, offering families trustworthy support and fostering hope and confidence. HCPs considered developing a personal mental strategy as helpful not only for delivering the information but also for managing one's emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Conducting BBN as an interdisciplinary team rather than alone was experienced as meaningful. Therefore, it was important to clarify and keep to the roles. Nurses may clarify ambiguous words for patients or their parents, provide emotional support, and specifically address their needs (e.g., pausing) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. HCPs from psychosocial services can help clarify misunderstandings, create pauses, encourage questioning, monitor the emotional situation, reframe complex issues, welcome and manage emotions, moderate discussions, support child-appropriate communication, promote decision-making, and provide emotional support for both BBN transmitters and receivers. Involving an interdisciplinary team was experienced as helpful in ensuring BBN quality. The presence of interdisciplinary team members helps to ensure first-hand professional information and first reactions to the BBN, which could prevent misunderstandings or emotional crises. The HCPs emphasized the need for comprehensive communication training as important to achieving effective communication. Training is imperative to methodically cultivating and enhancing HCPs' communication skills through structured programs, incorporating role models, and providing adequate feedback to the trainees <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Strategies for building communication skills should include cognitive maps, opportunities for active engagement, and reflection <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. HCPs benefit from learning from more experienced colleagues. Collegial coaching using the critical friend approach may also be beneficial as it provides ample opportunities for reflection before, during, and after BBN <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Further, the HCPs stated that a strong, unified, consistent message among all interdisciplinary team members is essential for the care trajectory. The interdisciplinary transmission approach allows for feedback among members about performance, which may prevent secondary trauma. Feedback discussions and debriefings at the end of the process are considered conducive to the targeted development of skills, acquiring knowledge through mutual learning, and enhancing the quality of joint communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The ability to recognize and experience emotions and the capacity to satisfy them is pivotal to achieving success in BBN. The HCPs felt sensitized to the importance of taking a moment to recognize, reflect on, and acknowledge their own feelings. The critical reflection on the BBN experience within the interdisciplinary team, especially with the departmental psychologist, could allow HCPs to question their experience of BBN and competence development <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>Practical recommendations for BBN via an interdisciplinary team were formulated for pediatric oncology based on the four domains of crucial insights <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Implications for the practice</head><p>The significance of BBN quality in pediatric oncology may be marginalized when resources are limited and training opportunities are scarce. Prioritizing, training, and implementing the BBN process in clinical practice can potentially yield significant benefits, including conserving resources and optimizing time management. BBN is a process that requires empathy, effective communication skills, and a unique tailoring to the needs of the patient and their family <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Therefore, an individualized approach appears to be the fundamental axiom for effective communication.</p><p>Providing a BBN support instrument at no cost is imperative to fostering high-quality BBN processes. The OKRA Compass and its pocked-sized guidebook are easily accessible, didactically prepared, and understandable. The Compass underscores the significance of effective communication by offering a structured, comprehensive, and context-tailored orientation for novice BBN transmitters and serving as a catalyst and guiding structure for experienced BBN transmitters. The Compass is expected to be widely accepted as it can help bridge the gap between the well-evaluated needs and demands of both BBN receivers and HCPs and broad knowledge about useful communication strategies. Incorporating diverse experts during its development was crucial for ensuring the Compass's comprehensive utility across all HCPs in pediatric oncology. In its participatory development, the Compass has already successfully been shown to facilitate a broader understanding of shaping BBN among the HCPs. Incorporating the Compass's theses into daily routines requires organizational openness to change, which must be enforced at the individual, team, and organizational levels. This process demands a readiness to adapt, allocate resources, and invest in enhancing team communication skills. These findings should be incorporated into developing and implementing interdisciplinary needs-driven trialogue training for HCPs transmitting BBN. These changes will inevitably yield positive outcomes for both BBN transmitters and receivers through an appreciative and collaborative interaction process. Organizations must allocate time for HCPs to process BBN, thereby fostering a culture of collective care and facilitating opportunities for reflective practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. In the end, it is the word that remains: intended to build confidence and evoke a sense of feasibility.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Cover of the BBN Compass, its pocket-sized BBN-communication guideline, and its outline.</figDesc></figure>

It addresses three different BBN case scenarios -a new diagnosis, a recurrence diagnosis, and a palliative situation -that were developed in a co-creative process with practitioners. Parts of the case scenario accompany each BBN phase. It aimed to apply a storytelling approach, as it is perceived as powerful in effective communication by transmitting emotions and sensitizing the transmitter to the emotions and needs of the receivers. Reading the case scenarios before starting a BBN was experienced as powerful, practical, and effective by both novice and advanced BBN transmitters. In addition, HCPs perceived putting the light on methods like active listening (Compass, p. 15) and the NURSE model (Compass, p. 28) as inspiring. Promoting moments of silence was considered crucial to understanding the message and its consequences and addressing the emotional overload of the BBN receivers. In the Compass (p. 27) and specifically in the OKRA Pocket Size Communication Guideline (Compass, Annex), HCPs are encouraged to include pauses, especially after transmitting the diagnosis. In practice, while this approach was considered important, BBN novices found it challenging and posing uncertainty.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
