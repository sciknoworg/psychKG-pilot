			<abstract>
				<p>Movement tracking is a novel process-tracing method that promises unique access to the temporal dynamics of psychological processes. The method involves high-resolution tracking of a hand or handheld device (e.g., a computer mouse) while it is used to make a choice. In contrast to other process-tracing methods, which mostly focus on information acquisition, movement tracking focuses on the processes of information integration and preference formation. In this article, we present a tutorial to movement tracking of psychological processes with the mousetrap R package. We address all steps of the research process, from design to interpretation, with a particular focus on data processing and analysis and featuring both established and novel approaches. Using a representative working example, we demonstrate how the various steps of movement-tracking analysis can be implemented with mousetrap and provide thorough explanations of their theoretical background and interpretation. Finally, we present a list of recommendations to assist researchers in addressing their own research questions using movement tracking of psychological processes.</p>

The result is a sequence of coordinates representing the movement's spatiotemporal development, a movement trajectory that is assumed to reflect the psychological processes that gave rise to the choice.

There are several excellent reviews summarizing this literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dotan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Faulkenberry et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Freeman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kieslich et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lopez et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Stillerman &amp; Freeman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Stillman et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Tian &amp; Wu, 2019;</ref>.</p><p>In this article, we present a comprehensive tutorial on how movement-tracking methodologies can be used to study psychological processes. We address the entire research pro-cess, from implementing movement tracking to collecting, processing, and analyzing movement trajectories. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various analysis approaches, provide practical recommendations for prospective users, and discuss unresolved theoretical questions in movement tracking.</p><p>Throughout the article, we showcase the analysis of movement trajectories using our mousetrap package, currently the most comprehensive analysis package available for movement tracking 1 . Built on the R programming language (R Core Team, 2020), mousetrap supports all steps of movement-tracking data analysis, including raw data import from a wide array of formats; various algorithms for processing, analyzing, and visualizing movement trajectories; and novel methodology for classifying movement trajectories types . Where available, we also point to other, complementary tools. Reproducible code for all analyses and figures presented in our tutorial can be accessed at https://pascalkieslich.github.io/mousetrapresources/mousetrap_tutorial.html.</p><p>Our article is structured as follows. First, we discuss the promise of movement tracking for psychological research, describe a representative movement-tracking study that serves as our working example throughout this article, and provide an overview of the elements of mousetrap. In the two major sections that follow, we provide a detailed introduction to movement-tracking processing and analysis. Finally, we discuss practical and theoretical issues that researchers should consider when designing and interpreting movement-tracking studies and provide recommendations to guide future movement-tracking research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Promise of Movement Tracking</head><p>Movement tracking promises unique insights into psychological processes. Traditional process-tracing techniques, such as eye tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Russo, 2019)</ref>, Mouselab <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Willemsen &amp; Johnson, 2019)</ref>, and Flashlight <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Schulte-Mecklenbeck &amp; Huber, 2003)</ref>, closely track the processes of information acquisition but only indirectly shed light on the processes of information integration and preference formation (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Schulte-Mecklenbeck et al., 2017;</ref>. Although movement tracking can be employed to track information acquisition, its main purpose is to overcome the limitation of other process techniques by directly revealing the process of preference formation. Movement tracking achieves this in two ways: first, by designing choice tasks such that there are minimal requirements for information acquisition, implying that behavior is governed by the processes of information integration and preference formation; and second, by recruiting a temporal resolution that is considerably higher than in other process-tracing methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Schulte-Mecklenbeck et al., 2017)</ref>. We discuss these two components in the next section, when we introduce our working example.</p><p>As with other process-tracing techniques, the usefulness of movement tracking rests on key assumptions about the mapping of the cognitive process onto the recorded process data, that is, the movement trajectory. The central assumption is that the current state of preference-with regard to the available options-influences aspects of the movement, such as its angle or speed. Support for this assumption comes from neuropsychological studies that have revealed close neuronal links between ongoing cognitive processes and motor output <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cisek &amp; Kalaska, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2001)</ref>, which suggest that the development of preference formation can affect the ongoing motor output as a choice is executed. How exactly the processes of preference formation impact the movement, however, is still an open question. Early applications of movement tracking worked under the assumption of a fully continuous mapping, where a continuous evidence accumulation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bogacz et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Busemeyer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lamberts, 2000)</ref> would directly control either the position or the angle of movement throughout the movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Spivey et al., 2005)</ref>. Recent results, however, point towards a more discrete mapping, where the cognitive process influences movement intermittently during the decision process . We will revisit the issue of assumptions at the end of this tutorial.</p><p>Crucially, the usefulness of movement tracking as a process-tracing method only depends on there being a link between cognitive process and movement, not whether the mapping is continuous or discrete. In either scenario, movement tracking provides valuable information on the development of the preference-formation process, which can be used in at least three ways. First, the trajectory of the movement can shed light on the relative strength of preference for the options, or, in other words, the degree of choice competition. Second, the movement trajectory can be used to identify the time point at which the preference-formation process commits to a particular option, and in some cases the order of commitments, including the detection of changes of mind . Third, by varying features of the individual choice problems, movement trajectories can reveal at what point these features are considered during preference formation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Sullivan et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The potential of movement tracking to reveal the cognitive process has been exploited in various domains of psychology and cognitive science. This research has relied primarily on a particular type of setup involving a forced choice between two options, with the options varying as a function of the research domain and question. These options can be anything, but have often been pairs of words (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dale et al., 2007)</ref>, images (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Sullivan et al., 2015)</ref>, numbers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Faulkenberry et al., 2018)</ref>, or more complex decision problems such as social dilemmas (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kieslich &amp; Hilbig, 2014)</ref>. Movement tracking is, however, not limited to twoalternative, forced-choice settings and has been generalized successfully to settings with more than two options (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Koop &amp; Johnson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Moher &amp; Song, 2014)</ref>, responses in surveys and questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fernández-Fontelo et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Horwitz et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">McKinstry et al., 2008)</ref>, and sensorimotor localization experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Fuchs et al., 2020)</ref>. We now turn to an early mouse-tracking study that serves as the working example throughout this tutorial. It follows the twoalternative, forced-choice paradigm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tracking Semantic Categorization: A Working Example</head><p>As our working example throughout this article, we use a replication of an early mouse-tracking study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dale et al. (2007)</ref>, who sought to use movement tracking to uncover the temporal dynamics of semantic categorization. To achieve this, they designed a task that required participants to select the correct taxonomic class of animals that varied in their typicality for their respective class. For instance, participants would be presented with the word "whale" and then asked to classify it as either "fish" or "mammal," which would constitute an atypical trial, as "whale" is atypical for the correct category "mammal." They hypothesized that the typicality of an animal for its true category should influence the psychological dynamics underlying the choice in ways that could be made visible by tracking the movement executing the choice. This hypothesis was based on the assumption that atypical trials, compared to typical trials, introduce a higher level of response competition that should pull trajectories in atypical trials more strongly to the nonchosen option compared to trajectories in typical trials.</p><p>To test whether the typicality of words influenced the psychological process in the hypothesized way, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dale et al. (2007)</ref> employed a procedure that has become a standard for movement-tracking studies: Participants in front of a computer screen initiated a trial by clicking a start button at the bottom center of the screen. The click triggered the display of the critical piece of information (i.e., the animal word) to select one of two response options (i.e., animal categories) located at the top left and right corners of the screen, respectively. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> illustrates this setup along with three characteristic movement trajectories from our replication study.</p><p>For the purpose of this tutorial, we replicated this study design <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kieslich &amp; Henninger, 2017)</ref> on 60 individuals using the same 19 stimuli used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dale et al. (2007)</ref> (translated into German; additional details regarding the experimental procedure and sample can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kieslich &amp; Henninger, 2017)</ref>. The raw data are available at https://pascalkieslich.github.io/mousetrap-resources/ and are also included in the mousetrap R package. The study was implemented using the OpenSesame experiment builder <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mathôt et al., 2012)</ref> and the mousetrap-os plugin (Kieslich </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The mousetrap Suite</head><p>In this tutorial we showcase all key functions of the mousetrap R package, which is part of the mousetrap movement-tracking suite (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). The suite further includes mousetrap-OS <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kieslich &amp; Henninger, 2017)</ref> and mousetrap-web <ref type="bibr">(Henninger &amp; Kieslich, in press</ref>), two software solutions for implementing movement-tracking studies for the Python-based experiment builder OpenSesame <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mathôt et al., 2012)</ref> and the JavaScript-based online experiment builder lab.js <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Henninger et al., 2021)</ref>, respectively. More information about these companion solutions, including software templates, is available at https://pascalkieslich.github.io/mousetrap-resources/.</p><p>The functions of the mousetrap R package can be grouped into functions for processing and for analyzing movementtracking data. The processing functions cover all steps from the raw data to a ready-for-analysis mousetrap object class: reading in the data from one of many supported data types, including those exported from OpenSesame and Mouse-Tracker <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010</ref>, another software solution to implement movement-tracking studies using the computer mouse); importing into the mousetrap object class; and aligning, resampling, and cleaning trajectory data. Analysis functions then provide access to a number of analytic approaches, ranging from the analysis of simple trajectory summaries (e.g., curvature or initiation time) to advanced approaches focusing on trajectory types and the analysis of temporal dynamics.</p><p>The next two sections present, in turn, the two classes of mousetrap functions for processing and analyzing movement-tracking data, while also delivering necessary the- </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Processing Movement Trajectories</head><p>The first step of working with movement-tracking data is to prepare the data for analysis. Similar to other processtracing techniques, preparing movement-tracking data can involve several steps and decisions that can be critical for the results of an analysis. In this section, we discuss reading in and importing movement-tracking data, adjusting the trajectories' spatial layout, and resampling the trajectory data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importing Movement Data</head><p>Movement tracking records the x,y (and potentially z) coordinates of the hand or a recording device at fixed intervals. As these intervals are typically very short (e.g., 10 ms), movement-tracking datasets are often large, with up to several thousand coordinate pairs (or tuples) per trajectory, for each of potentially hundreds of trajectories per individual. Furthermore, movement trajectories typically vary in length due to differences in decision time, rendering the import and storage more complex than in traditional experiments. For instance, in our working example, there are 19 trajectories for each of 60 participants that are between 72 and 2,159 observations long.</p><p>Trajectory data is usually stored in one of two formats. The wide data format represents trajectories horizontally across the columns of a rectangular matrix or table, leaving empty cells at the end of rows to represent shorter trajectories. The long data format stores trajectories across rows of a narrow matrix, with coordinate pairs and trajectories stacked on top of each other, requiring that an additional identifier column be added to the data. Both formats are used in the analysis of movement-tracking data; however, a wide data representation is often preferred. This is due to the fact that trajectories are typically resampled before analysis, resulting in a common number of data points for each trajectory and rendering the wide format more economical than the long format (see section Resampling Trajectories).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importing Data Using mousetrap</head><p>Processing movement-tracking data with mousetrap first requires that the raw data is read into R using one of many available functions for generic data formats (see, e.g., the rio package, which bundles functions for importing many common file formats) or specialized functions such as mousetrap's read_mt for MouseTracker files or readbulk's read_opensesame for mousetrap-os generated OpenSesame files. The next step is to import the data into the mousetrap object class using one of several functions named mt_import_*, where * is a wildcard that can be either long or wide depending on the format of the raw data. For data that has been collected using mousetrap-os, there is also a dedicated mt_import_mousetrap function.</p><p>The mousetrap object initially consists of a list of two elements. The first element is a data frame called data with one row per trial that contains further information for each tra-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3</head><p>The two core elements of the mousetrap object. The rectangle on the left hand side represents the data element of the mousetrap object, the rectangles on the right-hand side the trajectories element.</p><p>jectory. In our working example, this includes the variables subject_nr, identifying the participant; Condition, coding whether the animal is typical or atypical; correct, coding whether the choice was correct; and mt_id, a unique trial identifier added by mousetrap that is also used for the row names of data. The second element is a three-dimensional array called trajectories containing the trajectory data in a wide format. The array's first dimension distinguishes the N different trajectories, the second dimension distinguishes the up to M points on the trajectories, and the third dimension distinguishes the trajectory features, which initially are time stamps (timestamps), x-positions (xpos), and y-positions (ypos). To enable matching of trajectories between the two elements, the first dimension of trajectories is named according to the mt_id variable in data. See <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> for an illustration.</p><p>The code below shows how trajectory data from different file types can be read in and imported into mousetrap. The first chunk loads the mousetrap library, which is necessary to be able to run all further processing and analyses. The second chunk reads in data from a standard commaseparated file (CSV) and then imports the data using either mt_import_wide or mt_import_long depending on the format of the raw data. Note that if the raw data has a long format, the mt_id_label argument must be specified to provide the names of the variables that uniquely identify each trajectory. The third chunk makes use of readbulk's read_opensesame function to read in multiple mousetrapos CSV files from a folder and then imports them with the dedicated mt_import_mousetrap function.</p><p>Unlike the first three chunks, the fourth chunk shows the creation of the data object used throughout this tutorial. It makes use of the KH2017_raw object included in the mousetrap package, which contains the complete raw data of our working example. Consistent with the analytics choices made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dale et al. (2007)</ref>, the chunk first eliminates trials with incorrect answers using the subset function and then imports the data using mt_import_mousetrap, respecting the fact that the working example data has been collected using the OpenSesame plugin.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0"># 1) Load mousetrap ------ library(mousetrap)</formula><p># 2) CSV raw data ------# Read raw data library(readr) mt_data_raw &lt;-read_csv("raw_data.csv") # Import wide data into mousetrap mt_data &lt;-mt_import_wide(mt_data_raw) # Import long data into mousetrap mt_data &lt;-mt_import_long( mt_data_raw, mt_id_label = "mt_id")</p><p># 3) mousetrap-os raw data ------# Read and combine mousetrap-os files # in folder "raw_data" library(readbulk) mt_data_raw &lt;-read_opensesame("raw_data") # Import data into mousetrap mt_data &lt;-mt_import_mousetrap(mt_data_raw) # 4) Internal package raw data ------# Exclude incorrectly answered trials KH2017_raw &lt;subset(KH2017_raw, correct == 1) # Import data into mousetrap mt_data &lt;-mt_import_mousetrap(KH2017_raw)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transforming Movement Trajectories</head><p>The analysis of movement-tracking data typically requires that trajectories are transformed to render them more comparable to one another. The two most common transformation steps, which we turn to now, are adjusting the trajectories' spatial arrangement and resampling and interpolating trajectories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adjusting the Trajectories' Spatial Arrangement</head><p>Movement-tracking setups invariably produce trajectories that differ in starting position, end position, or both. In many studies, including our working example, trajectories that started in a common area at the bottom center of the screen end in either the upper left or upper right corner, where the response buttons for the two options are located (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>). The location trajectories end in is often not of concern (for an exception, see section Temporal Analyses), given that response options are typically counterbalanced between locations, but having trajectories end in different locations greatly impedes comparability. A frequent first step in processing movement trajectories is therefore to remap trajectories such that all trajectories end (or start) in the same location. In the case of our working example, this means flipping trajectories to the left side (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4A</ref> and B).</p><p>A typical second step is to account for any small variations in start or end positions, which result from participants clicking slightly different locations within the start and response buttons (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dale et al., 2007)</ref>. Aligning is achieved by shifting the trajectories to the average start or end position or to a specific start or end position. Most commonly, trajectories are aligned by setting the start position to [0,0], which has the added benefit that the trajectory coordinates can be interpreted as distances relative to the start position. Trajectories can also be aligned at both start and end positions; however, this implies stretching or compressing the dimensions of the trajectory.</p><p>A third, less common, preprocessing step in spatial arrangement is projecting trajectories into a new coordinate system. The MouseTracker software <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010)</ref>, for example, automatically projects trajectories into a coordinate system with x-values ranging from -1 to 1 and yvalues ranging from 0 to 1.5, with the point [0,0] as the start position. Such transformations can assist the interpretability of trajectories, as well as comparability across studies. However, mapping trajectories to a new coordinate system affects the trajectories' aspect ratio and, with that, the relative importance of the trajectories' dimensions in the results. For instance, making a coordinate system narrower emphasizes the importance of the vertical relative to the horizontal dimension. Moreover, projections usually lose the exact pixel information of the experimental setup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resampling Trajectories</head><p>Due to the fact that movements are typically tracked using (more or less) constant sampling rates, trials with different durations result in trajectories of different lengths. For example, in a setup with a 100 Hz sampling rate, trials lasting 1 s and 2 s will result in 101 and 201 recorded positions, respectively. The differences in the number of points of trajectories presents a problem for many analyses that require trajectories to be comparable in a point-by-point fashion. To address this, trajectories can be resampled using one of several techniques that make trajectories consist of the same number of points. The two most common resampling methods are time normalization and length normalization.</p><p>Time normalization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Spivey et al., 2005)</ref> interpolates trajectories such that they are represented by exactly the same number of temporally equidistant data points (see <ref type="bibr">Figure 4C)</ref>. The number of points is typically chosen to be 101, following early work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Spivey et al. (2005)</ref>, who first introduced this resampling method. This number of points may represent a reasonable trade-off between retaining sufficient detail and enabling efficient processing; however, other numbers of points may be justified depending on the length and complexity of trajectories. Time normalization is recruited in many analyses of movement trajectories, but is especially suited for analyses of the temporal development of trajectories (see section Temporal Evolution of the Trajectory).</p><p>Length normalization interpolates the trajectory into the same number of spatially equidistant data points or, in other words, N-1 equally long movement segments. Compared to time normalization, in which the beginning and end of a trajectory are usually represented with higher resolution due to lower movement velocity, length normalization distributes points such that the spatial resolution is constant throughout the trial. Length normalization thereby emphasizes the shape of the trajectory irrespective of changes of movement speed throughout the trial (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4D</ref>). For this property, length normalization is typically used in association with type-based approaches to movement-tracking analysis , see sections The Bottom-Up Approach to Trajectory Types and The Top-Down Approach to Trajectory Types).</p><p>Finally, there is a third resampling method called neutral resampling, which interpolates the trajectories such that timestamps are equidistant from each other. Neutral resampling can be useful to correct for variability in sampling rates across trials or computers, which, for instance, is often a problem in web-based movement tracking <ref type="bibr">(Henninger &amp; Kieslich, in press</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparing Trajectories Using mousetrap</head><p>The mousetrap package provides functions for each of the spatial and temporal processing operations discussed above: mt_remap_symmetric maps trajectories to a common side, mt_align_start and mt_align_start_end align trajectories at the start and/or end, mt_time_normalize timenormalizes trajectories, and mt_length_normalize lengthnormalizes trajectories. By default, each of these functions works with the standard trajectories element in the mousetrap object, containing the raw trajectories. However, via the use argument, the functions can be instructed to use alternative trajectory representations.</p><p>One point of difference between processing functions is how output of the functions is written into the mousetrap object. The spatial transformation functions, such as mt_remap_symmetric and mt_align_start, over- write the standard trajectories element by default, because such transformations are typically intended to impact all further analyses. The resampling functions (i.e., mt_time_normalize and mt_length_normalize), on the other hand, create new trajectory arrays in the mousetrap object by default. This allows users to later decide which trajectory representation to use in a given analysis. Either default can be overruled using the save_as argument, which allows users to specify how any of the processing functions store their results within the mousetrap object. The code chunks below show how to prepare trajectory data using mousetrap. The first chunk remaps all trajectories to the left-hand side (default) and then aligns the trajectories' start positions at the point [0,0]. The second chunk then adds new, resampled trajectory representations to the mousetrap object, which will be stored as new elements. Specifically, the mt_time_normalize function adds the tn_trajectories element containing time-normalized trajectories, and the mt_length_normalize function adds the ln_trajectories element containing length-normalized trajectories. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Filtering Movement Trajectories</head><p>A key requirement in movement tracking is that the process of interest is appropriately reflected in all movement trajectories used in the analysis. While it is not always clear how to best achieve this, several proposals have been made that at least eliminate the trajectories that likely do not reflect the process of interest. First, studies involving factually correct responses can consider removing trials representing an erroneous response (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Scherbaum et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Spivey et al., 2005)</ref>. The argument for excluding these trajectories is that such trials must have resulted from a different, irrelevant cognitive process. However, this reasoning may only be valid in easy tasks, such as the categorization task in our working example, where erroneous responses (6.7%) likely resulted from lapses of attention or faulty movement execution.</p><p>Second, studies imposing strict requirements for movement times (see section The Role of Study Design), can consider removing trials exceeding these limits. In the case of movement initiation, the argument for exclusion is that par-</p></div>

The 34 trajectories from our working example that deviated more than two standard deviations from the respective closest trajectory prototype are in blue. Axis units are pixels.</p><p>ticipants might have completed most or all of the decision process before the movement was initiated. Indeed, evidence suggests that long initiation times are associated with more straight, ballistic movement towards one of the options, likely reflecting only the outcome of the cognitive process rather than its development <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Grage et al., 2019)</ref>. Studies have used various cutoffs ranging from 300 ms (e.g., Dshemuchadse et al., 2013) to 750 ms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Martens et al., 2012)</ref>. A similar argument has been made for total response time, with studies excluding trials exceeding a total response time limit; previously used cutoffs ranged from 2 s (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Quétard et al., 2015)</ref> to 8 s (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Martens et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, studies can consider removing trials that produce otherwise anomalous trajectories. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Freeman et al. (2008)</ref> removed movements involving "erratic output producing uninterpretable looping cycling leftward and rightward" (p. 677). No precise criteria exist for defining anomalous trajectories, and most studies have relied on human judgment based on intuition and common sense. An alternative route to defining and identifying anomalous trajectories exists in analyzing trajectory similarities, as anomalous trajectories should, by definition, exhibit low similarity to most other trajectories. For example, <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows in blue potentially anomalous trajectories in our working example identified by comparing the trajectory's similarity to a set of trajectory prototypes (see section The Top-Down Approach to Trajectory Types).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyzing Movement Trajectories</head><p>Movement tracking produces rich data that, once processed, is amenable to a large set of analysis approaches. In this section, we discuss three central approaches to movement-tracking analysis. We first discuss trajectory indices that summarize different characteristics of movement trajectories. The trajectory index approach is still the dominant one in psychological research; however, there are advanced approaches that aim to harness more of the rich information contained in movement-trajectory data. Two of these approaches are analyses of the trajectories' development across time and the more novel type-based analysis of the trajectories' spatial distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trajectory Indices</head><p>Trajectory indices are trial-level summaries of primarily three distinct characteristics of movement trajectories: curvature, temporal development, and spatiotemporal complexity. Trajectory indices often serve as the key dependent variables in studies aiming to test the effect of an experimental manipulation. One such example is the original study behind our working example. To show that movements in atypical trials are pulled more strongly to the nonchosen option than in typical trials, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dale et al. (2007)</ref> relied on trajectories indices. In the next sections, we discuss each type of trajectory indices individually before turning to their commonalities and differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curvature Indices</head><p>Curvature indices aim to measure how strongly a trajectory is bent towards a nonchosen option. Curvature is commonly defined in reference to an idealized movement trajectory that directly connects the start and end points of the observed trajectory through a straight line (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Spivey et al., 2005)</ref>. Relative to this line, curvature is quantified as the perpendicular distance of either a single or all points on the trajectory.</p><p>Two single-point measures are maximum absolute deviation (MAD) 2 and maximum deviation above the ideal trajectory MD above . MAD is the more commonly employed measure of the two. It is defined as the signed maximum absolute distance of the observed trajectory from the straight line (in either direction), where the sign indicates whether the distance is toward (positive) or away from (negative) the alternative. MD above , by contrast, only considers deviations in the direction of the nonchosen alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Kieslich &amp; Hilbig, 2014)</ref>. Two integrative measures are the average deviation (AD) and the area under curve (AUC). AD is defined as the arithmetic mean of all signed pointwise deviations between the trajectory and the ideal trajectory <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Koop &amp; Johnson, 2013)</ref>, whereas AUC is typically defined as the area between the observed and idealized trajectories, with areas below the idealized trajectory being subtracted rather than added (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Spivey et al., 2005)</ref> 3 .</p><p>All curvature indices are thought of as a direct measure of response competition, but they vary slightly in how they may capture competition and how easily they are interpreted.</p><p>Single-point measures are often easier to interpret, as the single point of, for instance, maximum deviation clearly indicates how strongly a movement has been pulled to the nonchosen option. Integrative measures are possibly less easy to interpret, as they integrate curvature across many points, of which some (e.g., the start and end of the trajectory) may be less influenced by response competition. On the other hand, they use more data than single-point measures and might therefore be more representative of the movement as a whole. Overall, it is important to note that curvature indices have been proposed with a two-dimensional, two-option scenario in mind, similar to the one in our working example; nevertheless, it should be straightforward to generalize them to more complex scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Complexity Indices</head><p>Complexity indices aim to measure a trajectory's spatiotemporal degree of disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hehman et al., 2015)</ref>. Three complexity indices are commonly recruited in the literature. The most frequently employed index is the number of flips, directional changes 4 along the axis of interest, typically the horizontal axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010)</ref>. Similar to flips, reversals measure the number of times a trajectory crosses the midline between options <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Koop &amp; Johnson, 2013)</ref>. A somewhat different index is sample entropy, which measures the level of spatiotemporal disorder of a dimension of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dale et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hehman et al., 2015)</ref>. Sample entropy, which is often employed in time-series analysis, achieves this by quantifying temporal self-similarity (see <ref type="bibr">Yentes et al., 2013, for details)</ref>.</p><p>Like trajectory curvature, complexity is thought to reflect response competition. The argument is that response competition not only changes the path of the movement but also its complexity. For instance, Freeman and Ambady (2010) posited: "if both response alternatives simultaneously attract participants' mouse trajectories (relative to only one), this additional stress might manifest as less smooth, more complex, and fluctuating trajectories" (p. 230). Consistent with this view, manipulations of conflict tend to also produce differences in complexity indices, with higher conflict being associated with higher complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dale et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Koop &amp; Johnson, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">McKinstry et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Temporal Indices</head><p>Temporal indices aim to measure the temporal development of the movement. There are two sets of temporal indices. The first set of indices decomposes the overall response time (i.e., the time between the trial onset and the choice) into two components: movement time, defined as the time during which the movement is ongoing, and idle time, defined as the total time during which there is no movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cheng &amp; González-Vallejo, 2018)</ref>. Idle time is sometimes decomposed further into initiation time, defined as the idle time prior to the first onset of movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dale et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Faulkenberry et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010)</ref>, and motor pauses, defined as the remaining idle time after movement initiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Calcagnì et al., 2017)</ref>. The second set of temporal indices summarizes the velocity and acceleration profiles of the movement, such as maximum velocity or maximum acceleration <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Koop &amp; Johnson, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to curvature and complexity indices, the interpretation of temporal indices is less uniform and overall less clear. For instance, initiation time, which has received more attention in the literature, has been interpreted as a signal of response competition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dale et al., 2007)</ref>. However, results concerning the relationship between response competition and initiation time have been mixed. Recent investigations point to study design as a potential moderator of the interpretation of initiation time and possibly other temporal indices. In particular, designs that imposed time limits on movement initiation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Faulkenberry et al., 2015)</ref> have found initiation time to be less sensitive to competition than designs without time limits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Incera &amp; McLennan, 2016)</ref>. For initiation time to capture competition, it might thus be necessary to provide individuals with sufficient opportunity to initiate movement on their own terms. Consequently, the information carried by temporal indices can hinge on the characteristics of the study design <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fischer &amp; Hartmann, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wirth et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Commonalities and Differences Between Trajectory Indices</head><p>Although trajectory indices have almost all been linked to response competition, there are proposals aimed at differentiating the mapping between trajectory index and psychological process. For instance, Freeman and Ambady (2010) suggested that single-point and integrative indices of curvature may capture maximum and overall response competition, respectively. Furthermore, complexity indices may capture aspects of the psychological process over and beyond those captured by curvature indices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Koop and Johnson (2013)</ref>, for instance, distinguished momentary valence (i.e., the current, continuous evaluation of each option) from absolute preference (i.e., the option with the higher valence) and associated changes in momentary valence with flips and changes in absolute preference with reversals. Finally, complexity has been equated with wavering, whereas curvature has been equated with degree of competition or difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cheng &amp; González-Vallejo, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Notwithstanding these claims, empirical results typically suggest a high degree of overlap both within and between trajectory index classes. Using the data of our working example, for instance, we observed correlations among curvature indices between r = .79 (AUC x AD) and r = .99 (MAD x MD above ), among complexity indices between r = .49 (flips x sample entropy) and r = .69 (flips x reversals), and among temporal indices, excluding initiation time, between r = .43 (motor pauses x movement) and r = .92 (response time x motor pauses; see <ref type="figure">Figure 6A</ref>). Moreover, we observed substantial correlations between curvature and complexity (mean r = .50), curvature and temporal indices excluding initiation time (mean r = .26), and complexity and temporal indices excluding initiation time (mean r = .37). These correlations show a high to very high degree of overlap within indices of the same class, as well as substantial correlations between them. Only initiation time deviated from this pattern-likely due to the compensatory relationship with movement time discussed in section Temporal Indices-showing small negative correlations ranging from r = −.11 (initiation time x motor pauses) to r = −.21 (initiation time x sample entropy) with all indices, except overall response time, which includes initiation time.</p><p>The intercorrelations between trajectory indices imply that their true dimensionality is much lower than the number of available indices. This is further supported by a principlecomponent analysis on the trajectory indices in our working example (excluding response time, to avoid a rank-deficient correlation matrix) revealing that 53% of variance can be explained using a single component, and 92% using five components. Moreover, analyzing the indices' sensitivity to the typicality manipulation in our working example (see <ref type="figure">Figure  6B</ref>), we observed that all indices showed considerable sensitivity, with Cohen's d values ranging from .26 (initiation time) to .60 (AD). The fact that all indices are sensitive to response competition can in part be explained by their tremendous overlap. However, the overlap between indices is not perfect, leaving some room for psychological differentiation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyzing Trial-Level Indices Using mousetrap</head><p>The mousetrap package includes several functions to compute, analyze, and visualize trajectory indices. Most of the trajectory indices listed above can be calculated using mousetrap's mt_measures function. By default, it uses the trajectories element; however, as in other functions, different trajectory elements can be specified via the use argument. The computed measures are stored in a new element called measures. Additional measures of velocity and acceleration are calculated when these trajectory characteristics were previously added using mt_derivatives. Finally, sample entropy can be added to measures using a dedicated  Overlap between trajectory indices.

To compare trajectory indices between conditions, studies often first aggregate values within individuals per condition and then carry out comparisons using off-the-shelf statistical tests. However, it is generally preferable to analyse the disaggregated data on the trial level, while accounting for potential heterogeneity between individuals. This approach typically offers greater statistical power and permits flexible inclusion of additional covariates, for instance to account for item effects. Appropriate models are provided by the lme4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref>, afex <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Singmann et al., 2015)</ref>, and brms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bürkner, 2017)</ref> packages.</p><p>The code below illustrates simple analyses based on trajectory indices. The first chunk uses the mt_measures function to compute indices. The next chunk carries out a subjectlevel analysis of the MAD values computed in the previous chunk, using the mt_aggregate_per_subject function to aggregate MAD values, specified via the use_variables argument, per experimental condition and participant, speci-fied via the use2_variables and subject_id arguments, respectively. The aggregated MAD values are then compared between conditions using the standard paired t test.</p><p>To carry out analyses at the trial-level, the final chunk below first uses R's standard merge function to join the information contained in the grouping variable(s) in the data element with the trial-level indices in the measures element of the mousetrap object. Then it employs the lmer function of the lme4 package to run a mixed model predicting MAD. For a tutorial on mixed models, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Demidenko (2013)</ref>. Despite the widespread use of trajectory indices in the literature, their ability to unveil the dynamics of psychological processes is limited. This has to do with the high correlations among indices largely precluding a fine-grained characterization of the movement and the underlying processes. But, possibly more importantly, this is due to the fact that they compress the dynamic pattern within trajectories into a single number, thereby losing valuable information contained in the full movement trajectory.</p><p>There are two main approaches that aim to make use of the full information in trajectory data: the type-based approach and the temporal-dynamics approach. The type-based approach focuses on the spatial characteristics of trajectories, with the goal of uncovering distinct movement types that might correspond to distinct modes of the underlying cognitive process. The temporal-dynamics approach focuses on the temporal characteristics of the trajectory in order to shed light on the development of the psychological process over time. Both approaches promise distinct insights into the psychological process; however, in addition to focusing on different characteristics of the trajectory, they are based on different assumptions. The temporal-dynamics approach generally assumes that trajectories are distributed in a homogeneous fashion, whereas type-based approaches thrive when there is heterogeneity. This distinction implies that either of the two approaches is most useful precisely when the other is not. Consequently, it is important to assess the homogeneity of trajectories before implementing one of the two approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing Trajectory Homogeneity</head><p>The question of trajectory homogeneity has been raised in the literature for its importance for a particular theoretical view on movement tracking. This view conceives movement tracking as a direct and continuous effect of temporally unfolding, gradual response competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Spivey et al., 2005)</ref>. The supposed outcome of this view are trajectories that are all homogeneous in shape and vary only with the respect to the degree of pull to nonchosen options. However, it is not at all clear whether or when this view holds and, thus, whether trajectories will necessarily be distributed in a homogeneous fashion . One alternative scenario to the traditional view on movement tracking is that psychological process and movement trajectories map onto each other in a more discrete and intermittent way. For instance, in one of the first movement-tracking studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Spivey et al. (2005)</ref> considered as a rival hypothesis an intermittent process that would give rise to two distinct types of trajectories: trajectories that, on the basis of a single readout of the psychological process, move directly to the chosen option and trajectories that, based on two readouts, first move all the way to the nonchosen option before reversing course towards the eventually chosen option. The result is a highly heterogeneous distribution of trajectory types.</p><p>Trajectory heterogeneity presents a problem for all analytic approaches involving the aggregation of trajectory points, including the temporal dynamics approach. The reason is that in the presence of trajectory homogeneity, aggregate trajectories (or aggregate trajectory indices) are not representative of the actual distribution of trajectories. Consequently, one should assess the homogeneity of trajectories before choosing the temporal-dynamics approach and use the type-based approach instead whenever trajectories are heterogeneous.</p><p>There are two approaches to assessing trajectory homogeneity. One is based on evaluating the distribution of curvature indices (e.g., MAD or AUC) for signs of bimodality, using, for instance, the bimodality coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Pfister et al., 2013)</ref> or Hartigan's dip statistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hartigan &amp; Hartigan, 1985)</ref>. This approach is based on the assumption that trajectory heterogeneity expresses in extremely different types of trajectories that form two clearly distinct modes in the curvature distribution. However, this assumption may often not be met <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Pfister et al., 2013;</ref>. Recent evidence suggests that when trajectories occur in types, there are typically more than than two types that may be distinguishable in terms of curvature or other trajectory indices <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kieslich et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lepora &amp; Pezzulo, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Tomlinson et al., 2013;</ref>. Consequently, the bimodality approach should be used with caution.</p><p>The second approach, which is arguably simpler and more robust than the bimodality approach, is based on visualizing the spatial distribution of trajectories. An example is presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 7A</ref> using the data of our working example. It shows the trajectories of typical trials in yellow and of atypical trials in blue, with the trajectories' endpoints all mapped to the left side. This simple visualization clearly reveals the different kinds of trajectories present in the data. There appear to be two dominant types of trajectories-those that go straight to the chosen option and those that first visit the nonchosen option-as well as a number of trajectories that fall between these two types.</p><p>The distribution of trajectories in our working example as revealed in <ref type="figure">Figure 7A</ref> illustrates some of the issues that trajectory types present for traditional movement-tracking analysis. First, the assumption of a gradual process mapped continuously to movement trajectory is not met: The trajectories are clearly the type of intermittent processes discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Spivey et al. (2005)</ref>. Second, a hypothetical average trajectory would fall in between the two dominant types and thereby fail to accurately represent the distribution of trajectories. Third, a comparison between aggregate trajectories of the two conditions may wrongly suggest a small spatial shift for the nonchosen option for atypical versus typical trajectories, whereas in fact the exact same trajectories may occur in both conditions, only in different proportions. This point is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 7B</ref>, which shows a smoothed version of the between-condition comparison illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 7A</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 7B</ref> reveals that the conditions differ primarily in the region of the two dominant trajectory types, with the typical condition having higher density in the regions of the straight trajectory type and the atypical condition having higher density in the region of the trajectory type that first moves to the nonchosen option before turning to the chosen option. This highlights that analyses based on aggregating trajectories may strongly misrepresent not only the distribution of trajectories, but also the effect of experimental manipulations, and that in such cases type-based analyses are preferable.</p></div>

Here, two approaches have emerged: a bottom-up approach using cluster analysis and a top-down approach based on matching trajectories to predefined prototypes (see . The two approaches differ in their suitability for different types of analysis: The bottom-up approach is primarily suited for exploratory analyses, such as to identify which types of trajectories exist in a dataset, whereas the top-down approach is suited primarily for confirmatory goals, such as to test whether the distribution of trajectories types differs between conditions.</p><p>The bottom-up approach uses cluster analysis to group trajectories into a predefined number of types in two steps. In the first step, the trajectories are compared to one another to determine their distances (or dissimilarity) using a distance function. A common example of a distance function is the Euclidean distance, which for a pair of movement trajectories determines the distance as d i, j = k (x ik − x jk ) 2 + (y ik − y jk ) 2 , with k being the index of trajectory points. The calculation of distances according to this formula requires that the trajectories each consist of the same number of points, which can be achieved using trajectory resampling. The resampling method typically recruited in type-based approaches is length normalization, as it places equal emphasis on all parts of a trajectory, which helps emphasize differences in trajectory shapes (see section Resampling Trajectories). In the second step, the set of all distances between trajectory pairs, typically represented as a distance matrix, is analyzed using one of many clustering algorithms, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering. Such algorithms group the trajectories into a typically predefined number of clusters by iteratively optimizing a criterion, such as the average distance of trajectories within a group over the average of trajectories distances between groups. Clustering algorithms differ in the criteria that they recruit or permit, implying that different clustering algorithms will produce different solutions. <ref type="figure">Figure 8A</ref> presents a five-cluster solution for our working example that was derived using Euclidean distance and a hierarchical clustering algorithm that optimizes withincluster distance. The figure shows that the clustering algorithm successfully distinguished different kinds of trajectories. The first two clusters (representing 34% and 33% of all trajectories, respectively) consist of trajectories that are almost straight, the third cluster (15%) consists of trajectories that are somewhat curved towards the nonchosen option, the fourth cluster (12%) consists of trajectories that first go straight to the nonchosen option before continuing straight to the chosen option, and the fifth cluster (6%) consists of trajectories that first move towards the chosen and then towards the nonchosen option before eventually reversing course once more to the chosen option. These clusters and trajectories show that the data of our working example likely consist of at least four different types. These types include not only the two dominant types previously revealed in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> (clusters 1-2 and 4), but also two new types (clusters 3 and 5).</p><p>Bottom-up clustering is able to uncover types in trajectory data that are difficult to detect using visualizations alone. The bottom-up clustering approach is thus a powerful tool for data exploration, but less so for confirmatory testing, for two reasons. First, results of the bottom-up approach always depend on a match between assumptions of the clustering algorithm and the data at hand that is rarely perfect. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 8A</ref> by the fact that the bottom-up approach identifies two clusters (1 and 2) that effectively contain the same type of trajectories. This is due to a combination of setting the number of clusters a priori to five and using an objective function that tends to create evenly sized clusters. As a result, the algorithm was unable to group the large number of straight trajectories into a single cluster. Second, the outcome of the bottom-up approach will vary based on the data at hand. This implies that clustering solutions for two datasets may not be comparable, given that the clustering solutions will likely group trajectories in a somewhat different fashion. There are ways to mitigate these issues. For instance, it is possible to try to estimate a suitable number of clusters in advance using k-selection algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Haslbeck &amp; Wulff, 2020)</ref>, which should improve the usefulness of a clustering solution and increase comparability across datasets. However, ultimately it is not possible to identify the right settings a priori, as bottom-up clustering is an unsupervised learning problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hennig, 2015)</ref>. Consequently, confirmatory questions concerning trajectory types should be addressed using the top-down approach.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Top-Down Approach to Trajectory Types</head><p>The top-down approach addresses the limitations of the bottom-up approach by presupposing a set of prototype trajectories. This means that trajectories are no longer grouped based on their similarity to each other. Instead, they are grouped according to their similarity to the prototype trajectories, which is achieved by mapping trajectories to the most similar prototype with respect to a distance function, such as Euclidean distance. There are two reasons that this approach is more suitable for confirmatory analyses. First, by selecting a suitable prototype set, the top-down approach will generate trajectory clusters that are both more homoge-neous and more meaningful, avoiding situations such as that illustrated by clusters 1 and 2 in <ref type="figure">Figure 8A</ref>. Second, since prototypes are defined a priori, trajectory clusters no longer depend on the dataset under investigation, thereby permitting straightforward statistical comparisons of experimental conditions or covariate analyses.</p><p>As analyses based on the top-down approach hinge strongly on the choice of prototype trajectories, how should they be selected? There are at least three avenues. First, when there are clear expectations concerning the kinds of trajectories that either could occur or would matter in a given study, the prototype trajectories should be defined to match the expectations. For instance, in the case of the discrete scenario discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Spivey et al. (2005)</ref>, in which trajectories may either be attracted by the competing option or not, one could specify prototypes that capture these two discrete scenarios. The case of a priori expectations represents the preferred scenario. Second, in the absence of a priori expectations, prototypes can be borrowed from existing sets, such as the one included in the mousetrap R package, which was derived from a large number of published datasets using the bottom-up approach (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wulff et al., 2021)</ref>. The set includes five prototypes: straight, curved, continuous change of mind (cCoM), discrete change of mind (dCoM), and discrete double change of mind (dCoM2) trajectories (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8B)</ref>. The prototype set in mousetrap is a useful prior, but it may not perfectly capture the kinds of trajectories occurring in a given study. Third, prototypes can be generated using the bottom-up approach based on clustering. This approach can lead to prototypes that are more tailored to the study at hand, but it also risks creating unwanted dependencies between the identification of prototypes and downstream statistical analyses. One way to mitigate this risk is to base bottom-up and top-down analyses on separate datasets. <ref type="figure">Figure 8C</ref> illustrates the top-down approach using our working example. Trajectories were mapped to mousetrap's default trajectory prototype set using Euclidean distances. The resulting grouping of trajectories shares many similarities with the one produced by the bottom-up approach, but there are two important differences. First, where the bottomup approach separated straight trajectories into two equally sized clusters, the top-down approach reliably assigned all straight trajectories into a single large cluster (63% of all trajectories). Second, where the bottom-up approach lumped mildly and strongly curved trajectories into a single cluster, the top-down approach was able to separate these kinds of trajectories more clearly (curved and cCoM). Overall, the top-down approach produced a cleaner separation of trajectories into homogeneous clusters. This does not imply that the clustering is strictly better than others, including those produced by the bottom-up approach (or other prototype sets). However, it is likely more useful, as the different clusters likely correspond more directly to the different ways that the underlying cognitive process unfolded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Comparisons of Trajectory Types</head><p>There are two ways to conduct statistical comparisons of trajectory types: treating them as nominal or ordinal. The nominal route is based on a comparison of type frequencies. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> shows the distribution of trajectory types in typical and atypical trials in our working example, illustrating that there are differences in the frequencies of trajectory types between the two conditions. These differences can be tested against chance using a χ 2 test for stochastic independence, which in the case of our working example revealed a signif- icant effect (χ 2 (4) = 57.97, p &lt; .001). An inspection of the residuals (shown in the lower half of <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>), reveals that this difference is primarily driven by differences in proportions of change-of-mind trajectory types. The ordinal route of analyzing trajectory types is based on ordering the trajectories along a dimension of interest. For instance, the mousetrap default prototypes can be ordered according to the level of competition that they might reflect: straight trajectories representing the least amount of competition, followed by curved, cCoM, dCoM, and finally, dCoM2. The ordering can then be used as an outcome in ordinal statistics, such as ordinal linear regression models. A benefit of the ordinal approach is that inferences can be made with reference to meaningful dimensions like competition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyzing Trajectory Types Using mousetrap</head><p>The mousetrap package provides implementations of all type-based trajectory analyses described in the sections The Bottom-Up Approach to Trajectory Types and The Top-Down Approach to Trajectory Types. Bottom-up clustering of a mousetrap object can be performed using the mt_cluster function. The function will look for length-normalized trajectories, but can, in principle, also work with other trajectory transformations, including time-normalized trajectories. If length-normalized trajectories have not yet been computed, they can be added to the mousetrap object using the mt_length_normalize function, which will represent each trajectory using 20 equidistant points (or as many as are specified using the n_points argument). The mt_cluster function extracts a default number of five clusters using agglomerative hierarchical clustering and ward.D linkage <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Murtagh &amp; Legendre, 2014)</ref>. However, key aspects of the clustering procedure, including the number of clusters (n_cluster argument) and the clustering algorithm (method argument), can be adjusted. The result of mt_cluster is stored in a new data frame element within the mousetrap object called clustering. Top-down prototype mapping can be performed using the mt_map function. By default, the function maps trajectories to the mousetrap standard prototype set (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8B</ref>) based on Euclidean distance; however, both the prototype set and the distance function can be customized. The result of mt_map is stored in a new data frame element in the mousetrap object called prototyping.</p><p>The code below demonstrates the application of these approaches to our working example. The first chunk uses mt_length_normalize to length-normalize the trajectories, which provides the basis for the steps that follow. The second chunk uses mt_cluster to extract the default of five clusters using the bottom-up approach. mt_plot is used with use2 = "clustering" and facet_col = "cluster" to produce a visualization of the clustering similar to <ref type="figure">Figure  8A</ref> (but with the clusters spread out over columns instead of rows). The third chunk uses mt_map to perform top-down clustering using mousetrap's standard prototype set and then similarly visualizes the resulting clustering using mt_plot. Building on the third chunk, the fourth chunk produces a table of the prototype mapping for typical and atypical trials and compares the respective frequencies using chisq.test. The final chunk uses the clmm function of the ordinal package <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Christensen, 2019)</ref> to perform the same comparison using ordinal statistics, with mousetrap's prototypes ordered as suggested in the previous section. The temporal dynamics approach to movement-tracking analysis aims to reveal and explain the development of choice commitment or competition by analyzing the temporal development of key trajectory features (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Stillman et al., 2018)</ref>. Variants of this approach differ in their level of sophistication. Here, we focus on two variants, a basic variant recruiting aggregation and a more sophisticated variant recruiting regression modeling. As noted in the section Assessing Trajectory Homogeneity, these analyses implicitly assume a homogeneous distribution of trajectories that is not met by our working example. We will nevertheless rely on our working example to demonstrate the temporal-dynamics approach, as a failure to meet the homogeneity assumption mostly concerns the interpretation of the results, not their applicability.</p><p>The basic approach to temporal dynamics is to analyze aggregate trajectory features, such as position or angle, across time. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> illustrates this approach using our working example. <ref type="figure">Figure 9A</ref> plots the position on the horizontal axis as a function of time steps, which were determined using time normalization and reflect proportions of total trial duration (see section Resampling Trajectories). The foreground shows aggregate trajectories for the typical (yellow) and atypical (blue) trials; the background shows the individual trajectories. The plot reveals three key insights. First, on average, trajectories turn to the chosen option (located at an x position of −625 pixels) shortly after the temporal midpoints of the trials, suggesting that there is a notable period of indecision at the beginning of trials. Second, the aggregate trajectory of atypical trials turns to the chosen option substantially later than the aggregate trajectory of typical trials does, suggesting a longer period of indecision and delayed commitment to the chosen option. This is confirmed by mixed models that show significant differences between time steps 51 and 95 (see line asterisks at the top of <ref type="figure">Figure 9A)</ref>. Third, the individual trajectories show considerably more variation in both timing and location. The aggregate trajectories should not be viewed as a representation of the unfolding cognitive processes. This does not subtract from the fact that there are reliable differences in position across time, but it implies that these differences must be interpreted carefully. In light of the analyses in the section The Top-Down Approach to Trajectory Types, the best interpretation of the results is one that accounts for the different types of trajectories with different temporal profiles. We will return to this issue in the section Theoretical and Practical Considerations.</p><p>Aggregate analyses of temporal dynamics are amenable to any trajectory feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Koop &amp; Johnson, 2011)</ref>. Next to position, one popular alternative feature is movement angle, which is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 9B</ref>. Here, movement angle is determined relative to the vertical axis. A angle of 0 therefore implies a movement straight upwards and π (−π) implies a movement directed 90°to the left (right), the side of the chosen (nonchosen) option. Compared to the analysis of position, the analysis of angle provides a more detailed picture, showing that atypical and typical trials deviate at two points. First, shortly after the temporal midpoint, typical trajectories show an earlier increase in angle, implying a movement towards the chosen option. Second, before the end of the trial, atypical trajectories have more positive angles than typical trajectories, suggesting that they still move towards the chosen option, while typical trajectories are arriving or have already arrived at the response box of the chosen option. Despite the presence of two differences in angles rather than one in positions, both analyses suggest that there is a later choice commitment in atypical than in typical trials. However, the same caveats about trajectory homogeneity and aggregate trajectories apply.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling the Temporal Dynamics of Trajectories</head><p>A more sophisticated approach to temporal dynamics relies on statistical models to evaluate the moderating role of one or more independent variables or covariates of the temporal dynamics of trajectories. The standard way of doing this is to apply general linear models in a step-by-step fashion, such that each time step is analyzed separately <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dale &amp; Duran, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Scherbaum et al., 2010)</ref>. With a single categorical predictor, this approach is equivalent to the basic approach comparing aggregate values per condition, which is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. This analysis revealed a later commitment to the chosen option in atypical trials relative to typical ones. Identifying the amount of time in which trajectories are shifted by a single categorical factor can itself be powerful, but the real value of temporal analyses emerges once multiple predictors are included in the model. For instance, in the analysis of our working example, we could have considered word frequency as another driver of the categorization process in addition to typicality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brysbaert et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Forster, 2004)</ref>. Including both typicality and word frequency in a joint model produces two sets of regression weights that can be used to infer the relative strength and order in which the two predictors covary with the movement 6 . Studies have used this approach, for example, to show that the tastiness of food is processed earlier than its healthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Sullivan et al., 2015)</ref>, or that values are processed earlier than delays in an intertemporal choice task <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dshemuchadse et al., 2013)</ref>. These inferences were based on studying the two sets of beta weights across time and comparing their relative magnitude and temporal location. In line with most other work, these two cases used movement angle as the dependent variable. However, these types of temporal analyses can also be carried out using movement position or other features of the trajectory.</p><p>When using the step-by-step regression approach it is important to be aware of several underlying assumptions. First, as discussed in the section Assessing Trajectory Homogeneity, temporal analyses assume spatial trajectory homogeneity. This assumption is necessary to interpret aggregate trajectory features (e.g., angle or position) as representative of the trajectories from which they are calculated, and may also be required by the statistical tests recruited. This assumption is not met by our working example, as demonstrated in the section The Bottom-Up Approach to Trajectory Types, implying that the temporal analyses should be interpreted with caution. Second, modeling the time steps separately assumes independence between time steps, which is unlikely to be the case for movement trajectories, thus introducing challenges for statistical inference in the face of multiple testing. It has been suggested that this issue can be addressed by considering only a certain minimum number of consecutive significant results (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dale et al., 2007)</ref>. However, ultimately, the only appropriate approach to dealing with multiple testing is a joint statistical model 7 . Third, temporal analyses assume that the predictors are uncorrelated with absolute trial duration. This assumption arises from the use of time normalization, where trajectories of different durations are resampled to the same number of points. As a result, points at the same</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 9</head><p>Temporal dynamics across time steps. Panels A and B show the effect of typicality on the trajectories' x-axis positions (A) and angles relative to the vertical axis (B) across 101 time steps. Aggregate trajectories of typical (yellow) and atypical (blue) trials in the foreground are the arithmetic mean of the respective individual trajectories shown in the background. The line of asterisks at the top of each panel indicates regions where the average lines differ significantly from each other according to separate linear mixed models per time step and α = .05. See text for details on statistical analyses. relative time may be at very different positions in absolute time. This can be problematic when the goal is to derive conclusions with respect to absolute time. Consider, for instance, the difference between the aggregate trajectories of typical and atypical trials ( <ref type="figure">Figure 9A</ref>). To be able to interpret this difference as an early commitment for typical as compared to atypical trials in absolute time, typical and atypical trials must be roughly equal in their average response time. When they are not, it is at least conceivable that the true order of commitments is reversed. This would be the case when typical trials take considerably longer than atypical trials in absolute time.</p><p>There are ways for researchers to evaluate these assumptions. The assumption of spatial homogeneity can be evaluated using the approaches outlined in the section Assessing Trajectory Homogeneity. The assumption of stochastic independence can be tested using conventional tests of statistical dependence. Finally, the assumption of temporal consistency can be evaluated in two ways. First, researchers can inspect the distribution of absolute response times as a function of the predictor variables. When relationships exist, it is important to assess whether they are in conflict with the results obtained in the temporal analysis. To demonstrate this, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  10A</ref> shows the distribution of response times in our working example as a function of typicality. There is a clear relation-ship between response time and typicality, with typical trials (median RT = 1, 519.5 ms) being, on average, much faster than atypical ones (median RT = 2, 032.5 ms). However, a difference in this direction, if anything, emphasizes the claim of earlier commitment in typical trials as compared to atypical trials. The second option is to rerun the temporal analysis for different strata of the response time distribution in which response times are comparable, to assess robustness. This is shown in the middle panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10</ref> for trials with response times between 0 and 1,500 ms ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10B</ref>; 39% of trials), between 1,501 and 2,500 ms ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10C; 44%)</ref>, and between 2,501 and 5,000 ms ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10D; 13%)</ref>. The panels show an earlier commitment to typical as compared to atypical trials in all three strata, suggesting once more that the qualitative results of the analysis should hold in absolute time. Notably, however, the magnitude and timing of effects seem to vary somewhat across the strata. For small response times, the effect is smallest and seems to emerge at about 500 ms; for medium response times, the effect is considerably larger and seems to emerge at about twice the absolute time (about 1,000 ms); and for large response times the effects seem largest, emerging again at about 1,000 ms. These patterns can be traced back to the trajectory types uncovered in the section The Bottom-Up Approach to Trajectory Types. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10E</ref> illustrates the distribution of response times as a function of trajectory types, which shows that small absolute response time trajectories are overwhelmingly straight and curved, whereas the cCoM, dCoM, and dCoM2 types only enter with larger response times, once again illustrating the importance of change-of-mind trajectory types.</p></div>

The mt_angles function calculates angles between two-point segments and the vertical axis, as well as angles at the center of three-point segments. The mt_derivatives function calculates distances, velocities, and acceleration values. Features are by default calculated for and added to the standard trajectory element. However, via the use argument they can also be calculated for and added to other trajectory elements available in the mousetrap object. To aggregate trajectory features across time, the mt_aggregate function can be used. To visualize trajectory features across time, mt_plot and mt_plot_aggregate can be used to plot the temporal development for individual and aggregated trials per condition respectively.</p><p>The code below shows how to compute and visualize trajectory features across time.

Support for this position comes from research on motor control in basic reaching tasks. According to the predominant view in this field, reaching consists of multiple submovements, usually involving at least two stages: an initial preplanned, fast, ballistic movement that gets the limb into the target area and a smaller and slower corrective movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Battaglia-Mayer et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Elliott et al., 2010)</ref>. Similar proposals have been made in research on human-computer interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Martin et al., 2021)</ref>. If basic reaching movements are controlled intermittently, then this might also hold for reaching movements that are the product of higher-order cognitive processes.</p><p>Recent movement-tracking studies have reported evidence clearly favoring the intermittent view for at least a subset of trajectories <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Freeman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Friedman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kieslich et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Tomlinson et al., 2013;</ref>. These studies have observed trajectories involving abrupt directional changes similar to those embodied by the discrete change-of-mind trajectories (dCoM and dCoM2) revealed in the clustering analyses in the section The Bottom-Up Approach to Trajectory Types. It seems probable that, at the very least, these trajectories are the product of large, separate submovements. This possibility is underpinned by an analysis of velocity and acceleration displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 11 9</ref> . The figure shows that there are distinct dips in the velocity and acceleration profiles for the discrete and nondiscrete trajec-tory types, with the exception of straight trajectories. These dips reflect pauses in the movement, possibly as a result of the cognitive process controlling and re-orienting the movement at the these points. This suggests that all trajectories, not only discrete trajectories, have been produced by a small number of intermittently controlled submovements.</p><p>An intermittent link between the cognitive process and movement would have important implications for the interpretation of movement trajectories. Consider, for instance, the dCoM trajectory type. Under the traditional, continuouslink view, this trajectory type suggests a discrete decision process that first strongly prefers the alternative option until it almost reaches the threshold for a decision, before reversing completely to a strong preference for the eventually chosen option. Under an intermittent-link view, the decisions process could still evolve gradually, with distinct points in the decision process triggering ballistic submovements. However, it is not known which points of the process triggered the submovements, only that there must have been preference states consistent with their direction.</p><p>It is also possible that the cognitive process itself is, at some level, discrete in nature, or at least can be described as such. Many models of cognition assume an inherently discrete process incorporating, for instance, serial memory search (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Raaijmakers &amp; Shiffrin, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Wulff et al., 2020)</ref>, serial information acquisition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Krajbich et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pachur et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Wulff et al., 2018)</ref>, or lexicographic decision rules (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hertwig et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Johnson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Şimşek, 2020)</ref>. Such discrete processes would produce discrete movements, even if the link between process and movement were a continuous one.</p><p>We hope that future research will clarify the nature of cognitive processes and their link to movement trajectories. One possibility to consider in this enterprise is that the process and the link between process and movement vary as a function of the study subject and design. Research on movement tracking has identified several dimensions of study design that critically impact the types trajectories produced. We review these results next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of Study Design</head><p>Designing movement-tracking studies involves several key choices, including selecting and setting up a recording device and selecting the starting procedure, layout, and response mode used in trials of the study. Past work has shown that these choices play a critical role in shaping the movement trajectories recorded <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Blinch et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burk et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Grage et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kieslich et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Scherbaum &amp; Kieslich, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Schoemann et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schoemann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wirth et al., 2020)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> gives an overview of movement-tracking design aspects and empirical findings. These findings mainly concern the magnitude of the experimental effects, such as the effect of typicality on trajectory curvature in our working example, and the homogeneity of movement trajectories which show notable, albeit sometimes inconsistent dependencies with design aspects. These dependencies are important as they can determine the magnitude of experimental effects, the suitability of analysis pathways, and potentially even the cognitive process. However, we should note that across the existing investigations the choice of design aspects has hardly impacted the presence or absence of effects of interest, pointing to the robustness of the movement tracking methodology.</p><p>The reported results of design factor investigations suggest, among other findings, that larger rather than smaller distances between start and response options and a click rather than a hover response mode produce larger experimental effects. The use of robotic handles and camera-based tracking devices rather than other tracking devices, dynamic rather than static starting procedures, and touch rather than click response modes tend to produce larger trajectory homogeneity. Some of these effects are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 12</ref> using the data of <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kieslich et al. (2020)</ref>. One emergent pattern of these findings is that the magnitude of experimental effects and trajectory homogeneity tend to be inversely related, with large effects being associated with lower homogeneity and small effects with higher homogeneity. This has, for instance, been shown for click versus hover response modes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Grage et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kieslich et al., 2020)</ref>, mouse as compared to touchscreen as recording device <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Wirth et al., 2020)</ref>, and for instructing participants to initialize their movements within a specific time limit as compared to no specific instructions about movement initialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kieslich et al., 2020)</ref>. However, this relationship has not been shown for all design aspects. For example, different settings of device sensitivity only affected homogeneity but not the magnitude of experimental effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Grage et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kieslich et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The strong role of study design could have important implications for designing and interpreting movementtrajectory studies. The strong effect on homogeneity suggests that design choices could affect the link between cognitive process and movement trajectory, with designs associated with homogeneous trajectories possibly triggering a more continuous link and designs associated with heterogeneous trajectories possibly triggering a more intermittent link. The negative association of the magnitude of experimental effects and trajectory homogeneity further suggests that settings in line with a continuous-link view do not necessarily result in better signals of the underlying process. More than anything else, this suggests that the usefulness of movement tracking is not dependent on subscribing to the traditional perspective of a continuous link between cognitive process and movement. However, it is important to note that the understanding of the role of study design aspects is still limited and more research is needed to investigate the many combinations of study design choices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and Recommendations</head><p>Movement tracking is a relatively young methodology, with both practical and theoretical questions yet to be settled. Even so, the literature has made considerable progress in establishing movement tracking as a useful tool for studying cognitive processes. In this final section, we summarize several key takeaways and derive concrete recommendations to help researchers make the best possible use of movement tracking as a means to studying psychological processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implementation</head><p>Study setup. The experimental setup of movementtracking studies impacts the magnitude of experimental effects and trajectory homogeneity, which have been found to be inversely related for many design aspects. Larger experimental effects but also fewer homogeneous trajectories are associated with click rather than hover response modes and instructing participants to initialize their movements within a specific time window. The setup of a movement-tracking study should ultimately be chosen with the theoretical background and the planned analyses in mind. Higher temporal Standard computer mouse (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Spivey et al., 2005)</ref> Larger experimental effects for trajectory curvature, as well as a higher degree of responsiveness (i.e., faster redirection of movements in response to changes in target location), for camera-based as compared to mouse and touchscreen tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Moher &amp; Song, 2019)</ref>.

Conversely, larger effects and likely richer behavioral outcomes, including one or multiple changes of mind, might be achieved by designs associated with heterogeneous trajectories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Processing</head><p>Filtering. Movement tracking produces data that can benefit from filtering. Theoretically, filtering seeks to remove trajectories that do not reflect the intended cognitive processes (e.g., decision errors or lack of attention). Trajectory filtering should be kept to a minimum and avoided wherever possible; in any case, trajectory cleaning must be explicitly documented.</p><p>Spatial transformations. Mapping trajectories to a single side as well as starting point alignment are common and uncontroversial steps during trajectory processing. Transformations that stretch or compress trajectories or change their original coordinate system should be avoided, unless the aim is to render trajectories comparable across study setups.</p><p>Resampling. Trajectory resampling is a common, but not always necessary or inconsequential, processing step. Resampling choices should be made with the analysis in mind. Time normalization facilitates temporal analyses such as step-by-step trajectory regression. Length normalization is suitable for type-based analyses such as clustering. Wherever possible researchers should test for unexpected effects of resampling by carrying out the analysis using the raw data. mousetrap facilitates this by storing resampled trajectories as new elements, retaining the raw data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Analysis pathway. There are three main analysis pathways, focusing on trajectory indices, on the trajectories' temporal evolution, and on trajectory types. The choice between these should be motivated by the theoretical questions and should match the distribution of trajectories at hand. Analyses of trajectory indices and, in particular, temporal analyses, are based on the assumption of homogeneous trajectories. Type-based analyses are best suited for heterogeneous trajectories. Trajectory homogeneity should always be assessed, ideally using visualizations of individual, unprocessed trajectories.</p><p>Trajectory indices. Trajectory indices characterize trajectories along three main dimensions: curvature, complexity, and time. Curvature indices characterize how strongly a trajectory is bent towards the nonchosen option, and can be distinguished into point-based and integrative variants. Correlations among trajectory indices are usually extremely high (r ∼ .9), implying that the choice of curvature index might be motivated by ease of interpretation, which favors MAD and AD. Complexity indices characterize a trajectory's level of disorder. Flips, reversals, and sample entropy capture the number, locations, and unpredictability of directional changes, respectively. Correlations among com-plexity indices are high (r ∼ .5), yet small enough to capture unique information. Temporal indices characterize the temporal aspects of the trajectory by decomposing the total response time. Initiation time measures the duration until movement initiation, whereas motor pauses and movement time measure the still and active parts after initiation. Motor pauses and movement time are highly similar to response time (r ∼ .78), but may capture unique nuances. Initiation time, however, is largely uncorrelated and could capture unique psychological aspects. All three types of trajectory indices have been theoretically linked to and are sensitive to manipulations of response competition. Complexity indices have additionally been linked to decision wavering, whereas initiation time has been linked to premovement deliberation. Correlations between index types suggest a moderate degree of redundancy.</p><p>Trajectory types. Type-based analyses can be subdivided into bottom-up and top-down approaches and typically recruit length-normalized trajectories. The bottom-up approach uses cluster analysis to extract clusters of trajectories from a dataset. It is a useful exploratory tool for characterizing the kinds and homogeneity of trajectories, and can be used as a precursor for the top-down approach. The topdown approach maps trajectories onto a predefined set of prototypes. Prototypes are best derived from theory, or, if they are derived bottom-up, learned from a separate dataset. The mousetrap prototype set is a useful default, but may not fit every study setup. Type-based analyses should be chosen when trajectories are heterogeneous. They can reveal which kinds of trajectories are most sensitive to experimental manipulations or covariates, and might identify distinct cognitive processes, such as changes of mind. Statistical analyses should be carried out on a nominal or, at most, an ordinal scale level.</p><p>Trajectory evolution. Temporal analyses characterize the evolution of trajectory features, such as position, angle, or velocity, across time steps. Temporal analyses are usually based on time-normalized trajectories, but they can also be carried out using raw trajectory data. Temporal analyses can reveal the timing, order, and possibly the strength at which decision-relevant pieces of information affect the movement. When using time-normalized trajectories, one should exercise caution in making statements on the absolute timing of events. Temporal analyses should be avoided when trajectories are highly heterogeneous.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Movement tracking is a young, but maturing processtracing technology that is finding wide adoption across the psychological sciences for its ability to elucidate the temporal development of preference formation.
