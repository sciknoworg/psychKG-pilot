			<abstract>
				<p>Punishing wrongdoers can confer reputational benefits, and people sometimes punish without careful consideration. But are these observations related? Does reputation drive people to people to &quot;punish without looking&quot;? And if so, is this because unquestioning punishment looks particularly virtuous? To investigate, we assigned &quot;Actors&quot; to decide whether to sign punitive petitions about politicized issues (&quot;punishment&quot;), after first deciding whether to read articles opposing these petitions (&quot;looking&quot;). To manipulate reputation, we matched Actors with copartisan &quot;Evaluators&quot;, varying whether Evaluators observed (i) nothing about Actors&apos; behavior, (ii) whether Actors punished, or (iii) whether Actors punished and whether they looked. Across four studies of Americans (total n = 10,343), Evaluators rated Actors more positively, and financially rewarded them, if they chose to (vs. not to) punish. Correspondingly, making punishment observable to Evaluators (i.e., moving from our first to second condition) drove Actors to punish more overall. Furthermore, because some of these individuals did not look, making punishment observable increased rates of punishment without looking. Yet punishers who eschewed opposing perspectives did not appear particularly virtuous. In fact, Evaluators preferred Actors who punished with (vs. without) looking. Correspondingly, making looking observable (i.e., moving from our second to third condition) drove Actors to look more overall-and to punish without looking at comparable or diminished rates. We thus find that reputation can encourage reflexive punishment-but simply as a byproduct of generally encouraging punishment, and not as a specific reputational strategy. Indeed, rather than fueling unquestioning decisions, spotlighting punishers&apos; decision-making processes may encourage reflection. Significance Statement Has an epidemic of &quot;virtue signaling&quot; left people too trigger-happy with respect to moralistic punishment? On the one hand, we find that placing reputational scrutiny on whether people punish does make people more punitive, and the punishment that it inspires is indeed sometimes unreflective. Yet we also find that placing reputational scrutiny on how people come to punish (and particularly whether they first consider opposing perspectives) does not further increase rates of unreflective punishment. Moreover, when engaging with opposing perspectives is observable, overall rates of engagement increase, reflecting that people accurately expect considering opposing perspectives to look good. In these ways, our results paint a nuanced picture that both affirms and challenges critiques of virtue signaling and &quot;outrage culture&quot;.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Consider the following narrative: after an accusation of wrongdoing, an "outrage mob" appears. Initially, just a few condemn the accused. But before long, more and more people "pile on," hastily meting out punishment with little regard for evidence or opposing perspectives.</p><p>According to some critics of "outrage culture," such events have become troublingly frequent. A growing number of voices have expressed concern that society has become too quick to enact punishment without due consideration, yielding outcomes that can be disproportionate, unfair, and sometimes downright cruel <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</p><p>Even highly-educated professors can, by their own admission, punish without sufficient reflection. In 2022, 38 Harvard faculty members signed an open letter condemning the University for sanctioning John Comaroff, an Anthropology Professor who was accused of sexual harassment. Their letter expressed "dismay" at the sanctions, endorsing Comaroff's narrative <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. After more details emerged, however, 35 of the letter's 38 signatories retracted their signatures, acknowledging that they were "lacking full information about the case". Following the retraction, critics alleged that "the letter's uncritical engagement with limited perspectives, voiced in such decisive and unambiguous terms, was hasty and uninformed" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we ask what drives people to punish without careful consideration, which we term "punishment without looking." There are many ways that somebody might "look" (i.e., gather information to assess the merits of punishment) before deciding whether to punish: one might research basic facts, attempt to verify claims, question relevant sources, or consider additional perspectives-including those that support, or oppose, punishment. We conceptualize "punishment without looking" as the decision to punish without engaging in relevant looking behaviors. In particular, we focus on the form of punishment without looking that the 38 Harvard faculty members were accused of: punishment without consideration of opposing perspectives.</p><p>One might see a trend towards punishment with less consideration of opposing perspectives as negative or positive for society, depending on the context and one's orientation towards the relevant moral issue. When merited, punishment is essential for discouraging wrongdoing and holding perpetrators accountable <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>. Consider how movements like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter have punished transgressions, like sexual assault and racism, that many believe have historically been committed with impunity. From this perspective, it is problematic when people are too hesitant to support justified punitive efforts. Regardless of whether one believes that people should punish more or less reflexively, however, punishment without looking clearly has meaningful social consequences-raising the question of what drives such behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does reputation drive people to punish without looking?</head><p>We consider whether reputation motives <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> encourage punishment without looking. This hypothesis is partially inspired by social commentary suggesting that "virtue signaling" can inspire punishment that is hasty, underserved, or goes too far <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. For example, Sunstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> considers "what happens when a group of people, outraged by a real or imagined transgression, responds in a way that is disproportionate." He suggests that such responding represents a "quick, automatic reaction", fueled by reputation ("people want to appear at least as appalled as others in their social group.") Similarly, Haidt and Rose-Stockwell <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> discuss "what happens when people use moral talk to enhance their prestige in a public forum", arguing that "nuance and truth are casualties in this competition to gain the approval of the audience." Such perspectives raise the question of whether reputation contributes to reflexive punishment. Furthermore, academic research highlights the power of reputation to fuel punishment in general. People frequently engage in moralistic punishment, and may punish by acting individually (e.g., a boss fires an employee) or collectively (e.g., an individual participates in the online shaming of a target, or signs a petition calling for a target to be fired) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Such punishment can be socially rewarded <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and signal trustworthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> by conveying that the punisher is unlikely to themself transgress. Consequently, people punish more when their decisions are observable to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>, and when punishment has greater signaling value <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>.</p><p>Yet while reputation clearly drives punishment in general, and social commentary suggests that virtue signaling may fuel reflexive punishment, the hypothesis that reputation drives people to punish specifically without looking remains untested. We investigate two distinct pathways through which reputation might have this effect.</p><p>First, reputation could drive punishment without looking as a byproduct of driving punishment in general. When reputation motivates people to punish, some individuals may choose not to look (e.g., to save time or effort, or avoid engaging with disliked sources). Thus, by generally encouraging punishment, reputation may give rise to some reflexive punishment.</p><p>Second, reputation could drive punishment without looking as a specific reputational strategy, if people appear especially virtuous when they punish unquestioningly. People who punish without considering opposing perspectives might benefit from appearing particularly committed to the relevant moral cause-especially in politicized domains, where people are increasingly intolerant of other viewpoints <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. Furthermore, theoretical modeling highlights that cooperating "without looking" (i.e., without attending to the costs of cooperation) can be preferentially rewarded <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. Indeed, cooperative decisions that are faster, more intuitive, and less calculating tend to be evaluated more positively <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, and people make less calculating cooperative decisions when others can observe their decision-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. Thus, cooperating without looking can serve as a specific reputational strategy, and punishing without looking might function similarly.</p><p>Yet there are also reasons to doubt this proposal. Punishment-unlike cooperation-is morally bad when undeserved, so punishers who eschew opposing perspectives might incur the reputational cost of seeming less fair-minded. Furthermore, deliberative decisions are often extolled as wiser <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, so punishment without looking might signal reduced competence.</p><p>Across four pre-registered studies of Americans from MTurk and Prolific (total n = 10,343), we show that reputation can drive people to punish without looking. Critically, however, we find that reputation fuels such punishment as a byproduct of incentivizing punishment in general, and not as a specific reputation strategy. While punishers were reputationally rewarded in our studies, punishers earned the best reputations by considering opposing perspectives before punishing. Thus, placing reputational scrutiny on punishment in general increased punishment without looking. But spotlighting potential punishers' decisionmaking processes actually encouraged engagement with other perspectives-and did not influence or even decreased punishment without looking.</p><p>We also consider how the influence of reputation may depend on the reputational audience, and their ideological conviction towards the relevant moral issue. People may frequently face audiences who share their ideological viewpoints (i.e., "homophily") <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>, and in particular hold extreme aligned views (i.e., "acrophily") <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>. Interestingly, in our studies, even ideologically extreme audiences did not preferentially reward punishers who declined (vs. chose) to look. Yet we find that evidence that such audiences may nonetheless preferentially fuel punishment without looking-both by doing do more to encourage punishment in general, and less to encourage consideration of other viewpoints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Paradigm Overview</head><p>To investigate punishment without looking, we designed an incentive-compatible paradigm with meaningful stakes. We invited Actor subjects to sign real punitive petitions about politicized moral issues from the website Change.org ("punishment"), with or without first reading articles expressing perspectives opposing the petitions ("looking"). And we invited Evaluator subjects to respond to Actors' decisions, while allocating financial resources to them.</p><p>We assigned Democrat vs. Republican subjects to engage with distinct petitions, that we expected to resonate with their respective political parties. Democrats read one of two petitions (because the first closed before we finished conducting all studies in this paper), calling for the firing of either (i) University of Central Florida professor Charles Negy, in light of "abhorrent racist comments…on his personal Twitter account," or (ii) Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore, following Moore's statement that the death of George Floyd is on protestors' and looters' hands. These petitions align with the #BlackLivesMatter movement, which is preferentially supported by liberal Americans. Republicans read a petition calling for the removal of "Blue Lives Murder" merchandise from Amazon, which the petition characterized as "hatred merchandise". This petition aligns with the #BlueLivesMatter countermovement, which is preferentially supported by conservative Americans. Because these petitions had the potential to trigger outcomes that were costly to their targets, we conceptualize signing the petitions as acts of (collective) punishment.</p><p>Before Actors decided whether to sign the petitions, they could consider opposing perspectives. We presented Actors with links to two real news articles with headlines suggesting that punishment might be unmerited (e.g., "UCF professor behind tweets deemed racist says he is subject of 'witch hunt'" for the Negy petition; "Despite criticism, LAPD Chief Michel Moore maintains support in political circles" for the Moore petition; "Spring woman says 'Blue Lives Murder' shirts for sale on Amazon are hate speech. Activist disagrees" for the Amazon petition). Actors could read these articles, and also search the Internet for other opposing perspectives.</p><p>We used this paradigm to track whether Actors looked (i.e., considered opposing perspective articles) and punished (i.e., signed their assigned petition), and thus to identify individuals who punished without looking. To incorporate reputation, we used a "Dictator Game": Evaluators received an endowment of 50¢ and decided how much to share with an Actor of their same political affiliation, on the basis of the Actor's study decisions. Of note, stakes of this magnitude in online economic game studies tend to produce comparable results to in-person studies with stakes ten times larger <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>).</p><p>In Studies 1-2, we used this paradigm to ask how Evaluators create reputational incentives for Actors, when rewarding their behavior. In these studies, Evaluators decided how much money to share, if given different information (or no information) about an Actor's behavior (the "strategy method" <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>). They also rated Actors, using 0-100 scales, on overall positivity of impression, fairness, competence, and loyalty to the relevant moral cause. In Studies 3-4, we turned to asking how reputational incentives shape the behavior of Actors. In these studies, we compared Actors' punishment and looking behavior across conditions in which Evaluators could observe (i) nothing about their decisions ("Nothing Observable"), (ii) just whether they punished ("Punishment Observable"), or (iii) whether they punished and whether they looked ("Both Observable"). For all studies, we separately report results among Democrats vs. Republicans, because we presented these groups with different petitions (and opposing perspective articles); importantly, although we expected our materials to broadly trigger a similar psychology among Democrats and Republicans, any differences in the magnitude of effects among these groups may reflect that the stimuli they received were not exactly the same, rather than inherent differences in their psychological or behavioral tendencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>Study 1 investigated Evaluators. In Study 1a, we assigned n = 629 Democrat Evaluators to Actors who had either considered the Negy (n = 308) or Moore (n = 321) petition. Both groups showed equivalent results (see SI Section 2.1), so our analyses collapse across petition. In Study 1b, we assigned n = 600 Republican Evaluators to Actors who had considered the Amazon petition. To introduce the concept of looking to Evaluators, we explained that before deciding whether to sign their petition, Actors could read opposing perspective articles and/or search the Internet for other opposing perspectives. We also showed Evaluators an example article headline (that their Actor was shown), and explained how it constituted an opposing perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Did Evaluators create reputational incentives for punishment in general?</head><p>We first seek to confirm: did Evaluators create reputational incentives for punishment in general, as must be true for even the "byproduct" hypothesis to hold? We thus compare Evaluators' reactions to Actors who did vs. did not punish (described as signing vs. not signing their petition), when given no information about whether the Actor looked ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A)</ref>.</p><p>In Study 1a, Democrats formed more positive overall impressions of Actors who did (vs. did not) punish (b = 24.08 <ref type="bibr">[21.55, 26</ref>.61], t = 18.69, p &lt; .001), shared a larger percentage of their endowment with punishers (b = 15.80 <ref type="bibr">[13.79, 17</ref>.81], t = 15.44, p &lt; .001), and rated punishers as more loyal supporters of #BlackLivesMatter (b = 36.82 <ref type="bibr">[34.59, 39</ref>.05], t = 32.47, p &lt; .001), more fair (b = 19.23 <ref type="bibr">[17.06, 21.41]</ref>, t = 17.38, p &lt; .001), and more competent (b = 17.42 <ref type="bibr">[15.37, 19</ref>.46], t = 16.71, p &lt; .001), n = 629.</p><p>Similarly, Republicans in Study 1b rated punishers more positively overall (b = 22.10 <ref type="bibr">[18.77, 25.42]</ref>, t = 13.05, p &lt; .001), shared more money with punishers (b = 15.32 <ref type="bibr">[12.81,17</ref>.82], t = 12.02, p &lt; .001), and rated punishers as more loyal supporters of #BlueLivesMatter (b = 26.91 <ref type="bibr">[23.49, 30.34]</ref>, t = 15.45, p &lt; .001), more fair (b = 19.86 <ref type="bibr">[17.15, 22</ref>.58], t = 14.37, p &lt; .001), and more competent (b = 18.02 <ref type="bibr">[15.45, 20</ref>.58], t = 13.80, p &lt; .001), n = 600.</p><p>Thus, Evaluators rewarded punishers, creating incentives for Actors to punish in general. We also find that Evaluators who identified as "strong" (vs. "weak") partisans showed relatively stronger preferences for punishers (vs. non-punishers) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>), suggesting that more ideological audiences create especially strong incentives for punishment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Did Evaluators create reputational incentives to punish specifically without looking?</head><p>Next, we ask: did Evaluators create reputational incentives for punishment specifically without looking, as the "specific reputational strategy" hypothesis predicts? We thus compare Evaluators' reactions to Actors who punished, without vs. with looking (described as spending a below vs. above average amount of time considering opposing perspectives) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B)</ref>.</p><p>In Study 1a, Democrats formed less positive impressions of punishers who declined (vs. chose) to look (b = -10.46 <ref type="bibr">[-12.32, -8</ref>.60], t = -11.07, p &lt; .001), and shared less money with them (b = -4.39 <ref type="bibr">[-5.83, -2</ref>.94], t = -5.96, p &lt; .001). They also rated punishers who declined to look as less fair (b = -16.30 <ref type="bibr">[-18.35, -14.25]</ref>, t = -15.61, p &lt; .001) and less competent (b = -11.10 [-12.81, -9.39], t = -12.73, p &lt; .001), but as more loyal (b = 5.55 <ref type="bibr">[3.95, 7.14]</ref>, t = 6.82, p &lt; .001). Similarly, Republicans in Study 1b rated punishers who declined to look less positively (b = -4.55 <ref type="bibr">[-6.30, -2</ref>.79], t = -5.08, p &lt; .001), shared less money with them (b = -1.72 <ref type="bibr">[-3.14, -.29]</ref>, t = -2.36, p = .018) and saw them as less fair (b = -8.62 <ref type="bibr">[-10.38, -6</ref>.86], t = -9.62, p &lt; .001) and less competent (b = -5.20 <ref type="bibr">[-6.87, -3</ref>.52], t = -6.10, p &lt; .001), but also as more loyal (b = 6.90 <ref type="bibr">[4.91, 8</ref>.88], t = 6.83, p &lt; .001).</p><p>Thus, Evaluators did see punishing without looking as an especially strong signal of loyalty. Yet eschewing opposing perspectives also had reputational costs: it made punishers seem less fair and less competent. And the reputational costs outweighed the benefits, such that Evaluators rated punishers who declined to look less positively overall and sent them less money. Indeed, non-preregistered mediation analyses reveal (i) positive indirect effects of declining to look on overall positivity via enhanced ratings of loyalty, and (ii) countervailing (and significantly larger) negative indirect effects via diminished ratings of fairness and competence (see SI Section 2.3).</p><p>Our design also allows for between-subjects analyses of responses to punishers who declined vs. chose to look (because Evaluators encountered these two Actor profiles first, in random order). These analyses were also pre-registered, and produce results that are similar to our within-subject analyses, but, in line with their reduced statistical power, less consistently significant (see SI Section 2.4).</p><p>We also again investigate the role of Evaluator ideology ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). We find that strong (vs. weak) partisans reacted relatively less negatively to punishment without (vs. with) looking. Still, even strong partisans did not prefer punishment without looking. Strong Democrats rated punishers significantly less positively if they declined (vs. chose) to look, but shared comparable amounts of money with both types of punishers; strong Republicans did not significantly differentiate between punishers who declined vs. chose to look on either global evaluation measure.</p><p>Finally, Study 1 reveals that Evaluators reacted positively to looking even when the Actor ultimately declined to punish; see SI Section 2.5 for details.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Strong partisan Evaluators react more positively to punishment, and less negatively to punishment without looking. In the left columns, for both positivity and money shared, we predict evaluations of Actors who did vs. did not punish. We report simple effects of punishment among both weak and strong partisan Evaluators, and the interaction between partisanship and punishment. In the right columns, we predict evaluations of Actors who punished without vs. with looking; we report simple effects of not looking, and the interaction between partisanship and not looking. Of note, a small number of subjects in Study 1 did not complete our measure of strong vs. weak partisanship (due to an error, answering this question was not required for some of the time that Study 1 was active); <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> thus reports results from the n = 621 Democrats (Study 1b) and n = 597 Republicans (Study 1b) who did complete the measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>In Study 1, Evaluators created reputational incentives for punishment in general, highlighting the potential for reputation to drive punishment without looking as a byproduct. However, Evaluators in Study 1 did not preferentially reward punishment without (vs. with) looking, casting doubt on the hypothesis that reputation drives punishment without looking as a specific reputational strategy. In Study 2, which specifically recruited Democrat subjects, we probed the robustness of this conclusion ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>).</p><p>Given that punishment without looking can serve as a strong signal of loyalty, we might expect it to pay greater reputational dividends when one's loyalty is in doubt. In Study 2a, we thus asked: do Evaluators reward punishment without looking when given reason to doubt the Actor's loyalty? To investigate, we assigned n = 1796 Democrat Evaluators (across six conditions) to Actors who had considered the Moore petition. In the "baseline condition", mirroring Study 1, Evaluators learned that their Actor was a Democrat. In the "Other participant" treatment, by contrast, Evaluators merely learned that their Actor was another participantleaving the Actor's values (and thus loyalty towards the petition's cause) completely ambiguous. Finally, in four different treatments, Evaluators learned that their Actor was a Democrat, but also received additional information: they saw a (real) screenshot of their Actor responding to survey question(s). In each of these treatments, we anticipated that the responses in the screenshot would call the Actor's loyalty into question.</p><p>Specifically, in the "Ignored injustice" treatment, the featured Actor described witnessing racial injustice, but doing nothing to respond. In two "Conflict of Interest" treatments, the Actors described reasons that signing the petition-which advocated firing Police Chief Moore-might conflict with their personal self-interest. (In the "Police" version of this treatment, the Actor reported having a police officer uncle; in the "Privacy" version, the Actor noted that signing could make their information public, eliciting spam.) Finally, in the "Previously Independent" treatment, the Actor described a questionable history of partisan commitment (in which they voted in just one of the last four elections, and before becoming a Democrat identified as an Independent and "praised Trump").</p><p>Thus, across five treatments, we attempted to cast doubt on Actor loyalty, either by removing or adding information-and four of our five treatments successfully achieved this aim <ref type="table">(Table 2A</ref>). Yet none of our treatments caused Evaluators to reward punishment without looking as a specific reputation strategy. In all six conditions of Study 2a, Evaluators reacted significantly more negatively to Actors who punished without (vs. with) looking. And none of our five treatments significantly mitigated the reputation costs of not looking, relative to the baseline condition.</p><p>Moreover, three Study 2a treatments ("Ignored injustice" and both "Conflict of Interest" treatments) actually caused Evaluators to share relatively less money with punishers who declined (vs. chose) to look <ref type="table">(Table 2C</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2B</ref>). This result is particularly notable for the two of these treatments for which our loyalty manipulation check was significant (i.e., our two "Conflict of Interest" treatments), and especially for our "Conflict of Interest: Police" treatment, which had a particularly clear negative influence on perceived loyalty. This latter treatment thus highlights that background information about an Actor can simultaneously (i) strongly call their loyalty into question and (ii) decrease the reputation value of punishment without looking.</p><p>Supplementary analyses of Study 2 (see SI Section 3.3) suggest that this finding may reflect that, when given active reason to doubt an Actor's loyalty, Evaluators cease to see punishment without looking as a positive signal of loyalty-perhaps because they become more inclined to interpret not looking as laziness, rather than moral commitment.</p><p>Taking the reverse approach-and establishing a positive track record of Actor loyaltyalso did not cause Evaluators to preferentially reward punishment without looking. In Study 2b (n = 595 Evaluators across two conditions), we compared a baseline condition to a treatment in which we added information to highlight the Actor's loyalty. Specifically, we described the Actor as a Democrat, and provided a screenshot where the Actor described responding to racial injustice. This "Responded to injustice" treatment increased perceived Actor loyalty <ref type="table">(Table 2A</ref>). Yet in both conditions of Study 2b, Evaluators again reacted more negatively to punishment without (vs. with) looking, and our treatment (vs. baseline condition) did not significantly mitigate the reputation costs of not looking (although we do observe a marginally significant effect in this direction for our money shared DV) <ref type="table">(Table 2C</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2B</ref>). Supplementary analyses suggest that highlighting Actor loyalty did make punishment without looking seem less unfair (perhaps because it seemed less hasty or uninformed), but also diminished its value as a signal of loyalty (perhaps because loyalty was already well-established)-such that the overall reputation value of punishment without looking did not significantly change.</p><p>While our Study 2 treatments did not cause Evaluators to reward punishment without looking as a specific reputation strategy, some of them did increase the reputation value of punishment in general <ref type="table">(Table 2B</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2A</ref>). In all seven conditions of Study 2, Evaluators reacted more positively to Actors who did (vs. did not) punish-but this preference for punishment was significantly stronger, relative to the relevant baseline condition, in both the "Other participant" treatment of Study 2a and the "Responded to justice" treatment of Study 2b.</p><p>Together, Study 2 thus reveals that Actors may gain more from punishing in general when their loyalty is in doubt, or is particularly well-established-but they are still unlikely to be preferentially rewarded for punishing without looking. These results cast further doubt on the hypothesis that reputation drives punishment without looking as a specific reputational strategy.</p><p>Finally, we note that the baseline conditions of Studies 2a-b replicated all reported Study 1 effects on fairness, competence, and loyalty-including our mediation analyses, which we preregistered in Study 2. Study 2 also provides further evidence, both within the baseline conditions and overall, for the moderating effects of Evaluator ideology (whereby strong partisans react more positively to punishment in general, and less negatively to punishment without looking). Across all conditions of Study 2, however, even strong partisan Evaluators did not prefer punishment without looking. See SI Sections 3.3-3.5 for more information. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. Evaluators do not prefer punishment without looking, even when given reason to doubt or trust the Actor's loyalty. Shown are evaluations of Actors who did vs. did not punish, and who punished with vs. without looking, across conditions in Study 2. (A) Evaluators in all conditions preferred punishers to non-punishers, and this preference was significantly stronger in the "Other Participant" and "Responded to injustice" treatments. (B) Evaluators in all conditions dispreferred punishers who declined (vs. chose) to look, and no treatments significantly mitigated the reputation costs of not looking.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 3 and 4</head><p>In Studies 1-2, Evaluators rewarded punishment in general, but not punishment specifically without looking. These studies thus highlight the reputational incentives that Evaluators create for Actors. In Studies 3-4, we transition to investigating how such reputational incentives do (and do not) drive Actors to punish without looking. We thus shift our focus from Evaluators to Actors. We measured whether Actors chose to look (defined as clicking a link to at least one opposing perspective article) and punish (defined as signing their petition), allowing us to categorize Actors who punished without looking.</p><p>We consider two distinct reputational contexts, that varied with respect to audience ideology. In Studies 3a (n = 1808 Democrat Actors who considered the Moore petition) and 3b (n = 1796 Republican Actors who considered the Amazon petition), Actors were assigned to a co-partisan Evaluator who identified as "a weak [Democrat/Republican], who only leans towards the party". In Studies 4a (n = 1974 Democrat Actors who considered the Negy petition) and 4b  Of note, our Study 4a data was collected in two batches; however, all key results (i) held significantly within the first batch, and (ii) survive corrections for "peeking" between batches (see SI Section 4.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does making punishment observable drive punishment without looking?</head><p>We begin investigating whether reputation drives Actors to punish without looking as a byproduct of incentivizing punishment in general. We thus ask: does making punishment observable to Evaluators-thereby placing reputational scrutiny on whether Actors punish in general-encourage punishment without looking? To answer, we compare the "Nothing Observable" and "Punishment Observable" conditions, which differed only in whether punishment was observable ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3A)</ref>. Study 3. Before analyzing punishment without looking, we ask whether making punishment observable increased punishment overall. We find that, in Making punishment observable also significantly increased punishment without looking. Among Democrats, rates of punishment without looking were higher in Punishment Observable (16%) than Nothing Observable (10%), b = .06 [.02, .09], t = 3.13, p = .002, n = 1319. Similarly, Republicans were more likely to punish without looking in Punishment Observable (20%) than Nothing Observable (12%), b = .08 [.03, .14], t = 3.14, p = .002, n = 763.</p><p>Thus, in Study 4-which featured more ideological Evaluators-making punishment observable increased punishment overall, and punishment without looking specifically.</p><p>Together, Studies 3-4 suggest that reputation can fuel punishment without looking by incentivizing punishment in general. Furthermore, consistent with our finding from Studies 1-2 that more ideological Evaluators create stronger reputational incentives for punishment, we found stronger evidence for this process in Study 4 than Study 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does making looking observable drive punishment without looking?</head><p>Next, we investigate whether reputation drives punishment without looking as a specific reputational strategy. We thus ask: does additionally making looking observable-thereby placing reputational scrutiny on how Actors come to their punishment decisions-further encourage punishment without looking? To answer, we compare the "Punishment Observable" and "Both Observable" conditions, which differed only in whether looking was observable ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3B</ref> Studies 3-4 thus provide no evidence that reputation can drive punishment without looking as a specific reputational strategy, even when the reputational audience is strongly ideological. In both studies, showcasing looking decisions encouraged Actors to consider opposing perspectives, and diminished or did not influence rates of punishment without looking. Interestingly, however, making looking observable had directionally smaller positive effects on looking, and negative effects on punishment without looking, in Study 4 than in Study 3. This pattern is consistent with our finding from Studies 1-2 that more ideological Evaluators react less negatively to punishment without (vs. with) looking.</p><p>In sum, Studies 3-4 suggest that reputation can drive punishment without looking as a byproduct of driving punishment in general, but not as a specific reputational strategy. Moreover, they suggest that ideological audiences may facilitate punishment without looking by doing more to encourage punishment in general, and less to encourage looking and discourage punishment without looking.</p><p>Finally, we note that we report how making punishment observable influenced looking in SI Section 4.2, and how making looking observable influenced punishment in Section 4.3. These analyses were also pre-registered, but are not reported in the main text because they are less relevant to our key theoretical questions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Across four studies (total n = 10,343), we have shown that reputation fuels punishment without looking-not as a specific reputational strategy, but as a byproduct of encouraging punishment in general. Highlighting the general power of reputation to encourage punishment, Evaluators rewarded punishers, and Actors punished more when punishment was observable. And because some Actors who were reputationally-induced to punish chose not to look, making punishment observable increased not just punishment overall, but also punishment without looking specifically. Thus, reputation drove punishment without looking as a byproduct.</p><p>Yet reputation did not drive punishment without looking as a specific reputational strategy. Evaluators saw punishing without looking as an especially strong signal of loyalty, suggesting that eschewing opposing perspectives can enhance a punisher's perceived commitment to a moral cause. However, declining to look also made punishers appear less fair and competent-perhaps because people see hastily-enacted punishment as potentially unjustified, and associate deliberation with competence. On net, then, Evaluators dispreferred punishers who declined to look. And correspondingly, making looking observable did not encourage Actors to punish without looking, and actually increased looking overall.</p><p>Our results also highlight the robustness of Evaluators' preferences for deliberative punishment. Despite our finding that punishment without looking can be a strong signal of loyalty, casting doubt on an Actor's loyalty did not make Evaluators more likely to reward such punishment. In fact, when Evaluators had active basis to question an Actor's loyalty, they did not interpret punishment without looking as a signal of loyalty in the first place. Furthermore, giving Evaluators reason to trust an Actor's loyalty did not cause them to preferentially reward punishment without looking, either.</p><p>Thus, we find no support for the hypothesis that reputation drives people to punish specifically without looking, in order to appear especially virtuous. Rather, our results suggest that punishers who ignore conflicting viewpoints simply prefer not to look. This preference could reflect that evaluating opposing perspectives takes time and effort, and can require engaging with dissimilar (and potentially disliked) others. Moreover, some people may avoid looking because they are motivated to see punishment as merited (e.g., for ideological reasons, or because punishing has reputational benefits) and do not wish to have their minds changed. Discriminating between these possibilities is an interesting direction for future research.</p><p>Our findings have implications for how society might encourage more deliberative decision-making. According to the current zeitgeist, the deep human sensitivity to reputation is a problem to be managed, rather than a tool to be leveraged, when it comes to encouraging reflective punishment. Our work, however, challenges this perspective. While we do find that reputation inspires punishment that is sometimes unreflective, we also find that people correctly believe that engaging with opposing perspectives will be perceived positively by others. Thus, by giving people opportunities to broadcast their engagement with other viewpoints, it may actually be possible to leverage reputation to motivate careful deliberation.</p><p>Still, this approach might not be a silver bullet. When reputation inspires "looking", the result may sometimes be more performative than truly reflective. Our specific methodology suggests that reputation can genuinely increase intentions to consider opposing perspectives: when looking was observable, Actors clicked more links to opposing perspective articles, despite not knowing that their link-clicking was tracked. Yet we do not know how frequently or deeply Actors actually read the linked articles. When individuals face reputational incentives both to consider opposing perspectives and to ultimately punish, they may sometimes engage with countervailing perspectives superficially or in motivated ways (that bias them towards punishment)-especially if their incentives to punish are stronger than their incentives to look.</p><p>Our results also highlight the potential importance of audience ideology-both for generally driving punishment, and specifically driving reflexive punishment. We found that more ideological Evaluators reacted more positively to punishment in general, and less negatively to punishment without (vs. with) looking. Moreover, comparing Studies 3 and 4 suggest that, in the presence of more ideological audiences, (i) making punishment observable may do more to encourage punishment overall and punishment without looking, and (ii) making looking observable may do less to encourage looking and discourage punishment without looking. Still, the comparison between Studies 3 and 4 remains merely suggestive: we did not randomly assign Actors to Study 3 vs. 4, and the studies featured different Democrat petitions. Future work should continue exploring the influence of audience ideology on punishment behavior.</p><p>Importantly, even strongly partisan Evaluators did not significantly prefer punishment without (vs. with) looking in our studies. Yet our ideology findings, and our finding that punishment without looking does strongly signal loyalty, suggest a framework for thinking about when punishment without looking might be evaluated most positively. For example, punishment without looking might conceivably be rewarded as a specific reputation strategy by audiences that are extremely ideological, or that prize loyalty over fairness and competence (e.g., extremist groups)-or in situations that encourage even more moderate audiences to value loyalty more strongly.</p><p>Future research should evaluate the generalizability of our results across populations (e.g., representative samples of Americans, or samples from other cultures), moral domains (given that our studies focused on just a few petitions), and social environments (including environments beyond opt-in online participant pools; an investigation of punishment without looking on social media platforms would be of particular interest). It would also be valuable to consider different operationalizations of punishment. For example, punishment without looking might be perceived more negatively in the context of severe punishments (e.g., physical aggression, firing somebody) versus milder punishments (e.g., condemnatory gossip in a private, dyadic conversation). Moreover, while we investigated punitive acts that were collective and indirect (i.e., signing petitions that, with enough support, could trigger outcomes that are costly to targets), it would be interesting to consider the reputation consequences of punishment without looking when punishers act independently and directly (e.g., by personally removing resources from targets-the paradigmatic operationalization of punishment in economic game experiments involving social dilemmas (16)).</p><p>Similarly, there are many ways that somebody might look (i.e., gather relevant information) before deciding whether to punish. Future studies could investigate other looking behaviors, including gathering or verifying facts, or evaluating perspectives that are not countervailing (i.e., seeking confirmatory evidence that punishment is merited). Of note, relative to these other looking behaviors, considering opposing perspectives might appear particularly disloyal. It is perhaps especially striking, then, that looking was still rewarded in our studies. However, the amount of looking might matter too: if an individual considers many opposing perspectives, or demands a huge amount of evidence in favor of punishment, their looking might become a net reputational negative.</p><p>In conclusion, people sometimes punish alleged wrongdoers without first considering opposing perspectives. We find that reputation can fuel such "punishment without looking" by incentivizing punishment in general. Yet we find no evidence that people use unquestioning punishment as a specific reputational strategy, and show that engaging with opposing viewpoints can actually be socially rewarded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>For all studies, full procedures and stimuli are documented in SI Sections 1 and 6, and data, scripts, materials, and pre-registrations are online (https://osf.io/3es2k/?view_only=e272c31aa7304eca841f084d582187fb). All studies were approved by an IRB, and began with subjects providing informed consent. Subjects also completed attention checks (collected prior to random assignment) and comprehension questions about study tasks. Our main text analyses restrict to subjects who passed the attention checks; see SI Sections 2.6 and 4.4 for analyses that additionally restrict to subjects who passed all comprehension questions (and produce very similar results).</p><p>For our Evaluator studies (i.e., Studies 1-2), we recruited a small number of Actors who were not subjects in any of our studies (although they did provide informed consent), but were recruited so that we could describe real Actors to Evaluators, and pay study bonuses. We matched each featured Actor with multiple Evaluators, although Evaluators did not learn this. Likewise, for our Actor studies (i.e., Studies 3-4), we recruited a small number of Evaluators (who provided informed consent) to match with Actors. See SI Section 1.4 for more details about the matching procedures for each study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 1a-b</head><p>In May-June 2021, we recruited a target of n = 600 Evaluators from Prolific for each of Studies 1a (final n = 629 Democrats, 58% female, 39% male, and 3% other genders; average age = 34 years) and 1b (final n = 600 Republicans, 55% female and 45% male; average age = 37 years). In each study, we (i) introduced the Dictator Game, (ii) described the Actor's punishment and looking opportunities, (iii) measured evaluations of Actors, and (iv) presented demographic and other questions (including a binary strength of partisanship measure, used in our moderation analyses).</p><p>In stage (iii), subjects first evaluated Actors who did vs. did not look, before punishing. Next, in corresponding order, subjects evaluated Actors who did vs. did not look, before not punishing. Subjects then evaluated Actors who did vs. did not punish (without looking information). Finally, subjects evaluated an Actor about whom they had no information. For each Actor, subjects (i) decided what to share if matched with the Actor (between 0 and 50¢ in 5-cent increments; we analyze the percentage of 50¢ shared), (ii) rated the Actor on overall positivity, and then (iii) in random order, rated the Actor on loyalty, competence, and fairness.</p><p>For all studies, we adhered closely to our pre-registered analysis plans with some minor deviations. Of particular note, in Study 1 we pre-registered money shared as our primary DV, with analyses of overall positivity ratings as secondary. After conducting Study 1, however, we concluded, based on these variables' distributions, that positivity ratings were a more informative global evaluation measure. Whereas many Evaluators shared none or exactly half of their endowment, and almost no Evaluators shared more than half, positivity ratings were more continuously distributed. We thus pre-registered positivity as our primary DV in Study 2. For both Studies 1-2, we report analyses of both global evaluation DVs, but plot positivity in our main text figures; we reproduce these figures for sharing in the SI. For a complete discussion of all pre-registration deviations, see SI Section 5.</p></div>

Study 2, which was conducted chronologically last, did not include Republicans; we did not believe that enough Republicans on Prolific remained naïve to our paradigm to afford sufficient statistical power. The method for Study 2 closely mirrored Study 1a, except that we gave subjects different background information about the Actor they were matched with (which varied across conditions, as described in the main text).</p></div>

For Study 3b, we recruited a target n = 1800 Republican Actors, first from MTurk and then from Prolific, once it became clear that an insufficient number of Republicans on MTurk remained naïve to our paradigm (final n = 1796, 52% from MTurk and 48% from Prolific, 54% female, 45% male, and &lt;1% other genders; average age = 40 years). The flow of Study 3 mirrored Studies 1-2, except that subjects themselves had the chance to punish and look, and we manipulated what they were told that the Evaluator would learn about their behavior.</p><p>To measure looking, we presented a "looking screen" with headlines and links for two opposing perspective articles, and an invitation to search the Internet for other opposing perspectives. We tracked subjects' link-clicking behavior and define "looking" as clicking at least one link to an opposing perspective article. Subjects in Both Observable were told that the Evaluator would learn how long they spent on the looking screen, but not that we would track their link-clicking behavior. See SI Section 4.5 for pre-registered secondary analyses that define looking as either (i) time spent on the looking screen or (ii) the continuous number of links clicked (and produce very similar results).</p><p>To measure punishment, we presented a link to the petition, and tracked whether subjects clicked it (again, without informing subjects of this tracking). We also asked subjects whether they signed the petition. To discourage false reporting, we asked subjects, if they signed, to report information about the screen they saw after signing. We define "punishing" as clicking the link to the petition and self-reporting signing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 4a-b</head><p>In October-November 2020, we conducted Studies 4a-b. For each study, we preregistered initial targets of n = 1200 Actors from MTurk (less than we targeted in Studies 3a-b because, in Study 3 but not Study 4, we hypothesized that making looking observable might decrease punishment without looking-but expected this effect to be small, and thus require a larger sample to detect).</p><p>For Study 4a (which recruited Democrats), upon reaching our initial target of n = 1200, our key results were all significant. However, while finishing data collection for Study 4b (which recruited Republicans, and took longer to complete), we decided to direct Democrats to Study 4a, increasing its sample size. We thus amended our Study 4a preregistration, increasing our target to n = 2000 subjects, and registering a plan to correct, in our analyses, for "peeking" at the first batch of data before collecting the second batch. All significant results survive these corrections (see SI Section 4.1). Our final sample sizes were n = 1974 for Study 4a (54% female, 45% male, and 1% other genders; average age = 40 years) and n = 1145 for Study 3b (56% female, 44% male, and &lt;1% other genders; average age = 43 years).</p><p>The Study 4 method was otherwise identical to the Study 3 method, except that (i) subjects were matched with more ideological Evaluators and (ii) Study 4a featured the Negy petition (whereas Study 3a featured the Moore petition).   <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>   </p></div>

In Section 6 of this SI, we show the complete stimuli from each study; this section thus provides the specific wording we used to explain all study tasks and measure all dependent variables.</p><p>We also note that, per our pre-registrations, for all studies, (i) if we got duplicate responses from the same IP address or participant ID, we included only the chronologically first response in our analyses, and (ii) we excluded responses from subjects who failed at least one of two attention check questions at the beginning of the study, and/or did not complete all required measures before the demographic section at the end of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Studies 1a-b</head><p>As in all studies in this paper, subjects in Studies 1a-b began by reporting their gender and political party, and then completing two attention checks. Next, we introduced subjects to the Dictator Game involving the Actor. We told subjects that they (i.e., the Evaluator) would be "Player 1" and another subject (i.e., the Actor), of their same political affiliation, would be "Player 2". Furthermore, subjects learned that they would receive 50 cents, and decide how much to share with Player 2. Subjects then answered three comprehension questions about the Dictator Game.</p><p>Next, we introduced subjects to the Actor's punishment and looking decisions. We told subjects that Player 2 had the chance to sign the relevant punitive petition, and provided subjects with a brief description, and screenshot, of the petition. Next, we told subjects that before deciding whether to sign, Player 2 could read opposing perspective articles and/or search the Internet for other opposing perspectives. In particular, we told subjects that Player 2 received links to articles providing opposing perspectives, and provided a screenshot of an example headline, alongside a brief explanation of how it constituted an opposing perspective. We also told subjects that Player 2s varied in the time they spent considering opposing perspectives.</p><p>Next, we collected subjects' evaluations of different Actors. First, we asked subjects to consider a Player 2 who did sign the petition, after considering opposing perspectives for an above-or below-average amount of time (manipulated between-subjects). Thus, we described a punisher who did, or did not, look. We told subjects that they might be matched with this Player 2, and then measured the amount of money they wished to share with Player 2 in this event (between 0 and 50 cents in 5-cent increments). Afterwards, subjects rated the Player 2 on overall positivity, and then, in random order, loyalty towards Black Lives Matter or Blue Lives Matter, competence, and fairness (on 0-to-100 scales).</p><p>Next, we told subjects that they would make sharing decisions about other Player 2s they might be matched with. Subjects then evaluated six other Player 2s, with six other behavioral profiles. The second Player 2 was a punisher who did or did not look (whichever the subject did not evaluate first). Next, subjects evaluated non-punishers who did, or did not, look (in an order corresponding to the order in which they evaluated punishers). Then, Subjects evaluated nonpunishers and punishers, without receiving information about their looking (in random order). Finally, subjects evaluated a Player 2 without receiving any information about their decisions.</p><p>Afterwards, we presented subjects with a post-experimental survey in which they evaluated the petition, described how they made their decisions, shared their impressions of the study, rated their previous participation in related studies and beliefs about whether the petition and Player 2 were real, and answered demographic and ideology questions. In this survey, subjects answered a binary strength of partisanship measure, used in our moderation analyses (in which they were asked to identify as either "a strong Democrat/Republican, who strongly supports the party" or "a weak Democrat/Republican, who only leans towards the party").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Studies 2a-b</head><p>The method for Study 2 closely mirrored Study 1a, with a few differences. In Study 1, subjects evaluated multiple distinct Player 2s, who they learned that they might be matched with, and who behaved in different ways. In contrast, subjects in Study 2 evaluated just one Player 2, who they learned that they were matched with, in the event that this Player 2 behaved in different ways. This allowed us to, in our Study 2 treatments that added information, provide subjects with specific background information about the Player 2 they were paired with. Furthermore, to encourage subjects to reflect on this background information, we asked subjects across all conditions of Study 2 to write a paragraph about their initial impression of Player 2, before they evaluated different potential Player 2 behaviors.</p><p>In the "baseline" conditions of Studies 2a-b, the method was otherwise identical to the Study 1a method. In the "other person" treatment of Study 2a, when Player 2 was introduced, Player 2 was characterized as "another participant" and no information was provided about Player 2's political affiliation. In all other treatments of Studies 2a-b, Player 2 was initially described as a co-partisan (like in Study 1a and the baseline conditions). Then, after subjects learned about Player 2's punishment and looking opportunities, they were shown a screenshot of some questions that Player 2 was asked, and Player 2's responses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Studies 3-4</head><p>After reporting their gender and political party, and completing two attention checks, subjects in Studies 3-4 learned about the Dictator Game. We told subjects that they (i.e., the Actor) would be Player 2 and another subject (i.e., the Evaluator) of their same political affiliation would be Player 1, receive 50 cents, and decide how much to share with them. We described the Player 1 as "a weak [Democrat/Republican], who only leans towards the party" in Study 3, and "a strong [Democrat/Republican] who strongly supports [Black Lives Matter/Blue Lives Matter]" in Study 4. Subjects then answered three comprehension questions about the Dictator Game (and were required to correct any incorrect answers before preceding).</p><p>Next, we introduced subjects to their punishment and looking decisions. We presented subjects with a brief description, and screenshot, of the relevant petition, explaining that they would later have the chance to sign it. Subjects in Nothing Observable learned that Player 1 would not find out whether they signed; subjects in Punishment Observable and Both Observable learned that Player 1 would find this out.</p><p>Afterwards, subjects learned that they could consider opposing perspectives before deciding whether to sign. We told subjects that we would provide links to opposing perspective articles (and provided a screenshot of an example headline) and that they could also search the Internet for other opposing perspectives. Subjects in Nothing Observable and Punishment Observable learned that Player 1 would not find out how long they spent considering opposing perspectives; subjects in Both Observable learned that Player 1 would find this out. Subjects then answered three comprehension questions about what Player 1 would learn about their behavior (and again were required to correct any incorrect answers).</p><p>We then told subjects they would next get to consider opposing perspectives, and reminded them about whether their time spent doing so would be observable. Then, subjects advanced to a screen in which we provided headlines for and links to two opposing perspective articles, and reminded subjects than they could search for other articles. We told subjects to advance the screen once they were ready to decide whether to sign the petition. On this "looking" screen, we tracked subjects' link-clicking behavior and, per our preregistration, defined "looking" as clicking at least one link to an opposing perspective article. We did not tell subjects that their link-clicking would be tracked.</p><p>We then told subjects that they would next decide whether to sign the petition, and that if they reported signing, we would ask them to show us that they signed by reporting information about the screen that Change.org displayed after they signed. (We also assured subjects that we would not collect their identifying information if they signed). Next, we gave subjects a link to the petition and asked them whether they signed (and prompted them to report information about the completion screen if so). We also asked subjects about their level of commitment to supporting the petition; per our preregistrations, we do not analyze this DV.</p><p>On this "petition" screen, we tracked subjects' link-clicking behavior and, per our preregistration, defined "signing" (i.e., punishing) as clicking the link to the petition and selfreporting signing. We did not tell subjects that their link-clicking would be tracked. We did not incorporate the reported completion screen information into our pre-registered definition of "signing", because (i) pilot testing revealed that almost everyone who met the above criteria did report this information correctly, but (ii) there is some room for ambiguity in categorizing reports as "correct" (given that some responses are close to but not completely accurate).</p><p>Afterwards, we presented subjects with a post-experimental survey in which they evaluated the petition, described how they spent their time on the "looking" screen and made their decisions, rated their previous familiarity with the petition, the extent to which they were motivated by reputation, and their beliefs about whether the petition, articles, and Player 1 were real, and answered demographic and ideology questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Matching Actors and Evaluators</head><p>In Studies 1-2, focal subjects were Evaluators. Each Evaluator was matched with a real Actor. To pay each Evaluator's bonus, we implemented one of their sharing decisions, corresponding to how their Actor actually behaved.</p><p>The Actors that Evaluators in Studies 1-2 were matched with were not themselves subjects in any of our studies (i.e., we do not report analyses of their behavior, although they did provide informed consent to participate). Rather, we recruited a small number of Actors, with the specific aim of matching them with Evaluators (so that we could describe real Actors to Evaluators, and pay study bonuses). We matched each featured Actor with multiple Evaluators, although Evaluators did not learn this.</p><p>When recruiting Actors to match with Evaluators from Study 2, we asked a set of survey questions that we believed might elicit responses that would cast doubt on, or highlight, Actors' loyalty. These Actors provided informed consent for their responses to potentially be shown to other online participants (who they learned might view their responses, evaluate them, and decide how much money to share with them).</p><p>In Study 1, we simply matched Evaluators with co-partisan Actors. And in the "baseline" and "other participant" conditions of Study 2, we likewise matched Evaluators (who were all Democrats) with Democrat Actors (although Evaluators in the "other participant" condition did not learn that their Actor was a Democrat). In the remaining conditions of Study 2, we matched Evaluators with specific Democrat Actors who we chose to feature, on the basis of their responses to the above-described questions (selecting responses that cast doubt on the Actor's loyalty in the relevant conditions of Study 2a, and selecting a response that highlighted the Actor's loyalty in the relevant condition of Study 2b). Each of these conditions featured a different Actor, and we showed Evaluators in these conditions a screenshot of their Actor's survey responses.</p><p>In Studies 3-4, focal subjects were Actors. Each Actor was matched with a real Evaluator. To pay each Actor's bonus, we implemented one of their Evaluator's sharing decisions, corresponding to the Actor's observability condition and how the Actor actually behaved (e.g., if Actor was in the "Punishment Only" condition and chose to punish, we paid the Actor the amount that their Evaluator chose to share with a punisher, given no information about looking).</p><p>Mirroring Studies 1-2, the Evaluators that Actors in Studies 3-4 were matched with were not themselves subjects in any of our studies (although they did provide informed consent to participate). Rather, we recruited a small number of Evaluators specifically to match with Actors (and matched each featured Evaluator with multiple Actors, without Actors knowing this). In Study 3, we matched Actors with co-partisan Evaluators who reported identifying as weak partisans, and in Study 4, we matched Actors with co-partisan Evaluators who reported identifying as strong partisans, and also reported strongly supporting Black/Blue Lives Matter.</p></div>

As reported in the main text, the Negy and Moore petitions produced identical patterns of results; thus, our main text results collapsed over petition. However, per our pre-registration, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table S1</ref> below, we report our key Study 1 analyses separately for each petition, and also report interaction results that compare results across the two petitions. We find that each of our key results hold significantly within each of the two petitions. However, for some results, the effect size differs significantly across petitions, as reflected by a significant interaction.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>, we reproduce main text <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> (which plotted positivity ratings) with our sharing DV.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Mediation analyses</head><p>As described in the main text, Evaluators in Studies 1a-b rated punishers who declined (vs. chose) to consider opposing perspectives less positively overall, and also rated them as less fair and less competent. Interestingly, however, they rated punishers who declined to look as more loyal. This pattern of results suggests that (i) declining to look has reputational costs and advantages, and (ii) the advantages are outweighed by the costs, such that declining to look is a net reputational negative. Here, we support this proposal with mediation analyses.</p><p>Before describing our mediation analyses, we note that two of our mediators, fairness and competence, were highly correlated with each other (among Democrats, r = .86, p &lt; .001; among Republicans, r = .87, p &lt; .001). In contrast, loyalty was less strongly correlated with the other mediators (correlations with fairness: Democrats, r = .63, p &lt; .001; Republicans, r = .51, p &lt; .001; correlations with competence: Democrats, r = .59, p &lt; .001; Republicans, r = .49, p &lt; .001).</p><p>In light of this correlation structure, we consider two distinct multiple mediation models: one that takes fairness and loyalty as mediators, and one that takes competence and loyalty as mediators. This approach avoids placing fairness and competence together in a single model, which would be uninformative in light of their high collinearity. In each model, we take overall positivity as our dependent variable, the contrast between punishers who declined vs. chose to look as our independent variable, and the relevant pair of mediators as our mediating variables. In <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>, for each of Studies 1a-b, we report the total effect of not looking on overall positivity, as well as analyses from each of our two mediation models. In particular, for each mediator within each model, we report (i) the A path (i.e., the effect of not looking on the mediator), (ii) the B path (i.e., the effect of the mediator on overall positivity, controlling for not looking and the other mediator), and (iii) the indirect effect of not looking on overall positivity via the mediator. Additionally, for each model, we report the direct effect of not looking on overall positivity.</p><p>For each of Studies 1a-b, we consistently observe significant negative indirect effects for fairness and competence, and significant positive indirect effects for loyalty. Furthermore, the positive indirect effects of loyalty are consistently significantly smaller in magnitude than the negative indirect effects of fairness and competence (as revealed by the 95% CIs reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table S1</ref>), consistent with the negative total effect of not looking on overall positivity. <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>.

These between-subject analyses were also pre-registered, and produce results that are similar in direction and magnitude to the within-subject analyses we report in our main text. However, in line with the reduced statistical power they afford, they are less consistently significant. Below, we report the between-subject results for each of our dependent variables.

Here, we report analyses of these evaluations.</p><p>Among Democrats (n = 629), we find that Evaluators formed less positive overall impressions of non-punishers who declined (vs. These analyses demonstrate that Evaluators created reputational incentives for Actors to consider opposing perspectives, even if they did not ultimately choose to punish.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.5">Interpretation of analyses</head><p>Together, the above tables reveal that both baseline conditions of Study 2 replicated all reported Study 1 effects on all DVs. As in Study 1, within these conditions, we find that (i) punishers are evaluated more positivity than non-punishers on all DVs, (ii) punishers who decline (vs. choose) to look are evaluated less positively on all DVs except loyalty; for loyalty, punishment without looking is rated more positively, and (iii) non-punishers who decline (vs. choose) to look are evaluated less positively on all DVs.</p><p>Furthermore, the above tables provide insight into why our treatments had their effects. To highlight these insights, in the below sections we interpret the results for our treatments that sought to (i) cast doubt on loyalty by removing information, (ii) cast doubt on loyalty by adding information, and (iii) establish loyalty by adding information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Casting doubt on loyalty by removing information</head><p>As reported in the main text, relative to the baseline condition, casting doubt on Actor loyalty by removing information (as we did in our "Other participant" treatment) successfully decreased "baseline" loyalty ratings (when Evaluators had no information about whether the Actor punished or looked), and increased the reputation value of punishment in general on both of our global evaluation DVs. However, it did not significantly influence the reputation value of punishment without vs. with looking on either global evaluation DV.</p><p>The above tables add further insight into these patterns. They reveal that, for all DVs (i.e., including loyalty, fairness and competence), the "Other participant" treatment significantly (i) decreased baseline ratings, (ii) increased the reputation value of punishment in general, and (iii) did not influence the reputation value of punishment without vs. with looking, or nonpunishment without vs. with looking-with just one exception (the negative effect of "Other participant" on baseline sharing, which was only marginally significant). Thus, describing the Actor simply as "another participant" made Evaluators generally less positive about the Actor at baseline, and more sensitive to the question of whether or not the Actor decided to punish. However, once Evaluators knew whether the Actor punished, a lack of information about the Actor's party affiliation did not influence Evaluators' sensitivity to the Actor's looking decision. This pattern of results suggests that Evaluators may have seen the choice to punish as very informative, such that punishment information served as a substitute for information about partisanship. Under this interpretation, removing information about Actor partisanship did not change Evaluators' relative assessments of punishment without vs. with looking, because Evaluators had punishment information (to compensate for a lack of partisanship information) when making these assessments. Thus, the informativeness of punishment may help to explain why we did not find support for the hypothesis that casting doubt on Actor loyalty by removing information can enhance the reputation value of punishment without looking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Casting doubt on loyalty by adding information</head><p>As reported in the main text, relative to the baseline condition, casting doubt on loyalty by adding information (as we did in "Democrat + Ignored injustice", both "Democrat + Conflict of Interest" treatments, and "Democrat + Previously Independent") was largely successful at reducing baseline loyalty ratings (although "Democrat + Ignored injustice" did not have this effect). However, none of these treatments significantly (i) influenced the reputation value of punishment in general, or (ii) increased the reputation value of punishment specifically without looking, on either of our global evaluation DVs. In fact, "Democrat + Ignored injustice" and both "Democrat + Conflict of Interest" treatments caused Evaluators to share relatively less money with punishers who declined (vs. chose) to look.</p><p>The above tables add further insight into these patterns. First, they reveal that, beyond reducing baseline loyalty ratings, some of the aforementioned treatments also reduced baseline ratings of other DVs (in particular, positivity, fairness, and competence). Thus, the information that we added to cast doubt on Actors' loyalty caused Evaluators to evaluate Actors less positively at baseline in several ways.</p><p>Second, we find that none of the aforementioned treatments enhanced the reputation value of punishment in general on any DVs. In fact, all four treatments decreased the loyalty benefit of punishment (and one treatment also decreased the competence benefit of punishment). Thus, the information that we added to cast doubt on Actors' loyalty caused Evaluators to interpret punishment as a less meaningful signal of loyalty.</p><p>Third, we find that none of the aforementioned treatments enhanced the reputation value of punishment without (vs. with) looking on any DVs, with the one exception that "Democrat + Previously Independent" decreased the fairness cost of declining to look. Furthermore, in all four treatments, we did not observe the significant loyalty benefit of declining to look that we found in Study 1 (and replicated in the baseline conditions of Studies 2a-b). And for two treatments, this translated to a significant interaction effect, whereby the "not looking" effect size was significantly more negative in the relevant treatment than the baseline condition. Thus, we find evidence that the information that we added to cast doubt on Actors' loyalty caused Evaluators to interpret punishment without (vs. with) looking as a less meaningful signal of loyalty.</p><p>Finally, we find that none of the aforementioned treatments influenced the reputation value of non-punishment without vs. with looking on any DVs, with the one exception that "Democrat + Previously Independent" decreased the fairness cost of declining to look.</p><p>These patterns help illuminate why casting doubt on Actor loyalty by adding information did not cause the loyalty-signaling property of punishment without looking to pay larger reputational dividends, as one might have expected it to. We instead found that, when given active reason to doubt an Actor's loyalty, Evaluators formed more negative baseline impressions of Actors, and saw the choice to punish in general as a less meaningful indicator of loyalty.</p><p>Furthermore, Evaluators also saw the choice to punish specifically without looking as a less meaningful indicator of loyalty, perhaps because eschewing opposing perspectives seemed less like moral commitment, and more like laziness. And consequentially, casting doubt on Actor loyalty by adding information did not increase the reputation value of punishment in general, or punishment specifically without looking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Establishing loyalty by adding information</head><p>As reported in the main text, relative to the baseline condition, establishing loyalty by adding information (as we did in "Democrat + Responded to injustice") successfully increased baseline loyalty ratings, and increased the reputation value of punishment in general on both of our global evaluation DVs. However, it did not significantly influence the reputation value of punishment without vs. with looking on either global evaluation DV.</p><p>The above tables add further insight into these patterns. First, they reveal that "Democrat + Responded to injustice" increased baseline loyalty ratings, but did not increase baseline ratings of other DVs.</p><p>Second, we find that "Democrat + Responded to injustice" increased the reputation value of punishment in general on all DVs. This effect can be interpreted as a "moral consistency" effect, whereby having displayed loyalty previously (by responding to injustice) increases the importance of displaying loyalty in the present study (by punishing).</p><p>Third, we find that "Democrat + Responded to injustice" decreased the fairness cost, but also decreased the loyalty benefit, of punishing without (vs. with) looking-and did not influence relative evaluations of punishment without looking on any other DVs. Thus, the information that we added to establish loyalty caused Evaluators to interpret punishment without looking as relatively less unfair, perhaps because it seemed less hasty or uninformed coming from an individual with an established record of engagement with the relevant moral cause. But establishing loyalty also caused Evaluators to interpret punishment without looking as a relatively less meaningful signal of loyalty, perhaps because loyalty was very well-established for both types of punishers. Together, these countervailing effects seem to have netted out to create no change in the overall reputation value of punishment without vs. with looking (as measured by our global evaluation DVs).</p><p>Finally, we find that "Democrat + Responded to injustice" did not influence the reputation value of non-punishment without vs. with looking on any DVs.</p><p>Together, these patterns help illuminate why establishing Actor loyalty by adding information served to increase the reputation value of punishment in general, but not punishment specifically without looking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Mediation analyses</head><p>As noted in the main text, the baseline conditions of Studies 2a-b replicate the results of our exploratory mediation analyses from Studies 1a-b (which were pre-registered analyses for the baseline conditions of Study 2).

Mediation analyses of Studies 2a-b.

In particular, within each treatment condition, we ran the same two mediation models that we report results for above. The results of these analyses, which we do not report here for brevity, were qualitatively identical to the above-reported results, with one key exception. As illustrated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table S4c</ref>, the four Study 2a treatments that were designed to cast doubt on loyalty by adding information (i.e., "Democrat + Ignored injustice", both "Democrat + Conflict of Interest" treatments, and "Democrat + Previously Independent") did not produce significant positive effects of punishment without (vs. with) looking on loyalty. Therefore, within each of these conditions, in both models, the A path and indirect effects for loyalty are not significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Moderation analyses</head><p>As noted in the main text, Study 2 provides further evidence, both within the baseline conditions and overall, for the moderating effects of Evaluator ideology (whereby strong partisans show relatively more positive evaluations of punishment in general, and less negative evaluations of punishment without looking).</p><p>To support this claim, in <ref type="table">Table S6</ref>, we reproduce main text <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, but with data from the baseline conditions of Studies 2a-b. This table reveals significant partisanship moderation in the baseline condition of Study 2a for overall positivity (both for evaluations of punishment, and evaluations of punishment without vs. with looking) and sharing (for evaluations of punishment, but not evaluations of punishment without vs. with looking). In the baseline condition of Study 2b, however, we do not find significant moderation. <ref type="table">Table S6</ref>. The moderating role of ideology in Studies 2a-b. We reproduce <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> from the main text, but with Studies 2a-b.</p><p>Then, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figures S3a-b</ref>, we reproduce <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> from the main text, but separately show results among strong vs. weak partisans-both for positivity ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure S3a</ref>) and sharing ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Figure  S3b</ref>). These figures provide insight into moderation patterns across conditions. For both DVs, across conditions, we see that strong partisans generally show more positive evaluations of punishment in general, and less negative evaluations of punishment without looking. Notably, however, across all conditions, even strong partisans consistently react more negatively to punishers who decline vs. choose to look, on both DVs.    </p></div>

Upon reaching this initial target, all of our key results were significant. However, while finishing data collection for Study 4b (which recruited Republicans, who are under-represented on MTurk), we decided to direct Democrats to Study 4a, increasing its sample size. After making this decision, we registered an amendment to our Study 4a pre-registration, increasing our target to n = 2000 subjects. In the main text, we report analyses of Study 4a that combine data from both batches of data collection. However, in <ref type="table">Table S7</ref>, we report our Study 4a results within each individual batch (and also re-report the overall results from both batches combined, to facilitate comparison).</p><p>We also pre-registered a plan to correct, in our combined analyses of both batches, for the fact that we "peeked" at first batch of data before deciding to collect a second batch (using the approach of Sagarin, Ambler, &amp; Lee, 2014, Perspectives on Psychological Science). In particular, we planned, for each key result that is significant in our final sample, to report whether the result continues to be significant when accounting for peeking by computing an adjusted alpha threshold that allows us to maintain an actual type-I error rate of .05.</p><p>More precisely, instead of computing a single adjusted alpha threshold, we planned to report an adjusted alpha range. This reflects that the required alpha threshold depends on the maximum p-value observed in the initial batch of data collection for which we would have collected more data rather than declaring the initial results non-significant; this could range from a "best-case scenario" of the p-value observed after the initial data collection to a "worst-case scenario" of 1.</p><p>Thus, for each result in <ref type="table">Table S7</ref>, we report a best-and worst-case scenario for the adjusted alpha threshold. Importantly, for each of the three results that are significant in the overall sample, we find that the p-values are smaller than even the worst-case scenario adjusted alpha threshold. Thus, we find that all significant Study 4a results remain significant, even after accounting for peeking. <ref type="table">Table S7</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Analyses of how making punishment observable influences looking</head><p>In our main text analyses of Studies 3-4, when considering the effects of making punishment observable (i.e., when comparing our "Nothing Observable" and "Punishment Observable" conditions), we focus on rates of punishment overall, and punishment without looking, as dependent variables. However, our design also allows us to ask how making punishment observable influences overall rates of looking. We pre-registered analyses of this question, but do not report them in the main text because they are less relevant to our key theoretical questions. Here, we report these analyses. In Study 3, among Democrats, rates of looking were similar in Punishment Observable (35%) and Nothing Observable (34%), b = .01 [-.04, .06], t = .40, p = .686, n = 1222.

In contrast, Republicans were similarly likely to look in Punishment Observable (15%) and Nothing Observable (18%), b = -.03 [-.08, .02], t = -1.08, p = .279, n = 763.</p><p>Thus, we mostly find that making punishment observable has no reliable effect on rates of looking.

However, our design also allows us to ask how making looking observable influences overall rates of punishment. We likewise pre-registered analyses of this question, but do not report them in the main text because they are less relevant to our key theoretical questions. Here, we report these analyses.</p><p>In Thus, making looking observable did not influence rates of punishment in our studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Analyses of perfect comprehenders</head><p>As reported in the main text, our main text analyses include all subjects, regardless of performance on comprehension questions. However, per our pre-registration, below we report secondary analyses that restrict to subjects who correctly answered our comprehension questions on their first try (and produce very similar results).</p><p>We note that in Studies 3-4, subjects answered two sets of comprehension questions. The first three questions tested comprehension of the Dictator Game structure; for these questions, the correct responses were the same across observability conditions. The second three questions tested comprehension of the extent to which subjects' punishment and looking decisions were observable to the Evaluator; for these questions, the correct responses differed across observability conditions.</p><p>Importantly, in the below analyses, rather than restricting to subjects who answered all questions correctly on their first try, we merely restrict to subjects who correctly answered the Dictator Game questions on the first try. This decision reflects that in both Study 3 and Study 4, initial performance on each of the three observability questions differed significantly across observability conditions; thus, restricting to subjects who correctly answered all observability questions on their first try would undermine random assignment and thus causal inference.</p><p>In particular, in Study 3, a series of chi squared tests reveals significant condition effects on binary variables indicating whether the first (Democrats: X 2 = 30.37, p &lt; .001; Republicans: X 2 = 34.10, p &lt; .001), second (Democrats: X 2 = 174.58, p &lt; .001; Republicans: X 2 = 178.69, p &lt; .001), and third (Democrats: X 2 = 6.81, p = .033; Republicans: X 2 = 13.68, p = .001) observability questions were initially answered correctly.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Analyses of alternative specifications of looking</head><p>As described in the main text, per our pre-registration, our primary analyses define "looking" in Studies 3-4 as clicking at least one link to an opposing perspective article. However, for Study 4 (but not Study 3), we also preregistered secondary analyses that define looking as either (i) time spent on the "looking" screen (in which subjects were presented with links to opposing perspective articles, and invited to search the Internet for other opposing perspectives) or (ii) the continuous number of opposing perspective article links that subjects clicked. We report these alternative analyses (which produce very similar results) for both Studies 3-4, below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.1">Looking time (natural-log transformed seconds)</head><p>We begin by defining looking in terms of time spent on the "looking" screen.

When defining looking this way, in Study 3, we find that We do not use this definition of looking to redefine punishment without looking. This reflects that, in all studies, less than half of subjects read even one article; thus, if we were to mirror our above approach and redefine punishment without looking as punishing after looking at a below-median number of articles, we would wind up with the same definition of punishment without looking that we already used in our primary analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion of preregistration deviations</head><p>All studies were pre-registered (Study 1a: https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=RB5_VT1; Study 1b: https://aspredicted.org/522_B9Z; Study 2a: https://aspredicted.org/43C_4DD; Study 2b: https://aspredicted.org/1B8_B91; Study 3a: https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=WM4_C5K; Study 3b: https://aspredicted.org/XX6_24X; Study 4a initial pre-registration: https://aspredicted.org/2HX_QQJ; Study 4a pre-registration amendment: https://aspredicted.org/JLJ_QPY; Study 4b: https://aspredicted.org/XRC_RY3). As described in the main text, our analyses closely to our preregistered analysis plans with some minor deviations. Here, we describe these deviations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Studies 1-2</head><p>We begin by describing deviations in our analyses of our Evaluator studies (i.e., Studies 1-2.) We did not deviate from our pre-registrations for Studies 2a-b; thus, this section outlines deviations in our analyses of Studies 1a-b.</p><p>First, our Study 1a-b preregistrations describe our between-subject analyses (of evaluations of punishers who did vs. did not look) as primary analyses. However, for reasons of brevity and because these analyses produce results that are similar to our within-subject analyses but afford less statistical power, we report them only in the SI and not in the main text.</p><p>Second, our preregistrations describe our analyses of money sent in the Dictator Game as primary. In contrast, analyses of all other dependent variables (i.e., ratings of overall positivity, fairness, competence, and loyalty) are described in our pre-registrations as secondary analyses. Yet our main text does not preferentially focus on money sent. Instead, we report analyses of money sent and also ratings of overall positivity, fairness, competence, and loyalty, and specifically plot positivity ratings in main text <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>To explain this decision, we begin by noting that we saw money sent in the Dictator Game and ratings of overall positivity and as "global" evaluation variables (i.e., as variables that reflected Evaluators' overall impressions of Actors). In contrast, we saw ratings of fairness, competence, and loyalty as more specific evaluation variables. Originally, we planned to privilege money sent as our "primary" global evaluation variable. However, upon seeing our data, we noticed that many Evaluators chose either to share none or to exactly half of their endowment, and almost no Evaluators shared more than half of their endowment. This distributional feature likely reflects that money shared in the Dictator Game tapped both (i) the extent to which the Evaluator had a positive impression of the Actor and (ii) the extent to which the Evaluator was selfish vs. generous, or committed to avoiding inequality, etc. For example, Evaluators who were motivated to maximize their own payoffs may have never shared any money with any Actors, regardless of how positively they regarded them. And Evaluators who were committed to fairness may have always shared half of their money with all Actors, regardless of how positively they regarded them.</p><p>In contrast, ratings of overall positivity were more continuously distributed, perhaps reflecting that this global evaluation variable was a "purer" reflection of positive regard for the Actor. Thus, we ultimately felt that overall positivity was the more informative global evaluation variable. Moreover, we also ultimately felt that analyses of perceived fairness, competence, and loyalty provided critical insight into why Evaluators formed the global evaluations of Actors that they did. For these reasons, we report analyses of all DVs in our main text, and plot overall positivity in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> (while reproducing this figure with sharing in SI <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>). Furthermore, in Studies 2a-b, we pre-registered positivity ratings our as our primary DV.</p><p>Third, our pre-registrations describe our analyses of Evaluations of punishers who do vs. do not look as primary, but our analyses of Evaluations of punishers vs. non-punishers (in the absence of looking information) as secondary. However, our main text prominently features both sets of analyses. This decision reflects that, while our primary theoretical focus was on evaluations of punishers who did vs. did not look, we felt that understanding whether punishment was evaluated positively in general was critical for interpreting Evaluators' preferences for punishment with vs. without looking.</p><p>Fourth, we report mediation analyses that were not pre-registered. While exploratory, we felt that these analyses were informative (and pre-registered them in Studies 2a-b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Studies 3-4</head><p>Next, we describe deviations in our analyses of our Actor studies (i.e., Studies 3-4). First, our Study 3-4 preregistrations describe as primary two analyses that we ultimately report only in the SI (and not in our main text): (i) analyses of the effect of making punishment observable on looking, and (ii) analyses of the effect of making looking observable on punishment. As noted in the main text, we ultimately saw these analyses as less central to our theoretical questions; we therefore felt that they would distract from the flow of the main text and obfuscate the relationship between our analyses and the hypotheses we sought to test.</p><p>Second, for Study 4 but not Study 3, we preregistered a plan to report secondary analyses that used alternative definitions of looking. However, for completeness, in this SI we report these secondary analyses for both Study 4 and Study 3.</p></div>

In that treatment, the screen looked different because we did not say that Player 2 was a co-partisan, but rather described Player 2 merely as "another participant" (and asked one fewer comprehension questions):</p><p>Second, before subjects began evaluating Player 2, we showed a screen that (i) provided subjects in the treatments that "added information" with some additional information about the Player 2 they were paired with, and (ii) asked all subjects to write a paragraph reflecting on their initial impression of Player 2.</p><p>This was the relevant screen in the baseline conditions:</p><p>This was the screen in the "other participant" treatment from Study 2a:</p><p>This was the screen in the "Democrat + Conflict of Interest (Privacy)" treatment from Study 2a:</p><p>This was the screenshot in the "Democrat + Responded to injustice" treatment from Study 2b:</p><p>After subjects reflected on their initial impression of Player 2, we also showed one more screen (that was not included in Studies 1a-b) before subjects began evaluating Player 2. In this screen, we explained that subjects would be making multiple decisions about how much to share with Player 2, depending on how Player 2 had previously behaved. This was the relevant screen:</p><p>Then, like in Studies 1a-b, we collected our dependent variables, for the same set of Player 2 behavioral profiles that we featured in Studies 1a-b. However, while Studies 1a-b described each behavioral profile as corresponding to a different Player 2, Studies 2a-b described each behavioral profile as corresponding to a different way that a single Player 2 (i.e., the Player 2 that the subject was matched with) might have behaved. Moreover, we did not show a "transition screen" after the first behavior profile (like we did in Studies 1a-b) because we had already explained upfront that subjects would be making multiple decisions.</p><p>This HIT will also have another component.</p><p>In addition to participating in the Sharing Game, you will also have the opportunity to sign a petition, hosted on Change.org. Below, we have provided a screenshot of the petition. Later in this</p><p>HIT, we will provide a link to the petition.
