			<abstract>
				<p>We present a computational model capable of simulating aspects of human knowledge for thousands of real-world concepts. Our approach involves fine-tuning a transformer network for natural language processing on participant-generated feature norms. We show that such a model can successfully extrapolate from its training dataset, and predict human knowledge for novel concepts and features. We also apply our model to stimuli from twenty-three previous experiments in semantic cognition research, and show that it reproduces fifteen classic findings involving semantic verification, concept typicality, feature distribution, and semantic similarity. We interpret these results using established properties of classic connectionist networks. The success of our approach shows how the combination of natural language data and psychological data can be used to build cognitive models with rich world knowledge. Such models can be used in the service of new psychological applications, such as the cognitive process modeling of naturalistic semantic verification and knowledge retrieval, as well as the modeling of real-world categorization, decision making, and reasoning.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Knowledge of concepts and their features is one of the fundamental topics of inquiry in cognitive science <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Murphy, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Rips et al., 2012)</ref>. Understanding the content, structure, and representational format of conceptual knowledge is of great intrinsic interest, but is also critical as conceptual knowledge is a central component of much of high-level cognition. Unfortunately, it has traditionally been difficult to model what people actually know about real-world concepts, owing to their complexity and richness of knowledge acquired over many years of learning.</p><p>Thus, even though there are many influential computational theories of conceptual knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Collins &amp; Loftus, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Rogers &amp; McClelland, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Smith et al., 1974)</ref>, most such theories cannot make a priori predictions about how participants will judge the truth or falsehood of a proposition involving an arbitrary concept-feature pair. This is also why quantitative cognitive process models <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Busemeyer &amp; Diederich, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lewandowsky &amp; Farrell, 2010)</ref> common in other areas of cognitive psychology, are seldom applied to naturalistic semantic cognition. For example, evidence accumulation models have had great success in capturing response time distributions in perceptual and preferential choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001</ref>), but do not extend simplistically to semantic verification tasks involving everyday concepts and features, such as those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Collins and Quillian (1969)</ref>.</p><p>Likewise, computational memory models accurately predict word list recall data <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Polyn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Raaijmakers &amp; Shiffrin, 1981)</ref>, but are not used to model sequences of features recalled by participants in feature norm studies, such as those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">McRae et al. (2005)</ref>.</p><p>The inability to predict knowledge of real-world concepts also makes it difficult to build models that use human knowledge of naturally occurring entities in the service of high-level cognition. There are many successful theories of categorization, judgment, decision making, induction, and reasoning, but these are typically tested using only abstracted stimuli involving small sets of experimenter-defined features and relations. In order to quantitatively predict semantic verification, response time, and recall probability in everyday semantic cognition, and to build models capable of naturalistic high-level cognition, we first need a way to proxy human knowledge for thousands of concepts and an almost infinite set of possible features. This is not currently possible.</p><p>Fortunately, the field of distributed semantics has made great progress in automatically extracting knowledge representations for real-world concepts from large-scale natural language data. These advances rely on the insight that much human knowledge is reflected in the patterns of co-occurrence between words, which can be exploited to derive representations for words as vectors in high-dimensional semantic spaces or in terms of a set of probabilistic semantic topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Griffiths et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Jones &amp; Mewhort, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mikolov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Pennington et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> for reviews see <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lenci, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bhatia et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">or GÃ¼nther et al. 2019</ref>).</p><p>However, even though distributed semantic representations predict the semantic relatedness of concepts with reasonable accuracy and can be applied to tens of thousands of common concepts, they do not possess complex featural and relational representations for concepts. In response, researchers have begun to combine distributed semantic representations with survey and experimental data, such as feature norms and participant ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Andrews et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Derby et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Lu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Richie et al., 2019)</ref>. In most such applications, distributed semantic representations for concepts serve as inputs into more complex models that are fine-tuned on participant data, and are thus able to proxy the (often structured) knowledge at play in the participants' responses. Such extensions of the distributed semantics framework are promising.</p><p>However, they seldom predict human knowledge for out-of-sample features (features on which the models have not been fine-turned), and are thus unable to capture the richness of human knowledge for naturalistic concepts.</p><p>In this paper we extend the distributed semantics approach using contemporary implementations of classical connectionist models of semantic cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hinton, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Rogers &amp; McClelland, 2004)</ref>. We rely, in particular, on transformer networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Devlin et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vasvani et al., 2017)</ref>, which represent sentences using high-dimensional vectors, and manipulate these vectors in multiple interconnected neural network layers based on an attention mechanism.</p><p>These networks are pre-trained on billions of words of natural language, and know about most common concepts and features. We fine-tune transformer networks on sentences generated from existing feature and category norm studies in psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Devereux et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">McRae et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Van Overschelde et al., 2003)</ref>, and in doing so, teach them to use their rich world knowledge in a manner that proxies the representations and processes at play in simple semantic judgment.</p><p>The power and generality of transformer networks means that they can be used to make predictions for a very large set of naturalistic concepts and features, including concepts and features for which human data is not available. We use cross-validation analysis to test the accuracy of such predictions --our models are trained on a subset of category and feature norms data and then tested on out-of-sample concepts, out-of-sample features, out-of-sample conceptfeature combinations, and even out-of-sample domains. We also evaluate our models in terms of their ability to reproduce sixteen distinct behavioral patterns from twenty-three experiments involving response times in semantic verification tasks, typicality ratings for concepts and categories, the distribution of features across concepts, and similarity ratings between pairs of concepts. We do this with stimuli from classic as well as more recently published papers. We are the first to make quantitative predictions for most of these stimuli sets, and the success or failure of our tests has significant implications for the psychological validity of transformer networks. If these networks succeed at predicting participant-generated feature norms, as well as classical effects in semantic cognition, we can consider them to be valuable tools for studying human conceptual knowledge. They can be used to understand the computational mechanisms that give rise to observed behavioral patterns, and the predictions of these networks can be used in conjunction with existing theories for more sophisticated models of semantic verification and naturalistic high-level cognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Connectionist Models</head><p>The work in this paper draws form two traditions in semantic cognition research. The first is connectionist modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(McClelland et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Rumelhart et al., 1986)</ref>, which proposes that "semantic abilities arise from the flow of activation among simple, neuron-like processing units, as governed by the strengths of interconnecting weights" <ref type="bibr">(Rogers &amp; McClelland, 2004, p. 689</ref>). This approach has had a long history in cognitive science, with the earliest model in this theoretical framework being <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hinton's (1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hinton's ( , 1986</ref> distributed network for propositional knowledge. Hinton's model assumes separate vector representations for each part of a proposition. For simple propositions involving a head, a tail, and a relation word (e.g. cat has fur), this model involves three base layers, each corresponding to one word in the proposition (e.g. cat, has, and fur). Each of the word layers in Hinton's model are recurrently connected to a proposition layer, as well as to themselves. Thus, feeding the words in a proposition as inputs into the model leads to changing activation patterns on both the proposition layer and the word layers, culminating in a stable state in which activation patterns in the proposition layer reflect the emergent meaning of the proposition. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1A</ref> for an illustration. Hinton's model has several properties that make it a useful model of semantic cognition, including the ability to use the proposition layer as an input into additional cognitive processes, the ability to store a large set of propositions in memory using a small set of weights, the ability to generalize knowledge to novel concepts and features, and the ability to encode sentence structure by allowing for different weights between each pair of layers (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Rogers &amp; McClelland, 2004</ref> for a summary). As we discuss below, Hinton's model has architectural similarities to the transformer networks used in the current paper, which also involve vector representations for the individual words in a proposition, as well as the interactive transformation of these representations in hidden layers to generate emergent vector representations for propositions.</p><p>Since Hinton's foundational work, many other researchers have developed computational connectionist models capable of semantic representations and judgment. Perhaps the most popular of these is <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Rumelhart and Todd's (1993)</ref> network. This network has a feedforward structure which transforms vector inputs of entities and relations (e.g. cat and has), using hidden layers, to produce predictions for words and features that match the inputs (e.g. fur). See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure   1B</ref> for an illustration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Rogers and McClelland (2004)</ref> have trained this model on a taxonomic structure adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Collins and Quillian (1969)</ref> to study concept organization, and explain how concept organization changes over the course of development, as well as with expertise and dementia (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Saxe et al., 2019</ref>, for further analytical results). There are of course many other connectionist models and hybrid symbolic-connectionist models of semantics (as well as connectionist networks of distributed semantics discussed below). These models typically involve distributed (vector) representations for the words and concepts that make up propositions, and the transformation of these representations in neural network layers. The richness of this work reflects the importance of the connectionist paradigm to the study of conceptual knowledge. Connectionist models do have limitations, which we will discuss in detail at the end of this paper. However, they also provide a powerful approach for understanding the dynamics of concept learning, as well as semantic reasoning and judgment, within a wellspecified (and in some cases, neurobiologically feasible) computational framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distributed Semantics</head><p>Our paper also builds off a second area of research in semantic cognition: Distributed semantics. Models within this tradition use word distribution statistics in large-scale natural language data to derive representations for words that preserve word meaning. For example, the classic method, latent semantic analysis, performs a singular value decomposition on wordcontext co-occurrence matrices, which assigns each word in the corpus a vector representation in a high dimensional semantic space <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997)</ref>. As words that occur in similar contexts in natural language have similar vectors in this space, vector similarity measures like cosine are a good proxy for word association and word relatedness.</p><p>Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Landauer and Dumais (1997)</ref> introduced latent semantic analysis, a host of models exploiting lexical distribution statistics in text have emerged. One such model is GloVe <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref>, which tabulates a word-word co-occurrence matrix and then learns vectors such that the dot product of two word vectors approximates the logarithm of the words' probability of co-occurrence. Below we will be using vectors derived from a GloVe model as a baseline for model comparison. Other related models include BEAGLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Jones &amp; Mewhort, 2007)</ref>, topic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Griffiths et al. 2007)</ref>, and Word2Vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Word vector representations learned through these methods have been enormously successful in psychological applications (for reviews see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bhatia et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">GÃ¼nther et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Jones et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lenci, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mandera et al., 2017)</ref>. For example, cosine similarity between word vectors correlates with Likert-scale judgments of words' similarity and relatedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Richie &amp; Bhatia, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hill et al., 2015)</ref>, strength of semantic priming in, e.g., the lexical decision task, as measured by reaction times <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Jones et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mandera et al., 2017)</ref>, and even with probability of recall given a cue in free association, or given an earlier recalled item in list recall (although there are often better ways to use word vectors for such tasks rather than simply computing cosine; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Nematzadeh et al., 2017 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Jones et al., 2018)</ref>. Semantic judgments about words (e.g. the size of an animal) can also be approximated by calculating the relative vector similarity of a judgment target (e.g. tiger) to words high (e.g. large, big) and low (e.g. small, tiny) on a judgment dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Grand et al., 2018)</ref>. Most relevant to this paper, Bhatia (2017) has found that cosine similarity between word vectors provides a good measure of association in simple judgment tasks, and can thus predict association-based biases in probability judgment, factual judgment, and forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Evans, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kahneman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sloman, 1996)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fine-tuning Word Representations</head><p>Although the distributed semantics approach has been very successful at quantifying degree of similarity, relatedness, or association among pairs of words, or modeling simple semantic judgments of single words, it is, in its simplest form, unable to capture the types of word relationships that are necessary for structured knowledge representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Lenci, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Lu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lake &amp; Murphy, 2020)</ref>. For example, these models may be able to predict that cat and fur are closely associated (e.g. by observing that semantic vector representations or topic distributions for these words are very similar), but these models cannot evaluate whether cats have fur, cats are a type of fur, or fur has cats.</p><p>In response, recent work uses representations derived from the above approaches in more sophisticated models that are fine-tuned on task-specific human data. For example, the Bayesian analogy with relational transformations (BART) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Lu et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Lu et al., , 2019</ref> transforms Word2Vec representations for the entities in a proposition (e.g. cat and fur) using subtraction and ranking operations to obtain vector representations for the entity pair. These representations are then mapped onto a continuous variable that predicts whether a given relation (e.g. has) holds between the entities. The mapping itself is trained on positive and negative examples of different relations obtained from human subjects. The resulting model makes accurate predictions for the relations between novel entity pairs, and is subsequently able to model analogy and relationship similarity judgments between pairs of words. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1C</ref> for an illustration.</p><p>The partial least squares regression (PLSR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(FÇgÇrÇÅan et al., 2015)</ref> and Feature2Vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Derby et al., 2019)</ref> models provide another example of this approach. Feature2Vec takes GloVe representations of concepts as inputs, and using subject-generated feature norms for concepts, attempts to derive representations for features as points in the original GloVe vector space. The trained model evaluates whether a proposition (e.g. cat has fur) is true by measuring the vector similarity of its initial representation for the concept (e.g. cat) and its learnt representation for the feature (e.g. has fur) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1D</ref> for an illustration). The PSLR model is similarly fine-tuned on feature norms, but learns concept-feature relationships using regression. Note that there are also closely related approaches that use feature norms data to augment word representations extracted from text (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Andrews et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Steyvers, 2009)</ref>. These approaches rely on the insight that participant-generated feature norms reflect experiences with the world and capture sensory-motor data not present in spoken and written language, resulting in higher quality word representations.</p><p>Finally, in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Richie et al., 2019</ref>; also see Bhatia, 2019) we have used fine-tuning to predict human ratings of concepts on psychological properties (e.g. the femininity of traits, the warmth and competence of people, the riskiness of activities, and the nutrition of foods, etc.). We take Word2Vec representations of concepts as inputs, and, using human ratings of concepts, train a regularized regression model that maps these vector representations onto a scalar prediction for the human rating. Mathematically, this regression technique resembles PSLR and Feature2Vec, and can be seen as deriving representations of the rating dimension (e.g. femininity) as a point in the Word2Vec semantic space. Our regression technique is able to accurately predict human ratings of the psychological properties of concepts on which the model has not been fine-tuned. Importantly, such predictions are more accurate than those obtained by the relative similarity of the judgment target to words high and low in the judgment dimension, i.e., the Grand et al. (2018) approach discussed above.</p><p>Fine-tuning methods have been shown to be successful at describing certain types of structured knowledge. That said, they are still severely limited by the human data that is used to train the models. For example, PSLR and Feature2Vec are unable to make predictions for novel features that are not present in their training data. Likewise, our own regression approaches are applicable only to the psychological dimensions for which we elicit human ratings, and cannot extrapolate to novel psychological dimensions. The approaches discussed here are also limited by the vocabularies of the semantic vector models (e.g. GloVe) that they take as inputs. These semantic vector models typically do not have representations for noun phrases (e.g. house cat, black fur), and for this reason, cannot be applied to more complex concepts and features known to humans, including concepts and features that have been used in earlier research on semantic cognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transformer Networks</head><p>Recent years have seen technological breakthroughs in computational linguistics:</p><p>Computer models are now able to achieve unprecedented levels of performance in question answering, semantic entailment, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and other natural language processing tasks. Perhaps the most impressive advances have come from a new type of deep, feed forward neural network known as the transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cer et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Devlin et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Radford et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Vaswani et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dai et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Brown et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Tay et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Qiu et al., 2020)</ref>. There are now numerous variants of transformers, but we will focus on a particularly prominent transformer, the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Devlin et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>BERT is a stack of layers. The first layer receives vector representations of each of the individual words that make up the sentence, and transforms these representations into a vector output. This output is fed into the next layer, whose output is fed into the subsequent layer, and so on. Each layer transforms its input using a feedforward neural network and a self-attention mechanism. Self-attention enables the model to look at other positions in the input sentence for information about how to best process a word. This makes it sensitive to word order, and allows it to solve problems related to word-sense disambiguation (e.g. knowing that fur in cats have fur refers to the hairy coat on their skin rather than the garment) and co-reference resolution (e.g.</p><p>knowing that cats and their refers to the same entity in cats like to lick their fur).</p><p>BERT is 'pre-trained' on tasks such as masked word prediction and next sentence prediction on large amounts of text data. Through this, BERT learns how to transform natural language sentences into vector representations that approximate elements of sentence meaning.</p><p>The pre-trained BERT model can be subsequently fine-tuned on additional data (e.g. pairs of questions and answers, or sentiment ratings for sentences) to learn how to apply its learnt representations to specific natural language processing tasks. This 'pre-train, then fine-tune' paradigm, known as 'transfer learning', is the key to BERT's state-of-the-art achievements in natural language processing.</p><p>Building off these successes, our proposal is to fine-tune BERT to perform semantic verification (true/false judgments) for sentences generated from feature and category production norms. In our tests, BERT learns to predict if a sentence is composed of a concept and feature pair generated by subjects (i.e. is true) or if it is composed of a concept and feature pair not generated by subjects (i.e. is false). By fine-tuning BERT on psychological data, we teach it to use its rich world knowledge to proxy human semantic cognition. To better understand how the various properties of our full BERT model contribute to its ability to predict human conceptual knowledge, we also compare this model with variants that are not fine-tuned on subjectgenerated norms, as well as with variants that use alternate BERT outputs to make predictions. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1E</ref> for an illustration of the BERT model. We are not the first to apply BERT to structured semantic cognition in this manner. Some recent work has used a similar approach to augment knowledge bases with graphs consisting of {head, relation, tail} triples (e.g. {Steve Jobs, founded, Apple}) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Yao et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Petroni et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bouraoui et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bosselut et al., 2019)</ref>. However, transformer networks of have been underutilized for psychological applications of interest. For example, our fine-tuned BERT model generates continuous predictions of truth and falseness for natural language sentences generated from concept and feature pairs. We suggest that it may be possible to use these continuous predictions to predict classic findings in semantic verification tasks including choice probability, response time, and typicality effects (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Collins &amp; Quillian, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rosch, 1975)</ref>.</p><p>Since BERT can specify the relationship between thousands of concepts and features, it can also be used to predict how correlated different features are with each other (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Malt &amp; Smith, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">McRae et al., 1997)</ref>. BERT's sensitivity to word ordering in sentences may also allow it to capture asymmetry effects in similarity judgment, thereby outperforming classical distributed semantics models (whose spatial structure imposes strong symmetry assumptions on similarity, at least when using symmetric measures like cosine or dot product) (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Tversky, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Whitten et al., 1979)</ref>.</p><p>Transformer networks that produce representations for sentences are natural successors to earlier distributed semantics models that produce vectors (or topic distributions) for words. Both are based on word distribution statistics in natural language, and both generate representations for linguistic units (words or sentences) that preserve semantic similarity. Likewise, the 'pretrain, then fine-tune' paradigm is identical to the BART, Feature2Vec and regression applications discussed in the preceding section, in that vector representations for linguistic units are transformed in order to better capture the task to which the models are applied. Indeed, our use of feature norms data to fine-tune BERT is inspired by the successes of PSLR and Feature2Vec, which have already demonstrated the utility of these data for modeling featurebased knowledge representations in distributed semantics.</p><p>As outlined above, transformer networks can also be seen as modern counterparts to earlier connectionist models of semantic cognition. In our case, BERT's architecture is related to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hinton's (1981)</ref> connectionist network. Both take as inputs vector representations for the individual words that make up the sentence, and both transform these inputs into more refined representations using neural network operations. Of course, Hinton's network implements these operations in recurrent layers, whereas BERT implements them in large numbers of feed-forward layers. However, it is well-known that series of operations in feed-forward layers can approximate the outputs of recurrent networks. Indeed, BERT's transformations of concatenated word vectors in successive layers (each of which gives a vector output of the same dimensionality as the input) is similar to how recurrent networks successively manipulate a set of vectors using a single set of operations. For this reason, our BERT model and Hinton's model both have similar properties regarding prediction, generalization, and representational parsimony (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Rogers &amp; McClelland, 2004</ref> for a discussion). Of course, classic networks relied on handcrafted datasets of only a handful of concepts and their properties and relations. The promise of BERT is that, having been pre-trained on vast corpora, it can capture a much more realistic range of human knowledge.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Norms datasets</head><p>We fine-tuned our models using three existing datasets of subject-generated norms. The first dataset comes from Van Overschelde et al. <ref type="bibr">(2004)</ref>, who collected category norms for 70 different categories. Participants were asked to generate as many concepts in the categories as possible, and concepts were ranked based on their production frequencies. The dataset offered by Van Overschelde et al. has a total of 1,621 distinct concepts. The second dataset comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">McRae et al. (2005)</ref>, who collected feature norms for 541 concepts. Participants in their study were asked to list the features of each of the concepts and were encouraged to list different types of features (e.g. perceptual and functional properties, concept categories, and encyclopedic facts). McRae et al. processed their data to exclude infrequently listed features and pool synonymous features (e.g. has fur, is fluffy). The dataset released by McRae et al. has a total of 2,526 distinct experimenter-processed features. Our third dataset comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Devereux et al. (2014)</ref>, who collected feature norms for 638 concepts. Participants were given similar instructions as in McRae et al., and the final dataset contains a total of 26,075 unique participantgenerated features. Devereux et al. also pooled synonymous features, which yields 5,926 semantically distinct experimenter-processed features. The concepts and categories used in the above datasets were taken from prior research on semantic cognition, and included animals, foods, tools, clothes, geographic locations, occupations, and other real-world entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>True sentences</head><p>We trained our models using 'true' and 'false' sentences generated from these three norms datasets. True sentences were simply natural language propositions obtained by combining concepts and their corresponding categories or features. In the case of Van <ref type="bibr">Overschelde et al.'s (2003)</ref> data, concepts (e.g. cat) were combined with their corresponding superordinate category (e.g. a four-footed animal) using an 'is a' category membership relation, yielding natural language sentences of the form [CONCEPT] is a [CATEGORY] (e.g. cat is a four-footed animal). In contrast, concepts in <ref type="bibr">McRae et al. (2005) (e.g. cat)</ref> were simplistically combined with their corresponding features (e.g. has fur), yielding natural language sentences of the form [CONCEPT] [FEATURE] (e.g. cat has fur) (this was done as most features in McRae et al. were verb phrases that specified the relation with the target concept). We used a nearly identical approach for concepts in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Devereux et al. (2014)</ref> except that we applied it to the raw subject-generated features rather than experimenter-processed features. This gave us separate sentences for semantically similar features (e.g. cat has fur and cat is fluffy). True sentences generated using the above methods were combined with true 'tautology' sentences made using the Van Overschelde et al. concepts. This involved merely combining the target concept with 'is a' in the formula [CONCEPT] is a [CONCEPT] (e.g. cat is a cat). We decided to artificially generate such sentences as they are within the theoretical scope of most theories of semantic cognition, but are not represented in our feature norms data.</p><p>Note that we did have to manually process some of the McRae et al. features, such as those prefixed by 'beh' and 'inbeh', in order to generate reasonable natural language sentences (these prefixes were used by McRae et al. to organize and code the subject-generated features -'Beh' is an abbreviation of behavior and 'Inbeh' is an abbreviation for something an inanimate object does seemingly on its own). We also excluded features prefixed by 'e.g.' as these involved category examples that could not be simplistically made into natural language sentences with our approach (i.e. sentences like cat e.g. tabby were removed). Additionally, we removed 'does' from the Devereux et al., features in which 'does' was followed by a verb, and also modified the verb with a 3 rd person singular inflection (e.g. sentences like cat does like milk were replaced with cat likes milk). For both the McRae et al. and Devereux et al. datasets, we manually added 'is' to the features where necessary (e.g. replacing cat made of bones with cat is made of bones).</p><p>Finally, our dataset repeated true sentences in proportion to the production frequencies for the features that made up the sentences (i.e. the production frequencies of the concept-feature pairs). For example, thirteen participants in the Devereux et al. dataset generated the feature has fur for the concept cat. Thus, the true sentence cat has fur was repeated thirteen times in our final dataset. In the case of Van Overschelde et al., who obtained hundreds of repetitions for concepts, we scaled the repetitions to be between 1 and 10. For example, 97% of participants gave cat as concept in response to the category a four-footed animal. This number was divided by ten and rounded, to generate ten repetitions for cat is a four-footed animal in the final dataset. In contrast, only 23% of participants gave mouse as a response to this category, yielding only two repetitions for mouse is a four-footed animal in our dataset. Each of the tautology sentences (e.g.</p><p>cat is a cat) were repeated ten times (corresponding to a hypothetical production frequency of ten) in our dataset.</p><p>Overall, there were a total of 245,642 true sentences, including repetitions, in our final dataset. These were composed of 58,385 unique sentences. 4,438 true sentences were generated using the Van Overschelde et al. dataset, 75,365 were generated using the <ref type="bibr">McRae et al. dataset,</ref><ref type="bibr">146</ref>,929 were generated using the <ref type="bibr">Devereux et al. dataset,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 18,</ref><ref type="bibr">910</ref> were tautology sentences made up of concepts from the Van Overschelde et al. dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>False sentences</head><p>Our false sentences were obtained by modifying the true sentences using one of two methods. The first method, which we refer to as 'concept replacement', involved replacing the target concept with a randomly selected concept from the same dataset to which the feature had not been applied (e.g. the true sentence cat has fur could be used to generate the false sentence tractor has fur, by replacing cat with tractor and ensuring that has fur was not a feature listed in response to tractor). The second method, which we refer to 'subject-object exchange' involved swapping the subjects and objects of the true sentence whose features contained only one noun (e.g. the true sentence cat hunts mouse could be used to generate the false sentence mouse hunts cat, by swapping the positions of cat and mouse and ensuring that hunts mouse has only a single noun). We did not apply the 'subject-object exchange' method to sentences with a symmetric relation (e.g. is similar to, is associated with, resembles, is close to, is mixed with, etc.).</p><p>We generated one false sentence for each (potentially non-unique) true sentence in our training data, leading to 245,642 false sentences in our dataset. This was done by first generating as many 'subject-object exchange' sentences as possible, and then completing the false sentence dataset with 'concept replacement'.</p><p>Note that our use of false sentences not directly generated by participants is a type of negative sampling. Negative sampling is common in classification tasks, in which items are randomly paired with incorrect labels in order to provide additional training data for the learner.</p><p>Negative sampling is also used in models like Word2Vec, as well as in extensions of these models such as Feature2Vec (whose negative sampling method is identical to our 'concept replacement' method). As with most other negative sampling methods, the 'concept replacement' and the 'subject-object exchange' algorithms used in this paper can mistakenly assign the false label to otherwise true sentences. As we shall see below, many of the seemingly false sentences that our model thinks are true are in fact composed of reasonable concept-feature combinations that were not generated by subjects. Given the size and richness of the training data there is no way to avoid this problem, and we recognize that the accuracy rates in our tests are underestimates of the predictive power of our approach.</p><p>In summary, our final dataset had a total of 491,284 observations (sentences and corresponding true or false labels). 245,642 of these observations involved true sentences, 33,587 involved false sentences generated using the 'subject-object exchange' method, and 212,055 involved false sentences generated using the 'concept replacement' method. The 491,284 observations were composed of 284,530 unique sentences, 2,066 unique concepts, and 29,048 unique features. These statistics are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 1</ref>. Note that to evaluate the sensitivity of our model's performance to the potentially non-grammatical and unusual false subject-object exchange sentences (e.g. fur has cat), we also tested a variant of this model that used only the concept replacement sentences to generate negative examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Specification and Training</head><p>In the past year, many extensions of BERT have been proposed by researchers (e.g.</p><p>RoBERTa, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Liu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">StructBERT, Wang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">and SemBERT, Zhang et al., 2020)</ref> and the core BERT model itself has been pretrained on different types of corpora (e.g. scientific publications, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beltagy et al. 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">, or biomedical data, Lee et al., 2020</ref>. However, we used the original uncased BERT 'base' model, released by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Devlin et al. (2018)</ref>. This model has 12 layers (i.e. transformer blocks and attention heads in each block) and a hidden layer size of 768, resulting in 110M parameters. It was pretrained using masked word prediction and next sentence prediction on a books corpus (800M words) and Wikipedia data (2,500M words). The base BERT model also uses WordPiece vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Wu et al., 2016)</ref> to specify representations for the individual words in the sentence. These have a 30,522 size uncased vocabulary with 'subword' vectors, that is, representations for components of words. The subword vectors are aggregated into word vectors, and combined with position vectors (which specify the position of the word in the input sequence), to generate 768-dimensional vector inputs. Input vectors are then transformed through twelve successive layers of interactive attention-based processing, which generate an emergent representation of the sentence in higher layers of the model. This sentence representation is specified using a special CLS token (short for 'classifier') which has the same dimensionality (768) as the other input vectors.</p><p>In addition to the 12 transformer layers, we also specified an output layer with two nodes (corresponding to true and false), which takes as its input the CLS vector from the final layer of the base BERT model. We subsequently fine-tuned the full model on our training dataset, which consisted of sentences (concept and feature combinations) and corresponding true and false labels. We did this using the Hugging Face BertForSequenceClassification transformers package for Pytorch <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Wolf et al., 2019)</ref>. Our model generated a classification probability for each sentence using a logistic transformation of the difference between true and false activations in the output layer. If we write the activation value of the true node as AT and that of the false node as AF, this classification probability is simply = 1 (1 + â( â ) ) â</p><p>. We used the meansquared error between this probability and the (binary) true and false labels to compute loss. Our model was trained using the Pytorch AdamW algorithm with default parameters, batch sizes of 32, and with a total of four epochs. Note that this fine-tuning exercise changed the weights of the full BERT model (i.e. all 110M parameters, including those preceding the final output layer). In this sense, we fine-tuned the 'full model'. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1E</ref> provides an overview of this model.</p><p>Below we use the model's true classification probability, PT, on our various test sentences, to measure its predictive accuracy. In some cases, we also use a variant of this output that calculates the difference between the true and false activation values on the output layer. The differences in true vs. false activation, AT -AF, lie in the range <ref type="bibr">[-10,10]</ref> for sentences tested in this paper. To scale these differences so that they are in the [0,1] range (comparable to the range of the model's classification probabilities), and easy to visualize, we simply use the formula DT = 0.5 + 0.1â¢(AT -AF). AT -AF and DT make the same binary (true/false) predictions as classification probability, PT; indeed, the logistic function applied to AT -AF to obtain classification probability is simply a monotonic transformation of AT -AF, and subsequently DT. However, unlike PT, which is typically saturated very close to 0 or 1, AT -AF and DT provide a more graded output, which we find is better at explaining certain behavioral patterns. This base BERT model is very much a 'baseline' transformer network that is used as a basis of comparison in most papers in this area. We anticipate that performance will improve with BERT's various extensions, as well as variants of BERT that are trained on even larger datasets. We were not interested in the performance of the most state-of-the-art model (which changes frequently) so we limited our analysis to the simplest model that is tested in most papers in this literature, recognizing that our results provide only a lower bound on accuracy rates that are feasible using transformer networks.</p><p>Instead of using a pre-trained BERT model, it could be possible to train BERT from scratch using only the subject-generated norms. We have avoided doing this for the following reasons. Firstly, BERT requires a large amount of data for training (billions of words), and most implementations of BERT use next-sentence prediction for pretraining. The norms data, by contrast, is many degrees of magnitude smaller and does not have sequences of sentences.</p><p>Secondly, many of our tests require out-of-sample predictions for features that use words that are not in the norms data or are only infrequently mentioned in the norms data. Overall, only 28.20%</p><p>of the target concepts used in the stimuli from our behavioral findings section are in the norms data. Likewise, only 8.56% of the features used in this stimuli set are in the norms data, only 7.67% of the sentences used in this stimuli are in the feature norms data, and only 63.98% of the unique words used in this stimuli are in the norms data. We are currently able to make good predictions for these concepts/features/words as the BERT model is pretrained on a large amount of natural language data, giving it accurate representations even if the concepts and features are not in the fine tuning data. This would likely not be the case if we excluded the pretraining step and trained BERT from scratch only on the subject-generated norms (though note that such a model would still be able to make predictions for novel words, given the flexibility of the WordPiece subword vectors in its first layer). Ultimately, humans have rich world knowledge, which they use in the service of semantic cognition. Our model thus also needs this type of knowledge in order to make good predictions. Of course, the BERT pretraining step does not mimic human learning (which likely involves other linguistic sources, as well as perceptual inputs), but it does result in the kind of knowledge representations necessary for simple semantic verification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternative Models</head><p>We compared the 'full model', introduced above, against five alternatives: The first model, which we refer to as the 'subject-object exchange control model' or the 'SOE model', utilized the above training and prediction algorithm, but excluded the false subject-object exchange sentences from the training data. Although these sentences are useful for learning asymmetries in relations (e.g. cat hunts mouse is true but mouse hunts cat is false), they can have unusual structure (e.g. fur has cat), which can bias our model's predictions. Thus, excluding these sentences, and training only on the false concept-replacement sentences, provides a useful robustness test of our full model's predictions.</p><p>The second model, which we refer to as the 'first layer model', obtains vector representations for each sentence by just averaging the non-fine-tuned BERT input vectors for each word in the sentence. In this way, this model relies on the semantic content of the sentence (rather than on its emergent meaning based on the order and interaction of words in the sentence), and can be used to test the extent to which successful prediction in BERT depends on the interactive, attention-based processing performed by each layer. However, keep in mind that BERT's input vector for a word in a given position in a sentence is the sum of its word vector and the positional vector, which allows the first layer model to possibly capture some information about order (although, as we'll see, perhaps not adequately).</p><p>For the third alternative model, referred to as the 'last layer model', we obtained vector representations for each sentence by extracting the vector representation of the CLS token from the last layer of the non-fine-tuned BERT model. Recall that CLS is a special token standardly prepended to every sentence given to BERT models used for classification or regression purposes, including our full model described above. In this model, fine tuning changes all the parameters of the model, and thus the CLS vectors generated for a given sentence depend on the fine-tuning step. By comparing the predictions of our full model against those based on the CLS vector from the non-fine-tuned BERT model, we were able to evaluate the degree to which fine tuning helps in making good predictions for semantic verification tasks. The success of the last layer model would indicate that BERT's pretraining steps are sufficient to equip it with sentence vectors that capture the sentence's truth or falsehood.</p><p>Both the first layer and the last layer models outputted 768-dimensional vector representations for sentences (recall, that 768 is the size of the hidden layer in the base BERT model). To map these representations onto true/false classifications, we trained an L2regularized logistic regression on the output vectors, using cross-validation on the training set to find the optimal regression penalty. While the full fine-tuning procedure can adjust any of the 110M parameters of the BERT model, the logistic regression step for our first layer and last layer models can only fit 768 weights and an intercept.</p><p>Our fourth model, referred to as the 'language model', computed a pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL) for every sentence using our non-fine-tuned BERT model. This was done using the mlmscoring package in Python <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Salazar et al., 2020)</ref>. PLL's essentially measure how probable the entire sentence is according to the model, and have been useful for predicting sentence acceptability judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Salazar et al., 2020</ref>; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">PadÃ³ et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Porada et al., 2019)</ref>. We therefore suspected PLL's may be useful for proxying the semantic plausibility of a sentence.</p><p>Like the previous comparison to the first layer and last layer models, comparing the full BERT model to the non-fine-tuned language model allows us to understand the relative contributions of pre-training and fine-tuning on true and false sentences.</p><p>Last, we examined a simple GloVe model <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref> which used cosine similarity between the concept and the bag-of-words feature representation in GloVe space (i.e. the average of the vectors of the words that make up the feature) to predict whether a given sentence is true or false. The specific GloVe model used in our paper was trained on a combination of Wikipedia and Gigaword corpora (total 6B words) and had a vocabulary of 400,000 words and concepts, each with a 300-dimensional vector representation. Comparing the full BERT model to this GloVe model allows us to understand the extent to which the interactive, attention-based processing of BERT improves over mere similarity between concept and feature in semantic verification. As discussed below, similarity and semantic relatedness have been implicated in previous accounts of various behavioral findings in semantic verification <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Glass et al., 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Rips et al., 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Smith et al., 1974)</ref>, but generic measures of similarity and relatedness are of course insufficient for explaining semantic verification in general (i.e., animals are cats is false although animals and cats are highly related or similar). The full BERT model may therefore go some distance towards covering this insufficiency.</p><p>The reason we used GloVe vectors rather than alternate popular vectors such as the Google News Word2Vec vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref> or even the pretrained WordPiece vectors used in the BERT model <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Wu et al., 2016)</ref> is because the GloVe model has been used in competitor models such as Feature2Vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Derby et al., 2019)</ref>, which we examine below. GloVe also emerged as the best performing model in our own prior work on associative judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bhatia, 2017)</ref>, in which we found that similarity in GloVe space predicted responses in many judgment tasks, and accounted for classic biases documented in the judgment and decision making literature. As the GloVe model specified above is nearly identical to the Derby et al.</p><p>(2019) and Bhatia (2017) models, analyzing its performance can shed light on the improvements we are making over this previous work. Additionally, it is useful to note that the WordPiece vectors used by BERT rely on subword representations. Thus, for example, these vectors might specify a representation for a word like strawberry using separate vectors for straw and berry.</p><p>Such assumptions may be convenient for transformer networks that modify word representations in multiple interactive neural network layers (using sentence context to constrain and guide representations) but are likely to yield inferior results for the type of simple semantic similarity analysis we wish to perform with our GloVe model.</p><p>To obtain semantic verification predictions from the language model's PLL output and the GloVe model's cosine similarity output we simply trained a (non-regularized) logistic regression on these outputs. In contrast to the regressions performed for the first layer and last layer models, this entails even less parameter-fitting to our training data, allowing for only a bias/intercept and a single coefficient on the PLL score or cosine similarity. It therefore does not fit a decision function to the representation of a sentence, but rather to a single metric based on predicted probability of the sentence or the semantic similarity of the concept and feature in the sentence.</p><p>Before we turn to describing the accuracy of these various models, we point the reader's attention to our OSF repository located at https://osf.io/fr4cz/, which contains data and code for the primary analyses with the full (fine-tuned) BERT model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictive Accuracy</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Tests</head><p>We began by testing the ability of our full BERT model and its five alternatives to predict the conceptual knowledge reflected in our training dataset. We did this through cross-validation:</p><p>The models were trained on various subsets of the dataset, and were evaluated in terms of their ability to predict held-out portions of the dataset.</p><p>The first of these subsets corresponded to a random sample of 90% of the observations.</p><p>Model performance was evaluated on the remaining 10% of observations. Some observations were repeated multiple times (e.g. in cases where the same feature was listed by multiple subjects), implying that the random training/test split may not have always led to strictly out-ofsample observations. In response, our second approach generated the train/test splits over the unique sentences. Thus, observations corresponding to 90% of the unique sentences were used to train the models and observations corresponding to 10% of the unique sentences were used to test the models. Note that the total number of observations in training and testing were the same as in the prior split, but now there was absolutely no overlap between the two subsets of the data.</p><p>Our third approach performed the train/test split over unique concepts. Thus, observations corresponding to 90% of the unique concepts were used to train the models and observations corresponding to 10% of the unique concepts were used to test the models. This approach tested the models on their ability to generalize their learnt information to concepts on which they had not been fine-tuned. Our fourth approach likewise performed the train/test split over unique features. This approach tested the models on their ability to generalize their learnt information to features on which they had not been fine-tuned. Our fifth approach attempted a combination of the out-of-sample concept and out-of-sample feature tests. Here we randomly selected 5% of the concepts and 5% of the features, and excluded all sentences with either these concepts or these features from our training data. This approach tested the models on their ability to generalize their learnt information to both out-of-sample concepts and out-of-sample features.</p><p>Our last set of splits examined how well the models generalized to novel domains. For this, we randomly selected three of the thirty categories (10%) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">McRae et al. (2005)</ref> and excluded all concepts in these three categories from our training data. Models were tested based on their ability to predict features for concepts in these three out-of-sample categories. We repeated these tests a second time with a different set of three randomly selected test categories, due to the small sample sizes involved. The test categories in the first split were birds, drinks, and kitchenware, and the test categories in the second split were clothing, fruits, and trees.</p><p>Below, we will average the results from these two splits to present a single out-of-sample domain accuracy statistic.</p><p>Most of the tests presented below utilize the models' binary predictions (true or false), obtained using a threshold of 0.5 for predicted true/false classification probability, PT. The results are identical if we replace the full model's probability predictions with the difference in activation measure, AT -AF, introduced above (as PT is simply a monotonic transformation of AT -AF).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accuracy Rates</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 2A</ref>, our full BERT model was able make predictions with accuracy rates of 93% for out-of-sample sentences, 97% for out-of-sample observations, 86% for out-ofsample concepts, 87% for out-of-sample features, 88% for out-of-sample concept and feature combinations, and 78% for out-of-sample domains. This model's high accuracy rate for the observations split is to be expected, as this split had overlapping test and training sentence-label</p><p>pairs, yet high accuracy rates persisted even with out-of-sample sentences. The full BERT model was also able to accurately predict the features for concepts that it hadn't seen and the concepts for features it hadn't seen. Even though accuracy rates dropped for out-of-sample domains, the full model was still able to make a correct prediction in a majority of cases. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 2A</ref> also illustrates performance across all splits for the five alternative models. For all splits, the full BERT model out-performed all five alternative models, which generally ranked as follows (from worst to best): first layer model (using only averaged non-fine-tuned BERT input vectors), GloVe similarity model (based on cosine similarity of the concept and feature), language model (relying on BERT-based pseudo-log-likelihoods for the sentence), last layer model (relying on BERT's non-fine-tuned CLS representation in the last layer) and the SOE model (identical to the full model but trained without subject-object replacement sentences). This ordering was basically consistent with our expectations, as it correlates with each model's sophistication or flexibility of sentence processing, although we expected the language model to perform better as (pseudo-)log-likelihoods of language models are sometimes thought to be capturing something about the (semantic) plausibility of a sentence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">PadÃ³ et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Porada et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 2B</ref> contains the precision, recall, and F1-scores for the full model, for all train-test splits. That precision is higher than recall suggests that the full model is conservative about judging a sentence to be true, but is generally accurate when it does so. Interestingly, it is also mostly recall that declines with more challenging train-test splits, indicating that when true test sentences are especially unfamiliar (as in out-of-sample domains) the full BERT model is biased to say they are false. It is this bias that accounts for most of the declines in accuracy with more challenging train-test splits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accuracy on Subsets of the Data</head><p>We also examined the full model's accuracy rates in the sentences cross-validation split, for various subsets of our test data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 2C</ref> shows that the full BERT's accuracy rates in predicting out-of-sample sentences persisted for each of the datasets used in this paper, although it was better at making predictions for the Van Overschelde et al. category norms than the McRae et al. and Devereux et al. feature norms. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 2C</ref> we also display accuracy as a function of the type of feature being predicted. We can see here that the full model's predictive power for out-of-sample sentences was typically higher for functional and taxonomic features (as well as for tautologies), and slightly lower for encyclopedic and perceptual features. While we are unsure why encyclopedic features would be more difficult, difficulty with perceptual features is reasonable as they are less likely to be reflected in the linguistic data on which the model was pretrained and fine-tuned. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 2C</ref> also contains the full model's accuracy as a function of the relation linking the subject with the object of the sentence (e.g., bear *is a* mammal vs cat *has* claws vs table *is made of* wood). Accuracy is generally similar across these linking relations, which may make sense in light of the fact that there's no clear ontological or semantic distinction between some of these relations, as the same proposition can be expressed with different verbs, e.g., bears are clawed vs bears have claws.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 2C</ref> displays accuracy rates for out-of-sample sentences as a function of the type of sentence: true, false with 'concept replacement' or false with 'subject-object exchange', for the full BERT model. This figure shows two key patterns. First, although model accuracy was high for both true and false sentences, the model was slightly better able to recognize when a given sentence was false than when it was true (which is consistent with our results on precision and recall). Second, higher accuracy rates were obtained for 'subject-object exchange' sentences than for 'concept replacement' sentences. This result indicates that the full BERT model can pick up aspects of word order, allowing it to represent asymmetries in relations between concepts (i.e. differences between cat hunts mouse and mouse hunts cat).</p><p>Although not shown here, the above patterns were nearly identical for other crossvalidation splits which tested the full model on out-of-sample observations, concepts, features, and domains, rather than just out-of-sample sentences. These patterns also persisted for our model variants, that is, the relative accuracies for different subsets of the test data were the same (though of course the absolute accuracy rates for these alternative models were lower). One pattern that did not persist for the SOE and GloVe similarity models involved high accuracy on the subject-object exchange sentences. Recall that the SOE model was not trained on these sentences, even though the test data contained such sentences. Although this model achieved good accuracy rates overall, its accuracy for false subject-object exchange test sentences was only 0.58. Thus, it seems that subject-object exchange training data is necessary to teach the BERT model how to handle relational asymmetry. Likewise, the GloVe model relies purely on a symmetric measure of similarity between the concept and feature representation, and was thus also not able to handle relational asymmetry. In fact, GloVe's accuracy rate for these sentences was 0.44, which is below chance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>False Positive Bias</head><p>Having established the generally high accuracy of our model in predicting truth and falseness in out-of-sample sentences, we now turn to various tests we conducted to better understand the conditions or factors influencing our full BERT model's performance. As above, we limit our results to only our cross-validation splits involving out-of-sample sentences.</p><p>First, one might be concerned that the 1:1 ratio of true and false sentences in our train set induces a false positive bias in the model since most possible sentences are false. To examine this possibility, we varied the ratio of true to false sentences in the train set while keeping the 1:1 ratio in the test sets. We tried training set ratios of 1:1 as before, as well as 1:2 and 1:3. The training sets used were subsets of the original training dataset used above. We equated the size of the training set across all training set ratios, while maximizing the total training set available, resulting in a total of approximately 295,000 training observations in these three tests. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3A</ref> shows the resulting accuracies and false positive rates for out-of-sample sentences for the BERT model. Here we can see that accuracy only declined slightly (no more than 4% in absolute terms)</p><p>with increasing proportions of false sentences. Moreover, while the false positive rate did decrease with lower proportions of true sentences in the training set, the decrease was modest (no more than 4% in absolute terms). Although not shown here, these patterns were nearly identical for cross-validation splits with out-of-sample observations, concepts, features, and domains.</p><p>For a second related test, we paired all the concepts used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rosch (1975)</ref> with features that were generated at least three times by subjects in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Devereux et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">McRae et al. (2005)</ref> datasets. This test involved 560 concepts, 4,654 features, and roughly 2.6 million sentences (concept-feature pairs). Since concepts and features are fully crossed, we would expect the vast majority of sentences generated this way to be false. Indeed, we found that our full BERT model trained on the entire training set (which contains an equal proportion of true and false sentences) classified only 5.26% of these sentences as true. Both of these tests suggest that our model does not contain a large false positive bias, despite being trained on an equal number of true and false sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlates of Model Judgment</head><p>Next, we examined how our full BERT model's prediction depended on variables at the word, feature, or concept-feature level. Again, we focused on our cross-validation split for out-of-sample sentences. First, we examined the influence of word frequency on model prediction, under the reasoning that BERT (like people) may be more likely to judge as true, sentences involving words it saw more often during pre-training (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Goldstein &amp; Gigerenzer, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hertwig et al., 2008)</ref>. For each sentence, we extracted each word's estimate of log frequency from the SUBTLEX-US norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brysbaert &amp; New, 2009)</ref>, and averaged over every word in a sentence (excluding stop words like the or a). Sentences with one or more words missing frequency estimates were dropped from subsequent analysis. We then Spearman correlated each sentence's average word frequency with the model's predicted activation difference AT -AF (this is the same as the Spearman correlation with PT, which is a monotonic transformation of AT -AF). As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3B</ref>, this correlation was close to zero, suggesting no effect of frequency on model prediction. One might also have expected that frequency shouldn't make the model more likely to output 'true', but should make the model more accurate, under the reasoning that BERT would be more competent at processing words it had seen more during pre-training (and hence these words would have greater influence on BERT's parameters). However, a null effect was also obtained when we correlated frequency with the model's likelihood of the correct answer (or with AT -AF when the sentence is true and AF -AT when the sentence is false). We are unsure why this null effect arises, although it may simply be that, since our sentences are generated from feature and category norms which generally focus on common concepts and features, there might not be big enough variation in the frequencies of the concepts and features that are in our tests.</p><p>Next, we examined the impact of variables provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">McRae et al. (2005)</ref> in their feature norms: (a) distinctiveness, which is the inverse of the number of concepts for which a feature was listed, (b) production frequency, which is the number of subjects out of a possible 30 who listed a given feature for a given concept, (c) intercorrelational strength of a given feature for a given concept, which is calculated by summing the proportion of shared variance between a feature and each of the other features of a given concept with which it is significantly correlated, and (d) cue validity, which is the conditional probability of a concept given a feature, i.e., p(concept|feature). See McRae et al. for more discussion of these variables. Note that the first variable, distinctiveness, is unique to a feature, while the latter three are unique to a conceptfeature pair. Therefore, the latter three variables are usually only available for concept-feature pairs actually generated by subjects, and so correlating these properties with model predictions is generally only possible for sentences labeled as true. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3B</ref> thus contains the Spearman correlations between these variables and the full model's activation differences (AT -AF) for out-of-sample true sentences. Feature distinctiveness had a negative correlation, suggesting BERT is less likely to say a (concept, feature) pair is true if the feature is rare. If feature distinctiveness in the norms tracks the frequency of a feature in the world, then this is rational to some extent, since rare features will, in general, be less likely to be true of any concept than are common features. Production frequency, on the other hand, had a positive correlation with BERT's probability of true. This is also sensible: BERT is likely to judge a concept-feature pair as true if that feature is given for that concept often.</p><p>Intercorrelational strength had a very small positive correlation, consistent with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">McRae et al. (1997)</ref> discussed below. Finally, cue validity had a near zero correlation. We are unsure why this may be the case, and leave a detailed examination of this issue for future work.</p><p>The last potential correlate of prediction that we examined was the GloVe similarity between a concept and the feature (averaging over words in a feature, as we did for the GloVe similarity model). As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3B</ref>, we found that the model's continuous activation difference (AT -AF) had a positive Spearman correlation with the GloVe-based similarity between concept and feature. This indicates that BERT may to some extent be relying on similarity as a heuristic for truth in semantic verification. This is consistent with prior work on semantic judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Glass et al., 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Smith et al., 1974)</ref>. It is also consistent with work on high-level judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bhatia, 2017</ref>; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Evans, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kahneman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sloman, 1996)</ref>,</p><p>which finds that such a heuristic, although quite useful in many settings, as features that are true of concepts are often semantically related to the concepts, can lead to occasional judgment errors.</p><p>Although not shown here, the above patterns are largely consistent across different crossvalidation splits, except for the positive correlation with intercorrelation strength (which does not emerge for out-of-sample domains).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Errors</head><p>We also examined the five true (i.e. subject-generated) sentences with the highest false activationi.e. sentences that BERT thought were false, but were actually generated by our subjects (and thus have the label true). These sentences are belt drives an engine, beta is a fish, watch has needles, corn is a snake, and premium is a fuel. It seems that BERT makes mistakes when sentences involve atypical uses of words and word disambiguation issues (which may also lead human subjects to judge these as false, on occasion). Likewise, the false (i.e. non-subject generated) sentences with the highest true activation are axe is made of metal, sofa is a chair, rabbit is a mammal, house is a house, and woodpecker has a beak. These are sentences that BERT thought were true, but were generated by our 'concept replacement' algorithm (and thus have the label false). As can be seen here, these are all actually true sentences about the world, indicating that the accuracy rates shown above may underestimate BERT's ability to predict the features that people associate with concepts.</p><p>To further explore the possibility that in some sense we underestimate BERT's accuracy, we asked 19 subjects (Mage = 28 years, SDage= 12 years, 52% Female) on Prolific Academic to judge the truth of 100 of our sentences labeled as false. The sentences labeled as false but with the highest model-based probability of truth (e.g., sofa is a chair) formed half of this set, and the sentences labeled as false but with the lowest model-based probability of truth (e.g., jacket is a stair) formed the other half. These stimuli were generated from just the McRae et al. sentences, we excluded all subject-object exchange sentences, and we slightly adjusted the grammar of each sentence so that it became grammatical to a human reader.</p><p>Overall, subjects were generally likely to judge the former set as true, and the latter set as false. A mixed effects logistic regression of subject judgment with fixed effects for the modelbased probability of the sentence being true, and random intercepts for subject and sentence, confirmed this (p &lt; 0.001). More simply, on average the high probability sentences were judged as true by 78% of subjects and the low probability sentences as true by 10% of subjects. The fact that so many of our high probability 'false' sentences may actually be true again suggests that our reported accuracy rates may be underestimates in certain respects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Confidence</head><p>In a related test of model errors, we wished to examine how our full BERT model's accuracy rates varied based on the strength of its predictions, that is, its confidence. For this purpose, we calculated accuracy as a function of the model's predictions for the test data in our sentences cross-validation split. Here we took the absolute value of the model's activation difference, |AT -AF|, in order to quantify confidence, and further pooled observations based on a decile split of these absolute activation difference values. Accuracy rates for each decile split for out-of-sample sentences are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3C</ref>. Here we can see that BERT was more likely to respond accurately if assigned a high activation to the sentence being true relative to false or false relative to true. In other words, BERT was less likely to have strong responses for conceptfeature pairs it was likely to get wrong.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relation-Sensitive Representations</head><p>In our final diagnostic test, we examined how different relations influenced the full BERT model's representation of concepts in the subject position of a sentence. Whereas distributed semantics models like GloVe only have a single vector for a given word regardless of sentence context, BERT is able to provide contextualized representations for a given word, such that the representation for dog in dog has is different from that in dog can. Of course, this is reminiscent of classic connectionist models of semantic cognition. For example, <ref type="bibr">McClelland (2004, 2008)</ref> found that, in their trained neural network for predicting features, the hidden layer representations of living things shifted depending on whether they were joined with can or is. In particular, the context of can collapsed differences among plantsrelative to their contextless representation in an earlier layersince as far as their network knew, the only thing plants can do, is grow (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 11</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Rogers and McClelland, 2008</ref> for more). We thus sought to see if similar behavior arose in our full BERT model.</p><p>First, we computed similarities among all pairs of the 541 concepts in the McRae feature norms twice, once for features containing the is relation (is an animal, is furry, etc.) and once for features containing the has relation (has claws, has wooden legs) (we chose is and has simply because they were the most common relations). These similarities were simply calculated as the cosine similarity between two concepts' feature vectors, where the entries of each vector were the production frequency for that (concept, feature) pair. Second, we extracted our full BERT model's (trained on the entire training data) final hidden layer representation for each concept twice, once in the context of is (e.g. dog is) and once in the context of has (e.g. dog has). We then calculated cosine similarity among concept representations in the same context. As predicted, norm-based similarities among is features correlated better with BERT-based similarities in the context of is than with has (correlation of 0.15 relative to 0.09), whereas normbased similarities among has features correlated better with BERT-based similarities in the context of has than with is (correlation of 0.11 relative to 0.09). This suggests that, like its predecessor connectionist models, BERT is able to appropriately shift a concept's internal representation given the relation with which it is paired. This, in turn, allows BERT to predict that 'similar' concepts have similar features, but only when 'similarity' is with respect to particular relations linking concept and feature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison with Feature2Vec</head><p>We are not the first to fine-tune a distributed semantic model using subject-generated feature norms. In recent work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Derby et al. (2019)</ref>   Feature2Vec outperformed the PLSR approach. These results indicate that BERT has similar performance to Feature2Vec in the settings in which Feature2Vec performs well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We have trained and tested BERT on feature and category norms data. Each prediction involved an assessment of whether a given concept and feature combination was generated by human participants (e.g. cat has fur) or whether it was generated by our 'concept replacement' (e.g. tractor has fur) or 'subject-object exchange' (e.g. fur has cat) algorithms. As the participants typically generated features that were true of the concept and our 'concept replacement' and 'subject-object exchange' algorithms typically generated features that were false for the concept, the task can be equivalently be seen as involving semantic verificationthat is truth or falsehood judgments for simple natural language propositions composed of common concepts and features.</p><p>We have found that our full BERT model was able to make accurate predictions, even with the most demanding train-test splits involving out-of-sample domains. Our full BERT models' reported accuracy rates may to some degree actually be underestimates, since many of our generated 'false' sentences that the model predicted to be true, were also judged as true by human subjects, and conversely, some sentences our model 'incorrectly' but confidently labeled as false seem likely to mislead human subjects as well (since they involve rare word senses).</p><p>Despite being trained on equal numbers of false and true sentences (while most possible sentences are actually false), two separate tests revealed that this did not give our fine-tuned BERT model a strong false positive bias. Moreover, this model's precision was higher than its recall, suggesting that its errors were more driven by being overly conservative in judging true sentences as true.</p><p>We conducted various tests exploring the settings and factors influencing our full model's performance. We found that the model's predictive power persisted for all three datasets, for the different types of features and relations in these datasets, for true sentences, and for the two types of false sentences. However, BERT did better on category norms, non-perceptual features, and false sentences involving 'subject object exchange', although we did find that these latter sentences were harder to predict correctly when the model was not trained on them (as was the case with the SOE model). Predictive power also was higher when BERT had higher absolute activation values, and was thus more confident in its beliefs. Our full model thought that a sentence was likelier to be true when the feature was less distinctive (more common) according to feature norms, when the feature was listed more often for that concept in feature norms, and when the concept and feature had high GloVe similarity. The first two findings show that BERT's predictions sensibly track underlying feature and concept statistics. This last finding suggests that BERT may be using similarity as a heuristic, consistent with prior work on both semantic verification <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Glass et al., 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Smith et al., 1974)</ref> and high-level human judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bhatia, 2017</ref>; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Evans, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kahneman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sloman, 1996)</ref>. Finally, we found that BERT appropriately adjusted a concept's internal representation given the relation with which it was paired, much like earlier connectionist models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Rogers &amp; McClelland, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, 2008</ref>.</p><p>We compared our full fine-tuned BERT model against several alternative models, ranging from concept-feature GloVe similarity to logistic regression trained on final layer pretrained BERT representations. Our full model was better than all of these alternatives. The full BERT model also equaled the accuracy rates of Feature2Vec on out-of-sample concepts, implying that it retains the benefits of previous models that use feature norms to fine-tune distributed semantic representations.</p><p>The superiority of the full model over all of these alternatives leads to two conclusions regarding the source of its sucesses. First, the multi-layer, interactive, attention-based processing of BERT adds considerable power over both purely similarity-based processing of GloVe or Feature2Vec, and simply finding a decision boundary in the input vector space which retains only the most rudimentary information about word order. Second, the full BERT model's success comes from not just pre-training on a generic objective like masked word prediction or next sentence prediction on large language corpora, but also on fine-tuning all its parameters to the specific task of judging sentences to be true or false using psychological data. In other words, the highest levels of performance are achieved not just from adjusting a decision function on a pre-trained representation of a sentence, but also from learning the optimal representation of the sentence itself. That said, it is useful to note that the last layer model performed reasonably (and was far superior to the GloVe similarity, first layer, and language models), indicating BERT's pretrained final layer vector representations do contain a significant amount of information about the sentence's truth or falsehood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patterns of Semantic Cognition</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Tests</head><p>We also tested whether our full BERT model was able to generate well-known behavioral patterns in semantic cognition. Its ability to make predictions for truly out-of-sample concepts, features, and domains, allowed us to perform such tests using original stimuli from the papers that first documented these patterns. Such tests are crucial for evaluating the degree to which BERT's accuracy rates go beyond just predicting whether a feature is true of a concept, and extend to predicting response times, typicality ratings, and other patterns associated with psychological data. Transformer networks are highly flexible, and perform well at most natural language processing tasks if trained on appropriate data. Thus, it may not be particularly surprising that a BERT model trained on category and feature norms data can learn to predict these data with high accuracy. But if this model is also able to account for additional behavioral patterns (that are not directly present in the data on which it was trained), then we may be able to conclude that its learnt representations, and processes for mapping these representations onto semantic judgments, closely resemble those used by humans.</p><p>We tested BERT on stimuli sets from twenty-three different experiments, corresponding to the sixteen different behavioral patterns shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. We obtained these stimuli sets from published papers that gave examples of the experimental stimuli in the paper. We used every stimuli set involving real-world conceptual knowledge that we were able find. We excluded semantic cognition tasks with artificial concepts or features. We also excluded tasks in which participants were asked to evaluate naturalistic propositions based on previously presented information (e.g. tasks in which participants first read a story and then evaluated whether statements about the story were true or false). Additionally, some seminal publications and The BERT model used for our tests was trained on the full category and feature norms dataset described in the Implementational Details section. This had 491,284 sentences with true and false labels, pertaining to 2,066 unique concepts and 29,048 unique features. This model was tested on existing stimuli sets by manually transforming concept-feature pairs into natural language sentences, and calculating BERT's predicted classification probability (of true vs. false), PT, for these sentences. We compared the full BERT model to the SOE model, the first layer model, the last layer model, the language model, and the GloVe similarity model introduced above. These were also trained on the full category and feature norms datasets (in the case of all models except for SOE, this only involved fitting the weights of a logistic regression model), and tested based on their classification probabilities for sentences in existing stimuli sets.</p><p>Finally, we also evaluated the full BERT model based on its predicted activation differences for true vs. false responses, AT -AF (visualized through the normalized measure DT). Thus, in for judging a sentence to be true or false.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response Times in Semantic Verification</head><p>Effect 1: Collins and Quillian (1969) Experiments 1 and 2. We began by testing our models' predictions for concept and feature pairs used in <ref type="bibr">Collins and Quillian's seminal (1969)</ref> paper. In this paper Collins and Quillian argued that semantic memory was organized hierarchically, and that features were only stored at the highest level possible. For example, the feature is an animal would only be associated with bird, and not canary. Thus, to evaluate canary is a bird, one would first need to check whether canaries are animals, before moving up the hierarchy to check whether birds are animals. This generated the prediction that it would take longer for participants to verify canary is an animal than canary is a bird. Likewise, it would take longer for participants to verify canary has skin than canary has wings (because skin is associated with animals, while wings are associated with birds). Our BERT model does not involve explicit hierarchical organization, but may nonetheless be able to generate these patterns.</p><p>This can be tested by assuming that the response time when responding true to a true sentence is proportional to BERT's prediction for true.</p><p>The stimuli we used to test this pattern were taken directly from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1</ref> of <ref type="bibr">Collins and</ref> Quillian. This highly reproduced figure presents a hypothetical three-level semantic network with seven concepts (animal, bird, fish, canary, ostrich, shark, and salmon) and two to four features per concept. The concepts and features in this figure yield 73 distinct true sentences, spanning the three levels of the hierarchy. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1</ref> can also be used to generate false sentences.</p><p>For this we swapped out features of a concept with other concepts at the same level of the hierarchy. Thus, for example, features of bird were attached to fish (e.g. fish has wings) and vice versa (e.g. bird has fins). In addition to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1</ref>, we also used the stimuli presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 1</ref>  In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 4A</ref> we show the full BERT model's average predictions for sentences at each level of the hierarchy in the above stimuli. Here we can see that BERT was able to capture the Collins and Quillian effect, with lower predictions for sentences involving higher levels of the hierarchies. BERT also correctly judged most false sentences to be false and true sentences as true (though note that some Level-2 sentences were incorrectly judged to be false). These results are largely insensitive to whether we measure prediction using classification probability or difference in activation (note that this figure, and all subsequent figures plot DT = 0.5 + 0.1â¢(AT -AF) rather than AT -AF, to keep the y-axis on the 0-1 scale of probabilities). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 4A</ref> also presents analogous results for the five model variants. Here we see that the SOE model mimicked the predictions of the full BERT model and was able to successfully describe the data.</p><p>The last layer and GloVe similarity models also captured some of the level-of-hierarchy effects, but did so imperfectly. Specifically, the last layer model assigned equivalent predictions to Level 0 and Level 1 sentences, and fairly high predictions (probabilities around 0.5) to false sentence.</p><p>The GloVe model likewise assigned high predictions to false sentences, and in fact gave these sentences higher predictions than Level 2 sentences. In this way, these alternate models were unable to distinguish true from false sentences. Finally, the first layer model and language model were unable to capture these patterns, and assigned all levels roughly similar predictions.</p><p>We examined the full BERT model's predictions more rigorously by regressing activation differences, AT -AF, on level-of-hierarchy for true sentences. Our regressions also included fixed effects for sentence type (i.e. whether it involved category membership, e.g. is an animal, or not, e.g. has wings). These regressions revealed a statistically significant negative made by several researchers shortly after the publication of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Collins and Quillian (1969)</ref>. Out of these <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Rips et al. (1973)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Smith et al. (1974)</ref> showed that the effects predicted by <ref type="bibr">Collins and</ref> Quillian's theory could be reversed for certain categories based on the semantic relatedness of the categories and their exemplars. Thus, even though canary is a bird was verified more quickly than canary is an animal, <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Rips et al. (1973)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Smith et al. (1974)</ref> found that sentences like bear is a mammal were verified more slowly than bear is an animal.</p><p>To see if our models were able to capture these reversals, we applied them to <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2 of</ref> Rips et al., which summarizes the stimuli from Experiment 1 of their paper. These stimuli involve 12 birds (e.g. blue jay, cardinal), 12 mammals (e.g. bear, cat), and 12 car brands (e.g.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cadillac, Continental).</head><p>Participants were asked whether each of these concepts belonged to one of two superordinate categories: bird and animal, mammal and animal, and car and vehicle respectively. The first of these is a Level 1 category, whereas the second of is a Level 2 category.</p><p>Rips et al. found that response times were faster for Level 1 categories in the case of bird and car, but slower in the case of mammal. In total, the experiment involved 72 different sentences, generated by pairing the 36 concepts with each of the two superordinate categories.</p><p>Figures 4B, C and D show that our full BERT model captured these patterns.</p><p>Specifically, it gave higher activations and probabilities for Level 1 categories relative to Level 2 categories for bird and car, but not for mammal (though note that the differences for mammal are fairly minor, as the model's predictions are saturated very close to 1). We obtained similar results for the SOE model and the GloVe similarity model, whereas the remaining models failed to capture the observed effects.</p><p>To rigorously test for a statistically significant shift between bird and mammal we regressed BERT activation difference, AT -AF, on category level (Level 1 or Level 2), Level 1 category name (bird or mammal), and their interaction. We found a statistically significant negative interaction (Î² = -3.73, t(48) = -3.32, p &lt; 0.01, 95% CI = [-5.99, -1.47]) indicating that BERT does capture the reduction in the level-of-hierarchy effect for mammal relative to bird.</p><p>We also performed a similar set of tests using stimuli from <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Smith et al. (1974)</ref>.</p><p>This 2), and their interaction, revealed a marginally significant negative interaction (Î² = -4.20, t(52) = -1.95, p = 0.06, 95% CI = [-8.53, -0.12]). concerned with response times in semantic verification tasks in which the statements are true (although <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Smith et al. (1974)</ref> did test for semantic relatedness effects in false sentences, they did not provide their stimuli for these tests in their paper). <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Glass et al. (1974)</ref>, in contrast, documented semantic relatedness effects for both true and false sentences, and also provided examples of the stimuli used in their tests. <ref type="bibr">Glass et al.</ref> found that participants were quicker to accept true sentences in which the concepts and features were semantically related, but slower to reject false sentences in which the concepts and features were related. Thus, semantic relatedness facilitates the verification of true sentences but inhibits the falsification of false sentences.</p><p>To test if our models were able to capture this pattern, we used the stimuli presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Glass et al. (1974)</ref>.  <ref type="figure">Figure 5A</ref> shows model predictions for true and false sentences involving related and unrelated categories or features. Here we see that the full BERT model generated higher probabilities and activation differences for true related sentences than true unrelated sentences, capturing the finding that true related sentences are verified more quickly than true unrelated sentences. Likewise, this model generated lower probabilities and activation differences for false related sentences than false unrelated sentences, capturing the finding that false related sentences are verified slower than false unrelated sentences. Additionally, although true unrelated sentences had predictions close to 0.5 (indicating that BERT sometimes judged them to be false), true activation was always higher than false activation.</p><p>We obtained the same results for the SOE model, but not for the remaining models. Some of the remaining models failed to distinguish between true and false sentences, whereas others were insensitive to semantic relatedness. We further tested the predictions of the full BERT model by regressing the absolute activation difference (|AT -AF|) for each sentence on main effects for truth value (true or false), semantic relatedness (related or unrelated), sentence type (category membership or features), as well as the interaction between truth value and relatedness.</p><p>Absolute activation corresponds to the strength of BERT's beliefs and should be proportional to response time. As expected we observed a significantly positive interaction effect (Î² = 3.87, t predicted both by the response times for the verification of the concept on the true superordinate category and the response times for the superordinate category falsification, providing support for their hypothesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson and Reder (1974)</ref> provided the full set of concepts, as well as false superordinate categories (which they referred to as negative categories) and true superordinate categories (which they referred to as positive categories) in their appendix. There were a total of 82 concepts, with 41 positive and 41 negative categories, spanning a diverse set of domains (including buildings, materials, vehicles, weapons, plants, furniture, and beverages).</p><p>This generated a total of 246 sentences.</p><p>We extracted these sentences from the appendix and attempted to replicate <ref type="bibr">Anderson and</ref> Reder's findings using our six models. Specifically, for each target concept, positive category, and negative category, we calculated model predictions for the sentences generated for the concept/negative category pair (i.e. the original sentence, e.g. tent is a metal), the concept/positive category pair (i.e. the superordinate category verification, e.g. tent is a dwelling), and the positive category/negative category pair (i.e. the superordinate category falsification, e.g. dwelling is a metal). <ref type="figure">Figure 5B</ref> shows average model predictions for these three sets. Here we see that the full BERT model was once again able to successfully falsify the concept/negative category and positive category/negative category sentences, and verify the concept/positive category sentences. This was also the case with the SOE model and the last layer model. The language model and GloVe similarity did typically give lower predictions to the concept/negative category sentences and positive category/negative category sentences than the concept/positive category sentences, but did not correctly assign the false sentences predictions less than 0.5. The first layer model again completely failed at capturing the results.</p><p>To predict the response time relationships observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson and Reder (1974)</ref>  work <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Glass et al., 1974)</ref>, which showed that semantic relatedness increased response times for false sentences, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Glass et al. (1979)</ref> found that participants were typically quicker to falsify direct antonyms (e.g. boy-girl) than indirect antonyms (e.g. boy-sister). We obtained the stimuli used by <ref type="bibr">Glass et al.</ref> in Experiment 1 of their paper from their <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 1</ref>. These stimuli involved 12 direct antonym pairs and 12 indirect antonym pairs, totaling 24 pairs. In all cases stimuli involved gender-based social categories, and antonyms were constructed by pairing male and female categories with each other. Sentences generated using these word pairs were prefixed with all and some quantifiers. However, as these quantifiers did not influence Glass et al.'s results, we excluded them from our tests. Thus, we tested sentences like boys are girls or boys are sisters rather than all boys are girls or all boys are sisters.</p><p>We were unable to capture the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Glass et al. (1979)</ref>. Specifically, both the full BERT model and its competitors considered direct antonyms to be more likely to be true than indirect antonyms. This is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5C</ref>. Here we can see that BERT generated very strong negative activation for indirect antonyms, but neutral activation for direct antonyms.</p><p>Thus, although it was able to correctly falsify indirect antonyms, it sometimes considered direct antonyms to be true. This was also the case for the SOE model. The remaining models additionally failed at classifying the sentences as false. We also regressed absolute BERT activation difference (|AT -AF|) on a binary variable indicating whether the sentence was a direct or indirect antonym and found a significant positive effect of direct antonym for both models (Î² = 8.84, t(24) = 5.13, p = &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[5.26,12.41]</ref>, showing that this model behaved according to the semantic relatedness effect documented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Glass et al.

Hampton presented the stimuli used for these tests in the appendix of his paper. These stimuli involved 115 concepts, each with a true superordinate category, a true feature, a false superordinate category, and a false feature. This generated 460 distinct sentences that were used in Experiment 1 and 2 of the paper.</p><p>The properties and features were obtained from an existing feature norms dataset and were matched in terms of production frequency. They spanned a large set of domains, including trees, vehicles, foods, sports, weapons, and animals. <ref type="figure">Figure 5D</ref> shows model predictions for the four types of sentences used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hampton (1984)</ref>. Here we see that the full BERT model gave higher probabilities and activations to true category membership sentences than true feature sentences, as well as lower probabilities and activations to false category membership sentences than false feature sentences (though effects appear small for the false sentences as predictions are saturated close to 0). The SOE model and the last layer model also captured this effect. The remaining models failed at capturing the full set of effects, and sometimes had difficulties distinguishing true from false sentences.</p><p>Interestingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Collins &amp; Quillian (1969)</ref> also found that participants were quicker to verify true statements about category membership than true statements about features but and quicker to falsify false statements about category membership than false statements about features. Even though their stimuli were not designed to rigorously test for this effect, and this effect was not the central focus of their paper, we nonetheless tried to replicate the above results using their stimuli. For this purpose, we once again obtained the true and false sentences from Experiments 1 and 2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Collins &amp; Quillian (1969)</ref>, presented in their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 1</ref>, and used in our analysis of Effect 1 above. Our model predictions for these sentences are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5E</ref>. Here we once again find that the full BERT model captured the effect by giving true statements about category membership higher probabilities and activations than true statements about features, and giving false statements about category membership lower activations than false statements about features. The SOE model closely mimicked these predictions. Although the last layer model also captured these effects, and was able to explain the <ref type="bibr">Hamton (1984)</ref> results in <ref type="figure">Figure 5D</ref>, it did not correctly falsify false feature sentences. The remaining models failed to capture these effects and often had difficulties distinguishing true from false.</p><p>To test the above effects more rigorously we regressed absolute BERT activation difference (|AT -AF|) on binary variables indicating whether the sentences involved category membership or feature judgments, with a control for the truth value of the sentence.

The SOE model, last layer model, and language model also captured these effects, whereas the remaining two models did not. We tested the full model's predictions more formally by regressing BERT activation difference (AT -AF) on a binary variable for strong vs. weak concepts. This regression revealed a significant effect (Î² = 0.64, t(74) = 1.99, p = &lt; 0.05, 95% CI = [0.00,1.27] for BERT).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Typicality Ratings for Concepts and Categories</head><p>Effect 8: Rosch (1975) Experiment 1. We also attempted to use our models to study typicality effects in conceptual knowledge. It is well known that exemplars vary based on how representative they are of the category, a property of human cognition that can account for some of the semantic relatedness effects discussed above <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Glass et al., 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Rips et al., 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Smith et al., 1974)</ref>. Although BERT does not explicitly represent concepts in terms of typicality on a superordinate category, we expected that its representations would implicitly reflect typicality relationships, which could, in turn, explain behavioral patterns attributed to typicality. We began by testing our models on the typicality ratings dataset collected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rosch (1975)</ref> in Experiment 1, and presented in the appendix of the paper. This dataset involves 560 goodness-of-example ratings for exemplars taken from ten semantic categories: birds, carpenter <ref type="bibr">'s tools, clothing, fruit, furniture, sports, toys, vegetables, vehicles, and weapons</ref>. We used these exemplars and categories to generate 560 category membership sentences (e.g. robin is a bird, penguin is a bird, etc.), which we offered to our BERT model. We correlated its predictions for these sentences with typicality rankings (higher rank indicates more typical exemplars) for these sentences, separately for each of the ten categories, and then averaged the correlations across the ten categories to get a single measure of model performance.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 6A</ref>, we can see that the full BERT model's classification probabilities and activation differences both had positive average correlations with typicality rankings, though the latter achieved somewhat better predictions (with an average correlation of 0.32 across the ten categories). <ref type="figure">Figure 6A</ref> also shows average correlations for other models. Again, we see that SOE</p><p>closely mimicked our full model's predictions. We can also see that the last layer model achieved good correlations and that both the GloVe similarity and language models had moderate correlations, though these were lower than the full model's correlations. Once again, the first layer model completely failed to predict the results.</p><p>Why are the observed correlation rates not higher, given the fact that typicality is a key variable in human semantic cognition that should be easily captured both by simple semantic relatedness models like GloVe and modern extensions like BERT? Here it is useful to note that the above statistics reflect averaged correlations across categories. There is some variability in model accuracy across categories. Categories for which predicted correlations were low (such as sports, for which we achieved r = 0.10) usually have many exemplars that are fairly typical and a few that are highly atypical (e.g. dancing, checkers). Computing correlations on continuous scales (e.g. BERT's output predictions and subject's typicality rating scores) thus lead to weaker correlations. By contrast, categories for which predicted correlations were high (such as clothing,</p><p>for which we achieved r = 0.70) usually have a more graded distribution of typicality (e.g. some clothes are highly typical, some are moderately typical, and some are atypical), allowing for higher predictive accuracy rates. weather phenomena), and the appendix of their paper has data for both typicality ratings as well as inconsistency statistics for each exemplar-category pair. We began by first predicting typicality ratings. Here, as with the tests for <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rosch (1975)</ref>, we measured our full BERT model's predictions for sentences composed of the exemplar-category pairs, and computed average correlations with subject ratings for exemplars in the 18 categories. These average correlations are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6B</ref>. Again, we see that the model's probability and activations correlated highly with subject ratings, though the latter were slightly higher (average correlation of 0.58 across the 18 categories). The average correlation achieved by the SOE model were nearly identical, and the correlations for the remaining models were lower (with relative effects similar to the data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rosch (1975)</ref>). Note that the correlations presented here are higher than those for the <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rosch (1975</ref><ref type="bibr">) data, as McCloskey &amp; Glucksberg (1978</ref>  We also found that the full BERT model was able to predict participant inconsistencies.</p><p>To test this, we first calculated absolute BERT probabilities (|PT -0.5|) and activation differences (|AT -AF|), and found that both metrics correlated negatively with the proportion of inconsistent participant responses for sentences for most categories. These correlations (averaged across categories) are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6C</ref>. Again, activation differences were more predictive, achieving an average correlation of -0.15 for the 18 categories. The SOE, last layer, and GloVe similarity models were able to capture this pattern, whereas the first layer and language models were not. We suspect that the correlations here were not as high as those for typicality ratings, because McCloskey &amp; Glucksberg's inconsistency dataset involved only 30 subjects per ratings.</p><p>Thus, observed measures of inconsistency on a trial level were likely to be very noisy. This implies that there is lots of unsystematic variance in the data that we are trying to explain, reducing our accuracy rates.</p><p>Effect 10: Hampton (1982) Experiments 1 and 2. In related work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hampton (1982)</ref> examined intransitives in category membership judgments. Most theories that propose a hierarchical structure to the organization of semantic memory assume that the relations between sets of concepts involve class inclusion, which necessarily satisfies transitivity. Thus, if X is a member of category Y and Y is a member of category Z, X must also be a member of category Z. Our tests showed that the full BERT model's probabilities and activations both correlated with intransitivity rates, but that activations once again outperformed probabilities in terms of predictive accuracy (with a correlation of 0.37). This is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6D</ref>. We again obtained identical results for the SOE model. Unlike our previous tests, most of our remaining models also achieved moderate positive correlations.</p><p>Effect 11: Roth and Mervis (1983) Experiments 2 and 3. In response to the finding that typicality plays a role in semantic organization, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">McCloskey and Glucksberg (1978)</ref> and many others <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Osherson &amp; Smith, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Lakoff, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Zadeh, 1982)</ref> advanced 'fuzzy set theory', which is a formal approach to describing relations of typicality across categories. One prediction of fuzzy set theory is that the typicality of an exemplar for a remote superordinate category (indirect hypernym) cannot be higher than the typicality of the exemplar for a close superordinate category (direct hypernym). Roth and Mervis showed that this prediction is violated, and that there are concepts (e.g. pie) that are more typical of remote superordinate categories (e.g. dessert) than close superordinates (e.g. pastry). In many ways, this is a corollary to Hampton's findings discussed above, in which some concepts are more likely to be seen as members of close superordinate categories than remote superordinates. Overall, Roth and Mervis concluded that fuzzy set theory cannot provide a good account of concept typicality.</p><p>Although <ref type="bibr">Roth and</ref> Mervis replicated their finding with many different experiments, their paper only presented the stimuli used in Experiment 2 and 3 (in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> and 3 respectively). In these experiments, Roth and Mervis asked participants to give typicality ratings for two types of items on both close and remote superordinate categories. Type 1 items (e.g. strudel) were those that were predicted to have higher typicality for the close (e.g. pastry) rather than the remote (e.g. dessert) superordinate, whereas Type 2 items (e.g. pie) were predicted to generate the opposite pattern. The results of Experiments 2 and 3 verified these predictions. There were a total of 12 Type 1 and 2 pairs (e.g. strudel-pastry) in each experiment. As each item was rated on two superordinate categories, this generated a total of 96 sentences across the two experiments.</p><p>The categories included musical instruments, drinks, car brands, flowers, precious stones, and fruits.</p><p>We offered the sentences to the full BERT model, whose average probabilities and activations on the Type 1 close, Type 1 remote, Type 2 close and Type 2 remote superordinates are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5G</ref>. Here we can see that BERT generated higher predictions for Type 1 close sentences than Type 1 remote sentences. In contrast, it generated a nearly equivalent predictions for Type 2 close and Type 2 remote sentences. The SOE and GloVe similarity models also generated these patterns, however the remaining models were unable to capture differences between either Type 1 or Type 2 remote and close sentences.</p><p>We tested these differences by regressing BERT activation differences (AT -AF) for the sentences on binary variables for sentence type (Type 1 vs. 2), superordinate type (close vs.</p><p>remote) and their interaction. We documented a positive interaction, though we did not achieve significance (p = 0.34). These results indicate that our model is able to capture the qualitative trends underlying Roth and Mervis's results, but is not able to do so in a statistically reliable manner (possibly because the dataset is underpowered for testing BERT's predictions).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Rosch and Mervis's (1975)</ref> finding that exemplars that are highly typical of their categories also have a high degree of overlap with the features of other exemplars in the category and a low degree of overlap with the features of exemplars of other categories. This finding explains why some exemplars are more typical of a category than others. Our BERT model, which can make judgments regarding nearly any natural concept and feature pair, is uniquely suited to testing such predictions. We attempted such tests using the approach outlined in Experiment 1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Rosch and Mervis (1975)</ref>. In this experiment,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution of Features across Concepts</head><p>Rosch and Mervis asked participants to generate features for a subset of the concepts and superordinate categories used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rosch (1975)</ref>. Rosch and Mervis then measured the frequency with which the different features were listed for each category, and subsequently averaged the feature frequencies for a given exemplar to calculate the degree to which that exemplar's features were present in other exemplars for the category and in exemplars in other categories. These were the measures of feature overlap used by Rosch and Mervis.</p><p>Due to the generality of our model, we decided not to limit our tests to the subset of concepts used in Rosch and Mervis, but rather implement the tests for all 560 concepts and 10 superordinate categories for which <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rosch (1975)</ref> collected typicality ratings. Specifically, we first obtained a large list of 4,654 features. These were the features in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Devereux et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">McRae et al. (2005)</ref> datasets that were listed more than three times by participants. We then paired these features with each of the 560 <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rosch (1975)</ref> concepts to generate 2,606,240 distinct sentences. These sentences were evaluated by all our models, and their binarized predictions (true or false) were used to calculate measures of feature overlap that were identical to the two used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Rosch and Mervis (1975)</ref>. Specifically, our first measure took the dot product of the vector of binary features for each concept with the vector of total feature frequencies for other exemplars in its category. This calculated the degree of feature overlap the concept had with members of its superordinate category. Our second measure took the dot product of the vector of binary features for each concept with the vector of total feature frequencies for all concepts in other superordinate categories. This calculated the degree of feature overlap the concept had with non-members of its superordinate category. Finally, we correlated these two measures of feature overlap with typicality rankings (higher ranks for more typical items) for each of the ten categories in <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rosch (1975)</ref>, and averaged the correlations for each model. We expected to observe positive correlations for feature overlap with category members and negative correlations for feature overlap with non-members.</p><p>The results of this analysis are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7A</ref>. Here we can see that the full BERT model captured the predicted patterns, with average correlations of 0.45 with the features of members and -0.16 with the features of non-members. The SOE model also obtained similar correlations. However, none of the other models were able to capture these patterns.</p><p>An alternate approach to evaluating the GloVe model is to use semantic similarity between exemplars, rather than feature overlap, to predict typicality. It could be the case that concepts that are centrally located in the GloVe space relative to other members of their superordinate category, are more typical of their superordinate category. This would be consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Rosch and Mervis (1975)</ref> if we interpret the dimensions of the GloVe space as representing continuous features. To test if GloVe category centrality predicted typicality, we measured the average pairwise cosine similarities of concepts with all other concepts in their superordinate category, as well as with concepts not in their superordinate category. This gave us, for each concept, measures of aggregate GloVe space in-category and out-category centrality.</p><p>We then correlated these measures with typicality ratings. These correlations are also presented</p><p>in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7A</ref>, which shows that the GloVe centrality approach did yield higher correlations than the GloVe feature overlap approach for feature overlap with category members, but that it could not generate negative correlations for non-members.</p><p>Effect 13: Malt and Smith (1984) Experiments 1 and 2. Another important result regarding feature distributions was documented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Malt and Smith (1984)</ref>, who found that certain features were systematically correlated with each other (e.g. sit on trees occurred in the same concepts as flies, but in different concepts as is near ocean, for the category birds) and that people were able to perceive and predict these correlations. This result was important as most models of semantic cognition prior to Malt and Smith had assumed that the features of category members were independent of each other.</p><p>We attempted to replicate these results using the stimuli from Experiment 1, which were presented in Figures 1F-G of <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Malt and Smith (1984)</ref>. These figures displayed significantly correlated features from six categories: birds, furniture, clothing, flowers, trees, and fruit. There were a total of 103 positively correlated feature pairs and 41 negatively correlated feature pairs, with an average of 24 pairs per category. We paired each of these features with concepts in the six categories presented in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> of Malt and Smith. This table had a total of 96 concepts with an average of 16 concepts per superordinate category, generating 768 distinct concept-feature pairs. We gave these concept-feature pairs (in the form of sentences) to the full BERT model and then tested the degree to which its predictions for sentences generated using one feature in a pair were correlated with its predictions for sentences generated using the other feature in a pair. For example, as there were fifteen different birds in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> of Malt and Smith, this method yielded two sets of fifteen sentences for the feature pair (sits on trees, flies) (one sentence for each bird and feature combination). These sentences gave us two 15-dimensional vectors of continuous predictions (probabilities or activation differences), which were correlated with each other to get a single measure of predicted correlation for (sits on trees, flies). Intuitively, this approach measures the degree to which sits on trees occurs in the same concepts as flies for the BERT model.</p><p>We applied a similar analysis to the remaining models. However, for the GloVe model, we merely measured the semantic similarity of the bag-of-words GloVe vectors for the feature pairs (e.g. the similarity of the bag-of-words vector for sits on trees and the bag-of-words vector for flies). This is a reasonable shortcut as the correlation between vectors of distances to two points in a space is proportional to the direct distance between the two points. In other words, we can proxy the degree to which sits on trees occurs in the same concepts as flies for the GloVe model by simply measuring the distance between sits on trees and flies.</p><p>The results of this analysis are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7B</ref>. Here we present average correlations for the full BERT model for feature pairs that were positively and negatively correlated in Malt and Smith. We can see that BERT generated highly positive correlations (0.53 when using probabilities and 0.59 when using activation differences) for positively correlated Malt and Smith features, but neutral correlations (0.02 and 0.06 for probabilities and activations) for negatively correlated Malt and Smith features. This is also the case for the SOE model, but not for the remaining models which were able to capture positive correlations for positively correlated features, but also generated positive correlations for negatively correlated features.</p><p>Interestingly the first layer model achieved a correlation close to 1 in all tests. This was because its predictions depended only on the underlying semantic content of the sentence and were thus largely constant regardless of which concepts the features were paired with.</p><p>We also tried to replicate the results of Experiment 2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Malt and Smith (1984)</ref>. In this experiment, Malt and Smith offered a subset of the feature pairs from Experiment 1 to participants. Participants were asked to rate the extent to which they thought that these pairs went together or were related. Malt and Smith found that 44 of these pairs were rated as positively related and 13 were rated as negatively related by participants. These relationships are displayed in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> of their paper. As in Experiment 1, we used the concepts in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> of the paper to generate sentences for each positively or negatively related feature pair listed in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> of the paper. The full BERT model's predictions for these sentences were then correlated to get a single measure of predicted correlation for each Malt and Smith feature pair. We also used this method to obtain predictions for the remaining models, except for GloVe for which we used the feature similarity analysis outlined above. The results of this analysis are also shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7B</ref>. equipped with word vectors in its first set of layers is also likely to achieve similar accuracy rates (though to our knowledge, the specific set of vectors used in the BERT 'base' model <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Wu et al., 2016)</ref> have not been tested on semantic similarity judgements). In any case, our goal here is not to evaluate BERT on standard measures of semantic similarity but rather explore its application to similarity ratings phenomena that are particularly problematic for distributed semantic methods like GloVe (at least with the typical application of cosine similarity).</p><p>We begin by examining a classic finding in semantic cognition: asymmetric similarity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Tversky (1977)</ref> noted that spatial models of similarity (which include word vector models like GloVe and LSA), when using simple distance measures like cosine or Euclidean distance, predict that similarity ratings are symmetric, that is, that participants believe X to be as similar to Y as Y is to X. Tversky found that these predictions were violated in specific settings, mostly involving countries (e.g. Red China and North Korea), as well as perceptual stimuli like figures and artificial letters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Whitten et al. (1979)</ref> provided a more extensive dataset of similarity ratings for natural language concepts. In their experiment, Whitten et al. asked participants to rate the synonymy of 464 word pairs. The words were all nouns, and were taken from Roget's Thesaurus they were not limited to specific semantic categories, as in prior work. Although each word pair was considered to be a synonym according to the Roget's Thesaurus, participants gave some pairs higher ratings than others. Additionally, participant ratings varied based on the word in the pair that was presented first. Thus, for example, age was judged to be a good synonym for era but not vice versa.</p><p>Whitten et al. presented word pairs and associated ratings in The correlations between BERT's predictions and the t-statistic are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7C</ref>.</p><p>Here we see that the full BERT model achieved positive correlations (0.24 for probabilities and 0.26 for activations), showing that BERT can capture observed asymmetries in similarity judgment. Unlike our previous tests, the SOE model performed relatively poorly. This is because predictions of asymmetric similarity likely rely on trained examples of asymmetry on relations (in the subject-object exchange sentences), which were excluded from the SOE model's training set. We found similarly poor performance for the remaining models, with the GloVe model not predicting any asymmetry whatsoever (due to the symmetric measure of cosine similarity used for the word vectors).</p><p>We also examined our models in terms of their ability to predict the symmetrized similarity ratings for the word pairs in Whitten et al. We obtained predictions for the full BERT model by averaging its output activations for the two sentences associated with each word pair (e.g. averaging AT -AF for age is an era and era is an age). GloVe's predictions were simply the cosine similarities of the vectors corresponding to the words in the pair (e.g. cosine similarity of age and era). This analysis showed that BERT achieved relatively high correlations with the symmetrized similarity ratings data (0.37 and 0.39 for probabilities and activations respectively).</p><p>The remaining models also performed quite well (though slightly worse than the full model), except for the first layer model which achieved near-zero correlations.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Nelson et al., 2004)</ref> and were not restricted to a specific set of semantic categories. Participant ratings for these word pairs were released as part of the SimLex-999 dataset.</p><p>We used the full BERT model to predict similarity ratings on the SimLex-999 dataset.</p><p>For BERT, we again transformed word pairs into natural language sentences of the form . We averaged the predictions of the model for the two sentences to get a single prediction for the word pair. We then correlated this prediction with subject similarity ratings. These results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7D</ref>. Here we see that the full BERT model achieved high correlations (0.47 and 0.51 for probabilities and activations).</p><p>The SOE model achieved similar correlations, and last layer, language model, and GloVe similarity model achieved slightly worse (though still positive) correlations. The first layer model again failed at capturing the data.</p><p>Effect 16: Richie and Bhatia (2020) Experiment 1. Most similarity datasets generate stimuli by selecting word pairs from a larger lexicon, and thus often pair up distinct concepts from different categories. For this reason, these datasets ignore differences in similarity judgment rules across categories. The features that make robins similar to sparrows are different to those that make gloves similar to scarfs, and existing similarity datasets do not test the ability of models to account for these differences.</p><p>To address the limitations of existing research, we recently examined participant similarity judgments for word pairs with a shared category <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Richie &amp; Bhatia, 2020)</ref>. Specifically, we offered participants 2,040 word pairs, each of which involved concepts from one of seven superordinate categories: furniture, <ref type="bibr">clothing, birds, vegetables, sports, vehicles, and fruit. Thus,</ref> for example, participants were asked to judge the similarity of two types of furniture or two types of clothing or two types of birds. We found that the performance of leading distributed semantics models like GloVe was lower in our dataset relative to previous similarity datasets. This was partially due to the fact that the similarity rules used by our participants varied across categories.</p><p>In the current paper we wanted to test whether the full BERT model was able to avoid these issues. For this purpose, we applied it to the word pairs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Richie and Bhatia (2020)</ref>. Again, we obtained BERT predictions by averaging the activations of the [WORD 1] is a <ref type="bibr">[WORD 2]</ref> and [WORD 2] is a [WORD 1] sentences, and correlated these predictions separately for each category. These correlations were subsequently averaged across categories, and are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7E</ref>. Here we can see that BERT achieved high average aggregate correlations (of 0.53 for probabilities and 0.58 for activation). Again, the SOE model performed equivalently; the last layer model, language model and GloVe similarity model performed worse (but still yielded positive correlations); and the first layer model performed poorly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We have tested the full BERT model on stimuli from twenty-three experiments, spanning sixteen distinct behavioral effects in semantic cognition research. Our first set of tests used the probability predictions and differences in activation generated by BERT to describe response times in semantic verification. We found that BERT was able to successfully capture classic level-of-hierarchy effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Collins &amp; Quillian, 1969)</ref>, as well as reversals of these effects due to semantic relatedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Rips et al., 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Smith et al., 1974)</ref>. BERT also predicted response time differences between judgments involving related and unrelated sentences <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Glass et al., 1974)</ref>, between category membership and feature judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Collins &amp; Quillian, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hampton, 1984)</ref>, and between correlated and uncorrelated features <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(McRae et al., 1997)</ref>. It also captured response time patterns for judgments involving false sentences <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson &amp; Reder, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Glass et al., 1974)</ref>. In our second application, we used BERT to predict findings related to typicality.</p><p>We found that predictions for category membership judgments were proportional to the typicality of concepts in superordinate categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Rosch, 1975)</ref>. This allowed BERT to capture inconsistencies across participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(McCloskey &amp; Glucksberg, 1978)</ref>, transitivity violations <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hampton, 1982)</ref>, and violations of set membership relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Roth &amp; Mervis, 1983)</ref> in semantic judgment, previously attributed to typicality. Our third application exploited the fact that BERT can make predictions for arbitrary concept-feature pairs, and thus can be used to measure the distribution of thousands of features across thousands of concepts. Our tests showed that feature overlap in BERT predicted concept typicality <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Rosch &amp; Mervis, 1975)</ref>, and that feature correlations uncovered by BERT matched those obtained in previous experimental data <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Malt &amp; Smith, 1984)</ref>. Our final application showed that BERT was able to predict patterns in similarity judgment that are problematic for existing distributed semantics models. These patterns involve asymmetry in similarity judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Whitten et al., 1979)</ref>, the distinction between association and similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hill et al., 2015)</ref>, and the measurement of similarity within (rather than across)</p><p>categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Richie &amp; Bhatia, 2020)</ref>. Note that BERT's activation differences provided better predictions of semantic verification response times, as well as typicality and similarity ratings, relative to BERT's predicted probabilities. The latter were often saturated at 0 or 1, and were thus not able to capture nuanced patterns in subject data.</p><p>The full BERT model outperformed many alternative models in its ability to capture the above patterns. The SOE model (which is identical to the full model, except that it is not trained on subject-object exchange sentences) mimicked the performance of the full model for all tests except for those involving asymmetries in similarity judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Whitten et al., 1979)</ref>. This again shows that it is necessary to specially train BERT to handle asymmetries in relations and propositions. We also found that the last layer model (which is similar to the full BERT model except that its sentence representations are not fine-tuned on subject norms) did well on many of the tests, though there were some findings that it was not able to capture (and many others for which its predictive accuracy was smaller than that of the full BERT model). The last layer model also sometimes had difficulties distinguishing true sentences from false sentences. This was also the case for the language model and the GloVe similarity model, which use either the pseudo-log-likelihood of the sentence in the non-fine-tuned BERT model or the semantic similarity of the concept and feature in the sentence, to make predictions. These models typically performed worse than the last layer model. Finally, the first layer model, which relies purely on the semantic content of the sentence, performed very poorly, and often gave sentences in different experimental conditions the same predictions.</p><p>These results are similar to those documented in the predictive accuracy section above, and as in that section, show that BERT's successes come from (1) its multi-layer, interactive, attention-based processing which can appropriately respond to aspects of sentence structure, and</p><p>(2) the fine-tuning procedure which adjusts the representation of sentences based on psychological data. That said, the relative successes of the last layer model again show that there is some information already present in the non-fine-tuned BERT model. The ability of the GloVe model to describe some of the effects also shows the predictive power of semantic relatedness and association, which have been implicated in both semantic cognition (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Glass et al., 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Smith et al., 1974)</ref> as well as in probability judgment and reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bhatia, 2017</ref>; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Evans, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kahneman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sloman, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Note that even our full BERT model was unable to capture all previously documented behavioral patterns. In particular, it failed to predict <ref type="bibr">Glass et al.'s (1979)</ref> finding that response times for category membership judgments for direct antonyms are quicker than judgments for indirect antonyms (which itself is a reversal of <ref type="bibr">Glass et al.'s earlier (1974)</ref> finding the semantic relatedness slows down judgments for false sentences). The alternative models were also unable to capture this effect. Relatedly, BERT (as well as other models) gave non-significant predictions for <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Roth and Mervis's (1983)</ref> set membership typicality violations (though its predictions were in the correct direction). Other limitations of the full BERT model include its inability to give reliable true responses in the true-unrelated condition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Glass et al. (1974)</ref> (indicating that it is more likely to make errors when the concept and feature are explicitly designed to be semantically unrelated), its weak predictions for the false feature vs. category condition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hampton (1984)</ref> (for which its predictions are all saturated close to 0), and its weak predictions for the <ref type="bibr">Rips et al. (1973) mammals condition and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">the McRae et al. (1997)</ref> experiment (for which its predictions are all saturated close to 1). These limitations were also present in our alternative models. We anticipate that more elaborate models, that combine BERT outputs with psychologically realistic response generation mechanisms (such as diffusion processes), may be able to address these limitations. We consider these extensions below. We can better understand the mechanisms responsible for our model's success by comparing its performance with various alternatives. We have considered five such alternatives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The SOE model, which is identical to the full BERT model except that it excludes subject-object exchange sentences from the training data, achieves nearly identical performance to full BERT.</p><p>This model makes good out-of-sample predictions and captures nearly all observed behavioral patterns. The settings in which it fails involve sentences with relational asymmetries, showing that BERT needs to be explicitly taught to handle such asymmetries for the purposes of semantic verification.</p><p>Another model is the last layer model, which uses the final layer of the non-fine-tuned BERT model to generate sentence vectors. These vectors are subsequently mapped onto truth/falsehood judgments using a logistic function (whose parameters are fit to the training data). As the last layer model does not modify its sentence representations through fine-tuning on psychological data, it achieves lower performance than the full and SOE models. This further demonstrates the value of fine-tuning sentence representations, which is necessary to reach maximal performance. However, the last layer model is moderately successful at predicting outof-sample sentences and at describing many behavioral patterns, showing that the pretraining step does equip the BERT with somewhat useful representations.</p><p>A different implementation of the non-fine-tuned BERT model is the language model, which simply assigns a pseudo-log-likelihood to each sentence. This model does worse than the last layer model showing that explicitly mapping sentence vectors onto the response variable (in our case, the truth or falsehood of the sentence) is better than measuring the probability of the sentence in language. That said, this model does achieve reasonable performance in many settings, showing that sentence probability is a useful cue for semantic verification.</p><p>Our The fifth model that we tested, and the one that performed the worst, is the first layer model. This model simplistically averages the BERT vectors in the first layer, and thus captures only the semantic content of the sentence. The poor performance of this model is not surprising, but it does further highlight the value of interactive, attention-based processing in BERT. It is only by transforming word representations in multiple successive layers of a deep neural network that BERT can predict the truth or falsehood of the sentence.</p><p>Finally, it is useful to note that our full BERT model was tested using both its probability predictions and its activations from its final output layer (which served as inputs into the logistic function used to obtain probabilities). The training loss function was based on probability, however, we found that activations were more predictive of observed behavioral patterns. These patterns often involve true sentences that vary in subtle ways (e.g. sparrows are birds vs. parrots are birds), and thus often generate probabilities close to 100%. Activations, by contrast, can pick up small differences between true sentences, and are thus better correlates of psychological variables such as response times, typicality ratings, and similarity ratings, which reflect these small differences.</p><p>A connectionist model. Connectionist networks of semantic cognition have considerable precedent in psychological research (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Rogers &amp; McClelland, 2004</ref> for a review), and the transformers analyzed in the current paper are closely related to <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hinton's (1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hinton's ( , 1986</ref> propositional network. Just like Hinton's model, BERT relies on interactions between distributed word vectors to obtain a vector representation of the sentence. These interactions occur in neural network layers with a deep feedforward structure (rather than a recurrent structure, as in Hinton's model), and involve a number of new technical innovations such as the self-attention mechanism (which is not present in Hinton's model), however they are nonetheless able to yield sentence representations that offer the same benefits as those in Hinton's framework.</p><p>For example, sentence representations in both transformer networks and in Hinton's network depend on word order; both networks permit different sets of representations for words in different positions. This implies that the resulting sentence vectors can respond to word order and thus capture aspects of knowledge structure (e.g. relational asymmetries and hierarchies).</p><p>Sentence representations can also be generated for a vast set of different sentences (using a finite set of network weights), giving the two models a high degree of generality and a wide domain of applicability. Finally, both transformer networks and Hinton's network generalize learnt information based on the similarity of word vector and sentence vector representations. This is why they are able to accurately extrapolate from a limited training dataset to predict semantic judgments for new sentences (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Rogers &amp; McClelland, 2004</ref> for an overview of these benefits of connectionist models).</p><p>Hinton instantiated his model using a small set of words and experimenter generated weights. However, the BERT model used this paper can accurately represent tens of thousands of words, and has weights based on large-scale natural language data. In our case, we further refine these weights based on psychological data such as concept and feature norms. The beneficial properties of Hinton's network can thus be applied on a much larger scale and in a manner that mimics the behavior of human participants.</p><p>A psychological model. Connectionist networks, such as the transformers analyzed in this paper, provide good predictions. But to what extent are these networks 'psychological'</p><p>theories? Certainly, BERT does not perfectly implement human-like learning processes, and its capabilities fall short of the kind of sophisticated knowledge manipulation and reasoning processes at play in human cognition (both limitations are discussed in detail in the subsequent section). But BERT does have psychological value in its ability to describe simple semantic verification, as well as related phenomena involving naturalistic concept-feature knowledge.</p><p>One could even consider the results of this paper to be a type of existence proofa model in which "semantic abilities arise from the flow of activation among simple, neuron-like processing units, as governed by the strengths of interconnecting weights" <ref type="bibr">(Rogers &amp; McClelland, 2004, p. 689</ref>) is sufficient to predict simple semantic verification and capture many classic patterns of human semantic cognition (even though the training data itself does not "build in" the patterns). For example, we have shown that our model assigns lower activation values to higher-level propositions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Collins and Quillian's (1969)</ref> experiment, thereby generating behavior that matches the predictions of hierarchical semantic network models. Of course, our model also captures reversals of these patterns observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Rips et al. (1973)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Smith et al. (1974)</ref>. Taken together, these results indicate that contemporary instantiations of connectionist models are able to successfully predict key aspects of human conceptual knowledge. This implies that hierarchical structure in semantic representation is not necessary for simple semantic verification, and that the explanatory scope of connectionism is greater than previously assumed.</p><p>In fact, there is no other theoretical approach capable of quantitatively predicting the large set of semantic cognition effects studied in this paper.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997)</ref>, topic modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Griffiths et al., 2007)</ref> and BEAGLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Jones and Mewhort, 2007)</ref> They provide similarity metrics between words which are used in various applications and in the formulation of new theories (including cognitive process theories of memory and decision making). 4. By modifying and limiting some of the assumptions in these models (e.g. reducing number of dimensions in LSA) it is possible to understand the computational assumptions that are necessary for describing a particular cognitive phenomenon. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">GÃ¼nther et al. (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mandera et al. (2017)</ref> for additional discussion.</p><p>In many ways the contribution of our BERT model to the study of simple concept-feature knowledge is analogous to that of these established models for the study of concept similarity and association. In particular, we 1. Quantitatively predict benchmark psychological phenomena, including several well-known behavioral effects; 2. Examine a model with architectural similarities to established connectionist networks 3. Provide a knowledge base for use in process modeling of semantic cognition, as well as the modeling of high-level cognition; 4. Understand the computational assumptions that are necessary for describing behavior by modifying and constraining the processes and data used to train our model. We realize that word-level distributed semantics models are consistent with dominant theories of word representation (e.g. spatial models), whereas sentence-level models like transformers seem to be at odds with dominant theories of sentence representation (namely theories from generative linguistics, and particularly syntax and semantics, whose formal machinery includes grammars, trees, parsing algorithms, and logical inference rules). We are not claiming that BERT is a good model of sentence processing in general, only that it can describe semantic verification for simple conceptfeature pairings. The debate about the value of machine learning models like transformers for cognitive modeling is ongoing, and fully engaging with this debate is out of the scope of the present paper (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cichy &amp; Kaiser, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lillicrap et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">McClelland et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Richards et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Saxe et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">and Yarkoni &amp; Westfall, 2017</ref> for recent perspectives).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of our Approach</head><p>Other tasks in semantic cognition. While our approach is powerful, we do acknowledge it has certain limitations. First, we certainly have not tested our model on the full range of semantic cognition and truth-value judgment tasks that we could have, or might be able to. Most obviously, we don't expect our model to do well on more complex sentences that go beyond the relatively simple concept and feature (verb-object) sentences we trained and tested on here. For example, our fine-tuned model probably would not correctly falsify sentences like democracy is not a form of government in which the people have the authority to choose their governing legislation.</p><p>Moreover, there are many sorts of effects involving concept-feature knowledge that we have not captured, both those we tried and failed to, like <ref type="bibr">Glass et al.'s (1979)</ref> response times for false sentences with direct and indirect antonyms, and those we haven't yet tried. An example of the latter type involves complex concepts composed of adjective-noun combinations such as red apple and brown apple. There is an extensive literature on this topic, mostly concerned with how features are applied to such complex concepts, and how semantic verification depends (in fairly subtle ways) on the adjective-noun combination used (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Murphy, 1988 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Osherson, 1984</ref>, for early results). Our model is trained to predict the features of simple concepts, and we suspect that it can be extended to handle complex concepts as well. In fact, in preliminary tests we have found that our full BERT model accurately predicts the findings of <ref type="bibr">Smith and Osherton (1984)</ref> using their original stimuli. It also manages to generate the patterns observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Murphy (1988)</ref>, albeit with some difficulty. Due to the scope of the concept combination literature, we have not examined it in the current paper, though we plan to begin working on it very soon.</p><p>We have also not attempted to use our model to study tasks involving the use of quantifiers (e.g., some cats have fur vs all cats have fur), and in our analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Glass et al. (1974)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Glass et al. (1979)</ref>, have simplified our model inputs to avoid quantifiers. Some preliminary tests (not reported here) have shown that BERT is indeed sensitive to quantifiers, though it typically has difficulty with negating sentences that are not true (e.g. no cats have fins).</p><p>Likewise, we have not examined the BERT model on tasks involving logical connectives (e.g.</p><p>cats have fur and like to hunt mice), though again preliminary tests have found that BERT has some ability to respond to connectives. We suspect that teaching the model about quantifiers and connectives through appropriate training data could somewhat improve its predictions, though we doubt that this would be a satisfactory solution. Our plan for future work with the BERT model is to use it to derive a knowledge base to predict the truth values of atomic sentences, and then to build a second, high-level module to use the knowledge base for propositional and predicate logic (we elaborate on this direction below).</p><p>Finally, we have not attempted to evaluate semantic verification data when other sentences are given as premises, when participants are asked to judge the truth or falsehood of sentences based on information that was presented to them previously (e.g. tasks in which participants read a story before evaluating facts about the story), or when participants are primed with words prior to semantic verification. This would require additional, contextual representations (e.g. of premises, previously presented information, or primes), and could potentially be tested in variants of the BERT model equipped with such representations in additional layers. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dasgupta et al. (2020)</ref> have recently shown that such an approach has many limitations. Thus, a better strategy may again be to use BERT to derive a knowledge base for simple concept-feature pairs, which can be combined with a second module that reasons and responds based on additional information.</p><p>Learning. We do not necessarily think that our BERT model is a model of learning. To achieve the performance we obtained here, we used a transformer model that had been pre-trained on corpora with 3.3 billion word tokens, and then fine-tuned our model on nearly 500,000 examples of true and false sentences. The first of these steps is clearly not developmentally realistic: children learning (spoken) language only hear on the order of millions, not billions, of word tokens <ref type="bibr">(Sperry et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Golinkoff et al., 2019</ref>), yet children clearly possess considerable conceptual knowledge and abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Carey, 2009)</ref>. The fine-tuning step, on the other hand, may have some basis in developmental reality. That is, it does seem reasonable that children develop some conceptual knowledge independently through non-linguistic information sources (whether innate or learned by observing the world), and then, when they can understand sentences, they further bolster this knowledge when parents or other knowledgeable sources explicitly describe the nature of the world through positive and (implicitly) negative examples (cats are animals vs whales are not fish) (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Rogers &amp; McClelland, 2004</ref> for a defense of such a view). On the other hand, it is doubtful whether children receive these sorts of simple, concept-feature sentences in the quantities we trained our model on, nor does it seem likely that children receive the kinds of negative examples we generated, with subjects and objects switched (fur has cat), or with arbitrary words swapped in (tractor has fur). Whatever the real process by which children come to possess the conceptual knowledge they have, we suggest that they arrive at knowledge and abilities that can be described, in many ways, by our fine-tuned BERT model.</p><p>Interpreting neural networks. Third, perhaps even more than their predecessor neural networks and distributed semantic models, transformers like BERT might be criticized as 'black boxes' that offer little insight into how they solve a particular problem like sentence verification.</p><p>We are very sympathetic to this concern. As such, we conducted analyses of the factors influencing our full, fine-tuned model's performance (section Correlates of Model Judgment), and found that feature distinctiveness, production frequency, and cue-feature GloVe similarity had positive correlations with model predictions. We also note that there is an emerging cottage industrysometimes (pejoratively) termed BERTology <ref type="bibr">(Rogers et al., 2020</ref>)attempting to better understand how BERT and other transformers solve natural language processing problems.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Jawahar et al. (2019)</ref> showed that the intermediate layers of BERT follow a hierarchy of processing not unlike that proposed by many traditional cognitive models of linguistic processing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Frazier, 1987)</ref>, with surface features (e.g., sentence length)</p><p>represented on the bottom layers, syntactic information in the middle, and semantic information at the top (for similar findings, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Tenney et al., 2019)</ref>. It is likely that further insights like these could be gleaned from our fine-tuned model, thereby shedding light on why the model is able to reproduce the large set of semantic cognition effects studied in this paper. Besides the techniques utilized in the BERTology work referenced above, it may be useful to rely on the methods used by previous neural network modelers of semantic cognition, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Rogers &amp; McClelland (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Saxe et al. (2019)</ref>, to understand the hidden layer representations of our networks. Our analysis in the section Relation-Sensitive Representations is one example of this, and we expect much more is possible in this vein.</p><p>Limits of text-based approaches to semantics. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there are some concerns that BERT and other text-based language models are just not up to the task of modeling meaning and reasoning in human-like ways. Some work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ettinger et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ettinger, 2020)</ref> shows BERT or related models struggling on benchmarks for various semantic tasks like semantic role interpretation (e.g., knowing that professor is the agent for help in the sentence the student who is sleeping was helped by the professor). More seriously, some cognitive scientists view (neural) text-based models like BERT as just inherently limited in their ability to explain human knowledge and reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Lake &amp; Murphy, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">, Marcus, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, or Bender &amp; Koller, 2020</ref>. What many of these critiques have in common is that they view BERT and related models as just too dependent on superficial statistics of text. For example, Marcus (2020) shows that, GPT-3 <ref type="bibr">(Brown et al., 2020)</ref>, a very popular, state-of-the-art transformer model that can generate text following a prompt, often displays remarkable lack of conceptual knowledge and often simplistically responds with continuations that are likely given nearby textual context <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Marcus's (2020)</ref> suggested remedy to this is hybrid neural-symbolic systems, a possibility we briefly discuss in the next section). The knowledge capabilities touted by BERT similarly might not reflect actual reasoning, and instead may, to at least some extent, reflect</p><p>BERT merely memorizing (superficial patterns in) its training data (Kassner et al., 2020). Lake</p><p>and Muprhy (2020) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bender and Koller (2020)</ref> level related critiques, which are essentially that "a system trained only on form has a priori no way to learning meaning" <ref type="bibr">(Bender &amp; Koller, 2020, pg. 1)</ref>. What these systems are missing is grounding in perception of, and action in, the world that we use language to talk about. Bender and Koller illustrate this vividly with a thought experiment of a super-intelligent octopus listening to a conversation between two people stranded on separate islands. Although the octopus may, after a while, be able to predict what each person will say to the other, it has no way of picking out the things in the world under discussion. It therefore doesn't really know the meaning of, say, palm tree.</p><p>Given all the above, we certainly aren't ready to claim that our fine-tuned BERT network is a complete model of the human computation of meaning and reasoning that underlies sentence verification tasks in their full complexity. But if the foregoing sorts of criticisms are correct, then why does our model work as well as it does in both raw out-of-sample accuracy, and accounting for classic patterns in the literature? One possibility is that our fine-tuning step equips the BERT model with the world knowledge and knowledge manipulation processes necessary to mimic simple semantic verification. Subsequently, it could be that our fine-tuned BERT model is able to explain so many classic semantic cognition results because these results reflect shallower aspects of knowledge and processing than previously thought, aspects of knowledge that might be reflected in patterns of word co-occurrence and sentence frequency in text. To a certain extent, we could accept this sort of view, but we might simply reply that much of everyday knowledge and behavior may then rely on fairly superficial reasoning. This would be largely consistent with a common perspective in cognitive science <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Evans, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kahneman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sloman, 1996)</ref>, which holds that human judgments often rely on a fast and shallow (and therefore sometimes inaccurate) heuristic system rather than on a slow and effortful deliberative system. It may be the case that much of semantic cognition, and the effects in classic studies that we examined here, have more in common with the former system than previously thought (see also Bhatia, 2017, for a discussion of this point in the context of judgment research). Of course, a complete model of knowledge and reasoning needs both connectionist or heuristic components, as BERT clearly provides, as well as the symbolic or deliberative components that it might not.</p><p>We return to this possibility in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New Applications</head><p>Cognitive process modeling of semantic cognition. The predictive accuracy and generality of BERT offer many practical benefits for semantic cognition research, that do not depend on its plausibility as a theory of human conceptual knowledge. One such benefit involves the cognitive process modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Busemeyer &amp; Diederich, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lewandowsky &amp; Farrell, 2010)</ref> of semantic cognition: BERT's outputs can be used to equip existing cognitive process models of binary choice or memory search with the knowledge necessary to predict naturalistic semantic verification and knowledge retrieval. Process models equipped with this world knowledge can then be applied to a wide range of everyday semantic cognition tasks. With parametric model fitting, researchers can recover parameters that describe individual-level semantic mechanisms, and study the variability in these mechanisms across individuals and the sensitivity of these mechanisms to experimental manipulations and task-relevant variables.</p><p>For semantic verification, for example, we can quite simply use the output activation states of our trained BERT model to quantify the strength of evidence favoring true or false in response to a given concept-feature pair. Strength of evidence can subsequently be fed as a drift rate into dynamic decision models of two-alternative-forced-choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001)</ref>, thereby predicting response times in semantic verification (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 1982</ref>, who provide an early test of the feasibility of this approach and find mixed results). Other task-relevant variables (e.g. sentence length, word frequency, time pressure) can also be incorporated into this framework, and the semantic similarity between the concept and feature can be used to specify response biases, thereby instantiating dual process theories of cognition (which propose that responses are a product of both a fast associative processes and a slow deliberative processsee <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bhatia, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Evans, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kahneman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sloman, 1996)</ref>. Using such an approach, model predictions can be obtained for thousands of concepts and features, allowing for a quantitative cognitive process model of semantic verification with a very large domain of applicability.</p><p>We can also apply a variant of this approach to memory modeling. This would first require a prespecified set of features and concepts over which memory processes can be assumed to operate. We can obtain this set from existing norms data and expand the set by algorithmically creating new features based on existing features. Thus, features like hunts mice can first be parsed into a 'feature type' like hunts <ref type="bibr">[ANIMAL]</ref>, and then be used to generate new features like hunts rabbits and hunts lions, based on sister terms for mice in lexical resources like WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Miller, 1995)</ref>. Our trained BERT model can be given sentences generated from millions of algorithmically-generated features to derive the universe of features that are reasonably true for the concept. Finally, cognitive process models of memory (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Polyn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Raaijmakers &amp; Shiffrin, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr">see also McRae et al., 1997)</ref> can be equipped with model-derived representations for these features, in order to quantitatively characterize retrieval processes in feature norm generation studies. Evaluating the feasibility of such models is a promising avenue for future research.</p><p>Models of real-world cognition. There are many successful theories of categorization, judgment, decision making, and reasoning, but these are typically tested using abstracted stimuli involving small sets of experimenter-defined features and relations. Occasionally, researchers may use experimental techniques like similarity ratings to uncover concept representations for more naturalistic variants of these tasks (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Nosofsky et al., 2018)</ref>. However, models trained in these experiments can only be applied within a narrow domain, and cannot be used to make quantitative predictions for most common naturalistic concepts (for which additional experimental data has not been collected). There are likewise few computational models capable of making quantitative predictions for naturalistic cognitive tasks involving explanation, argumentation, moral judgment, and creativity, as responses in these tasks are nearly always based on rich real-world knowledge that is difficult to formally model.</p><p>The transformer networks analyzed in this paper again offer a solution to this problem.</p><p>As with the cognitive process models discussed in the previous section, we can use BERT's outputs to equip theories in other domains of cognitive science with the world knowledge necessary for successful deliberation and response in naturalistic tasks. Thus, for example, we can use our fine-tuned BERT model applied to both human-generated and algorithmicallygenerated features to derive the universe of features that are reasonably true for a set of concepts.</p><p>These features can then be used to model the learning of new categories for naturalistic concepts, probability judgment for events involving concepts, and preferential choice between various objects and concepts (see Bhatia et al., 2019 for a discussion).</p><p>One could also, in principle, apply such an approach to model naturalistic high-level cognition. Thus, for example, existing models of analogical reasoning such as BART <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Lu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">2019)</ref>, could be given our model's fine-tuned vector representations of sentences (made of relations and entity pairs) as inputs for further relational reasoning. Likewise, cognitive architectures like ACT-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson, 1990</ref>) could be equipped with facts about the world derived from our trained BERT model for use alongside production rules and other cognitive operations.</p><p>Similarly, Bayesian models <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Oaksford &amp; Chater, 2007)</ref> could be given the world knowledge to aid probabilistic reasoning and inference for thousands of concepts and features. It may also be possible to directly embed the representations possessed by our BERT model into hybrid symbolic-connectionist models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Doumas et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hummel &amp; Holyoak, 2003)</ref>, thereby combining the expressiveness and productivity of symbolic models with BERT's ability to capture learning and gradations of similarity and meaning (see also Marcus, 2020 for similar suggestions).</p><p>A complete theory of the full range of naturalistic high-level cognition will surely be extraordinarily complexindeed, solving this problem is likely to be as hard as solving the problem of general human intelligence. We therefore believe that such a theory will likely have need for both connectionist principles as embodied in our fine-tuned BERT model, and symbolic and structured principles as embodied in other theories of high-level cognition. Importantly, such theories would benefit from the large scope and generality of the knowledge contained in our fine-tuned BERT model, and therefore be able to reason over a much broader set of concepts than previously possible, as well as uncover new reasoning rules in a data-driven manner.</p><p>Synthesizing and reconciling diverse approaches to human semantic cognition, by equipping existing theories with rich world knowledge, is likely to be a fruitful area of research for years to come.     <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Collins &amp; Quillian (1969)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(A)</ref> and moderators of the effects documented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Rips et al.

Again, the SOE model replicated the results, and the remaining models failed to generate negative correlations for negatively correlated features. The differences shown above are significant according to a regression model in which BERT's correlations (obtained using BERT's output activations) are regressed on a binary variable indicating whether or not the feature pair was positively or negatively correlated in Malt and Smith.

Standard distributed semantics models like GloVe are trained on word co-occurrence statistics. For this reason, their word vectors represent the degree to which different words are semantically related or associated with each other. Although generic semantic relation or association does often correlate with semantic similarity, there are settings in which words can be positively associated but dissimilar (e.g. cat and fur or refrigerator and food). To disentangle association from similarity, Hill et al. (2015) curated a set of 999 word pairs, and asked participants to judge these word pairs based on their synonymy or similarity. Participants were specifically instructed to give low ratings to word pairs that were related but dissimilar. The word pairs used in Hill et al. were obtained from the USF free association norms dataset</figDesc></figure>

(2019) (the main difference being that Derby et al. fit feature vectors to data rather than averaging GloVe vectors). We have found that the GloVe similarity model achieves roughly identical performance to the language model. Semantic relatedness or association have been implicated in both semantic cognition and in previous work on high-level judgment, however our analysis shows that these cues are not enough to predict actual semantic judgment. Rather what is necessary is a model that can take into account word order and represent sentences using multiple layers of interactive, attention-based processing.</figDesc></figure>

(2014)  to learn feature representations as vectors in a GloVe semantic space. This approach, known as Feature2Vec, is closely related to our GloVe model, in that the degree to which a feature is attributed to a concept is assumed to be proportional to the semantic similarity between the concept and the feature vector. Of course, the Feature2Vec feature representations are obtained not by a simple bag-of-words averaging of the GloVe vectors (as we did above) but by finding the feature vectors in the GloVe space that best predict participant responses. This approach allows Feature2Vec to potentially uncover feature representations that diverge from the averaged GloVe representations of their component words. Due to its reliance on participant data, Feature2Vec is able to accurately model feature norms and successfully predict features for out-of-sample concepts (it also outperforms previous approaches based on similar data, such as PSLR -<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">FÇgÇrÇÅan et al., 2015)</ref>.Feature2Vec does, however, have limitations: Its need for extensive training data makes it difficult for it to learn representations when feature data is sparse. This is why Derby et al.(2019) trained and tested Feature2Vec on experimenter-processed variants of the McRae et al. and Devereux et al. datasets, which pooled semantically related features. In this application, Feature2Vec learnt a single feature representation for distinct features like has fur, is fluffy, and has hair, and had representations for only 2,725 features in the Devereux et al. dataset. BERT, in contrast, requires minimal experimenter preprocessing of features, which is why we were able to train and test it on all 26,075 raw subject-generated features in the Devereux et al. dataset. Feature2Vec's reliance on subject-generated features also explains why it is unable to extrapolate its learnt knowledge to out-of-sample features: Features that are absent in the training data just cannot be given vector representations. Again, BERT does not have this limitation, and successfully predicts out-of-sample features and features composed of novel word combinations (just as it does out-of-sample concepts). Despite the unique strengths of BERT relative to Feature2Vec, it is useful to examine BERT's performance in the types of settings in which Feature2Vec excels. To do this, we trained and tested a separate set of models on variants of the McRae et al. (2005) and Devereux et al. (2014) datasets outlined above. Specifically, we (1) obtained the cross-validation splits used in Derby et al. (2019); (2) trained the full BERT model on the features for the training concepts in Derby et al. (400 concepts from McRae et al., and 500 from Devereux et al.); and (3) tested the full BERT model on the features of the test concepts in Derby et al. (141 concepts from McRae et al., and 138 from Devereux et al.). As in Derby et al., our tests measured the overlap betweenobserved and predicted features. In the case of a concept with K features, we obtained the K features that yielded the strongest activation in favor of true (vs. false) for the concept in the trained BERT model. Overlap was calculated by measuring the proportion of predicted features in the subject-generated features dataset. To further mimic the tests in Derby et al. we used experimenter-processed features (rather than raw subject-generated features) in our training and test data, and generated false sentences using only the 'concept replacement' negative sampling method (and not the 'subject object method'). In this way we replicated Derby et al.'s tests with BERT. However, unlike Derby et al., who negatively sampled at a rate of 20x, we negatively sampled a rate of only 5x (due to computational constraints).</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Lastly, we examined<ref type="bibr" target="#b77">McRae et al.'s (1997)</ref> finding that feature correlations predict response times in semantic verification. This effect is the basis of a recurrent neural network theory in which feature representations guide semantic cognition. Although McRae et al.'s theory is somewhat different to the transformer networks tested here, it is still possible that our networks reproduce their main results. Indeed, as we show in the Distribution of Features Across Concepts section below, our full BERT model successfully predicts feature correlations documented in prior research, implying that it should be able to capture response time effects attributed to these correlations.The stimuli we used in our analysis were taken from Appendix C of McRae et al. This appendix contains a set of 37 target features (e.g. hunted by people), each associated with a 'strong' (e.g. deer) and a 'weak' (e.g. duck) concept. Target features were highly correlated with other features belonging to the strong concept, but weakly or negatively correlated with other features belonging to the weak concept. McRae et al. hypothesized that semantic verification should be quicker for strong concepts relative to weak concepts for a target feature, and in Experiment 3A they successfully documented this result. Additionally, in Experiment 3B, they</figDesc><table><row><cell>stimuli (Î² = 0.41,</cell></row><row><cell>t(460) = 2.45, p &lt; 0.05, 95% CI = [0.08,0.74]) and for Collins &amp; Quillian's (1969) stimuli (Î² =</cell></row><row><cell>1.39, t(151) = 3.47, p = &lt; 0.01, 95% CI = [0.60,2.18]).</cell></row></table><note>Effect 7: McRae et al.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_6"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>They found that participants were fairly consistent for sentences involving highly typical exemplars (e.g. chair is furniture), as well as for sentences involving unrelated exemplars (e.g. cucumber is furniture). However, participants were inconsistent for sentences involving atypical exemplars (e.g. bookends are furniture). McCloskey and Glucksberg took their results as evidence that natural categories are fuzzy sets with graded set-membership relations described by typicality, rather than clear boundaries or formal definitions.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Effect 9: McCloskey and Glucksberg (1978) Experiment 1.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_8"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>However, Hampton found that many concept and superordinate category combinations violated transitivity. For example, participants agreed that husky is a dog and dog is a pet, but disagreed that husky is a pet. He argued that this finding suggests that semantic memory is not hierarchically structured, but rather influenced by typicality and fuzzy set membership relations, according to which concepts can be typical of their close superordinate categories (direct hypernyms) but not the remote superordinate categories (indirect hypernyms) above them.Hampton's experiments involved 74 triplets of concept combinations, consisting of a subordinate category, e.g. husky, a basic category, e.g. dog, and a superordinate category, e.g.pet. These categories spanned a large variety of domains, including vehicles, household appliances, stones, tools, weapons, and animals, and were associated with varying levels of transitivity violations in the two experiments. Hampton listed the triplets in the appendix of his paper, and we used these triplets to generate pairs of natural language sentences to offer to our models. The first sentence in each pair had the form [SUBORDINATE] is a [BASIC] (e.g. husky is a dog) and the second had the form [SUBORDINATE] is a [SUPERORDINATE] (e.g. husky is a pet). Each triplet in Hampton's data was associated with an 'intransitivity percentage'statistic describing the proportion of participants violating transitivity for the triplet. Our goal was to predict this statistic. We did this by taking the difference in our models' predictions for the first sentence and the second sentence.Higher differences would indicate that the model is more likely to think [SUBORDINATE] is a [BASIC] is true but [SUBORDINATE] is a [SUPERORDINATE] is false.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

Our goal was to use the full BERT model to predict the asymmetries in this table. We obtained its predictions by asking the model to judge natural language sentences of the form [WORD 1] is a The activation states outputted by BERT for these sentences were subtracted from each other to obtain a predicted asymmetry rating for the word pairs.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_12"><head>The Power of Transformer Networks A predictive model.</head><label></label><figDesc>We have trained and tested a transformer network of human conceptual knowledge. Our BERT model can predict what people know about thousands of concepts and features, including concepts and features not in the human data on which it is fine-</figDesc><table><row><cell>tuned. For this reason, it can be applied to stimuli from previous empirical research on semantic</cell></row><row><cell>cognition, and we show that our full model reproduces fifteen out of sixteen classical effects</cell></row><row><cell>documented in twenty-three distinct experiments. The predictive power and generality of our</cell></row><row><cell>model are unparalleled. There have been many cognitive theories of semantic representation and</cell></row><row><cell>retrieval in the past fifty years, yet none are able to describe human responses for arbitrary</cell></row><row><cell>(linguistically encodable) concepts and features, or quantitatively model key patterns of semantic</cell></row><row><cell>cognition by predicting responses on existing experimental stimuli sets.</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_13"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Analyzing the behavior of models like BERT can also generate new insights about human cognition. For example, we have shown that BERT relies on cues such as feature frequency and concept-feature association. BERT's representations, and in turn, predictions, are also sensitive to relational context. As these predictions tend to mimic those of human participants, it is likely that human semantic judgement also relies on a similar set of cues. In future work, BERT could be used to exhaustively evaluate which of a large number of statistical and linguistic variables map onto prediction, which in turn could stimulate new experimental hypotheses and tests. By mimicking human behavior, predictive models like BERT enable researchers to identify novel behavioral phenomena and improve existing theories (see<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agrawal et al., 2020</ref>, for a recent demonstration of this idea).A more interesting issue involves what it means to have a psychological model of semantic cognition. Consider, for example, latent semantic analysis (LSA)</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_14"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, three prominent distributed semantics models. It is hard to argue that these are complete models of how people actually learn knowledge representations. They also do not offer process-level mechanisms for retrieving knowledge and mapping learnt representations onto responses, response times, and recall probabilities. Finally, these models are limited to measuring conceptconcept association, and cannot capture most sophisticated features of human semantic cognition (e.g. relational representation and reasoning). Yet these models have had tremendous impact on psychological research. This impact is due to the fact that: 1. They quantitatively predict benchmark psychological phenomena, such as similarity ratings and free association. 2. They have broad architectural similarities to established cognitive modeling approaches: LSA can be implemented in a connectionist network, topic modeling uses theories in Bayesian cognitive science, and BEAGLE uses convolutional and superposition properties of memory systems. 3.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
