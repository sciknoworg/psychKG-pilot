			<abstract>
				<p>Over the past several decades, researchers in psychology, neuroscience, marketing, and economics have been keen to understand context effects in multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision-making. These effects occur when choices among existing alternatives are altered by the addition of a new alternative to the choice set. The effects violate classic decision theories and have led to the development of computational and mathematical models that explain how the effects arise due to underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms. This paper reviews the class of dynamic models of these effects, comparing mechanisms across models. We observe that most models of context effects incorporate an attention mechanism, suggesting attention plays an important role in multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision-making. We conclude by discussing recent empirical studies of attention and context effects and hypothesize that changes in attention could be responsible for recently observed reversals in context effects.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Many of life's decisions -whether it be shopping for cereal or buying a home -involve multiple options that have different features. A core question in psychology, economics, marketing, and neuroscience is how do people make choices in these complex situations?</p><p>Importantly, research has shown that the context created by a set of options influences people's choices. Over the past several decades, there has been extensive empirical and theoretical work on understanding "context effects" in multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice. Most of this research has focused on three "core" context effects: the attraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Huber, Payne, &amp; Puto, 1982)</ref>, compromise <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Simonson, 1989)</ref>, and similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tversky, 1972)</ref> effects. These effects are empirical demonstrations of how choices between two existing options can change with the introduction of a third, new alternative.</p><p>To illustrate the effects, imagine you are deciding between two hotels for an upcoming trip (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1a)</ref>. One of the hotels, call this hotel X, is in a great location (e.g., in walking distance to the best restaurants, shops, and museums), but is expensive. Whereas the other hotel, call this one Y, is in a worse location, but is cheaper. Thus, there is a tradeoff in convenience and price for X and Y. Further, suppose that you are conflicted about this tradeoff and equally likely to select either X or Y. Now, suppose you learn of a third hotel, call this one A, that is similar to hotel X, but is in a slightly worse location and a little more expensive than X. A is termed a "dominated decoy" because option X is superior on both the attributes of price and convenience.</p><p>In this case, A makes X look better and you ultimately choose X. This phenomenon is known as the attraction effect.</p><p>In the similarity effect, the third option is similar to one of the existing options and competes with that option. In this case, the dissimilar option is selected. For example, consider a hotel called S that is similar to Y on both convenience and price dimensions. A similarity effect occurs when X is selected out of the choice set {X, Y, S}. In the compromise effect, the third option is an extreme option that makes one of the existing options appear as a compromise. For example, consider a hotel called C that is in the best location, but very expensive. In the choice set {X, Y, C}, X appears like a compromise between C and Y. The compromise effect occurs when X is selected over Y. Note that the difference between the similarity and compromise effects is related to the distance between the third option, S or C, and the existing options. In the similarity effect, the third alternative is very close to one of the existing alternatives. In the compromise effect, the third alternative is an extreme alternative, further away from the existing alternatives.</p></div>

The economy attribute is the inverse of price (i.e., lower on economy implies a higher price). The colored regions show standard locations for the third (decoy) alternative for the three effects. Panel b: Schematic of a canonical preference accumulation model with three accumulators and internal stopping rule governed by the decision threshold. In this example, accumulator X reaches the threshold first and thus would be the option chosen. Context effects were originally used as examples of how people's choices violate the principles of classic decision theories. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Luce's (1959)</ref> ratio of strengths model is an example of a theory violated by context effects. In this model, the probability of selecting an option is the strength s of the option divided by the sum of the strengths of all options:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( |{ , , }) = ( ) ( ) + ( ) + ( ) .</formula><p>Here the notation p(X | {X, Y, A}) is the probability of choosing option X out of the choice set {X, Y, A}. To see why the attraction effect leads to a violation of the model, consider two choice sets {X, Y, AX} and {X, Y, AY} where AX and AY are dominated decoys similar to X and Y, Understanding the mechanisms that underlie context effects could shed light on how preferences form in multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision tasks more generally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dynamic Models of Context Effects</head><p>For more than three decades, researchers have developed mathematical and computational models of context effects. At the time of writing, there are dozens of models of context effects across the fields of economics, marketing, psychology, and neuroscience. These models range from rational models based on Bayesian belief updating <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Rigoli, Mathys, Friston, &amp; Dolan, 2017)</ref> to theories about normalization among populations of neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dumbalska, Li, Tsetsos, &amp; Summerfield, 2020</ref>). In the current review, we focus on a subset of these models developed to explain the dynamics of multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision-making.</p><p>The class of models we consider here are known as evidence accumulation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ratcliff, 1978)</ref> and share some foundational assumptions. First, these models assume that during the course of deliberation, evidence (preference in the case of value-based decisions) for different options is accumulated. Each option is associated with an accumulator that tracks the evidence state for that option. Second, these models assume that decisions are determined by the amount of accumulated evidence for each option at either a fixed time (i.e., external stopping rule) or when the first accumulator reaches an internal decision threshold (i.e., internal stopping rule). In the latter case, evidence accumulation models account for both the choices people make and their response times (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1b</ref> for an illustration). Evidence accumulation models are well suited to studying context effects because research has shown that these effects often change during the time course of deliberation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Pettibone, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cataldo &amp; Cohen, 2021)</ref>, where the effects are small for quick decisions and larger for slow decisions.</p><p>To date, there are at least nine different dynamic models of context effects as listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Some of these models, such as Multi-alternative Decision Field Theory (MDFT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Roe, Busemeyer, &amp; Townsend, 2001)</ref>, have been studied and tested extensively over the years. Other models, such as the Normalization and Urgency Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Tajima, Drugowitsch, Patel, &amp; Pouget, 2019</ref>) and the Gaze-dependent Leaky Accumulator (GLA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Molter, Thomas, Huettel, Heekeren, &amp; Mohr, 2021)</ref> are relatively new theories and thus have been studied less. Looking at <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1,</ref> one might wonder which model is the "best". That is, which model provides the best account of context effects and multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice more generally. This turns out to be a difficult question to answer because while the models all have a similar foundation (i.e., being evidence accumulation models), they also have a number of additional assumptions that can make comparison difficult. Currently there have only been a handful of attempts to quantitatively compare some of these models, and those attempts have led to different conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Noguchi &amp; Stewart, 2018;</ref>. At the time of writing, there have been no attempts to compare all nine models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>One promising avenue for future research on evaluating and comparing models is the "switchboard analysis" developed by , where a model is viewed as a set of assumptions (e.g., how attention is processed, how attributes are compared, etc.) representing different decisions to be made by the modeler. In the switchboard approach, these decision points are referred to as "nodes" and the different options available at the decision points are referred to as "switches". A large family of possible models in generated by defining a set of switches for each possible node.  used the switchboard approach to evaluate 432 different dynamic models of context effects. Their "nodes" and "switches" were defined using mechanisms from four of the models listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> (i.e., MDFT, LCA, AAM, and MLBA).</p><p>Thus, their approach provided a comprehensive comparison of all possible combinations of the mechanisms in these models. We think such an approach is very promising as it provides a thorough exploration of the space of possible models. to explain context effects: inhibition and attention. Inhibition is the capacity of one option to reduce the evidence accumulated for other options. Specifically, the attraction effect arises due to "negative inhibition" from the dominated decoy to the dominating option. Conceptually, this is akin to a double negative, leading to a boost in evidence accumulation for the dominating option.</p><p>The similarity effect arises through attention switching between the two attributes. In the model, attention is either allocated to one attribute or the other at any moment in time. When attention is allocated to the attribute favoring the dissimilar alternative (e.g., the attribute "convenience"</p><p>favoring option X in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), it gains an advantage. Likewise, when attention is allocated to the attribute favoring the similar alternatives (e.g., the attribute "economy" favoring Y and S in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), they gain an advantage. This dynamic attention switching process leads to a positive correlation in evidence accumulation between the similar options. Someone focusing their attention more on "convenience" will end up selecting option X. However, someone focusing their attention more on "economy" will select either Y or S, roughly equally due to the correlation in evidence accumulation. Like the attraction effect, the compromise effect arises through inhibition. In this case, negative inhibition results in evidence accumulation for the compromise option being negatively correlated with evidence for both extremes. This correlation leads to a probabilistic advantage for the compromise option due to the stochastic nature of the model.  While attention is common to almost all models of context effects, other mechanisms in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> appear in only some of the models. For example, several theories incorporate the relative evaluation of options. In these models, the evaluation of an option occurs by comparing the option to an internal reference point (i.e., a reference point determined by the other options in the choice set). In MDFT, an option is evaluated by comparing it to the mean of the other options. In other models such as the LCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Usher, &amp; McClelland, 2004)</ref>, MDbS, and MLBA, an option is evaluated through pairwise comparisons along a single attribute. The idea of pairwise comparisons originates from <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tversky &amp; Simonson's (1993)</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. This suggests that future research should more carefully study the relationship between attention and context effects in order to refine our understanding of this critical mechanism. Below we describe some recent empirical work along these lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Looking at</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical Studies of Attention and Context Effects</head><p>Recent research on context effects has examined the impact of attentional and comparative processes by (1) measuring visual attention using eye-tracking and (2) manipulating the layout of options on the screen. With respect to the former, one of the first studies to use eyetracking to understand gaze patterns in context effects was <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Noguchi and Stewart (2014)</ref>. They found that eye-movements revealed a series of comparisons between pairs of alternatives along a single dimension consistent with many dynamic models of context effects, including MDbS, MLBA, the 2N-ary Choice Tree (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Marini, Ansani, &amp; Paglieri (2020)</ref> used eye-tracking to understand how dominated decoys impact eye-movements in the attraction effect. They found that decoys result in more consecutive shifts of attention between the decoy and target, suggesting an increase in comparing target and decoy options during choice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Molter et al. (2021)</ref> found that target options received greater relative dwell time than competitor options in both the attraction and compromise effects. Overall, these results show that attention and how it shifts during deliberation plays a key role in understanding context effects.</p><p>Other studies have revealed the impact of presentation layout on the strength of context effects, shedding light on how attention could modulate the effects. For example, Evans et al.</p><p>(2021) reanalyzed data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Trueblood, Brown, Heathcote, &amp; Busemeyer (2013)</ref> and found that the spatial ordering (i.e., right to left placement of alternatives on the screen) impacted the strength of the attraction effect. In orderings where the target and decoy were adjacent, a standard effect was generally observed. However, when the competitor came between the target and decoy (i.e., it was the middle option), a reversed attraction effect occurred. These results likely arise because it is easier to shift attention between (and thus compare) adjacent options.</p><p>When the competitor is the middle option, it potentially receives more attention and thus accumulates evidence (preference) faster than the other options, leading to a reversal of the attraction effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">He and Sternthal (2018)</ref> found a similar effect of spatial order on the attraction effect in consumer choice tasks. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Spektor et al. (2018)</ref> found strong reversals of the attraction effect when options were spatially arranged far apart in a triangular configuration.</p><p>Related research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cataldo &amp; Cohen (2019)</ref> found that manipulating the presentation format of a choice set (i.e., the arrangement of options in a table) impacted the presence of context effects. They found standard attraction and compromise effects, but a reversed similarity effect in a "by-dimension" format (i.e., options are displayed in separate rows with their attributes listed in different columns). However, they found a null attraction effect and reversed compromise effect, but a standard similarity effect in a "by-alternative" format (i.e., options are displayed in separate columns with their attributes listed in different rows). Similar to the findings discussed above on spatial arrangement, these results likely arise from the interaction of attention and choice set layout.</p><p>Attention not only influences what individuals look at, but also how they encode information into memory. The effects of attention on memory are also relevant when thinking about context effects. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bhatia (2014)</ref> found that participants had increased memory for features shared by target and decoy options (as measured using a recall task), which mediated the strength of the attraction effect. In this case, attention to the shared features of the target and decoy likely enhanced the encoding of these features in memory, which then impacted behavior.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Trueblood et al., 2013)</ref> and species <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Latty &amp; Trueblood, 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>When thinking about empirical and theoretical developments with regards to context effects, an important outstanding problem is understanding reversals of these effects. Recent studies have documented reversals of context effects (see , for a review), but it is unknown when and why reversals occur. On the one hand, this has caused some researchers to question the importance of these effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Frederick, Lee, &amp; Baskin, 2014)</ref>. On the other hand, this provides researchers an opportunity to refine our understanding of how fundamental cognitive processes, such as attention, play a role in multi-alternative, multiattribute choice. It will require both new empirical and computational modeling work to elucidate these processes.</p><p>On the empirical side, new experiments are needed to explore the factors that lead to reversals. We hypothesize that attention might be critical to understanding reversals based on the research showing that presentation layout influences the effects. However, it still remains unclear exactly how presentation layout impacts attention. Eye-tracking studies that manipulate layout could help shed light on this question.</p><p>On the theoretical side, research is needed to understand the cognitive mechanisms responsible for context effect reversals. Many of the existing models discussed in this review cannot fully account for recent empirical demonstrations of context effect reversals or how choices change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cataldo &amp; Cohen, 2021)</ref>. Thus, new modeling approaches are needed.</p><p>The "switchboard" modeling approach of  could prove very useful in exploring the space of models that can produce both standard and reversed context effects along with identifying the relevant underlying cognitive mechanisms. Importantly, this approach could help distinguish among the various implementations of attention listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. Another important goal for future research will be using information about how choices change over time to evaluate models. To date, there have only been a few studies evaluating models using both choices and response times (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cataldo &amp; Cohen, 2021)</ref>. In sum, coupling the new modeling approaches and empirical studies aimed at manipulating the presence / absence of context effects could reveal new insights into the dynamics of multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision-making and how preferences evolve over time.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>respectively. The attraction effect implies p(X | {X, Y, AX}) &gt; p(X | {X, Y, AY}) and according to the ratio of strengths model, we must have s(AX) &lt; s(AY). On the other hand, the attraction effect also implies p(Y | {X, Y, AX}) &lt; p(Y | {X, Y, AY}) and according to the ratio of strengths model, we must have s(AX) &gt; s(AY). Since s(AX) &lt; s(AY) and s(AX) &gt; s(AY) cannot both be true, the assumptions of the model are violated. In particular, this is a violation of the assumption of "independence from irrelevant alternatives", which states that the probability of choosing an alternative over another does not depend on the choice set.More recently, these effects have been instrumental in the development of formal models of multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice. Since they cannot be explained by classic decision theories, such the ratio of strengths model, theorists in psychology and neuroscience have been keen to understand the cognitive and neural mechanisms that give rise to the effects.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>, we see that models typically involve multiple mechanisms. As described above, attention and inhibition are critical to explaining context effects in MDFT.While different models evoke different mechanisms, there is one interesting similarity across almost all models. Eight out of nine models have attention mechanisms, suggesting attention is important for context effects. While the specific implementation of attention varies from model to model, the basic idea is the same. When someone is faced with multiple options that vary on multiple attributes, they cannot allocate attention to everything simultaneously. Rather, they allocate attention to a subset of information and accumulate evidence on the currently attended information. Throughout deliberation, individuals shift this "window of attention" to evaluate the various options. In MDFT, the window of attention includes all options along a single attribute.</figDesc><table><row><cell>In MDbS (Noguchi &amp; Stewart, 2018), the window of attention includes a pair of options along a</cell></row></table><note>single attribute. In MLBA (Trueblood, Brown, &amp; Heathcote, 2014), the window of attention includes pairwise comparisons similar to MDbS; however, this is modeled through weight parameters rather than explicit shifts of attention due to the ballistic nature of evidence accumulation. In Table 2, we describe the window of attention (i.e., what is attended) and how attention is implemented in the eight models with attention mechanisms. As can be seen from the table, there are a variety of different ways attention has been interpreted in these models. We note that one model, the Normalization and Urgency Model (Tajima, Drugowitsch, Patel, &amp; Pouget, 2019), does not include an attention mechanism. Rather this model accounts for context effects through divisive normalization (i.e., the phenomenon where the firing rate of a neuron is normalized by summing the firing rates of a pool of neurons and dividing by that sum).</note></figure>

Originally studied to demonstrate violations of classic decision theories, in recent years, context effects have helped researchers investigate the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice. As discussed in this review, there are many different theoretical accounts of context effects. While attention is common to most dynamic models of context effects, divisive normalization offers an alternative explanation. It is possible that there are multiple pathways to context effects. Such a view might explain why context effects often appear ubiquitous, occurring in different domains</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
