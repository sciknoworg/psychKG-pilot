			<abstract>
				<p>Value-based decisions are driven by subjective estimates of value for each available option, but recent work has shown that subjective measures of certainty about those value estimates also influence choice behavior. Cognitive and computational theories have proposed that decisionmakers process information about choice options in order to reduce their uncertainty about their value estimates before choosing an option. One theory specifically proposes that value estimates are refined during deliberation, which results in more certain-and sometimes revised-value estimates after the choice relative to before. Here we examine the idea that choice options hold different levels of familiarity for decision-makers, and that familiarity can influence the degree to which certainty gain or value revision occurs. Our results show that both certainty gain and value revision are decreasing functions of initial certainty-which we classify as a demand effect-and increasing functions of familiarity-which we classify as a supply effect. Together, these results provide support for our supply and demand approach to the processing of information during decision-making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>When pondering a decision, people sometimes take a long time to deliberate, yet other times choose relatively quickly. Many studies have demonstrated a so-called speed-accuracy tradeoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Heitz, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Keramati et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wickelgren, 1977)</ref>, in which a decision-making agent controls the speed of its responses (i.e., how long it deliberates before making a choice) according to its target accuracy level (i.e., the frequency with which it expects its choices to be correct, given its selected response speed). For preferential choices, where value is subjective, the speed-accuracy tradeoff could instead be thought of as an effort-confidence tradeoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bénon et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lee &amp; Daunizeau, 2021)</ref>. The Metacognitive Control of Decisions (MCD) model assumes that mental effort (e.g., deliberation) is aversive, and that confidence (in the impending choice) is gratifying <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lee &amp; Daunizeau, 2021)</ref>. Therefore, the moment-by-moment control of resource allocation to the decision process is determined by a cost-benefit analysis: deliberation comes at a cost (e.g., time, neural bandwidth, metabolites), but yields an anticipated benefit (e.g., confidence; ).</p><p>The MCD approach provides a normative extension of the sequential sampling framework that is ubiquitous in the decision-making literature (e.g., the drift-diffusion model or DDM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Ratcliff et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008)</ref>). According to sequential sampling accounts, evidence (about which option is better) accumulates in the mind of the agent during deliberation, and the process terminates when a pre-determined threshold is reached. The dynamic or online version of MCD (oMCD; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bénon et al., 2024)</ref>) has components that involve sequential sampling, except that the shape of the decision frontier is determined optimally by agent-specific parameters (reflecting the relative value of confidence versus mental effort, as well as the efficiency of information processing) and the characteristics of the decision at hand (e.g., initial</p><p>Supply &amp; Demand Approach to Information Processing 4 value estimates and certainty 1 ). The MCD approach is thus based on information processing related to the set of choice options (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fudenberg et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Tajima et al., 2016)</ref> for a similar normative approach). Recent work suggests that the sampled evidence is scaled by its precision while accumulating (signal-to-noise DDM or snDDM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Lee &amp; Usher, 2023)</ref>), adding further support to the idea that the costs and benefits of information processing will differ according to the specific decision context.</p><p>Agents estimate the values of different options with different degrees of certainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(De Martino et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gwinn &amp; Krajbich, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lee &amp; Coricelli, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lee &amp; Daunizeau, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lee &amp; Hare, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Polanía et al., 2019)</ref>, which suggests that information processing during a decision should not be equally distributed across the choice set. Both the MCD and the snDDM incorporate the concept of value certainty, yet both are agnostic as to how information processing might differ among the options in the set. The attentional DDM (aDDM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Krajbich et al., 2010))</ref> takes this idea into account by including a parameter that makes information processing a function of attention. Specifically, the latent evidence indicating how valuable an option is relative to the other will accumulate at a faster rate while the agent attends to that option. This approach has been suggested to account for any type of decision-relevant information processing, not only that related to positive value <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Sepulveda et al., 2020)</ref>. One potential shortcoming, however, is that shifts in attention are considered to be events exogenous to the decision process. It seems probable, however, that the dynamics of attentional shifts will be closely linked to the dynamics of information processing that guide the decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gluth et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">He &amp; Bhatia, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Recent theoretical work has attempted to explain how agents should optimally allocate their attention during deliberation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Callaway et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jang et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Song et al., 2019)</ref>. In that work, the control of deliberation (i.e., whether to process additional information and, if so, which option to attend to) is determined by a cost-benefit analysis. The cost includes a general deliberation cost as well as an attention-switching cost. The benefit differs as a function of the current state -when the value certainty of an option is lower, the benefit of information processing (which directly increases the certainty via a Bayesian updating of the value estimate) is higher. In other words, the value of information will be higher for options with lower certainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Howard, 1966)</ref>. This approach accounts well for empirical data and has the additional lure of describing attentional shifts from a normative perspective, integral to the decision process itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Callaway et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jang et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Song et al., 2019)</ref>. Nevertheless, it may still be missing a key component. Inherent in this approach, at least in its current form, is the assumption that allocating resources to process additional information will necessarily result in information gain in a predictable and uniform manner. This assumption may not be realistic.</p><p>It seems reasonable to believe that thinking about different options will provide different levels of information, even when controlling for the need (i.e., uncertainty) and the intention (i.e., attentional focus). Sometimes an agent might seek information about an option yet not find it.</p><p>Other times, a mere glimpse at an option might trigger a cascade of new information. This would suggest that information availability may differ between options. Furthermore, information about some options may be more accessible than about others (e.g., from memory; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brocas &amp; Carrillo, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fazio et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gwinn &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>). This concept of information accessibility may relate to familiarity, where more familiar options might provide more precise mental representations and thus more accessible information retrieval. Accessibility may also relate to fluency, where characteristics of the features of a stimulus allow information about it to be processed more or less easily. Stimuli that are easier to process are associated with higher value estimates and confidence judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alter &amp; Oppenheimer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Oppenheimer, 2008)</ref>. More generally, processing fluency magnifies informational content regardless of its valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hertwig et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Landwehr &amp; Eckmann, 2020)</ref>. It therefore seems compelling to claim that decisionmaking theories and models should incorporate some notion of information accessibility (where availability would be subsumed by accessibility, in the sense that information that is poorly available would necessarily be poorly accessible). Specifically, higher accessibility should lead to a decreased cost and/or an increased benefit of information processing. The cost will decrease because the information will be easier to acquire; the benefit might also increase because the gain in certainty from the influx of information might occur at a higher rate.</p><p>Our working hypothesis allows us to make a variety of predictions about effects we expect to find in experimental data. Our main predictions relate to the potential impact of value certainty and information accessibility (here operationalized as familiarity) on choice. Choice consistency and confidence have positive relationships with initial certainty, and response time (RT) and subjective mental effort have negative relationships with initial certainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lee &amp; Daunizeau, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>We expect qualitatively similar relationships between each of these dependent variables (consistency, confidence, RT, and effort) and familiarity. If decision-making is based on information processing, one could consider familiarity to be tantamount to the quantity of available information and certainty to be tantamount to the quality of that information. Both higher quantity and higher quality information should facilitate decisions, thus resulting in greater consistency and confidence, and lesser RT and effort. Certainty gain (final minus initial certainty rating) has a negative relationship with initial certainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lee &amp; Daunizeau, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lee &amp; Hare, 2023)</ref>. We expect certainty gain to have a positive relationship with familiarity. If certainty gain represents an augmentation of information that occurs during choice deliberation, it should benefit from both Supply &amp; Demand Approach to Information Processing 7 demand for information (lesser initial certainty) and supply of information (greater familiarity).</p><p>When both supply and demand are present, substantial information gain should take place -the agent will simultaneously want to obtain new information and be able to do so. To that end, we also predict a negative interaction effect of information supply and demand: certainty gain for an option will be highest when initial certainty for that option is low and familiarity for that option is high. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> provides an illustrative example of the proposed process.</p><p>According to the theoretical account of value refinement during deliberation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lee &amp; Daunizeau, 2020</ref>, people process additional information when trying to decide between available options, and this leads to two general effects. First, as described above, their feelings of certainty about the values of the different options increase relative to how they felt before starting to think about the decision. Second, their initial value estimates for the options often change as they incorporate new information that was previously neglected or overlooked. We predict that the magnitude of such value changes (the absolute value of final ratings minus initial ratings) will follow certainty gain -it should be greatest when initial certainty is lowest and when familiarity is highest. Our results provide evidence in support of the value refinement account. value difference of 0.05 in favor of option 2 (center plot). However, these estimates are not certain, thus there is some width in the representative value distributions (here, a standard deviation of 0.10 for option 1 and 0.12 for option 2). This uncertainty creates a demand for additional information processing, for without that, confidence in the choice would stand at only 20% (right plot). Middle row: Because option 2 has the greater uncertainty (demand) when first considered (as shown in the top row), the agent focuses on that option (gazed fixated on the baguette). Option 2 is more familiar to the agent, thus there is also a greater supply of information to be processed (here depicted as binary bits for simplicity). This combination of demand and supply leads to a reduction of the uncertainty about option 2 (center plot; standard deviation reduced to 0.05) as well as a revision of the value estimate (now 0.50). Choice confidence rises to 50% (right plot), but the agent still has a demand for more information to increase its confidence even more. Bottom row:</p><p>Now option 1 has the greater uncertainty, so the agent focuses on it (gaze fixated on the pretzel).</p><p>The agent processes the relatively low amount of information about option 1 that it finds in its memory, leading to a (lesser) certainty gain and value revision (center plot; standard deviation reduced to 0.08, estimate revised to 0.35). Confidence rises to 76% (right plot) and the agent chooses option 2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10</head><p>The sample size for the original study was determined by following precedent in previous studies that examined the same general phenomenon (relating to so-called choice-induced preference change) and simply opting for a similar number of participants. Trials with excessively long or short response times (greater than 10s or lesser than 0.5s) were excluded from our analyses (1% of all rating trials, 1% of all choice trials). The original study included a time pressure penalty on a randomly-selected 10% of trials (a small decrease in the bonus payment as a function of RT on those trials) and a consequentiality condition on a randomly-selected 10% of trials (participants would receive and consume a portion of the food options they chose on those trials). We did not analyze these trials separately, because those conditions are not theoretically relevant to the current study and because they did not qualitatively change the results in the original study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Participants</head><p>All participants were native French speakers, with no reported history of psychiatric or neurological illness. A total of 41 people (28 female; age: mean = 28, SD = 5, min = 20, max = 40) participated in the study. All participants provided written informed consent prior to commencing the experiment. The study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The experiment was approved by the ethics committee of the Paris Brain Institute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Materials</head><p>Written instructions provided detailed information about the sequence of tasks within the experiment, the mechanics of how participants would perform the tasks, and images illustrating what a typical screen within each task section would look like. The experiment was developed using Matlab and PsychToolbox and was conducted entirely in French. The stimuli for this experiment were 148 digital images, each representing a distinct food option (50 fruits, 50 vegetables, and 48 various snack options including nuts, meats, and cheeses). Food options were selected such that most options would be well known to most participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Task design</head><p>Prior to commencing the testing session of the experiment, participants underwent a brief training session. The training tasks were identical to the experimental tasks, although different stimuli were used (beverages). The experiment itself began with an initial passive section where all individual options were displayed in a random sequence for 1.5 s each, in order to familiarize the participants with the set of options they would later be considering and form an impression of the range of subjective value for the set. The main experiment was divided into three sections, following the classic Free-Choice Paradigm protocol (e.g., Izuma and Murayama, 2013): prechoice option ratings, choice, and post-choice option ratings. The main experiment was followed by an additional section where participants rated their level of familiarity with each option. There was no time limit for the overall experiment, nor for the different sections, nor for the individual trials. Participants generally took about half an hour to complete each rating section and about 15 minutes to complete the choice section.</p><p>The first and third experimental tasks solicited value ratings for individual options.</p><p>Participants were asked to rate the entire set of options in terms of how much they liked each option. The options were presented one at a time in a random sequence. At the onset of each trial, a fixation cross appeared at the center of the screen for 750 ms. Next, a solitary image of a food option appeared at the center of the screen. Participants responded to the question "How much do you like this item?" using a horizontal slider scale (labeled "I hate it!" at the left end and "I love it!" at the right end) to indicate their value rating for the option. The middle of the scale was the point of neutrality (labeled "I don't care about it."). Participants then responded to the question "What degree of certainty do you have?" (about the option's value) by expanding a solid bar symmetrically around the cursor of the value slider scale to indicate the range of possible value ratings that would be compatible with their subjective feeling. We measured participants' certainty about value rating in terms of the percentage of the value scale that is not occupied by the reported range of compatible value ratings. At that time, the next trial began. The post-choice rating task was structurally identical to the pre-choice rating task. The sequence of options was randomized separately for the two rating tasks. Regarding the post-choice ratings, participants were instructed not to try to remember their previous response but rather to respond according to how they felt at that moment.</p><p>The second experimental task provided participants with decisions between options.</p><p>Participants were asked to choose between pairs of options in terms of which option they preferred.</p><p>The entire set of options was presented one pair at a time in a random sequence. Each option appeared in only one pair. At the onset of each trial, a fixation cross appeared at the center of the screen for 750 ms. Next, two images of snack options appeared on the screen: one toward the left and one toward the right. Participants responded to the question "Which do you prefer?" using the left or right arrow key. Participants then responded to the question "Are you sure about your choice?" using a vertical slider scale (labeled "Not at all!" at the bottom and "Absolutely!" at the top) as a report of choice confidence. Finally, participants responded to the question "To what extent did you think about this choice?" using a horizontal slider scale (labeled "Not at all!" at the left and "Really a lot!" at the right) as a report of subjective effort. At that time, the next trial began.</p><p>Supply &amp; Demand Approach to Information Processing</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>13</head><p>In a separate task at the end of the experiment, participants provided familiarity ratings for each option. The structure was similar to that of the value rating tasks. For this task, participants viewed individual options displayed at the center of the computer screen and responded to the question "How familiar are you with this?" using a vertical slider scale labeled "Not at all!" at the bottom and "Absolutely!" at the top.</p><p>We thus have initial value estimates (V1) and certainty ratings (C1), final value estimates (V2) and certainty ratings (C2), and familiarity (F) ratings for each option for each participant. We also have the response, confidence estimate, RT, and subjective rating of mental effort for each choice for each participant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Analysis</head><p>We utilized mixed-effects regression models to test for fixed effects related to value, certainty, and familiarity on consistency (i.e., choices aligned with initial value estimates), confidence, RT, effort, and certainty gain (final minus initial certainty ratings). We used the fitlme Matlab function for the linear models and the fitglme Matlab function (with a binomial distribution and logit link) for the logistic models. We centered and scaled all variables in the choice regressions (except for the binary choice and consistency dependent variables). For individual options, we did not center or scale the variables in the rating regressions where we were specifically testing for non-zero intercept terms relating to changes from initial to final ratings. We included participants as random effects (both intercepts and slopes) in all regression models.</p><p>Realizing that concepts such as certainty and familiarity might be interchangeable in the minds of participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Du &amp; Budescu, 2021)</ref>, we tested to what extent initial certainty ratings correlated with familiarity ratings (within participant). Across participants, the mean Spearman's rho was only 0.29, indicating that the variables were indeed differentiable. It is also possible that familiarity might be conflated with value, as people would tend to choose things that they like more (over the course of their lives) and thereby become more familiar with those things relative to those that they like (and thus choose) less. We thus tested to what extent initial value ratings correlated with familiarity ratings (within participant). Across participants, the mean Spearman's rho was 0.47. For completeness, we tested to what extent initial value ratings correlated with initial certainty ratings (within participant). Across participants, the mean Spearman's rho was only 0.33.</p><p>To avoid complications with multicollinearity in our regression analyses, we orthogonalized the familiarity and initial value ratings. Specifically, we regressed familiarity on value and used the residuals as our measure of familiarity in the relevant regression models. To verify that the remaining variables would not be problematic in terms of multicollinearity, we calculated a variance inflation factor (VIF) for each regressor in the different design matrices. For the choice design matrix (sV1, dV1, sC1, dC1, sF, dF), all VIFs were less than 1.24. For the rating design matrix (V1, C1, F), all VIFs were less than 1.19. We concluded that multicollinearity would not be an issue for our analyses.</p><p>In the Supplementary Material, we summarize the variables included in our regression analyses by presenting histograms for each variable (pooled across participants).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Preliminary analyses</head><p>Before testing our hypotheses regarding the supply and demand approach to information processing, we ran some preliminary tests to get a basic understanding of how familiarity impacts choice behavior. We first tested for effects of value, certainty, and familiarity on choice (consistency, confidence, RT, and effort). We included value and certainty alongside familiarity because those variables are known to impact choice, so we wanted to test for the additional impact of familiarity beyond the impact of value and certainty. Specifically, we separately regressed consistency (logistic) and confidence, log(RT), and effort (linear) on the sums and differences of initial value, initial certainty, and familiarity (sV1, dV1, sC1, dC1, sF, and dF). We included the sum and difference terms for value and certainty because they have previously been shown to relate to choice behavior in a robust manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Frömer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gwinn &amp; Krajbich, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hunt et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lee &amp; Coricelli, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lee &amp; Daunizeau, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lee &amp; Hare, 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Polanía et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Smith &amp; Krajbich, 2019)</ref>. We included similar terms for familiarity in hopes to bolster initial previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fazio et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gwinn &amp; Krajbich, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lee et al., 2025)</ref>.</p><p>For the consistency regression, each of the difference terms (dV1, dC1, and dF) was calculated according to the higher-rated option minus the lower-rated option. For the other regressions, the difference terms were calculated according to the chosen option minus the rejected option. For all four dependent variables, the regression coefficients for most regressors (sums and differences of initial value, initial certainty, and familiarity) were in the predicted direction, although not all were statistically significant ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Qualitatively, the effects related to value and certainty were in line with what has previously been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lee &amp; Daunizeau, 2021)</ref>. Effects similar to the effects of familiarity sum and difference have been reported before in a similar choice context (see the effect of accessibility on choice in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gwinn &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>, there operationalized in a more complicated manner related to the speed with which participants provided ratings for each option).  0.18 (p = .009) 0.03 (p = .306) -0.03 (p = .219) 0.01 (p = .653) difference in certainty (dC1) 0.11 (p = .144) -0.02 (p = .286) -0.01 (p = .403) -0.04 (p = .063) sum of familiarity (sF) 0.10 (p = .048) 0.15 (p &lt; .001) -0.06 (p = .004) -0.05 (p = .035) difference in familiarity (dF) 0.25 (p &lt; .001) 0.10 (p &lt; .001) -0.05 (p = .007) -0.03 (p = .098)</p><p>We also tested whether familiarity with an option impacted its likelihood of being chosen.</p><p>We regressed choice (logistic, probability of choosing the left option) on initial value difference (dV1), initial certainty difference (dC1), and familiarity difference (dF) -each here defined as the left option minus the right. As expected, choices were predominately determined by value (regression coefficient for dV1 = 1.32, p &lt; .001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). Certainty did not seem to influence choice (p = .384). However, beyond value, participants also tended to choose the more familiar option (regression coefficient for dF = 0.19, p &lt; .001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Confirmatory analyses</head><p>Next, we tested for evidence in support of our supply and demand approach to information processing. We first tested our hypothesis that choice deliberation leads to an increase in value certainty. This would result in a certainty gain measured as the difference between final certainty (C2) and initial certainty (C1) for individual options. The effect should be stronger for those options whose value estimates were initially more uncertain (i.e., greater demand for information) and for those options that were more familiar (i.e., greater supply of information), and especially for options that had both low initial certainty and high familiarity. Indeed, this is what we found <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4)</ref>. We regressed certainty gain on initial certainty, familiarity, and their interaction. The intercept term was positive (0.69, p &lt; .001), indicating that certainty ratings increased on average across all options and participants. The regression coefficient for C1 was negative (-0.77, p &lt; .001), indicating that options with lower initial certainty had greater gains in certainty. The regression coefficient for F was positive (0.23, p &lt; .001), indicating that options with higher familiarity had greater certainty gains. The regression coefficient for the interaction of C1 and F was negative (-0.17, p = .015), indicating that there was an additional gain in certainty for options with both low initial certainty and high familiarity (i.e., greater information demand and supply). The above results show that the data support the idea that choice deliberation leads to a gain in value certainty; we checked whether value revision followed a similar pattern. Value revision refers to the idea that additional information processing during deliberation sometimes leads to an update of the initial value estimates, and that the magnitude of such an update might increase as a function of how much additional information was processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lee &amp; Daunizeau, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lee &amp; Holyoak, 2021)</ref>. We thus regressed value change (the magnitude of V2 -V1 for each option) on C1, F, and the interaction of C1 and F ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). The intercept term was positive, indicating that value ratings on average changed somewhat across all options and participants (0.18, p &lt; .001). The coefficient for C1 was negative (-0.11, p &lt; .001), the coefficient for F was positive (0.11, p &lt; .001), and the coefficient for the interaction of C1 and F was negative (-0.16, p &lt; .001). This pattern follows that for certainty gain and provides additional support of the supply and demand approach to information processing. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Exploratory analyses</head><p>If certainty and familiarity are indeed factors related to additional information processing (and hence longer RT), one way to test for this might be to examine data from the rating task that Supply &amp; Demand Approach to Information Processing 20 came before the choice task. This could provide a more direct measure of the influence of C1 or F on how long participants thought about an option before becoming satisfied with their estimate of its value. We thus regressed response time from the first rating task (Rating1 RT) on V1, C1, and F (after centering and scaling all variables). We found that each of the independent variables had a significant negative effect (regression coefficients: V1 = -0.07, p = .002; C1 = -0.09, p &lt; .001; F = -0.04, p = .015; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>). So, participants were faster to rate options when they were subjectively more valuable (greater attraction), more certain (lesser demand for more information), and more familiar (greater supply of information). We took advantage of the negative relationship between rating RT and value certainty to test for the effect of certainty gain on rating RT. If choice deliberation yields an increase in certainty that endures beyond the decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lee &amp; Coricelli, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lee &amp; Daunizeau, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lee &amp; Hare, 2023;</ref>, subsequent rating tasks should require less time because the value estimates would be more certain than they were before the choice task. To test this, we</p><p>Supply &amp; Demand Approach to Information Processing 21 regressed the decrease in response time between initial and final value ratings (RT decrease, after taking the logarithm of both RT measures) on certainty gain. Note that the dependent variable is defined as a decrease, so a positive value means that RT was lower for Rating2 relative to Rating1.</p><p>We found an overall RT decrease (intercept = 0.29, p &lt; .001), showing that participants responded more quickly in general during the second rating. More importantly, we found a positive relationship between certainty gain and RT decrease (0.19, p = .004; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7)</ref>. When the gain in certainty from initial to final ratings was higher, participants were able to estimate value more quickly, which aligns with previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lee &amp; Coricelli, 2020)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>When choosing among multiple options, people will try to pick the option that best answers the relevant decision question (e.g., which snack food would they prefer to eat?). Such decisions are driven by estimates of value, in the sense of a general measure on a scale specifically tuned for the current decision. Importantly, people are not always certain about the values they estimate for the different available options. It is thus reasonable to claim that choice deliberation includes an attempt (even if unconscious) to reduce uncertainty about value before committing to a choice.</p><p>But this might not always be possible. For example, some options might be less familiar to someone than other options. In that case, thinking carefully would do no good, because the information (e.g., to be retrieved from memory) would not be readily available or easily accessible.</p><p>In this study, we examined a dataset that included subjective ratings of value, certainty, and familiarity for a collection of snack food options. We showed that participants experienced a gain in certainty (or a reduction of uncertainty) for options between initial and final ratings, plausibly caused by additional information processing during choice deliberation. Importantly, the gain in certainty was greater for options whose initial ratings were more uncertain and options that were more familiar, and especially for options with both low initial certainty and high familiarity.</p><p>Value refinement theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lee &amp; Daunizeau, 2020</ref> describes two general effects that arise when people process additional information while deciding among options: they become more certain about the values of the options and they also update their value estimates for the options. We showed that participants generally revised their value estimates between initial and final ratings. Importantly, the magnitude of these revisions was greater for options whose initial ratings were more uncertain and options that were more familiar, and especially for options with both low initial certainty and high familiarity.</p><p>Together, these results provide clear evidence in support of our supply and demand theory of information processing during decision-making. Our collection of results, though simple, may yet be important to the field. Most theories and models of choice in the literature do not consider levels of certainty about the value estimates that drive the decision process. While some do explicitly consider certainty -and in particular information processing to increase certainty -they focus on what we call the demand for information and completely ignore what we call the supply of information. In this study, we have presented evidence that both supply and demand are relevant, thus encouraging researchers to include parameters for supply in their theories and models.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the negative relationship between initial certainty and certainty gain could be caused in part by a regression to the mean effect, where participants might have initially rated their feelings of certainty as more extreme and later revised their certainty reports to be more evenly spread across the scale. However, the participants in this experiment were trained on how to use the rating scales -through both instruction and practice -which should have decreased the likelihood of such behavior. Indeed, the percentage of extreme certainty ratings (lesser than 0.05 or greater than 0.95) was higher in the final rating task (43%) than in the initial rating task (40%). Moreover, the average certainty gain across all trials and participants was significantly positive, which would not be the case under a pure regression to the mean scenario.</p><p>We also found that the choice behavior participants exhibited (consistency with value ratings, response times, and reports of confidence and effort) was impacted not only by the value estimates of the available options, but also by feelings of certainty and familiarity. Participants were more consistent, faster, more confident, and experienced less effort when they were more certain about their value estimates and when they were more familiar with the choice options. A more direct examination of the probability of choosing one option over the other revealed that participants preferred options that they believed to be more valuable (as they should for such valuebased decisions) as well as options that seemed more familiar to them. This attraction to familiarity is intriguing from a psychological perspective. Anecdotally, we know that people tend to feel more comfortable choosing options that they are more familiar with, sometimes even being willing to forgo some expected value in exchange for more familiarity. For example, when choosing where to eat dinner in a new city, people might tend to choose a well-known restaurant over an unknown one even if their best guess is that the unknown restaurant will be better. Value certainty and familiarity would be confounded in that case, but we found that those variables were distinct in our data. Decades of research have elucidated what has come to be known as the mere exposure effect, where people like things more when they have been presented with them more often (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bornstein, 1989</ref>) for a review). This effect has been demonstrated to hold even when the task does not involve affective evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Garcia-Marques et al., 2016)</ref>. This aligns with work showing that participants estimated numerical stimuli to be greater when the information about those stimuli was more accessible <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lee et al., 2025)</ref>. Future work might investigate whether the apparent preference for familiarity or accessibility is normative, perhaps from the perspective that it could enable value signals in the brain to be more reliable or their formation to be more efficient.</p><p>In this study, we examined the concept of information supply based on self-reported ratings of familiarity. Despite having received the same instructions, it is possible that different participants might have interpreted familiarity differently, which might have led to inconsistencies in responses. Future work might consider alternative measures of information supply beyond selfreported familiarity ratings, including more objective measures. For example, participants could be presented with a memory or recognition task after being exposed to different stimuli for different durations, different frequencies, or with different degrees of clarity. It would be interesting to know if the effects of such objective measures of information supply in other types of decision-making or judgment tasks would be similar to those that we reported. The notion of information availability invokes the notion of an availability heuristic, with which decision-making researchers have long been acquainted. This heuristic was originally suggested as the source of a bias where people misestimate frequencies of events or probabilities of potential outcomes based on the ease with which they can recall examples of such events or outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1973)</ref>. More recently, the availability heuristic has been shown to influence judgments of goodness. For example, university students were asked to provide either two or ten criticisms of their course; those in the first group could easily recall the requested information, but those in the second group could not. This manipulated sense of information availability apparently caused the second group of students to rate the course more positively, as they equated their inability to think of enough criticisms with their satisfaction with the course <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fox, 2006)</ref>. More generally, participants were shown to overestimate the pleasantness of their childhood when led to believe that pleasant memories fade more quickly or to underestimate the pleasantness when led to believe that unpleasant memories fade more quickly, suggesting that the availability of information (in memory) can have diverse effects on judgments, depending on how that availability is interpreted <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Winkielman &amp; Schwarz, 2001)</ref>. In value-based decision-making, perhaps people assume that if they are more familiar with an option, it must be because they have chosen to be exposed to it more often in the past, in which case they must have liked it more. In this study, we controlled for the correlation between familiarity and value when testing for effects of familiarity. However, it could still be true that people rely on their sense of familiarity as an additional cue about which option they should choose when their sense of value for the alternative options is not enough for them to confidently decide.</p><p>Although this study was motivated in part by our belief that popular computational models of decision-making assume full information availability, this was not a modeling study and therefore we did not propose any new computational formulations for the decision process. It would be interesting for future research to explore this directly, perhaps revealing the best way for models to incorporate our supply and demand approach. One possibility is that the drift rate in sequential sampling models should be an increasing function of information accessibility, leading to faster and more consistent choices when accessibility is greater. However, the specific mathematical formulation would need to be determined methodically. Moreover, the ways in which accessibility and certainty might interact attention should be carefully investigated. For example, accessibility and certainty should influence where an agent focuses its attention, but they should also influence how that focused attention will influence certainty gain and value revision, and thus subsequent allocation of attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Metacognitive impressions such as certainty and confidence are important to our life experience. Not only do they help us make better decisions, but they help us to understand the world in which we live in a more general sense. Without the ability to form and assess these impressions, our lives would be filled with chaos. That is why we are willing and able to refine our mental representations through seeking, filtering, and processing information about the world as we interact with it. Because our cognitive and biological resources are limited (i.e., we cannot simply process all the information we come across), we must be clever about how to best utilize them. Our supply and demand approach to decision-making provides one small example of what this might entail: we should not waste our resources thinking about things that we already understand well enough (low uncertainty, low demand) or that we realize we will be unable to resolve (low accessibility, low supply).</p></div>
