			<abstract>
				<p>The past two years have witnessed a significant increase in the endorsement of conspiracy theories especially due to the emerging uncertainty caused by the pandemic. The prevalence of conspiracy beliefs could have negative social, health, and civic outcomes, thus it is important to understand the formalization and maintenance mechanism of conspiracy beliefs. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the deficit in learning and recognizing the probabilistic patterns of the environment while making decisions in an uncertain and unstable environment and the general tendency to engage with conspiracy theories. The Generic Conspiracist&apos;s Belief Scale (GCBS) is used to estimate conspiracy theory beliefs and a web-based aversive learning task consisting of two blocks, i.e. stable and volatile, is designed to objectively assess individuals&apos; ability to adapt their learning to changes in environmental volatility. Participants were recruited on social media and 69 participated in the experiment, 39 of which completed the whole experiment online. Our results suggest conspiracy belief is correlated with a deficit in the perception of the higher-order statistics about the causal structure of an aversive environment to guide decision-making (r(37) = −0.48, P = 0.002). People with high conspiracy beliefs are less able to update their learning rates to adapt to the changes in environmental volatility.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Conspiracy theories attempt to explain significant events and circumstances as the malevolent acts of secret and powerful groups. Belief in conspiracy theories has been prevalent throughout human history at various times and in various societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Groh, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sedek, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zonis and Joseph, 1994</ref>. In addition to being widespread, accumulating research findings have revealed that conspiracy theories are associated with negative social, health, and civic consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jolley and Douglas, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jolley et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kofta et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lewandowsky et al., 2015</ref>. For example, exposure to conspiracy theories increases intention to extremist political views Van Prooijen et al., 2015 and collective self-defense against alleged threats from out-groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sedek, 2005</ref>. Belief in COVID-19-related conspiracy theories has been associated with decreased adhesion to prevention measures Farias Lili Zhang Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Lili Zhang, School of Computing, Dublin City University, 123 Main St., Oneonta, NY 13820. E-mail: lili.zhang27@mail.dcu.ie and Pilati, 2021. People who believe that alternative remedies can help them fight off the virus may be less likely to follow health officials' advice and instead opt for less effective (at best) or lethal (at worst) alternatives. Conspiracy beliefs may also fuel hostility toward groups seen as responsible for the virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Marchlewska et al., 2019</ref>. Given these issues, understanding the formation and maintenance mechanism of conspiracy beliefs in the human mind becomes an emergent and important task for researchers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related work</head><p>Although conspiracy theories vary enormously in content, it has been widely agreed that belief in such theories is grounded in similar underlying psychological processes. An important fact that supports this argument is that belief in one conspiracy theory is generally a good predictor of belief in a different, conceptually unrelated conspiracy theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Douglas and Sutton, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lewandowsky et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Swami et al., 2010;</ref>. This suggests that people vary in the extent to which they have a conspiratorial mindset, prompting them to assume evil conspiracies as responsible for impactful societal events, which is consistent with Brotherton's assumption Brotherton, 2015 that conspiracy belief is part of a continuum of patterns of thought and behaviour that are extremely common and not for the most part, paranoid.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Douglas et al., 2017, Douglas et al.</ref> summarized the psychological motives that drive belief in conspiracy theories into three categories, i.e. social, epistemic, and existential motives. The factors involved explained, for instance, why people on the losing (vs. winning) side of political processes appear more likely to believe conspiracy theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Uscinski and Parent, 2014</ref>, why it is stronger among people who habitually seek meaning and patterns in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bruder et al., 2013</ref>, and why people are more likely to turn to conspiracy theories when they lack psychology empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bruder et al., 2013</ref>. A large group of research has focused on individual difference correlates of belief in conspiracy theories. This perspective is based on the advancement in terms of developing valid measures of individual differences in generic conspiracist ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brotherton et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bruder et al., 2013</ref>, which in turn will be correlated with other psychological antecedents. Studies have reported relatively reliable associations between stronger belief in conspiracy theories and a number of psychological constructs, such as maladaptive personality traits, lower selfesteem, feelings of being out of control, and trait anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brotherton and Eser, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cichocka et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Douglas and Sutton, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Grzesiak-Feldman, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Swami et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Swami et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Prooijen and Acker, 2015, etc.</ref> In addition, several studies have examined the correlation between Big Five personality factors, although the results are still controversial <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Goreis and Voracek, 2019</ref>. The psychological characteristics in these studies were mainly indexed via measures of traits or symptoms. Many of them are in fact a composite measure of several underlying cognitive processes including, but not limited to, working memory, verbal and spatial ability, reasoning and processing speed. To the best knowledge of the authors, no study has examined which components of the cognitive process may be involved in the formalization of conspiracy beliefs. Advances in computational modelling allow us to investigate the characteristics of cognitive mechanisms of conspiracy theory believers.</p><p>In numerous life domains, people make predictions of future outcomes by searching for patterns in random stimuli. Pattern perception, i.e. the automatic tendency to establish the causal relations between people, events, and other important stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zhao et al., 2014</ref>, is a basic feature of an adaptive human ability for associative learning and indispensable for the survival of human beings in the social and physical environment. Understanding the world by identifying cause and effect helped our ancestors to recognize threats and opportunities, to foresee the consequences of their actions, and strategically adjust their behaviour to fit the demands of the situation. Sometimes, however, distortions to this cognitive process might lead to illusory pattern perception, misperceiving meaningful patterns in what are in fact random stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Williams and</ref><ref type="bibr">Griffiths, 2013. According to van Prooijen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Van Vugt, 2018</ref>, such illusory pattern perception is a result of the evolved human tendency to make sense of the world and, by extension, could lead to all kinds of seemingly irrational beliefs such as conspiracy beliefs. This hypothesis has been proved by empirical evidence. For instance, people who believe in conspiracy theories overestimate the probability that events are connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brotherton and French, 2014</ref>. Furthermore, the findings in Van Prooijen et al., 2018 suggest that conspiracy beliefs are predicted by a tendency to perceive meaningful patterns in random or chaotic stimuli, notably random coin flip strings and unstructured modern art paintings. Surprisingly, however, conspiracy beliefs were not associated with detecting patterns in structured stimuli, and supernatural beliefs even predicted a decreased capacity to recognize existing patterns. In other words, people who are prone to believe in irrational theories are more desired to seek for existing patterns to establish causal relations even in facing a random process where in fact no pattern exists, but they were less able to recognize the real patterns when they are presented with a nonrandom process where a pattern did exist. However, no further study has explored more on this vain, i.e. the potential correlation between conspiracy belief and impaired pattern recognition.</p><p>In the field of computational psychiatry, it has been found that anxious individuals have a general deficit in perceiving the statistical patterns of the environment in the context of learning and decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Browning et al., 2015</ref>. Combining the fact that conspiracy believers were reported to have higher anxiety levels Grzesiak-Feldman, 2007, 2013, we believe conspiracy belief may also be linked with impairment of recognizing the statistical structures of their environment and using the information to guide their decisionmaking accordingly. Importantly, with the application of computational models, we are able to capture individuals' cognitive-based characteristics of learning and recognizing the probabilistic patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Question</head><p>In this study, we aim to examine the correlation between pattern perception and adaptive learning ability and conspiracy belief in the context of decision making. We hypothesise that conspiracy believers may be linked with the inferior capability of learning and recognizing the underlying patterns of the environment and making accurate predictions of the negative outcomes. Such predictions of future outcomes are inherent in conspiracy beliefs, which are frequently construed as ways to cope with uncertain and complex life situations. One common proposition is that belief in conspiracy theories often constitutes attempts to understand distressing events that are difficult to understand otherwise <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bale, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hofstadter, 2012</ref>. Consistently, impactful and threatening societal events increase people's sense-making motivation, as reflected in feelings of worry and a desire to find out what happened, which subsequently increases belief in conspiracy theories Van Prooijen and Van Dijk, 2014. Through compensatory conviction, having difficulties solving the uncertainty in one life domain is compensated with heightened certainty about one's ideologies such as opinions and values <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Farias and Pilati, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">McGregor, 2006</ref>, compensating for personal uncertainties by imbuing the world with meaning and purpose Van Prooijen et al., 2015. We aim to provide empirical evidence to prove this hypothesis.</p><p>Another question is what disturbed cognitive process causes this inferior capacity and thus ends up turning to conspiracy theories to satisfy their psychological needs of avoiding uncertainty? Possible accounts for this include 1) people might be less able to estimate the probability of future negative events when there are sources of uncertainty complicating the action-outcome relationship in the environment; 2) they are less able to combine these estimates when choosing between actions. The application of computational modelling allows us to investigate which of the cognitive mechanisms involved in decision-making within uncertain situations are disrupted in individuals who tend to believe in conspiracy theories.</p><p>We used a reward-loss learning task, which is designed to capture important uncertain and unstable aspects of reallife decision-making. It consists of two blocks, in one the relationship between participants' actions and the outcomes of those actions is stable; in the other, this relationship is volatile, repeatedly changing over time. In other words, two sources of uncertainties are included. One source of uncertainty is produced by noise in the relationship between actions and outcomes, for instance, an action only leads to a given outcome on a proportion of the occasions it is performed in the stable block. The second source of uncertainty is non-stationarity, or volatility, in the underlying causal structure. For example, the action-outcome contingencies switch in the volatile block and an action that was primarily associated with a given outcome becomes predominantly associated with another. Such volatility leads to uncertainty around the estimate of outcome probability; this can be conceived of as second-order uncertainty. Within a reinforcement learning framework, the influence of outcomes on one's belief is captured by the learning rate parameter, with a higher learning rate reflecting a greater influence of more recently experienced events. If unexpected or 'surprising' outcomes are caused by noise (the stable block), then current action choices are optimally determined by averaging over the outcomes of many previous actions. In contrast, if surprising outcomes are caused by a change in action-outcome contingencies in a volatile environment, then only the most recent events should be used to guide action choice. The difference in participants' learning rate between the stable and volatile task blocks extracted from the computational models provides a measure of participants' ability to perceive the statistical structure of the environment and adjust their decisionmaking strategy accordingly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Behrens et al. Behrens et al., 2007</ref> reported that healthy adult participants are indeed able to implement a higher learning rate when the environment is volatile than when it is stable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>All participants were recruited online. They would have the chance to win a digital gift card worth e100 for their engagement. We advertised on multiple social media platforms, including Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. An URL link to the study was embedded in the advertisement, so people who are interested can enter the study directly by clicking the link. The surveys and the decision-making task are both included inside the link. The participants are firstly required to answer a 15-item instrument concerning individuals' generalized tendency toward conspiracy theorizing. After submitting their answers to this survey, they will be directed to another survey to evaluate their trait anxiety level. They will finally be randomly assigned with one of the schedules (which will be explained later) of the reward-loss decisionmaking task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale</head><p>Conspiracy beliefs are measured using a validated measure of generic conspiracist ideation developed by Brotherton, French, and Pickering Brotherton et al., 2013. The Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCB) assesses the extent to which an individual believes that the kind of conspiratorial activity postulated by popular conspiracy theories occurs routinely in the world instead of assessing attitudes toward a small number of arbitrarily selected eventbased conspiracy theories. The authors measured five dimensions of general conspiracy theories: governance malfeasance (GM), which comprises beliefs that the government is involved in secret major threatening events; extraterrestrial cover-up (ET), which involves beliefs that alien contact is being hidden; malevolent global conspiracies (MG), which encompasses beliefs that secret groups are responsible for world major decisions and events; personal wellbeing (PW), which comprises beliefs that secret technologies have been employed, and the spread of viruses/diseases has been taking place without people knowing about it; and control of information (CI), which comprehends beliefs in the concealment of relevant evidence from the public. Participants rate the extent to which they agree with each statement on a 5-point Likert Scale on 15 items (1 'definitely not true', 2 'probably not true', 3 'not sure/cannot decide', 4 'probably true' and 5 'definitely true'). Cronbach's alpha for the scale was high (.88).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory</head><p>In the experiment, we also measured the anxiety level of the participants. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Spielberger et al., 1971</ref> is a commonly used measure including two, twenty-item self-report scales, for assessing trait and state anxiety, respectively. State anxiety is regarded as a psychophysiological state with activation of the autonomic nervous system and qualities of apprehension and tension, whereas trait anxiety is regarded as a relatively stable personality disposition to respond with anxiety in various situations. Items in the state scale are rated on a 4-point scale from 'not at all' to 'very much so' and items on the trait scale are rated also on a 4-point scale, but here the ordinal labels range from 'almost never' to 'almost always. The total score of each scale ranges from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater anxiety. We are interested in exploring the personality perspective of anxiety, thus only the trait subscale is adopted in the experiment. The total score of the trait scale ranges from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater anxiety. STAI scores are commonly classified as "no or low anxiety" (20-37), "moderate anxiety" (38-44), and "high anxiety" (45-80)Bunevicius et al., 2013. Internal consistency coefficients for the scale have ranged from 0.86 to 0.95. Test-retest reliability of this inventory ranged from 0.65 to 0.75 over a 2-month interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Spielberger et al., 1971</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Aversive Learning Task</head><p>In order to assess humans' sensitivity to negative outcomes and how they respond to the changes in the underlying structure of the simulating environment in naturalistic settings, we developed a web-based aversive version of the learning task. To maintain the interest and enthusiasm of the participants, the task is modified into a more entertaining, leprechaun-themed game, which will be referred to as the Aversive Learning Task (ALT) in the following.</p><p>The participants are initially given 10000 gold coins in the forest (see <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref> for the screenshot of the task). They have to navigate through a clump of bushes to reach home. As they make their way through the bushes, they will come upon a series of junctions. Participants have to repeatedly choose one of two leprechauns, blue or red, to pass through the junctions. At each junction, there will be two leprechauns, blue and red. One of the leprechauns has a higher probability of stealing gold coins from the participants while the other one has a lower probability. Each leprechaun holds a bag in their hands with a number on it, representing how many gold coins the participants will lose if that leprechaun steals from them. The magnitude values of loss for the blue leprechaun are randomly generated between 1 and 100 (L_blue), and the values for the red leprechaun are set to (100−L blue ). The participants are instructed that the chance of the stealing leprechaun being blue or red depends only on the recent outcome history. However, because of the loss magnitudes associated with the two leprechauns, participants normally don't select the less likely to steal leprechaun if it is associated with a very high loss. There are two blocks in the task, i.e. the stable block and the volatile block (see <ref type="figure">figure 2)</ref>, each for 120 trials. In the stable block, the blue leprechaun has a 75% probability of stealing coins from the participants if it is chosen. The other leprechaun has a 25% probability of stealing. In the volatile block, the probability that the choice of a given leprechaun would result in stealing switches every 20 trials between 75% and 25%. The outcome probabilities of the blue leprechaun across the course of the task are shown in the following figure. The aim of the participants is to choose the better leprechaun that steals less from them as more as possible to reserve more gold coins when they get back home.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard Behavioral Data Analysis</head><p>For each participant, the probability of choosing the option with a lower probability of stealing (we call it a correct option in the following), the probability of choosing the option with a smaller stealing magnitude (we call it a smaller option in the following), and the proportion of trials in which the individual selected a different bandit from the previous trial are calculated separately for stable and volatile blocks and are submitted to repeated-measures analysis of variance</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2</head><p>Outcome probabilities across the course of the ALT. The task comprised two blocks. In the stable block, one leprechaun (for example, the blue one) had a 75% probability of resulting in loss of gold coins; the other shape had a 25% probability of resulting in coin loss. In the volatile block, the probability that the choice of a given leprechaun would result in coin loss switched every 30 trials between 80 and 20%. .</p><p>(ANOVA) to assess the impact of volatility of the environment on behaviour. Conspiracy belief and trait anxiety scores are added as covariates in the analysis. Regression analysis is conducted to examine the correlation between conspiracy belief and behavioural performance on the decision-making task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational Modelling Analysis</head><p>The performance on the decision-making task is an interaction and synthesis of several different underlying components, including motivational, learning, and choice processes. The primary measure of interest in this task is the change in learning rate between stable and volatile blocks, which reflects the capability of recognizing the probability structure of the simulated environment. This will be achieved by fitting a computational model, which breaks performance on the task down into these components, to participants' choice data. The model supposes the probability P t , that a good outcome would result from choosing from leprechaun blue rather than leprechaun red, is updated on a trial-by-trial basis using the Rescorla-Wagner model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P t = P t−1 + A(O t−1 − P t−1 )</formula><p>in which the learning rate A ∈ (0, 1) determines how much weight the decision maker gives to the recent outcomes when updating their expected probability. The outcome O t−1 is coded as 1 if leprechaun blue is chosen and followed by a good result (no stealing) or if leprechaun red is chosen and followed by a bad result (stealing). O t−1 is coded as o for the opposite cases in the task. The initial outcome probability P t is set as 0.5. The outcome probability estimate is then adjusted to P ′ t using a risk preference parameter γ ∈ (0, 10) to capture the relative importance of the magnitude of losses versus outcome probability. If γ &lt; 1, it means the participant place greater weight on loss magnitudes, while if γ &gt; 1, it means the participant place greater weight on outcome probability when doing the choice.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P ′ t = min[max[(γ(P t − 0.5) + 0.5), 0], 1]</formula><p>The expected value for each leprechaun is then calculated by multiplying the adjusted outcome probability and loss magnitude, separately, before taking the difference in expected value between the two leprechauns.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">v t = P ′ t M blue t − (1 − P ′ t )M red t</formula><p>Finally, after updating the expectancies, to reflect current action-outcome contingencies, we assume the participant use a softmax function to transform the expected values into action probabilities. Another free parameter, the inverse temperature parameter β ∈ (0, 10), is introduced to control the degree to which the expected values are used in choosing the leprechauns.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P(C = blue) = 1 1 + exp(−βv t )</formula><p>In total, there are three free parameters (A, β, γ) in the model. They are estimated across all trials for the stable and volatile blocks separately using Hierarchical Bayesian Methods. In order to take the potential within-participant correlation of the stable and volatile parameters into account in the modelling process, we assume each participant had a stable and volatile parameter with a prior distribution defined by the Multivariate normal distribution with means µ s table and µ v olatile and covariance matrix , which can be converted to the correlation matrix. We will use Cholesky decomposition to decompose the correlation matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix (Cholesky factor) and its transpose. The Cholesky factor is given an LKJ prior to 1, reflecting the equal prior expectation of small to large correlations.</p></div>

The average trait anxiety score is 43.72 (SD = 8.98). Most of the participants demonstrated a slightly moderate level of anxiety. The trait anxiety does not show a significant correlation with conspiracy belief 3c. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> demonstrates the percentage of choosing correct options, the percentage of choosing the option with smaller stealing magnitudes across trials for each participant, and the percentage of switching to the other option after receiving losses in previous trials across trials for each participant in four conditions, respectively. The percentage of correct choice in stable blocks is significantly higher than that of the volatile blocks (F(1, 37) = 44.70, P &lt; 0.001), regardless of the order in which the two blocks were completed (F(1, 37) = 0.009, P = 0.92). The percentage of choosing choices with smaller magnitudes in stable blocks is also significantly higher than that of the volatile blocks (F(1, 37) = 4.56, P = 0.03) and this figure is not impacted by the schedule factor either. The probability of switching to the other option after receiving loss in previous trials is not significantly different between stable and volatile blocks (F(1, 37) = 0.85, P = 0.36) and this figure is not modulated by the schedule either (F(1, 37) = 0.84, P = 0.04). None of the three behavioural statistics is correlated with trait anxiety or general conspiracy belief score. Additionally, we did not find a significant correlation between the percentage change in the three behavioural statistics between stable and volatile trials with either of the two psychological measurements either.</p></div>

More precisely, the difference between the expected and actual outcome of a given trial has a large effect on change in outcome expectancy and subsequent choice behaviour. In contrast, at low learning rates, surprising outcomes lead to little change in outcome expectancy and behaviour. The difference in participants' learning rate between stable and volatile task blocks provides a measure of participants' ability to adapt their learning to changes in environmental volatility. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> illustrates the group-level posterior distribution of the learning rate parameter in stable and volatile blocks. The vertical blue line marks the mean value of the posterior samples. It can be seen that the mean value of the volatile learning rate is slightly higher than the stable learning rate in both schedules. We also plot the posterior distribution of the difference between the volatile and the stable learning rates A di f f and filled the 95% Highest Density Interval (HDI) blue colour. If the 95% HDI does not encompass zero, we consider there to be a significant difference between the two blocks of learning rates. As shown in the plot, participants in schedule 2 adopted significantly higher learning rates in the volatile block compared to that of the stable block. In other words, at the group level, participants who were assigned schedule 2 demonstrated significant adaptive learning behaviour to adapt to the volatility of the environment. In contrast, the group of people who were assigned with schedule 1 (stable block first) did not show significantly increased learning rates when transforming from stable block to volatile block.</p><p>Apart from the group-level parameters, the individuallevel parameters are also extracted, i.e. the posterior distributions of the free parameters for each individual. The mean value of the posterior distribution of the parameters is calculated in the following analysis. Each participant is represented by six parameters, the learning rate, the inverse temperature, and the risk preference parameter under stable and volatile blocks, respectively. We still focus on the learning rate parameter at the individual level. The distribution of the</p></div>

The left panel contains plots for schedule 1 and the right panel contains plots for schedule 2. A di f f represents the posterior distribution of the difference between volatile and stable learning rates. The blue area comprises the 95% HDI. If the 95% HDI of A di f f does not encompass zero, we consider there to be a significant difference between the two learning rates. We found a main effect of the block only with the dataset of schedule 2, i.e. the learning rate in the volatile block is significantly higher than that of the stable block in schedule 2.</p><p>individual-level learning rate parameter is positively skewed, so when analyses were run on this parameter per se (e.g. correlation between change of learning rate and conspiracy belief), learning rate values are log-transformed before running statistical tests.</p><p>Firstly, the stable learning rate is significantly correlated with the volatile learning rate (r = 0.65, P &lt; 0.001). Consistent with the group-level parameter, the participants' learning rates are higher in the volatile than in the stable block of our ALT (F(1, 37) = 35.37, P &lt; 0.001), but there is a significant two-way interactions between the block and the schedule effect (F(1, 37) = 19.89, P &lt; 0.001). Thus, the impact the block has on the learning rates depends on the order in the two blocks are completed. A one-way model of the block factor is run at each level of the schedule factor. It turns out that the simple main effect of the block is only significant for schedule 2 (F = 67.4, P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Importantly, elevated conspiracy belief is associated with a reduced change in learning rate between blocks (r(37) = −0.48, P = 0.002; see <ref type="figure">figure 6</ref>). An effect of conspiracy belief is only seen for change in learning rate between stable and volatile blocks; there is no significant relationship between conspiracy belief and mean learning rate across blocks (r(37) = 0.1, P = 0.53) or with learning rate in each block (volatile block, r(37) = −0.1, P = 0.54; stable block, r(37) = 0.30, P = 0.06). In other words, low conspiracy</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6</head><p>The relative log learning rate for the volatile versus the stable block (i.e. log(A volatile ) − log(A stable )) is negatively correlated with participant GCBS score (r(37) = −0.48, P = 0.002) theory believers were able to identify the underlying pattern of the outcome contingencies and adjust their learning appropriately between blocks, learning (that is, updating outcome estimates) fast when the world was fast-changing and slowly when the world was stable. By contrast, high conspiracy theory believers were not able to learn in this flexible manner, instead learning similarly in both blocks. It is notable that the mean learning rate is not modulated by conspiracy beliefs. This suggests that high conspiracy belief individuals did succeed in updating outcome expectancies following surprising outcomes, but that they were unable to modulate this on the basis of the volatility of the current environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We firstly investigated the relationship between trait anxiety and conspiracy thinking. Although several studies have found anxiety is positively correlated with conspiracy thinking regarding specific events, e.g. ethnic and national groups Grzesiak-Feldman, 2013, COVID-19 Leibovitz et al., 2021, we failed to replicate a significant correlation between general conspiracy belief thinking and trait anxiety in this study. One possible reason that caused this result is that the sample size of our study is not as large as that of the previous studies. Another reason might be that trait anxiety is only associated with specific conspiracist claims instead of the general tendency to engage with conspiracist explanations for events. It is also possible that the measure of anxiety used (the STAI trait scale) does not provide a particularly pure measure of anxiety-specific effect, also showing moderate-to-high correlations with measures of depression. Studies with largerscale and factor analyses of internalizing symptoms are re-quired in the future to detect the relationships between conspiracy beliefs and internalizing psychopathology.</p><p>In real life, it is important for human beings to recognize the causal statistics of the aversive events and make adaptive decisions accordingly. We hypothesise that people who are more capable to learn the patterns of the outcome contingencies could get a sense of control over their environment. As a result, they will be less likely to be anxious due to uncertainty and less likely to believe in conspiracy theories to satisfy their psychological needs. This hypothesis was tested using a web-based decision-making task, in which participants were required to make decisions in a simulated uncertain and unstable environment. The behavioural statistics on the task were first examined. Three behavioural statistics were calculated for each participant under stable and volatile blocks, respectively. There was no evidence showing that these behavioural statistics were predicted by trait anxiety nor by general conspiracy beliefs in the regression analysis. However, we conducted more statistical tests on these behavioural variables aiming to reveal the characteristics of decision-making of the participants. As expected, participants selected more correct choices across trials in stable block compared to volatile block. The action-outcome contingency in the stable block is more predictable, thus it is easier for the participants to recognize only one source of uncertainty, i.e. noise in the relationship between actions and outcomes, in the environment. In the volatile block, the action-outcome contingencies switch across trials. The participant needs to estimate the second-order uncertainty, i.e. the outcome probability associated with the options. It is thus more difficult to identify the option with a lower probability of stealing. Interestingly, participants also selected more choices with smaller magnitudes in stable blocks compared to volatile blocks, meaning that they put more weight on the losing magnitudes while making decisions in stable blocks compared with volatile blocks. The probability of shifting to the other option after receiving losses is not significantly different between the two blocks. The probability of switching is corresponding to the learning rate parameter to some extent. The higher the switching probability is, the more likely the participant was guided by the more recent outcomes of actions versus those further back. No significant difference in terms of the loss-shift probability between the two blocks means the participants may not update their outcome expectancies based on the volatility of the current environment.</p><p>In order to disentangle the underlying cognitive mechanisms and identify the possible connection between the cognitive representations of adaption of learning to contingency volatility and conspiracy belief scales and trait anxiety, computational modelling analysis was performed. Our results did not replicate the association between trait anxiety and learning rate adjustment on the reward loss learning task. Al-though earlier findings support that elevated trait anxiety was associated with impoverished learning rate adjustment when outcomes involved punishment (electric shocks) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Browning et al., 2015</ref> or financial loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pulcu and Browning, 2017</ref>, the latest results found <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gagne et al., 2020</ref> no evidence to suggest a differential relationship between anxiety-specific symptoms and adaptation of learning to volatility. It was implied that impaired adaptation of learning was associated with internalizing psychopathology instead of anxiety-or depressionspecific symptom factors. Consistent with our hypothesis, impairment in terms of recognizing the action-outcome contingency and adapting learning rates are linked with an elevated general tendency to engage with conspiracy theories. The difficulty in identifying the stability of action-outcome contingencies to judge whether or not to repeat an action that has led to an unexpected aversive outcome may lead high conspiracy individuals to engage in poor decision-making. It might also result in aversive outcomes being experienced as less predictable and less avoidable. This could in turn increase in desire to make sense of the environment, and thus potentially be involved in the onset of conspiracist ideation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, our findings reveal that trait vulnerability to anxiety is not associated with general conspiracist ideation. We did not replicate the relationship between anxiety and the ability to adapt decision-making to higher-order uncertainty either. However, our findings suggest that conspiracy belief is correlated with a deficit in the perception of the higherorder statistics about the causal structure of an aversive environment to guide decision-making. High conspiracy belief individuals did not differ from low conspiracy belief individuals in terms of superficial behavioural statistics or the mean learning rate of the cognitive representations. Instead, their pattern of decision-making indicated a specific insensitivity to environmental volatility. In other words, high conspiracy belief individuals have difficulties differentially updating action-outcome contingencies as a function of whether the current environment was stable or volatile.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 4</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Figure 4</figDesc></figure>
