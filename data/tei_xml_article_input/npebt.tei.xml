			<abstract>
				<p>The quantum cognition research programme concerns the application of quantum probability theory (the rules for how to assign probabilities to events from quantum mechanics, without the physics) to cognitive modeling. We review quantum cognitive models in several areas of psychology, including conjunction/ disjunction fallacies in probabilistic judgment, conceptual combinations, similarity, order effects on judgments, causal inference, the disjunction effect in decision making, measurement and interference effects on judgments and decisions, memory, perception, and other judgment and decision-making applications. For each area, we first present the empirical findings that have motivated the application of quantum models, emphasizing any characteristics which are particularly puzzling or have resisted coherent theoretical explanations previously; we then discuss the quantum cognitive models, noting the key features of the models that help explain the empirical data; we finally cast a critical eye on the models and explore comparisons with non-quantum models.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Bayesian (classical) probability theory has been a hugely influential and dominant framework for understanding human decision making, reasoning, and inference, amongst other cognitive processes (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Griffiths et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Oaksford &amp; Chater, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b226">Tenenbaum et al., 2011)</ref>. Equally, there have been persistent challenges to the applicability of baseline classical probability principles: in decision making, Tversky, Kahneman, Shafir and others have initiated a research programme into probabilistic fallacies, concerning empirical findings that violate classical probability theory, and so advocated heuristics biases, that are quick and easy to use, as the basis for human cognition, in at least some cases (this work has been recognized by two Nobel prizes, for <ref type="bibr">Kahneman in 2002</ref> and Thaler in 2017; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Kahneman et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b240">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b241">, 1974</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">, 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Sloman, 1996)</ref>. The importance of such findings is that they often challenge the most basic principles of Bayesian reasoning and, equally, that the conflict between Bayesian prescription and intuition is persistent -even when we are told the relevant Bayesian principle, it is sometimes difficult to overcome the (classically erroneous) intuition (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Gilboa, 2000)</ref>. As another example, in memory, Reyna, Brainerd and others have reported results, challenging an expectation of consistency with basic classical probability constraints (such as the law of total probability, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Brainerd et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Reyna &amp; Brainerd, 1995)</ref>. There are several other examples, across different areas of psychology, even if in many cases classical probability theory remains the most successful framework for cognitive explanation.</p><p>Especially in decision making, models based on heuristics and biases have embodied a rich repertoire of novel theoretical concepts and processes (as examples see the references just above, as well as e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Gigerenzer &amp; Goldstein, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Hertwig et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Hogarth &amp; Einhorn, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Nilsson et al., 2013)</ref>. There is absolutely no doubt regarding the significance of these contributions. However, beyond classical (Bayesian) probability theory, a theoretical approach based on heuristics and biases need not be the default option when empirical findings indicate inconsistency with classical probability principles. Classical principles do not exhaust the formal probabilistic frameworks available to psychologists. Besides psychological efforts to extend baseline classical probability theory (e.g., with assumptions regarding sampling or the influence of pragmatics, <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Goodman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Griffiths et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">Sanborn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Shafer, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b238">Tversky &amp; Köhler, 1994)</ref>, it is also the case that there are alternative formal frameworks for probabilistic reasoning <ref type="bibr">(Narens, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b219">Sorkin, 1994)</ref>. So, even if classical probability theory were uniformly successful in cognition, there is a reasonable question of whether alternative approaches might sometimes offer an advantage.</p><p>The purpose of this review is to bring together theoretical work employing an alternative formal framework for probabilistic inference based on what we call quantum probability theory, the rules for how to assign probabilities to events from quantum mechanics without any of the physics (for introductions suited to psychologists, in decreasing complexity, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Busemeyer and Bruza, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b265">, 2017</ref>; for introductions for philosophers and physicists see <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hughes, 1989, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Isham, 1989)</ref>. By reviewing and evaluating quantum cognitive models, we seek to answer questions such as: is there room for a probabilistic framework in cognition other than classical probability theory? Is there promise in the quantum set of probabilistic principles in cognition? Can quantum probability help us learn something new about cognition? <ref type="bibr">Pothos and Busemeyer (2022)</ref> also reviewed some of these questions. Both Pothos and Busemeyer's review and the present one aim to cover the main concepts and offer an overview of relevant quantum models and empirical results, but the present review is intended to be more detailed and granular (both in terms of the models and empirical results that are covered).</p><p>The application of quantum probability theory to cognition (briefly, quantum cognition) has been ongoing for nearly fifteen years. The idea of applying quantum theory to psychology dates back to seminal articles by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aerts and Aerts (1995)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Bordley (1998)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Khrennikov (1999)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">and Atmanspacher et al. (2002)</ref>. However, applying these ideas to empirical data became more widespread after a special issue in the Journal of Mathematical Psychology <ref type="bibr">(2009, Vol 53, 5)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ashtiani and Azgomi (2015)</ref> survey the different types of quantum models applied to judgment and decision-making. <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Haven and Khrennikov (2013)</ref> describe applications beyond psychology to the more general field of social sciences. Other previous reviews of the quantum cognition research programme include <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Bruza, Wang, Busemeyer (2015)</ref> and .</p><p>Before embarking on a (lengthy) review, a key question is, in the words of a reviewer <ref type="bibr">(Costello)</ref>, "why would anyone expect human cognition to follow the rules of quantum probability?" After all, quantum mechanics was originally proposed as a theory of physics, for microscopic particles. There have been several physics theories, e.g., electromagnetism, classical mechanics, string theory etc. and in most cases there have been no attempts to extend applicability outside physics. So what is special about quantum mechanics, which has motivated some psychologists to think it might be relevant in cognition? There are three steps in answering this question.</p><p>First, as just noted, quantum mechanics involves a part which is a theory of probability -that is, a theory for how to assign probabilities to events (what we call quantum theory). Because manifestly much of cognition is about quantifying uncertainty, any theory of probability is, in principle, relevant in cognitive theory. This includes Bayesian theory, the variants and extensions which have been proposed (e.g., within cognition, the probability and noise model, from <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Costello &amp; Watts, 2014)</ref>, and any other probability theory -this includes quantum theory. A priori, given a theoretical objective of understanding human probabilistic inference, any theory of probability is relevant. Here, one might counterargue that quantifying uncertainty using Bayesian theory specifically matches the structure of the world. That is, the world conforms to a Boolean structure and so, when it comes to quantifying uncertainty in the world, Bayesian theory is uniquely appropriate. A problem with this counterargument is that the world also reflects contextuality and in such circumstances a contextual probability theory, such as quantum theory, might provide better descriptions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Aerts et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Bruza et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Cervantes &amp; Dzhafarov, 2018</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aerts &amp; Beltran, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Aerts et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Second, the dominant probability approach in psychological theory, Bayesian theory, sometimes runs into difficulties, for example, the various fallacies from e.g. <ref type="bibr">Kahneman, Tversky etc</ref>. This has motivated the search for alternative theory, to understand the emergence of such fallacies. Psychologists have often pursued explanations based on heuristics and biases and these have certainly allowed many powerful and important insights. Quantum theory is another candidate in principle, relevant for dealing with the apparent failures of baseline Bayesian theory. Note, this historical picture is analogous to that in physics and quantum mechanics. Abandoning classical physics principles was very difficult for the physics community (which can be conservative) and, initially, quantum mechanics had faced severe objections from the leading, at the time, physicists (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Einstein, Poldosky, Rosen, 1964)</ref>. It was only the close correspondence between theory and empirical data which gradually led to the acceptance of quantum mechanics in physics.</p><p>This leads us to the third point: regardless of whether one is convinced of the a priori relevance of quantum theory in cognition or not, in several cases quantum cognitive models have shown good correspondence with empirical data and demonstrated generative value, in terms of novel, surprising predictions. Again, this situation is analogous in physics: initially, quantum mechanics was adopted almost in an exploratory way, without a clear sense of why nature should be consistent with quantum mechanics -it has taken a long time for foundational arguments to emerge and even now this is an active research area (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hardy, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>A related question here is whether the use of quantum probabilities entails, motivates, or requires a quantum brain, that is, an assumption that brain neurophysiology involves quantum mechanical processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Hameroff, 2007)</ref>. An argument might be along these lines: if there is quantum structure at the behavioral level, should this not be the result of quantum-mechanical processes in relation to the function of neurons? There are two parts to the answer here. First, throughout cognitive psychology, the theories which are invoked at the behavioral level involve principles which can describe regularities in behavior, without any claims about brain neurophysiology (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Griffiths et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Marr, 1982)</ref>. It is a peculiarity of our field that there are different, largely independent explanatory levels. Why should a description at the behavioral level require quantum mechanical processes at the neuronal level? This is like arguing that the use of Bayesian principles at the behavioral level must go hand in hand with Bayesian processes at the neuronal level. Note, such an argumentation, even if half-plausible for quantum or Bayesian behavioral models, makes no sense at all for many other behavioral level explanations (such as ones based on heuristics). Second, the use of quantum principles at the behavioral level is often described as quantum-like, exactly so as to emphasize that quantum mechanical processes at the neuronal level are not required for apparent quantum effects behaviorally. There have been several proposals for how classical models of neuronal function could lead to quantum-like effects and we will review these later (e.g., de <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Barros &amp; Suppes, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Khrennikov et al., 2018)</ref>. However, be this as it may, it needs to be remembered that behavior is an emergent property of the function of millions or hundreds of millions of neurons and it is difficult to build bridges across such disparate explanatory levels.</p><p>Putting the above two points together, whether neuronal function involves quantum processes or not has no bearing on the plausibility of quantum-like models at the behavioral level. For example, the brain could be fully quantum, but behavior fully classical (that is, better described by classical principles). That is, even if the brain were quantum, quantum mechanical processes at the neuronal process might lead to classical structure in behavior -or vice versa. There are two related points. First, evidence for quantum mechanical processes at the neuronal level has been weak, despite proposals from influential scientists <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Hameroff, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Litt et al., 2006)</ref>. Second, quantum mechanics has led to intense debate about reality, forcing us to rethink deeply ingrained intuitions about nature. For example, ontic uncertainty or spooky action at a distance have required radical revisions to our picture of reality. However, we shall see that the application of quantum theory in psychology eschews such problems: in their most part, effects which appear weird for physical systems have familiar interpretations in behavior (such as contextuality, interference, and constructive influences).</p><p>Finally, one might question the use of our label 'quantum', since this label is closely associated with a theory of physics and, as such, it might alienate some readers. Additionally, over the years, readers and reviewers have sometimes pointed out that our quantum-like models are essentially linear matrix algebra, e.g., for how to compute projections of vectors onto subspaces (as we shall see, this is a major building block of quantum-like cognitive models). We think there are two arguments for sticking with the label 'quantum'. The first argument is substantive. We are employing Born's rule for how to associate subspaces to probabilities. Born's rule also implies Gleason's theorem regarding the uniqueness of how to associate subspaces to probabilities. Related are Luder's rule for conditional probabilities and the interpretation of superpositions. Without going into detail, there is an extensive mathematical machinery linking subspaces and projections to probabilities. This machinery is rightfully considered part of quantum theory, at least the part that has to do with probabilistic inference. The second argument is practical. There is already more than 10 years' worth of research with quantum cognitive models and retaining the label 'quantum' helps bring this work together as a distinctive approach to cognitive modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is quantum probability theory?</head><p>We begin with an informal presentation of quantum probability theory focused on its key properties and differences compared to classical probability theory. To make the ideas less abstract, the presentation is based on the application of quantum theory on a famous decision fallacy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Tversky and Kahneman's (1983)</ref> conjunction fallacy. Briefly, conjunction fallacy is the finding that sometimes participants will consider a conjunction as more likely than either of the conjuncts individually. An example of a conjunction fallacy concerns a hypothetical person, Linda, described very much as a feminist and not at all like a bank teller. Participants considered more likely the conjunction that Linda is a feminist and bank teller, than the conjunct that Linda is a bank teller. Note, the conjunction fallacy has been extensively replicated and withstood the test of proposals for possible confounds or alternative explanations (notably conversational implicatures; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Dulany &amp; Hilton, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Moro, 2009)</ref>. Note, in the following presentation, we employ the terms "possibilities," "question answers," or "events" fairly interchangeably, with the term event typically being more common in technical discussions.</p><p>The conjunction fallacy is problematic for baseline classical probability theory because events are defined as subsets of a universal set containing all events. The intersection of feminism and bank teller sets is contained within the larger set of all bank tellers, and so the probability of the intersection must be smaller (or equal, see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). This constraint for classical probability becomes immediately apparent if we recast the situation with countable instances. For example, compare the number of days on which it rained and snowed in London in 2018 to the number of days when it just rained. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. A sample space of all possible Lindas consistent with the story. The subset for which both properties of bank teller and feminist are true can never be larger than the subset for the bank teller property alone. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. A caricature of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al.'s (2011)</ref> model for the conjunction fallacy, based on onedimensional subspaces. is the mental state and F, BT the feminist, bank teller properties.</p><p>Quantum probability theory works differently, and probabilities arise from the geometric relation between a vector representing the state and subspaces representing events. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the main terms. Additionally, in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, we offer some relevant equations, which complement the presentation in main text (these equations become relevant later on in the review). <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows a caricature of the quantum model for the conjunction fallacy <ref type="bibr">(Franco, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al., 2011)</ref>. Several simplifications are made, notably we employ a two-dimensional space, and each event is a one-dimensional subspace (i.e., a ray). The vertical black ray represents the event that Linda is a bank teller (BT) and the horizontal (orthogonal) black ray represents the event that she is not a bank teller. The red ray at 45 degrees represents the event that Linda is a feminist (F) and the orthogonal red ray represents the event that Linda is not a feminist. The belief or mental state of a participant prior to a judgment is represented by the unit length state vector denoted as in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The location of the state with respect to the rays representing feminism and bank teller is determined by the Linda story; in this example, we can straightforwardly set the state to be similar (small angle) to feminism and dissimilar to bank teller. The probability that Linda is a bank teller is determined by projecting the state vector onto the black vertical ray for bank teller (green horizonal line) and then computing the squared length of the projection. The probability that Linda is a feminist and a bank teller is determined by first projecting the state vector onto the ray representing feminism (red line connecting the state vector to the feminist ray), and then projecting the previous result onto the ray representing bank teller (blue horizontal line), and finally computing the squared length of this last projection. All these elements are presented more carefully below. In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the direct projection to the bank teller ray is shorter (lower probability) than the projection to the feminist ray first and then to the bank teller one -this illustrates how this simple caricature model can accommodate the conjunction fallacy.</p><p>Each elementary outcome to a question (e.g., 'Linda is a bank teller) is called a basis vector and all the basis vectors for a particular question form a basis set. Generally, in quantum probability theory, outcomes to questions can be more complex and correspond to subspaces of any dimensionality (not just rays as in the above example) and the state vector is embedded in an arbitrary dimensionality space, called a Hilbert space. The probability of a single possibility, e.g. feminism, equals | ! | " , where ! is a projection operator (matrix) corresponding to the feminism subspace, ! is the projection of the state, , onto the subspace, and | ! | " is the squared length of the projection. That is, probabilities depend on the match or overlap between the state vector and the subspaces for the relevant events.</p><p>This brings us to the first unique property of quantum probability theory (here and elsewhere) relative to classical probability theory. In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the state | ⟩ = | ⟩ + |~⟩ is called a superposition. It is a linear combination of the bank teller basis vectors, i.e., | ⟩, |~⟩ (a, b are called amplitudes and are complex numbers whose squared moduli are probabilities). Note, we have employed the Dirac notation here, whereby | * ⟩ indicates a column vector. | ⟩ is called a ket and ⟨ | is the complex conjugate of | ⟩ (and so a row vector); it is called a bra. The inner product ⟨ | ⟩ is called a bracket. A superposition state indicates uncertainty of a kind unique to quantum theory: prior to a decision, the person neither agrees nor disagrees that Linda is a bank teller (it is as if the person has no (specific) opinion about this question) and the decision creates a possibility into being. For example, suppose a person in a state described as | ⟩ = | ⟩ + |~⟩ decides that Linda is actually a BT. Then, after the decision (measurement), his/ her state would change to become | ⟩ = | ⟩. This process is called the collapse of the state vector. Such ontic uncertainty is fundamentally different from the more common epistemic uncertainty, which reflects lack of knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Atmanspacher &amp; Primas, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Griffiths, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Spekkens, 2007)</ref>. In physics, the meaning of superpositions and the collapse of the state vector has led to extensive debate. For example, what does it mean for an electron to not have a position prior to measurement? In psychology, if anything, the situation is the converse, since it is often reasonable to assume that decisions change the mental state. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> illustrates a second key property of quantum probability theory, that questions/ possibilities in quantum theory can be incompatible. In the example, the bank teller and feminist questions are represented by different bases (black rays versus red rays), and this arrangement does not allow a simultaneous projection on basis vectors for both questions. If a person was told for a fact that one possibility is true (e.g., Linda is a feminist), then the state vector would collapse to the feminist ray, to reflect certainty about the feminist question. But this would introduce unavoidable uncertainty about the incompatible question of whether Linda is a bank teller (the new state vector | ⟩ = | ⟩ has nonzero projections to both the BT and ~BT rays). So, incompatibility implies uncertainty relations. Note, in physics, uncertainty relations mean, for example, that it is impossible to concurrently know the position and momentum of a particle and have led to extensive debate (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Isham, 1989)</ref>. In psychology, a basic way to approach uncertainty relations is that deciding that one event is true (e.g., that Linda is a feminist) creates a unique perspective or mindset for other, incompatible ones (e.g., that Linda is a bank teller).</p><p>For incompatible questions, a joint probability distribution does not exist (since we cannot concurrently resolve all questions) and so the classical notion of conjunction has to be modified. In quantum probability theory, it is possible to define sequential conjunctions, which are just like the classical analogues, but the conjuncts have to be evaluated sequentially (as in the Figure 2 example) and order matters. Let #$ and ! be the projectors for the possibilities that Linda is a bank teller and a feminist and note that #$ ! ≠ ! #$ , i.e., the projectors are non-commuting. Then, the probability that Linda is a bank teller and then a feminist is <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>) and the conditional probability that she is a bank teller given that she is a feminist is ( | ) = | #$ | ! ⟩| " , where | ! ⟩ is a normalized state in the feminist subspace (this is Luder's law, <ref type="bibr">Hughes, 1988)</ref>. Note, these definitions imply that, in general,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( &amp; ℎ ) = | #$ • ! • | ⟩ | "</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">( &amp; ℎ ) ≠ ( &amp; ℎ ) (Equation 1).</formula><p>Note also that for one-dimensional projectors, conditional probabilities conform to a reciprocity property, ( | ) = ( | ). However, this is not true for multidimensional subspaces.</p><p>Uncertainty relations (arising due to incompatibility) lead to interference effects. It is easy to show (Equation 2) that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( ) = ( &amp; ℎ ) + (~ &amp; ℎ ) + Δ.</formula><p>So, we end up with an expression which appears like the quantum analogue of the law of total probability, plus Δ, where Δ is an interference term that can be positive or negative. The interference term allows quantum theory to violate the law of total probability. To account for the conjunction fallacy, we require Δ &lt; − (~ &amp; ℎ ). Note, despite the fact that Δ can produce a conjunction fallacy where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">| #$ | ⟩| " &gt; ( &amp; ℎ ), it is also bounded such that | #$ | ⟩| " ≥ ( &amp; ℎ ) and | #$ | ⟩| " ≥ ( &amp; ℎ ~)</formula><p>. This requirement implies that only the conjunction ( &amp; ℎ ) &gt; ( &amp; ℎ ) can produce a conjunction fallacy. In other words, quantum probability cannot account for double conjunction fallacies.</p><p>In quantum theory we can also have compatible questions, for which the projectors commute, e.g., # % = % # , and quantum and classical probabilities produce the same answers,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">( ) • ( | ) = ( ) • ( | ).</formula><p>With compatible questions Δ = 0, thus, incompatible questions are required to produce the conjunction fallacy.</p><p>Superposition states can be separable or entangled. Consider a participant deciding not just whether Linda is a Feminist (F), but also whether another person Jane is a political Activist (A) or not. Suppose that the judgment for Linda is independent from the judgment for Jane. Then we can write</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">| ⟩ = | &amp;'()* ⟩| +*(, B + ′| &amp;'()* ⟩|~+ *(, B + ′ |~&amp; '()* ⟩| +*(, B + ′ ′|~&amp; '()* ⟩|~+ *(, B = ( | &amp;'()* ⟩ + ′|~&amp; '()* ⟩)⨂( | +*(, B + ′|~+ *(, B)</formula><p>That is, the state for Linda, Jane is given as the tensor product (the symbol ⨂) for the state for each person individually. This state is called a separable state. Alternatively, suppose that Jane is a very good friend of Linda's, so that they are rather similar, and that we believe that Activism and Feminism go together. Then, an appropriate mental state might be</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">| ⟩ = | &amp;'()* ⟩| +*(, B + |~&amp; '()* ⟩|~+ *(, B.</formula><p>Such a state is called an entangled state and the corresponding property entanglement. In this case, we have a special entangled state called a Bell state, whereby a decision for Linda forces an outcome for Jane. Put differently, entanglement means that, for component questions A and B, we cannot write the state for the combined question as | ⟩⨂| ⟩, that is the combined state cannot be constructed by independently combining parts of the representation from | ⟩ and then | ⟩. In physics, entanglement has led to intense debate, because the two systems can be physically separated yet arbitrary measurements on either of them can remain correlated -it can appear that a measurement on one system 'forces' an outcome on a space-separated system (this relates to the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Paradox, <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hughes, 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">, or Isham, 1989</ref>. However, when dealing with mental concepts, entanglement is less philosophically challenging, because it can be attributed to some dependence between the systems, e.g., when considering the different component concepts of a composite one. Entanglement can allow supercorrelations. Consider two individuals, Linda (person A) and Jane (person B), and two binary questions about each person: questions A1, A2 for Linda, and questions B1, B2 for Jane. We can compute correlations <ref type="bibr">(technically, expectation values E[Ai,Bj]</ref>, labelling the binary outcomes for each question as ±1) for all pairs composed of one question about Linda A and one question about Jane B. An ingenious result by Bell shows that any classical joint probability distribution formed by four binary random variables A1, A2, B1, B2 has to be consistent with a linear combination of the correlations called the CHSH inequality (this is a specific version of the <ref type="bibr">Bell inequality, Clauser et al., 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Bell, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Equation 3)</ref>. . Bell showed that if A, B are described with a quantum entangled state, then the Bell bound can be exceeded (but another bound applies, the so-called Tsirelson bound). In this sense, entangled quantum systems can be supercorrelated. It is important to note that supercorrelations can also be a result of 'communication' between the two systems. What is unique about entanglement is that supercorrelations can even occur when no information is allowed to be transmitted between the two systems. In quantum physics, this can be established by having the two systems in an entangled state separated in two different localities. The non-locality requirement, however, is harder to enforce in psychological experiments.</p><p>So far, we have only described static/measurement assumptions. Quantum theory also applies to dynamic situations in which the state vector evolves across e.g. time, according to a unitary process derived from Schrödinger's equation. A unitary process is analogous to a rotation of the state vector in a quantum space, so that with time the probabilities for the various possibilities change. This is analogous to dynamics in classical probability theory, in which the probability distribution over states evolves across time according to a Markov process derived from a Kolmogorov equation.</p><p>There are other, more complex technical details from quantum theory that can be applied to cognitive research. Instead of a state vector, a quantum system can also be represented by a density matrix = ∑ ' ' | ' ⟩⟨ ' |, where ' 's reflect a mixture over states of the system (Comparo, 2013); in such cases, ( ) = ( % ), where the trace operation sums diagonal elements of a matrix. Instead of projection operators, probabilities can also be computed by positive-operator-valuedmeasures (POVMs), which are more general type of measurements. In particular, projectors imply repeatability (e.g., a second measurement produces the same result as the first), whereas POVM type measurements can be noisy and no longer subject to repeatability <ref type="bibr" target="#b265">(Yearsley, 2017)</ref>. Instead of unitary dynamics, one can alternatively employ what are called Lindblad dynamics, which incorporate open system environmental influences and can exhibit a characteristic pattern of oscillation followed by stabilization <ref type="bibr">(Asano et al., 2011)</ref>. Also, the process of measurement has led to intense debate. Rather than require that the state collapses to (identifies with) the question outcome, it is possible to specify the measurement interaction in more detail, as a dynamical process, using the 'instruments' formalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Ozawa &amp; Khrennikov, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tsuchiya et al., in press)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, the key properties of quantum theory that lend themselves to psychological application are primarily superposition states and the collapse property, incompatibility, uncertainty relations and interference effects, entanglement and supercorrelations, though of course these properties are closely inter-dependent. Physicists have sought to reduce all of quantum theory into a single fundamental property (e.g., superposition; Harding 2001), but such considerations are beyond the present scope.</p><p>[Note for reviewers: additional text has been added relative to the original, but this cannot be shown with track changes.] <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Review</head><p>The main objective of this review is to bring together and evaluate the more notable quantum cognitive models across psychology. This objective presents several challenges. First, quantum probability theory has been applied in very diverse cognitive areas. We identified notable applications in conjunction/ disjunction fallacies in probabilistic judgment, conceptual combinations, similarity, order effects on judgments, causal inference, the disjunction effect in decision making, measurement and interference effects on judgments and decisions, memory, perception, and other judgment and decision-making applications; a summary is provided in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Even though all applications of quantum theory share some common elements, different empirical domains come with their own unique research questions and interests. Therefore, we organize quantum cognitive models according to empirical domain and note that coverage and evaluation in certain areas will be a lot more extensive than in others, an inevitable consequence of differences in the interests of the research community. For each empirical domain, we will consider the relevant findings, describe how the quantum models account for the findings, and present a critical evaluation with respect to non-quantum models. Regarding the latter, our purpose is not to provide a comprehensive review of the corresponding debates (some of which are so extensive as to warrant independent, substantive reviews), but rather to selectively focus on an evaluation of quantum models.</p><p>The second challenge is that even within an empirical domain, in some cases theoretical work can extend over several different empirical findings and paradigms. This precludes an organization of the review based on e.g. common characteristics or features between empirical tools, as would be the case in more standard empirically driven reviews. Instead, systematization has to be achieved from the way different theoretical proposals are covered and evaluated. A related challenge is that rigorous inclusion, exclusion criteria cannot be specified. Instead, we have been guided by a sense of which quantum cognitive models have been more notable, based on technical rigor, empirical applicability, and recognition in the relevant research communities. Clearly, in part, these are subjective judgments.</p><p>Overall, the objective in the present review is not to consider every single application of quantum probability theory in psychology. Rather, it is to showcase the way quantum models have contributed new theoretical and technical tools in different areas of psychology and evaluate these contributions in relation to competing non-quantum theories. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.

In the following, we will review approaches using quantum probability theory to account for this fallacy and some remaining controversy and open questions in using quantum probability models for explaining related findings.</p><p>Empirical research.

Using the terminology from <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Tversky and Kahneman's (1983)</ref> paradigmatic Linda example, where BT=bank teller, F=feminist, the conjunction fallacy is ( ∧ ) &gt; ( ). The disjunction fallacy is ( ∨ ) &lt; ( ) (note, this is not to be confused with the disjunction effect, see later, . Conjunction effects often arise when combining an unlikely conjunct with a likely one and/or when the conjuncts have a strong causal association (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Moro, 2009)</ref>. Unpacking effects are violations of the law of total probability e.g. instances of subadditivity, whereby ( ) &lt; ( ∧ ) + ( ∧~). More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Huang et al. (2024a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Huang et al. (2024b)</ref> studied a large number of probability judgments, relating to the last US presidential election, in 2020. They asked their participants to respond to 78 probability judgments each, corresponding to all possible probability expressions involving three events: Biden would win in State A; Biden would win in State B; Biden would win in State C. Two triplets of states were used the tacit negations of the basic events were that Trump would win in the corresponding states. They replicated all existing fallacies, such as conjunction and disjunction fallacies. Additionally, they reported frequent double conjunction and disjunction fallacies and a fairly novel effect of violation of binary complementarity. In its simplest form, binary complementarity is the constraint that Prob(A)+Prob(~A)=1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Huang et al. (2024b)</ref> observed systematic overestimations in the basic binary complementarity expression, as well as other ones. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Gronchi and Strambini (2017)</ref> presented a variant of the Linda problem to test the Wignerd'Espagnat inequality (Equation 4, d <ref type="bibr">'Espagnat, 1979)</ref>. The Wigner-d'Espagnat inequality is a version of Bell's inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Bell, 2004)</ref> better suited to Linda-style paradigms (a Venn diagram illustrates how trivial this is from a classical perspective when all possibilities are represented in the same sample space). Bell notably stated, "trivial as it is, the inequality is not respected by quantum mechanical probabilities'' <ref type="bibr">(Bell, 1981, p. 52)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Gronchi and Strambini (2017)</ref> reported two experiments concerning the probability of picking different objects from an urn or of male vs. female students more likely to be playing soccer. In the first experiment the results indicated violations of the Wigner-d'Espagnat inequality. In a second experiment, when participants directly estimated unpacked probabilities (that is, the two probability terms in the Wigner-d'Espagnat inequality), Wigner-d'Espagnat violations disappeared, thus indicating that a subadditivity pattern (Equation 4) possibly accounts for Wignerd'Espagnat violations.</p><p>Quantum cognitive models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al. (2011)</ref> employed a quantum probability model in which a conjunction fallacy emerges from Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(2)</ref>. Note, this decomposition implies that the conjunctive statement F&amp;BT is evaluated in terms of a projection first to the F subspace and then to the BT one, an assumption justified through appeal to heuristics prioritizing the processing of more likely information <ref type="bibr">(Gigerenzer &amp; Todd, 1996)</ref>. Concretely, a conjunction fallacy can be obtained if the following two conditions are fulfilled. First, | #$~! | ⟩| " has to be small, which is reasonable because the story makes ~F unlikely. Second, the interference term has to be negative, which is the case if the features matching "feminist bank teller" are negatively correlated with the features matching "not feminist bank teller". In the <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al. (2011)</ref> account of conjunction/ disjunction errors the order used to evaluate the questions is critical. <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Miyadera and Phillips (2012)</ref> proposed an extension of this theory that employed positive operator valued measurements and which can produce conjunction errors without necessarily requiring order effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Huang et al. (2023)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Huang (2023)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Huang et al. (2024a)</ref> also provided an extension to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al. (2011)</ref> model, by assuming a response process based on a sequential sampling mechanism, with drifts corresponding to quantum probabilities and a bias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aerts (2009)</ref> also has a quantum model for conjunction and disjunction fallacies. However, this model will be discussed later in the section on conceptual combinations.</p><p>Gronchi and Strambini (2017) produced two quantum models to account for violations of Wigner-d'Espagnat. The first model is based on applying two non-commutative projections, representing incompatible events, on a quantum state in the same space and so this approach is analogous to that of <ref type="bibr">Pothos and Bysemeyer (2009)</ref>. The second model assumes that the two questions for each logical operation in the Wigner-d'Espagnat equation are represented by two commutative projections, representing compatible events, acting on different parts of a joint quantum state. In this construction there will be a violation of Wigner-d'Espagnat inequality only when the joint quantum state has inseparable subparts, namely when the state is entangled. The two models were shown to provide equivalent empirical coverage for violations of Wigner-d'Espagnat inequality.</p><p>Critical evaluation and controversy. One important contribution of quantum models of probability judgments is that they provide a new measure of probability that is not restricted by Kolmogorov axioms and set theory. The Venn diagram picture of events as subsets of a sample space makes it impossible to imagine a conjunction as more likely than a marginal <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). Yet the geometric picture of events as subspaces of a vector space in quantum theory allows us to do so and shows how earlier projections can change our perspective for later ones and so result in a sequential conjunction being more probable than a corresponding marginal ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">Pothos et al. (2017)</ref> showed that quantum theory is consistent with the Dutch Book criterion for rational behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(de Finetti et al., 1993)</ref> and that a conjunction fallacy can be rational when the questions are contextual (the presence of one question alters the meaning of the other) or disturbing. More generally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al.'s (2011)</ref> work has encompassed a range of fallacies related to the conjunction fallacy, notably the disjunction fallacy and unpacking effects.</p><p>Most decision results which have been considered fallacies can be reconciled with (baseline) classical probability theory through appropriate conditionalization. For example, regarding the conjunction fallacy, one could write</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">( &amp; | 1) &gt; ( | 2)</formula><p>, where fm1, fm2 can correspond to different measurement contexts (e.g., frame of minds; Dzhafarov &amp; Kon, in press). Indeed, from a psychological perspective, an explanation based on measurement contexts might appear analogous to the quantum one. However, one hardly ever encounters such models, because an arbitrary, post hoc conditionalization carries low explanatory power. We will therefore discount such possibilities in subsequent discussion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al. (2011)</ref> explained the conjunction fallacy by event incompatibility. Accordingly, if this explanation is correct, manipulations that encourage processing of the conjuncts in a concurrent (compatible) way should reduce conjunction fallacies. Empirical findings show that training on the algebra of sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Agnoli &amp; Krantz, 1989</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">Yamagishi, 2003, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b262">Wolfe &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b262">Reyna, 2010)</ref> and feedback training on the classical probability rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">(Nilsson, 2008)</ref> can reduce conjunction fallacies, which is consistent with this hypothesis as this kind of training should encourage compatibility. Familiarity is also thought to induce transitions from incompatible to compatible representations; for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Nilsson et al. (2013)</ref> showed that conjunction fallacy is reduced when familiarity increases.</p><p>The quantum explanation of the conjunction fallacy is predicated on evaluating the more likely conjunct first, assuming the two predicates are incompatible. This implies that judgments on the two predicates must also result in order effects. There is some evidence that manipulating processing order produces order effects with conjunctions <ref type="bibr">(Stolarz-Fantino et al., 2003, Experiment 2;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Gavanski &amp; Roskos-Ewoldsen, 1991)</ref>. A more direct demonstration was provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley and Trueblood (2018)</ref>, who reported the co-occurrence of conjunction fallacies and order effects (we provide some more detail in the section on "Order effects on judgments"). However, Boyer-Kassem et al. (2016) examined order effects for seven different pairs of questions that had produced conjunction fallacies in past research, but reported order effects in only two cases, no order effects in two other cases, and ambiguous results in the remaining three cases. This apparent null result is undermined by their use of the Bonferroni correction for family-wise error, which has been criticized as too conservative <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Nakagawa, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">Perneger, 1998)</ref>, and the lack of an observation of concurrent conjunction fallacies (which contrasts with <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley &amp; Trueblood, 2018)</ref>. It is possible that their sample was less prone to order effects and conjunction fallacies (their participants were students in economics, management, or medicine).</p><p>Several other models for conjunction and disjunction fallacies have been proposed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Tversky and Kahneman (1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Shafir et al., 1990)</ref> proposed a representativeness heuristic, so that probability judgments are essentially similarity processes. Thus, probabilistic inference is relegated to a more generic cognitive process. However, the similarity mechanism in representativeness is underspecified. Note that probability in the quantum model is sometimes equivalent to overlap between two vectors in some space (the mental state vector and a vector along the way representing a particular question, e.g., whether Linda is a feminist). Such overlap in psychological space has been argued to correspond to similarity computations, in some proposals <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">(Sloman, 1993)</ref>. So, stretching a little bit the corresponding ideas, we could consider the quantum model for the conjunction fallacy as a way to formalize the representativeness heuristic.</p><p>Another class of models that purport to explain such fallacies is averaging models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abelson, Leddo, &amp; Gross, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Fantino, Kulik, &amp; Stolarz-Fantino, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Nilsson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Nilsson et al., 2009)</ref>. The basic idea of averaging models is very intuitive: probability of conjunctions reflects some weighted average of the probabilities of the individual conjuncts. However, there are some well-documented problems with such models. Notably, they cannot distinguish (without additional assumptions) between situations when the two conjuncts are strongly causally related vs. not. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Tversky and Kahneman (1983)</ref> had discussed the conjunction fallacy in cases such as "Mr. F has had one or more heart attacks and Mr. F is older than 55" vs. the lack of a fallacy when participants consider "Mr. F has had one or more heart attacks and Mr. G is older than 55." This difference cannot be easily explained with averaging models. Averaging models also have difficulty distinguishing between conjunctions and disjunctions (this is accomplished through the use of different weights).  proposed an inductive confirmation account of conjunction fallacies; however, this proposal does not attempt to account for disjunction effects. According to inductive confirmation, probability estimates for hypotheses given evidence are driven by the difference (ℎ| ) − (ℎ), where h is a hypothesis and e is evidence . This account dissociates the degree of conjunction fallacy from the probability of the more likely conjunct. <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">Tentori et al.'s (2013)</ref> evidence for this proposal was based on a task that involved a hypothetical woman who is Russian (R), lives in New York (NY), and in addition is an interpreter (I). Their main finding was ( ∧ | ) &gt; ( | ), even though the I possibility is less likely than the ~I one , express this as (~| ∧ ) &gt; ( | ∧ )). Thus, in this scenario and variants the conjunction fallacy arises from a less likely conjunct (being an I). The quantum conjunction fallacy model can account for <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">Tentori et al.'s (2013)</ref> results . Additionally,  argued that order effects in the consideration of the conjuncts <ref type="bibr">(Stolarz-Fantino et al., 2003, Experiment 2;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Gavanski &amp; Roskos-Ewoldsen, 1991</ref>) support the quantum account, but not the inductive confirmation one.</p><p>Another potential advantage of the quantum probability model over the inductive confirmation model is that it is capable of predicting quantitative probability judgments measured on rating scales, while the inductive confirmation theory only forecasts when a conjunction fallacy would occur without predicting the fallacy's magnitude. However, there have been some limited reports of a finding, double conjunction fallacies <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Crupi et al., 2018)</ref>, which is problematic for the quantum model, but can be explained by the inductive confirmation account. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Huang et al. (2024a)</ref> reported more extensive evidence for double conjunction fallacies, indicating that the original <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al. (2011)</ref> model needs some revision.</p><p>In the probability theory plus noise account, probability judgments are based on classical probability theory, but subject to error <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Costello &amp; Watts, 2014;</ref>. To account for conjunction fallacies, the amount of noise is assumed to be greater for conjunctions as compared to single conjuncts, otherwise the model cannot predict systematic conjunction errors. Noise arises because probability estimates are based either on enumerating relevant memory instances or a mental simulation of such instances. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Costello, Watts, and Fisher (2018)</ref> derived several probabilistic expressions which diverge depending on whether one adopts quantum rules or probability plus noise rules. Their results appear to uniformly support their model, not quantum theory. Their criticism is mainly focused on the assumption by the quantum model that incompatible events are necessary to account for the conjunction fallacy. Note, quantum theorists have been incorporating noise in their work too (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Yearsley and Pothos, 2016)</ref>. However, noise has not been explored for the conjunction fallacy, because in quantum theory noise emerges as a small probability that the internal computation may produce A, but one may mistakenly pronounce ~A. Therefore, in quantum models the role of noise should be more relevant in situations of multiple decisions.</p><p>The probability plus noise model has many strengths, including its Bayesian origins and strong intuition. But there are some concerns as well. For example, there is no evidence that cognitive processes give rise to sampling independence for estimating related probabilities (e.g., marginals and a conjunction), but without sampling independence the noise model cannot predict the conjunction fallacy. Additionally, some further clarity is needed in how the essential idea applies to different probability terms (e.g., conditional probabilities; <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Costello &amp; Watts, 2016</ref> and the role of error in probabilities is implausible for completely impossible or certain events. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Costello and Watts's (2014)</ref> prediction for a conjunction fallacy relies on Prob(A∧B) being close to Prob(A), but  reported conjunction fallacy results at odds with this requirement. Notwithstanding these points, the probability plus noise model has been the focus of current research and it is possible that in future iterations some of these issues will be addressed.</p><p>Do <ref type="bibr">Costello et al.'s (2018)</ref> results challenge the quantum model?  consider familiarity to equate with compatibility and there is evidence that this is the case (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley &amp; Trueblood, 2018)</ref>. However, we think that even familiar questions might be incompatible, if they induce different perspectives to each other, as seems apparent for order effects regarding the Clinton, Gore honesty questions . However, there are also aspects captured by the probability plus noise model that are not captured by a quantum probability model. For example, <ref type="bibr">Costello et al. 's (2018)</ref> work shows violation in conditional probability judgments which are not explained by the quantum probability model. This suggests that fallacies in probability judgment are not limited to conjunction and disjunction fallacies, and a more general quantum model is needed to cover all the results from .</p><p>A more recent related model which builds on some ideas from the probability plus noise model is the Bayesian sampler model <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">(Zhu et al., 2020)</ref>. In the Bayesian sampler, conjunction and disjunction fallacies are explained by observers running fewer mental samples of conjunctions compared with the isolated conjunct. The Bayesian sampler model is claimed to account for more probability judgment fallacies than the probability plus noise model. Overall, this is a compelling model. We just note that, just like for the probability plus noise model, the Bayesian sampler explains the conjunction and disjunction fallacy by assuming sampling independence for composite vs. singleton judgments. A detailed comparison between Zhu et al.'s (2020) model and Huang et al.'s (2024a) quantum model, adjusting for complexity, favored the quantum model.</p><p>To summarize the discussion so far, we think there some reasonable concerns for the probability plus noise model and the Bayesian sampler. Equally, work to support these models has also highlighted shortcomings with the original quantum model for the conjunction fallacy (from Busemeyer et al., 2011).</p><p>Boyer-Kassem et al. <ref type="formula">2016</ref>argued that a two-dimensional quantum model (like that shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>) for the conjunction fallacy entails consistency with the grand reciprocity equalities (which they derived). They reported empirical violations of grand reciprocity, which they claimed go against the quantum model. However, the grand reciprocity property requires the assumption that each event is represented by a pure quantum state and rays in complex Hilbert Space (as in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). On the contrary, Busemeyer et al.'s (2011) model is not restricted in this way; in their example events were represented as multi-dimensional subspaces, because it is unlikely that complex psychological concepts (like feminism) would have one-dimensional (single feature) representations . Using multi-dimensional subspaces means that the law of reciprocity need not be obeyed (using POVMs can achieve a similar effect). <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Gronchi and Strambini's (2017)</ref> work brings into focus a key issue, that violations of the Wignerd'Espagnat inequality can arise either because of incompatibility in the same space or compatible representations in separate spaces with an entangled state. Both incompatibility and entanglement can preclude a joint probability distribution, but in the former case because of uncertainty relations and in the latter because of the impossibility to describe the corresponding entities independently of each other. However, researchers may require a commitment to incompatibility or compatibility in any situation. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Gronchi and Strambini's (2017)</ref> experiments, questions regarding the color or shape of objects are likely to be treated as compatible (because perceptual physical properties like this are unlikely to have a contextual influence on each other), but gender and likelihood of playing different sports incompatible (if different genders change our perspective for likely sports).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual combinations</head><p>Empirical research. There are a range of related results examining membership judgments for conceptual combinations, including membership for conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations of concepts. There has been a lot of attention concerning overextension and underextension effects. The former concern situations like a goldfish. A goldfish is a better member of the conjunction of the concepts pet and fish (i.e., pet-fish), than either of concepts individually <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Hampton, 1988a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Osherson &amp; Smith, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Storms et al., 1999)</ref>. Underextension occurs when observers judge strongly an item to belong to some category A and, separately, to another category B, but only weakly to the disjunction of the two categories (A or B). For example, this occurs for a refrigerator, relative to the categories of furniture and home furnishings <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Hampton, 1988b)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Aerts, Sozzo, and Veloz (2018)</ref> also studied negations with conceptual conjunctions, e.g., fruits and vegetables, fruits and not vegetables, not fruits and vegetables, and not fruits and not vegetables. In addition to overextension effects, they also found violations of total probability. For example, the rating for chili pepper being a spice was less than the sum of the ratings for spice and herb plus spice and not herb.</p><p>A different line of research examined issues concerning whether or not conceptual combinations are compositional as opposed to non-compositional. Intuitively, for a compositional conceptual combination, each constituent concept maintains its meaning independently of the other constituent concepts. More formally, suppose we have four conceptual questions A1, A2, B1, B2 which can be true or false (e.g., it can fly/ it cannot fly). These questions can be combined into pairs forming conceptual combinations (e.g., is A1 true and is B1 false). Each of these conceptual questions corresponds to a random variable and the resulting conceptual combinations to joint probabilities. The resulting conceptual combinations are compositional, if the individual random variables are consistent with a joint probability distribution for all four variables. The Bell inequality (Equation 3) provides a corresponding test. A failure of compositionality indicates that some of the random variables/ conceptual questions are contextual, so that their meaning changes depending on which other questions are asked.</p><p>Using novel, ambiguous conceptual combinations, , designed an experiment to test for compositionality. Each conceptual combination involved two words, chosen so that the meaning of each word individually would be ambiguous. For example, in 'spring plant', the meaning of plant could be either a living organism of a certain kind or machinery used in industrial settings. Each participant received one of four primes (a single word), corresponding to the 2 x 2 meaning possibilities, and subsequently was asked to interpret the ambiguous concept and rate the sense of each component word that was employed. The authors then compiled conditional probabilities for the interpretation of each concept combination, given particular primes, which could be employed to test for violations of a variant of the Bell inequality. Violations of Bell were observed, indicating non-compositionality, that is, the meaning of the pair of words could not be determined on the basis of the meaning of each word individually, independently of its context.</p><p>Non-compositionality in concept combinations was also found using a similar design, but different conceptual combinations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Aerts et al. (2018)</ref> asked participants to pick a pair of wind directions (e.g., North and Southwest vs. South and Northeast), that they considered 'good examples of two different wind directions'. Across several trials, participants were presented with choice sets including different combinations of pairs of wind directions. By analogy with entanglement experiments in physics, a first system would involve two directions A, A' and a second system two different wind directions B, B', so that overall we would have four combinations of wind directions (AB, AB' etc.), with each combination specifying a trial (since e.g. each of A, B are binary questions, there are four possibilities for the combined question A, B and participants would choose one). The design was fully within participants. The main empirical finding was that averaged participant responses violated the CHSH inequality, so that a complete joint probability distribution for the four relevant events is impossible.</p><p>Non-compositionality in concept associations was further explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Cervantes and Dzhafarov (2018)</ref>. Participants were presented with one A question and one B question, such that A1: Gerda or Troll, A2: Snow Queen or Old Finn woman, B1: Beautiful or Unattractive, B2: Kind or Evil. Participant responses were used to compute expectations e.g. [ 1, 1], by coding question answers with ±1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Cervantes and Dzhafarov (2018)</ref> reported violations of the CHSH, hence demonstrating noncompositionality in concept associations of this kind.</p><p>A challenging issue in conceptual reasoning concerns borderline vagueness, the idea that for many concepts there are no clearly defined boundaries and there are borderline cases for which it is unclear whether the predicate applies. The Sorites paradox exemplifies such problems. Start by stating that if X is a heap of sand, then removing one grain will surely result in still having a heap. However, the repeated application of this rule results in the paradox that the last grain left must still count as a heap. Alxatib and Pelletier (2011) empirically examined borderline combinations (is 'X is tall and not tall') and found that borderline contradictions were commonly accepted.</p><p>Quantum cognitive models. <ref type="bibr">Aerts and colleagues (2009;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Aerts &amp; Gabora, 2005a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, 2005b</ref><ref type="bibr">Aerts, Gabora, Sozzo, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Aerts, Sozzo, &amp; Veloz, 2015</ref>) developed a quantum theory for conceptual combination, called the "state-context-property" theory, which is one of the earliest quantum models in psychology. This model can also be applied to probability judgment errors such as conjunction and disjunction fallacies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aerts, 2009)</ref>. The state-context-property theory uses an expanded Hilbert space called a Fock space, which can be thought of as a combination of different Hilbert spaces. For a conceptual combination between concepts A, B, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aerts (2009)</ref> proposed a combination of two Hilbert spaces: one used a tensor product between the (quantum) representations for concepts A, B; the other used a superposition of concepts A, B (Equation 5). Note, this combination rule is applied to both conjunctions and disjunctions, but with different parameters allowed for each type of combination. The tensor product space component was designed to satisfy classical conceptual combination, and the superposition component was designed to produce non-classical judgments. Interference effects arise from the superposition part (see <ref type="formula">Equation 2)</ref>, which allow the modelling of overextensions and underextensions. This model purports to formalize the idea of two separate routes to concept combination, a classical one and a quantum one. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Aerts et al. (2018)</ref> also developed a quantum model with an entangled initial state and four tensor product measurements to account for their violations of the CHSH inequality for their experiment on wind directions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Aerts et al. (2018)</ref> represented the questions about wind directions with tensor products of the form ( • ) ⊗ ( • ), where a, b are direction vectors and = : + ; + &lt; , the Pauli spin matrices. In order to describe correlations between binary measurements in two subsystems (i.e., the responses for each of two wind directions, for each subsystem), one needs to identify four direction vectors a, b, a', b' and an entangled state. The authors claim that there is no guarantee of a suitable quantum representation of this kind. But, they identified an entangled mental state and wind directions which described the observed correlations.</p><p>In the work of Cervantes and Dzhafarov (2018) a specific quantum model was not provided, rather the Bell violation was taken as indication of quantum-like contextuality.</p><p>Blutner et al. <ref type="formula">2013</ref>developed a quantum model where probabilities corresponded to activation patterns in a Hopfield network with a single input unit representing the statement of interest (e.g., "John is tall") and two output units representing truth, falsity. The statement could be characterized in one of three ways, definite truth, definite falsity, and truth and falsity at the same time -this last pattern expresses a 'glut' and is a feature of borderline vagueness. Probabilities were assigned to each of these three possibilities using the Boltzmann distribution. The main assumption was that the projectors for truth and falsity were not orthogonal, allowing emergence of interference terms, which affected the normalization factors for the Boltzmann distribution probabilities.</p><p>Critical evaluation and controversy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aerts (2009)</ref> reported exact reproductions of overextension and underextension effects in conceptual combination, covering both conjunctive and disjunctive categories (mostly using <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Hampton's, 1988a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Hampton's, , 1988b</ref>. However, this was achieved by using a number of model parameters that equaled or exceeded the data degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, standard conceptual combination approaches have difficulty with such effects. For example, Hampton (2011) discussed fuzzy logic averaging approaches to overextensions, underextensions, and negations to conclude that they fail to appropriately capture interactions between concepts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Hampton (2011)</ref> argued that a prototype model is more promising, but his approach involves various heuristic assumptions; so a formalized approach (such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aerts's, 2009)</ref> may provide a more coherent explanation across the range of relevant findings.  identified some conceptual combinations for which there was evidence of non-compositionality. These results impact on approaches to conceptual combination requiring compositionality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Fodor's, 1994)</ref>, but less so for proposals based on emergent properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Hampton, 1997)</ref> for which a compositional constraint is less central. Non-compositionality and weaker forms of compositionality are now well established in the conceptual combination literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">(Swinney et al., 2007)</ref>. The main contribution of  is providing a formal framework for assessing compositionality/ contextuality. One can envisage a model with an entangled state , but a demonstration of contextuality does not necessitate a quantum model.</p><p>The interpretation of violations of Bell/ CHSH inequalities from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Aerts et al. (2018)</ref> and  involves some controversy. Several different concepts are relevant here and their precise relation can be a little confused, but the essential idea can be described with the notion of signaling. Suppose you ask questions A1, A2 for system A and questions B1, B2 for system B. No-signaling occurs when the marginal probability of question A1 in the context of B1 is the same as the marginal probability of A1 in the context of B2. Signaling occurs when there is interaction between the systems A, B, e.g., disturbance and/or communication (exactly what is meant by disturbance and communication can vary). In physics, it has been possible to observe violations of Bell/ CHSH inequalities, in the absence of signaling (in landmark demonstrations widely interpreted as indicating quantum structure in the microscopic world, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Aspect, 1982)</ref>. In psychology, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Dzhafarov, Zhang, and Kujala (2016)</ref> argued that violations of the Bell inequality, such as those reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Aerts et al. (2018)</ref> and , tend to go hand in hand with signaling, indicating interaction between the two 'systems' and precluding a conclusion of contextuality/ quantum-like structure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Dzhafarov and Kujala (2013)</ref> developed a generalized version of the CHSH test that is argued to test contextuality beyond what can be expected by signaling (Equation 6). <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Cervantes and Dzhafarov (2018)</ref> reported a violation this generalized CHSH inequality, and so argued that their finding constituted the first evidence of contextuality in human judgments. There is some controversy regarding the extent to which signaling can be corrected for <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Atmanspacher &amp; Filk, 2019)</ref> or how important it is to correct for it, e.g., when the objective is to establish non-compositionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">(Waddup et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Blutner at al. <ref type="formula">2013</ref>showed that Alxatib and Pelletier's (2011) experimental data could be fit by their quantum model, but not a closely matched classical one (for which probability assignment was identical to the quantum one, with the exception of the normalization factor for which interference terms arose in the quantum case). That is, the main empirical finding could be seen as arising from a violation of the law of total probability, so that interference effects from quantum probabilities provided an appropriate modeling instrument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Similarity</head><p>Similarity is a core cognitive process that is assumed to facilitate other processes such as categorization and learning. Geometric and feature-based approaches are the two most prominent classes of models used to describe similarity.</p><p>Empirical research. Geometric models assume that objects or concepts are represented as points in a multidimensional, metric space, where the similarity between any two objects is a function of the distance between the points that represent those objects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Shepard, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Kruskal &amp; Wish, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Nosofsky, 1984)</ref>. Therefore, the more similar two stimuli are, the closer their points will be positioned in the multidimensional space, and the less similar two stimuli are, the further their points will be positioned in the space. Since the geometric models assume similarity is a function of distance in a metric space, they are required to obey the metric axioms: minimality, symmetry, and the triangle inequality. In terms of similarity, minimality states that the similarity between a stimulus and itself is maximal, symmetry states the similarity of stimulus A to stimulus B is equal to the similarity of stimulus B to stimulus A, and the triangle inequality states that the dissimilarity between stimulus A and stimulus C plus the dissimilarity between stimulus C and stimulus B must be equal to or greater than the dissimilarity between stimulus A and stimulus B. The triangle inequality is more difficult to assess in terms of similarity judgments, so further explanation for this point is included in the following paragraph. <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Tversky (1977)</ref> demonstrated violations of all three axioms, which suggests the distancebased similarity function may be a fundamentally flawed approach to similarity.</p><p>To demonstrate violations of symmetry, <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Tversky (1977)</ref> reported that people systematically judged the similarity of, for example, (North) Korea to (Mainland) China to be greater than the similarity of China to Korea (several other pairs of stimuli were employed; China and Korea are generally employed as the most paradigmatic example). Violations of symmetry have been demonstrated on multiple occasions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Aguilar &amp; Medin, 1999)</ref>. For violations of the triangle inequality, <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Tversky (1977)</ref> used William James's example, whereby Similarity (Russia, Jamaica) is low, but Similarity (Russia, Cuba) is high (because of political affiliation) and Similarity(Cuba, Jamaica) is also high (because of geographical proximity), so that Dissimilarity(Russia, Jamaica) &gt; Dissimilarity(Russia, Cuba) + Dissimilarity (Cuba, Jamaica). However, despite the strong intuition for the triangle inequality, <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Tversky's (1977)</ref> example concerns violations of the triangle inequality on distances, not similarities. That is, the triangle inequality constraint (from an assumed metric representation) is that Distance (Russia, Jamaica) &lt; Distance(Russia, Cuba) + Distance(Cuba, Jamaica). It is not straightforward to translate an inequality on distance to one on similarities. Tversky was clearly aware of this issue (in later work he considered violations of the related corner inequality, <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Tversky &amp; Gati, 1982)</ref>, but it seems to have been ignored in some of the subsequent literature (for an exception see <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Nosofsky, 1984)</ref>. Considering options for how to convert the triangle inequality on distances to similarities, Yearsley et al. <ref type="formula">2017</ref>derived a so-called multiplicative triangle inequality (based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Shepard's, 1987</ref>, function for relating distances to similarities). In addition to the violations of the metric axioms, <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Tversky (1977)</ref> also reported that similarity is susceptible to contextual influences from non-targeted alternatives in the choice set, which was coined the diagnosticity effect. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Tversky (1977)</ref> reported that out of Hungary, Sweden, Poland, the country chosen as most similar to Austria is Sweden, but out of Hungary, Sweden, Norway, the country chosen as most similar to Austria is Hungary.</p><p>In reaction to these findings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Tversky (1977)</ref> proposed the contrast model of similarity, which gave rise to the broader class of featural models. Featural models assume that stimuli are decomposed into explicit features and similarity between two stimuli is a function of their number of shared features minus the number of distinctive ones. Although the contrast model can account for violations of the metric axioms, the concept of salience is ill-defined and has proven difficult to apply to other sets of stimuli.</p><p>Finally, researchers have recognized that matching parts between object representations can have a greater influence on similarity judgments, than mismatching parts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Gentner, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Goldstone, 1994)</ref>. To account for this finding, alignment models have been developed to incorporate the structure of stimuli into similarity judgments.</p><p>Quantum cognitive models. A prior motivation for applying quantum theory in similarity is that it involves geometric representations and geometric representations have consistently featured prominently in similarity models <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Kruskal &amp; Wish, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Nosofsky, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Shepard, 1987)</ref>. Whereas traditional geometric models use a point-wise representation (each object corresponds to a single point), in quantum theory representations can be (potentially multidimensional) subspaces. Differences in subspace dimensionality are a natural way to capture differences in knowledge between concepts in a quantum approach. Additionally, quantum probabilities embody order effects and are contextual, which are baseline requirements for violations of symmetry and the diagnosticity effect.  developed a model of similarity judgments as quantum conjunctive probabilities. The quantum geometric model of similarity judgments can generate violations of symmetry in one of two ways. Either by using a biased initial state, where the projection of the initial state vector onto one subspace is greater (in length) than the projection of the initial state vector onto the other subspace, or by using noncommutative projectors, such that the order of projection alters the similarity judgment. To produce violations of symmetry of conceptual stimuli (e.g., China and Korea),  assumed that the dimensionality of the subspace representing China was greater than that of the subspace representing Korea and an initially neutral state at the beginning of each similarity judgment. The dimensionality of a subspace was meant to represent different ideas/knowledge of the stimulus the subspace represents. Therefore, in parallel with Tversky's notion of relative salience determining the direction of asymmetry, extent of knowledge determines the direction of asymmetry in the quantum model. The quantum model immediately reproduces the observed asymmetry, i.e., the similarity of Korea to China was greater than the similarity of China to Korea, as long as the dimensionality of the subspace representing China is greater than the one for Korea.</p><p>To produce an asymmetry between the similarities of perceptual stimuli (e.g., colors), Epping et al. <ref type="formula">2023</ref>offered two adaptations to prior work with quantum theory and similarity. First, all subspaces were assumed to have the same dimensionality, because there should be no differences in extent of knowledge across colors. Second, instead of assuming an unbiased, initial state,  allowed for a biased initial state, whose particular placement could depend on any of three possible mechanisms. The first mechanism is a primacy vs recency one, biasing the state either towards the first or second color in the similarity judgment. The second one is a serial dependence mechanism, such that the final state of the previous similarity judgment influences the position of the subsequent initial state. Finally, the third mechanism is a salience mechanism, which biases the initial state toward the color with greater 'attention-grabbing' properties. Based on a model fitting exercise,  concluded that there was only evidence in support of the primacy versus recency mechanism. Therefore, this runs contrary to Tversky's account that differences in perceptual prominence determine the direction of asymmetries in similarity judgments; there was little support for the salience mechanism in model fits. The best quantum model was shown to outperform the distance-based, pointwise geometric model of similarity judgments, even when that approach was augmented to incorporate a parameter that allowed for symmetry violations (as in <ref type="bibr">Nosofsky, 1991)</ref>. More recently, <ref type="bibr">Tsuchiya et al. (in press)</ref> suggested that results such as those from  indicate that the basic elements of consciousness, qualia, should be understood using quantum theory, rather than the existing formalisms.</p><p>Regarding violations of the triangle inequality, different regions in a quantum space are associated with different contexts (e.g., features/ concepts). So, using <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Tversky's (1977)</ref> example, if a region of a quantum space is consistent with the property of Communism, then representations in or close to that region would reflect varying degrees of consistency with Communism. Therefore, if basis sets are arranged in a two-dimensional space so that one region reflects Cuba, sandwiched between a region for Russia and one for Jamaica, it is straightforward to see how triangle inequality violations can occur (at least on dissimilarities).</p><p>Coverage of the diagnosticity effect relies on order effects in non-commuting projectors.  assumed that each possible pairwise similarity was computed with the quantum similarity rule but modified to include prior projections to any context stimuli. So, in a sequence of projections involving both the compared stimuli and the context ones, differences in eventual selection were observed consistent with the diagnosticity effect. A more recent quantum model for diagnosticity was reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">Yearsley et al. (2022)</ref>. They assumed that the quantum process for similarity judgments is potentially modified by a series of thoughts which are potentially focusing (if the projection sequence retains a transition between the items which are meant to be compared) or distracting. They fitted the model to data on similarity judgments from two experiments.</p><p>Regarding similarity comparisons sensitive to structure, <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Pothos and Trueblood (2015)</ref> adapted the quantum similarity model using the idea of Smolensky (1990) for structure in linguistic representations based on tensor products. For example, for stimuli having three parts <ref type="bibr">(top, middle, bottom)</ref>, such that each part can differ in color and shape, we can write a representation vector as | 〉⨂| ℎ 〉⨂| 〉 + | 〉⨂| ℎ 〉⨂| 〉 + | 〉⨂| ℎ 〉⨂| 〉. The 'part' vectors keep track of matching parts (and can be adjusted to capture influence from matches in place or matches out of place, Goldstone, 1994; Equation 7). In this way, the quantum geometric model of similarity is consistent with the approaches of the previously distinct geometric and feature-based/alignment models, while also accounting for structural similarity as in alignment models.</p><p>Critical evaluation and controversy. Some of the assumptions of quantum similarity models are questionable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Pothos et al.'s (2013)</ref> assumption of a mental state that is neutral in relation to the compared stimuli was justified as one of uniformed priors, appropriate for comparisons involving conceptual stimuli. By contrast  allowed for a biased mental state, with the justification that in perceptual processing it is not uncommon to have priming or other biasing effects, such as recency, primacy etc. However, in principle, some of these effects might be applicable for conceptual stimuli too (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Hogarth &amp; Einhorn, 1992)</ref>, questioning the assumption of a neutral mental state in . More work is needed in this direction, including relevant empirical data.</p><p>The diagnosticity effect explanation in  has the following difficulty. The explanation relies on how the comparison between the same two stimuli can be different, depending on differences in prior projections (assumed to correspond to contextual stimuli). However, there is an issue of scalability when dealing with multiple contextual items and how to understand comparisons involving different numbers of context stimuli. <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">Yearsley et al. (2022)</ref> offered an account of diagnosticity which eliminates this problem, since any processing corresponding to contextual items only introduces one additional step in the projection sequence.</p><p>Another problem is that some of the quantum similarity proposals are descriptive. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Pothos and Trueblood's (2015)</ref> proposal for structural similarity consisted of showing how structural similarity could be embodied in the quantum similarity framework. Arguably, the main value of this work is in showing how structural proposals in language (as in <ref type="bibr">Smolensky, 1990</ref>) and in similarity can be analogous.</p><p>Critics can also challenge the assumption that, in quantum similarity models, concepts are assumed to be incompatible. This means, for example, that we cannot 'concurrently' think of two concepts, like Korea and China. The rationale for this assumption is that thinking about two concepts (e.g., for evaluating their similarity) is a sequential process and a train of thought, so that successive projections correspond to the mental state going through different concepts. Depending on which concept is currently considered, incompatibility means that there are differing perspectives on the likelihood of thinking about other concepts. For example, if one is thinking about China there is uncertainty about whether he/she will next think about Korea, depending on the relation between the subspaces. However, currently it is difficult to reconcile this picture with situations when the compared stimuli are presented concurrently and have simple perceptual form. Such difficulties indicate that the quantum approach to similarity is incomplete.</p><p>Quantum similarity researchers have argued that the main advantage of their approach is the completeness of coverage of <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Tversky's (1977)</ref> and related results, when compared to that from other predominant approaches. For example, the main issue with <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Tversky's (1977)</ref> contrast model is that it involves two independent parameters. For violations of symmetry, these had to be set in a circumvented way (based on assumptions about the relative weighting of the features of the subject and the referent in a similarity comparison). The situation is analogous with other well-known accounts of similarity.

For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Kintsch (2014)</ref> proposed a similarity model based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) that he argued shares properties with the quantum similarity model.

He suggested that the length of a vector in an LSA space reflects amount of knowledge and it is this feature of the model which allows asymmetries in similarity (since the numerator of the similarity metric invokes only one of the compared items). However, there is some underspecificity regarding the kind of knowledge implied by differences in length.

Consider asking judgments about the likelihood of a hypothesis H after presenting two different pieces of evidence (A, B) in different orders (e.g., evaluate H after first being informed that A is true and then being informed that B is not true).

To test the prediction of the QQ equality on inference, <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley and Trueblood (2018)</ref> collected judgments regarding five main candidates for the Republican and Democratic 2016 presidential nominations, concerning (1) the probability of a single event (e.g., the likelihood of one of the candidates winning a state primary) (2) the probability of a single event conditioned on either one or the conjunction of two events (e.g., the likelihood of a candidate winning the election given that they won a state primary or the likelihood of a candidate winning a state primary and winning the election). As there are two possible order effects comparisons per candidate and five total candidates, there were ten potential order effect comparisons. The Bayes Factor for all ten comparisons was greater than 10 14 , which strongly suggests the presence of order effects for each comparison. Next, for each candidate, each participant judged eight different conjunctions. Therefore, since there were five different candidates, there were 40 comparisons that could give rise to the conjunction fallacy. The Bayes factor for 37 out of the 40 comparisons had BF10 &gt; 12, which again strongly suggests the presence of conjunction fallacies. Importantly, both effects were observed for the majority of participants. They also observed a dependence of style of thinking on the likelihood of incompatible representations, so that more compatible representations were more likely for participants adopting a more analytic mode of reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Frederick, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>This finding was also corroborated by , who compared order effects in categorization judgments, in situations which were rule-based (RB) vs. information-integration (II) ones. In Epping and Busemeyer, each participant learned to categorize simple, perceptual stimuli into two categories, and then, during a transfer phase, rated the likelihood that a stimulus belonged to one category and then rated the likelihood that the stimulus belonged to the other category. The RB categorization strategy relies on participants using some verbalizeable rule, which favors a more analytical style of thinking. By contrast, the II categorization strategy is assumed to be mediated via the basal ganglia procedural learning system. Procedural knowledge is generally assumed to be less accessible to consciousness and reflecting a more intuitive style of thinking.

Suppose that order effects are first found to occur for questions A and B in an initial experiment. Then, in a subsequent experiment, question A is presented, followed by B, followed by A again. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Busemeyer and Wang (2017)</ref> conducted this ABA experiment with 325 participants on sets of questions for which order effects had been previously identified and they found a moderate amount of opinion change between the first and second iteration of the A question.</p><p>Quantum cognitive models. According to quantum theory, the basic explanation for question order effects is non-commutativity of incompatible questions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">[ ;,H ℎ (I^= a #( %; | ⟩a " differs from [ (I ℎ ;,H^= a %; #( | ⟩a "</formula><p>. For example, for incompatible questions, earlier questions may create a perspective or context which impacts the way later questions are understood. Specific empirical findings on order effects have been described using more complex (e.g., dynamical) quantum models, considered below.</p><p>Trueblood and Busemeyer (2011) developed a quantum model of order effects on inference and tested the model by fitting it to data from <ref type="bibr">Bergus et al.'s (1998)</ref>   <ref type="bibr">Bergus et al.'s (1998)</ref> task, they specified a mental state for the possible combinations between the presence or absence of a disease and positive or negative evidence of a disease in a four-dimensional, composite vectors space. The initial story and subsequent pieces of evidence were modeled with different rotations of this mental state, where, cognitively, rotations represent the change of perspectives. The mental state was constructed from a part corresponding to the hypothesis of whether the disease was present or not and one corresponding to the evidence. The decision process was modeled as dynamical evolution of this mental state, and occurred both for each part of the mental state separately and in a way which mixed the parts together (this model is analogous to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Pothos &amp; Busemeyer, 2009</ref>, disjunction effect and will be further considered below).</p><p>Beyond binary questions, Wang and Busemeyer (2015; see also Wang &amp; Busemeyer, 2016a) developed a quantum random walk model for modeling question order effects for questions answered by rating scales (e.g., a 9-point rating scale). They successfully applied their model to order results concerning the effectiveness of public health service announcements from the perspective of the self and then another person, in this order vs. the reverse order. This model is analogous to the one <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Kvam et al. (2015)</ref> employed to model the interference between intermediate decisions and later confidence ratings (see section on "Measurement and interference effects on judgments and decisions") and the one  employed to model order effects on category judgments for perceptual stimuli. <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Wang et al. (2014;</ref> showed that the QQ equality can be derived from quantum theory with minimal assumptions, notably, it is valid regardless of the dimensionality of the subspaces for each event and the overall space. In two dimensions, the QQ equality relates to the way the positive and negative answers for two questions (two different basis sets in Hilbert space) are linked up -the unitary rotation that takes us from the basis set for one question to that of another is fixed by the relation between any one answer to one question and another to the other question. <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Wang et al. (2014)</ref> also considered when we expect the QQ equality to be violated, notably when new information is introduced after each question. Specifically, a key assumption underlying the derivation of the QQ equality is that starting from a common state (technically, the state is represented by a density matrix for a mixture of people with individual differences), questions are asked back to back without any information inserted in between so that two successive projections are applied (either % # or # % ) to the common state. New information presented before or inserted in between questions would change the state in different ways. For example, if new information is presented in between questions, then a change is produced by a transformation U' for one type of information, and a different change is produced by another transformation U'' for a different type of information. Rather than comparing % # with # % (as required for the derivation of the QQ equality), we are now comparing % ′′ # with # ′ % , and the equality is no longer expected to hold. For example, the Rose-Jackson poll in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> violated this condition for the QQ test. A more complex quantum model that includes transformations U' and U'' is required for this case. Note, <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley and Trueblood's (2018)</ref> QQ equality variant requires one-dimensional subspaces and reciprocity (reciprocity is automatically true when A, B are represented by one-dimensional subspaces). <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley and Trueblood's (2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Boyer-Kassem et al., 2016)</ref> proposal that incompatibility is the driving factor for both order effects and conjunction fallacies was accompanied by a simple quantum model with one-dimensional subspaces for the effects of interest. The model was employed to extract constraints on the predicted size of order effects and the degree to which conjunction fallacies occur. Also, by studying individual differences in thinking using the Cognitive Reflection Task (CRT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Frederick, 2005</ref>), Yearsley and Trueblood linked an analytic style of thinking with more compatible representations, using a hierarchical model of representations, from fully quantum to fully classical, with intermediate representations having a hybrid form (from <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">Trueblood, Yearsley, &amp; Pothos, 2017)</ref>.  further explored how a quantum approach can be used to formalize the analytic, intuitive distinction, in their categorization work. They argued that RB categorizations allow people to ground category judgments in a single basis, corresponding to that of the relevant stimulus feature measured with the verbalizable rule. In the II case, people cannot use stimulus features to construct a compatible basis for the two category decisions and are left with incompatible representations. This is how they explained order effects in sequential judgments with II categorizations, but not RB ones.</p><p>In the ABA paradigm, the correlation between the two responses of A should reveal identity when A, B are compatible, but it would be otherwise bounded depending on the uncertainty relation between A, B <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Khrennikov et al., 2014)</ref>.

These two effects can each be described by quantum measurement theory individually, but not simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Khrennikov et al., 2014)</ref>. To address this, Ozawa and Khrennikov (2020) developed a more general form of quantum measurement theory based on the theory of quantum instruments. A quantum instrument is a mathematical object intended to replace the traditional projectors in quantum theory, in a way which affords more flexibility and emphasizes the interaction between the quantum system being measured and the classical instrument being used to it. By incorporating quantum instruments, the more general model is intended to capture the statistical properties of all physically realizable quantum measurements.</p><p>Critical evaluation and controversy. Question order effects are classically puzzling, because of commutativity in conjunction. Suppose A, B represent the answer yes to corresponding questions. Then, the event answering yes to the first question and then yes to the second one is given by ( ) ( | ) = ( &amp; ) = ( ) ( | ) and so accommodating order effects can only be done by conditionalizing on e.g. order. Social psychologists argue that sometimes answers to questions are not simply retrieved from memory, but instead they are constructed on-line, which can produce order effects, which, for example, might be the case if earlier questions allow unique thoughts and perspectives for later ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">(Schwarz, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Hogarth and Einhorn's (1992)</ref>   <ref type="formula">2002</ref>and concluded that the quantum model provided the better fit to empirical results.</p><p>Regarding non-binary questions, Wang and Busemeyer (2015) compared their quantum model with a closely matched Markov random walk model (both models required estimating five parameters to predict 182 joint frequencies from both orders) and reported superior fits for the quantum model for their empirical results. This was largely because in the quantum model the two questions were represented as incompatible, so that in consecutive judgments order/ interference effects can emerge; this was not possible in the Markov random walk model.</p><p>The QQ equality is one of the most impressive predictions from the quantum cognition research programme, because it represents an a priori, parameter-free prediction, which can be derived with minimal assumptions. Some researchers have attempted to derive the QQ equality with non-quantum accounts. <ref type="bibr">Kellen et al. (2018)</ref> and  identified approaches that either reproduced the QQ equality exactly or showed the QQ equality as a likely prediction, thus contesting the necessity for the quantum formalism to account for the QQ equality. These alternative models have an advantage in that the underlying psychological process is more clearly specified. However, one can argue that it is unsurprising that heuristic principles can be employed to reproduce a formal result; descriptive accounts for an empirical finding are always possible. The advantage of the quantum approach is that the QQ equality is predicted a priori and enables a clear characterization of the conditions under which we expect the prediction to fail. Note, additionally, it is unclear whether <ref type="bibr">Kellen et al.'s (2018)</ref> analysis can naturally be extended to reproduce the QQ equality variant that <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley and Trueblood (2018)</ref> reported.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley and Trueblood's (2018)</ref> work, both the co-occurrence of order effects with conjunction fallacies (and the size of these effects) and the likelihood of having incompatible representations on style of thinking (analytic vs. reflective) were a priori predictions motivated from quantum theory, which were confirmed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley and Trueblood (2018)</ref> examined whether <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Hogarth and Einhorn's (1992)</ref> anchoring and adjustment model can reproduce their QQ equality variant, but this was not possible without implausible assumptions.

They noted that there are no existing non-quantum models which require a co-occurrence of order effects and conjunction fallacies or that predict a dependency of such effects on cognitive style of thinking.  prediction that RB categorizations indicate compatible representations (and analogously for II ones) is a bold one which merits further tests.</p><p>The ABA paradigm was proposed as a test of the incompatibility principle as an explanation for question order effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Khrennikov et al. (2014)</ref>. The correlation between the two responses of A in the ABA paradigm should reveal identity when A, B are compatible, but if they are incompatible, it should be bounded depending on the uncertainty relation between A, B <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Khrennikov et al., 2014)</ref>. That is, if a response to question A is followed by an incompatible question B, then the answer to question A has to become uncertain again and the correlation between the two A copies should be less than 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Khrennikov et al. (2014)</ref> argued that people would try to be consistent across the replications of A, regardless of the presence of B in between and despite the fact that there may be order effects for the A, B questions. However, the results of the ABA experiment by <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">Wang and Busemeyer (2015)</ref> showed changes in opinion across the replications of question A and, more importantly, the squared correlation between the first and second A measurements was found to be positively related to the squared correlation between the A, B measurements, as predicted by their quantum model. Classical test theory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Lord &amp; Novick, 2013)</ref> also postulates variability in measurements across occasions. According to this view, the measurement outcome from rating a question represents both a true opinion, that is fixed across repeated measurements, and some measurement error, that randomly varies across repeated measurements. However, the measurement error model differs from the quantum approach in a fundamental manner. When considering an AA sequence (i.e., responding to A twice without B in between), the projection principle of quantum probability predicts perfect correlation between the first and second measurements of A, whereas classical test theory allows measurement error to occur across repetitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>. Classical test theory also cannot predict the role of compatibility of B in affecting the relation between the two iterations of A in an ABA sequence. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Ozawa and Khrennikov (2021)</ref> argued that question order effects and the QQ equality should co-occur with what they called the response replicability effect, that is, identity between the two iterations of the same question A. In order to produce all three effects, they employed the formalism of instruments regarding measurements, which allows more flexibility, compared to the standard approach (the standard approach being that post-measurement the state identifies with the outcome of the measurement). However, it is unclear whether the empirical data favor Ozawa and Khrennikov's assumption of the response replicability effect, as just discussed .</p></div>

Empirical research.  presented three experiments, broadly based on the causal structures and procedures from Rehder (2014), seeking to challenge classical intuition in causal inference. They reported three novel empirical findings. First, they observed evidence for reciprocity, that is, ( | ) = ( | ), which is surprising because of the asymmetry between causes and effects (reciprocity shows insensitivity in causal direction). The inverse fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1972</ref>) is related to reciprocity, but there have not been demonstrations in the area of causal inference. Second, there was evidence for memorylessness, which occurs when conditionalization in probability estimation depends only on the latest information to be considered. For example, in some cases conditionalization on A &amp; then B would appear equivalent to just B. Finally, they observed evidence that classical inconsistencies were more likely to be adopted in unfamiliar situations and for participants who approached the task in a more intuitive way (as opposed to deliberative, measured using the Cognitive Reflection Test; <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Frederick, 2005)</ref>. Together with these novel empirical findings,  also reported violations of the Markov condition, anti-discounting behavior, and order effects, partly replicating Rehder (2014).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantum cognitive models.</head><p>The evidence for inconsistencies with classical probability principles in causal inference motivates the application of quantum theory. Equally, there is evidence for some classical behavior in causal inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Rehder, 2014)</ref>. Accordingly, Trueblood et al. (2017) specified a hierarchy of representations, from fully quantum to fully classical, which included intermediate levels with some effects/ causes represented in compatible ways and some in incompatible ways. The fully classical representation required an eight-dimensional space, since all causal reasoning scenarios involved three binary variables, while the fully quantum representation required only a two-dimensional space (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Trueblood &amp; Busemeyer, 2012)</ref>. The advantage of the hierarchical approach was that quantum and classical putative influences could be integrated in the same framework in a coherent manner. Regarding the quantum part of the model, different causes, effects were represented as rays and rotation matrices were fitted to the data to achieve empirical fits. Probabilities were computed by projectors in nearly all cases, except for the fully quantum one, for which a version with POVMs outperformed a version with projectors. In  modeling, POVMs allowed the circumvention of reciprocity (which was not observed consistently).</p><p>Critical evaluation and controversy.  employed model comparison techniques penalizing for a number of parameters and so determined the dimension of the model needed to predict the data for each experiment, noting that the highest dimensional version was equivalent to a classical probability model. In all cases, a dimensionality below fully classical was required for best fit (i.e., quantum representations were needed). Prior to Trueblood et a.'s (2017) work, it had already been recognized that causal inference can violate classical principles, which undermined the then predominant descriptive and normative framework for causal reasoning, based on Bayesian networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">(Pearl, 1988</ref>). Rehder's (2014) results provided strong evidence that, at least in some cases, there is a discrepancy between predictions from Bayes nets and human behavior (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Fernbach &amp; Sloman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Park &amp; Sloman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Rottman &amp; Hastie, 2016</ref>). Rehder's (2014) approach for the range of behaviors in causal inference, including both classical and non-classical biases, was to specify three heuristic models, which together with a Bayesian one could additively combine to predict participant behavior.  argued that their main contribution was to show how individual heuristic principles were not needed, but rather nonclassical behavior in causal inference could be explained by employing incompatibility/ interference effects from quantum theory (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Mistry et al., 2018)</ref>. Note, even if there is no technical need for separate heuristics, heuristics potentially provide descriptive interpretations for subsets of the relevant behavior under quantum theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Mistry et al., 2018)</ref>. Also,  showed that more compatible representations were more likely to be observed for participants adopting a more analytic mode of reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Frederick, 2005)</ref> and after more experience with the task, so supporting their view for the source of incompatibility in cognition.</p><p>Despite the potential benefits of a quantum approach in addressing apparent Bayesian fallacies in causal inference, there are also some challenges to be addressed. First, there is an abundant amount of evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Lewis, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Pearl, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Morgan &amp; Winship, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Sloman et al., 2015</ref>) that, beyond observational-level Bayesian inference processes, counterfactual reasoning plays an important role in human causal inference. However, there has not been any work on a quantum approach concerning counterfactual reasoning and the connection from counterfactual to causation. Second, a recent study on causal reasoning has included a focus on the intuitive physics domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">(White, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wolff et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Gerstenberg et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Gerstenberg et al., , 2021</ref>; models that try to explain causal reasoning in the physical domain usually rely on mental physical simulations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The disjunction effect in decision making</head><p>Empirical research. The disjunction effect is an influential demonstration of an apparent violation of the law of total probability, which is defined here as the failure of total probability inferred from known conditions to predict the probability of an unknown condition. In one variant , participants were presented with a prisoner's dilemma game in which the dominant action is defection for both players. The unique feature of the experiment by <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">Shafir and Tversky (1992)</ref> was that participants received different information about the action of the other player: that he/she would cooperate, defect, or no information. In each of the 'known action' conditions, most participants preferred to defect, but in the 'unknown' condition, many reversed their judgment to cooperate, revealing that ( ; ) &lt; ( | ) and at the same time ( ; ) &lt; ( | ), where the conditional refers to information provided by the experimenter for the other player, and ( ; ) refers to the probability when there is no such information.

Therefore, the marginal in the unknown condition is expected to be bounded by the conditionals in each of the known conditions, but the results violate these bounds, and so have been interpreted as a violation of the law of total probability.

(2006)</ref> proposed a dynamical model for the prisoner dilemma version of the disjunction effect. The model is built from two different parts. In the first part, each action (defect, cooperate) of the opponent is represented by a separate Hamiltonian, 8 ( ), 9 ( ), based on the payoff matrix of the game. The two Hamiltonians can be combined by a direct sum to produce 8 ( ) ⊕ 9 ( ). If only this first part is used, then the predictions satisfy the law of total probability. To produce interference effects, <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Pothos and Busemeyer (2009)</ref> used an additional interaction Hamiltonian J(K which was designed to align beliefs and actions, in a manner consistent with the psychological principle of cognitive dissonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Festinger, 1957)</ref>. Using both parts together, ( 8 ⊕ 9 ) + J(K , can lead to interference effects that account for the observed violations of the law of total probability (Equation 8). Broekaert et al. (2020) proposed a similar model using analogous unitary dynamics, except that their model was developed to explain the disjunction effect in gambling task. Accordingly, their Hamiltonian and measurement matrices would be a little different from those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Pothos and Busemeyer (2009)</ref>. Note, because there were differences in the emergence of the disjunction effect between less and more risk averse participants, the model was fitted differently for the two groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aerts (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Khrennikov and Haven (2009)</ref>, and Yukalov and Sornette (2011) all provided alternative quantum models based on the common idea that the quantum state under the uncertain condition is a superposition of the quantum states for each known condition: L2*;,M(0IN( = • L2*;,O'( + • L2*;,&amp;IH, . The squared length of this superposition state could produce an interference term, ∆, like that shown in Equation 2, which is required to cover the disjunction effect.</p><p>Critical evaluation and controversy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Pothos and Busemeyer (2009)</ref> showed that the quantum model could describe the disjunction effect better than a matched Markov model (employing the Kolmogorov forward equation). The initial explanation for the disjunction effect, from <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Tversky and Shafir (1992)</ref>, was that this is a failure of consequential reasoning. In prisoner's dilemma participants may have a good reason to defect knowing the opponent has defected and a good (different) reason knowing the opponent has cooperated but lack clarity of why they should defect in the unknown case. However, this intuitive explanation does not provide quantitative predictions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Tversky and Shafir (1992)</ref> proposed a version of prospect theory with a changing reference point to account for the disjunction effect with the two-stage gambling task. But the changing reference point model only applies to results from that task and not to prisoner's dilemma, whereas the quantum model applies to both sets of results using the same principles. One criticism of <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Pothos and Busemeyer's (2009)</ref> model is that, because of its use of unitary dynamics, the choice probabilities can oscillate over extended time periods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Pothos and Busemeyer (2009)</ref> based their predictions on a point in the dynamics before oscillations occurred, but a better approach might be to use open system dynamics, in which oscillations are eventually quenched (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Asano et al., 2011a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Asano et al., , 2011b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Kvam et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Rosner et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>It has been argued that perhaps the ability of quantum models to account for puzzling findings like the disjunction effect arises from the additional flexibility of the quantum model produced by extra parameters or model complexity. To address this issue, Busemeyer, Wang, and Shiffrin (2015) conducted a Bayesian model comparison of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Pothos and Busemeyer (2009)</ref> quantum model with the <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Tversky and Shafir (1992)</ref> reference point model for the two-stage gambling paradigm. A large experiment on the two-stage gambling task was used to compare the two models, which were matched in their number of free parameters. The Bayes factors were computed at the individual participant level, and the model comparison overwhelmingly favored the quantum model, indicating that its success is due to its ability to make accurate predictions rather than increased complexity. Despite this, a comparison between a non-dynamic quantum model and an open system model (which avoids the problem of indefinite oscillations) has yet to be conducted for the disjunction fallacy.</p><p>Yukalov and Sornette's (2011) framework was presented as a general framework for probabilistic decision making, with applications to a variety of decision-making phenomena (also discussed later). However, regarding the disjunction effect, there is a weakness. They proposed that the interference term is determined by an uncertainty factor that is negative for taking actions, and positive for not taking actions. This principle applies to the two-stage gambling results, but not to the prisoner's dilemma results. In the latter, both cooperation and defection are actions that the player can take. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aerts (2009)</ref> applied his conceptual combination model to the disjunction effect as well. The two concepts in the original version of the model were equated with the various conditions required for testing the sure thing principle. This creates a confusing picture, since in conceptual combination we have ℎ ( &amp; ) = [ ℎ ( ), ℎ ( )^. However, for the disjunction effect we must instead consider ( ) = ( &amp; ) + ( &amp; ) (plus possibly interference terms). A more recent problem regarding models of disjunction fallacy is evident in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Broekaert et al. (2020)</ref>, where findings show the extent of risk aversion is closely correlated with the fallacy in the gambling setting, while none of the current models take into account risk as an explicit feature. The quantum model provided best fit to the data for both more risk averse and less risk averse participants, but the fits were obtained by utilizing two different sets of parameters (for the low and high risk conditions), rather than directly taking into account risk, as is the case with the existing Markov and logistic models. A future direction would be to extend quantum models for gambling tasks in a way that include risk and loss aversion directly.</p></div>

There have been several proposals for how earlier questions might influence responses to later ones. When discussing question order effects, we considered the idea that earlier questions might create thoughts which impact on how later ones are approached -but such effects are not specific to whether a question is considered but not answered vs. answered. Regarding the latter, answering a question in a certain way might bias subsequent responding, as a way to avoid cognitive dissonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Festinger, 1957)</ref>. For example, Glöckner, Betsch, and Schindler (2010) demonstrated coherence shifts, i.e. changes in subjective cue validities related to a decision, in a direction indicating greater consistency with the decision. Similar results were reported in (hypothetical) legal decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Holyoak &amp; Simon, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Simon et al., 2001</ref>). There have been some studies attempting to harness such intuitions into paradigms suitable for applications of quantum theory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">White et al. (2014</ref> provided a direct demonstration of constructive influences in judgment, as predicted by a quantum framework. They employed a paradigm of presenting two stimuli of opposite positive, negative valence (e.g., corresponding to imagined smartphone ads). The pairs of stimuli were always presented in the same order. In all cases participants provided an affective rating for the second stimulus. In some cases, participants provided an affective rating for the first one as well. <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">White et al. (2014</ref> observed what they called an evaluation bias, according to which the second stimulus was rated in a more extreme way when the first stimulus had been rated too, than when it had not. Put differently, the intermediate judgment created an impression of greater contrast between the first and second stimuli. <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">White et al. (2014</ref> presented several modifications to their procedure and controls and generalized the finding with other kinds of judgments (e.g., trustworthiness). In a more recent demonstration, White et al. (2020) showed a similar effect, in the context of a real organizational questionnaire, with participants comprised of business managers taking part in organizational workshops.</p><p>The idea that judgments can influence the mental state of a person was further explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Yearsley and Pothos (2016)</ref>. They employed a hypothetical murder mystery, such that the suspect would be originally considered innocent. All participants would then receive 12 pieces of evidence indicating the suspect to be guilty, such that each piece of evidence was individually weak but collectively they would make a strong case of guilt. With a between participants manipulation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Yearsley and Pothos (2016)</ref> varied the number of intermediate judgments about guilt for the suspect. They found that increasing the number of intermediate judgments slowed down opinion change. Note, this is the quantum Zeno prediction in physical systems, as translated to opinion change.</p><p>An interference effect of categorization on decision making has been found using a categorization-decision task <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">(Townsend et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Busemeyer et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, Wang &amp; Busemeyer, 2016</ref>. Participants were first presented with a face and then went through one of two conditions on each trial. For the categorization-decision condition, participants were asked to first categorize the face as friendly or hostile, and then decide to attack or withdraw; for the decision alone condition, participants observed the face without being asked to categorize it and simply made a decision. This paradigm provides an empirical test of the law of total probability. That is, is the sum ( &amp; ) + ( &amp;~) from the categorization-decision condition equal to ( ; ) from the decision alone condition? The intermediate categorization apparently produced interference effects on the decision: the probability to attack in the decision alone condition was higher than both when the face was categorized as friendly and hostile. A similar design was used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Kvam et al. (2015)</ref> to investigate interference effects of choice on later confidence ratings. Participants were presented with a dynamic dot display (dots jiggling around with some proportion systematically moving in the same direction) and then received one of two conditions on each trial. For the choice-judge condition, participants were asked to first decide the direction of dot motion at time t1, and then rate their confidence that the direction was left vs. right at a later time t2; for the judgment alone condition, participants simply pushed a preplanned button at time t1, and then made a judgment at time t2. This paradigm provides an empirical test of the law of total probability and it was found that the intermediate choice produced interference effects on the later judgment. The average confidence rating was stronger for the correct direction under the judgment alone condition as compared to the total probability from the choice-judgment condition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Kvam et al. (2014)</ref> also examined measurement effects in a prisoner's dilemma task. In such a task, participants have to decide whether to defect or cooperate with a (usually computer) agent, and then a payoff is assigned to different combinations of actions that encourage mutual defection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Kvam et al. (2014)</ref> employed an added manipulation in which the player first made a promise to cooperate or not to a first agent (A), and then played the PD game with another agent (B). They found that the promise made to a first agent A increased cooperation rate for another agent B, contrary to economic game theory.</p><p>Finally, interference effects of belief judgments on decisions have also been observed in a sequential prisoner's dilemma task <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Blanco et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Croson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tesar, in press)</ref>. Asking a person to predict the opponent's play changes the player's probability to cooperate as compared to conditions when no prediction is made.</p><p>Quantum cognitive models. <ref type="bibr">White et al.'s (2014</ref><ref type="bibr">White et al.'s ( , 2015</ref> quantum model for the evaluation bias was based on a two-dimensional space, with a basis for positive, negative affect and an initial state close to one of these rays, depending on the valence of the first stimulus (e.g., if the first stimulus was positive, the mental state was close to the positive affect ray). The subsequent oppositely valenced stimulus was modeled with an appropriate rotation (e.g., if the subsequent stimulus was negative, the rotation was towards the negative ray). The impact of the intermediate rating was a projection of the mental state to the corresponding subspace, which meant that the subsequent rotation would bring the mental state closer to the oppositely valenced ray. Therefore, the collapse assumption in quantum theory drives prediction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Yearsley and Pothos (2016)</ref> also employed a two-dimensional space, with a basis set corresponding to the guilt, innocence of the suspect. The effect of each piece of evidence on the mental state was modeled by a time-dependent unitary operator, so that the impact of particular pieces of evidence on opinion change depended on their serial position <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Hogarth &amp; Einhorn, 1992)</ref>. Intermediate judgments on the mental state were modeled through POVMs, since with several judgments (in some conditions) there would be large aggregate error. <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Yearsley and Pothos (2016)</ref> computed an analytic expression for the survival probability (probability of no-change) as a function of intermediate judgments. The main feature of their quantum model is the collapse postulate.</p><p>For the categorization-decision task, Wang and Busemeyer (2016b) used a model similar to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Pothos and Busemeyer (2009)</ref>. They also employed a Hamiltonian with two parts: one part built using the structure !P',()2; ⨁ QIHK'2, , corresponding to changes in payoff evaluations depending on each kind of categorization, and another part using an interaction Hamiltonian, which aligns categorizations with decisions. The full Hamiltonian is !P',()2; ⨁ QIHK'2, + R':,P , which allows dynamical evolution of the mental state in a way that produces interference effects and violations of the law of total probability.</p><p>These results were modeled in an alternative way by <ref type="bibr">Moreira and Wichert (2016)</ref>, who employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">Tucci's (1995)</ref> quantum-like network. While Bayesian networks propagate probabilities, quantum-like networks propagate amplitudes. Because amplitudes propagate across multiple paths, quantum nets can give rise to interference effects not possible in Bayesian networks. <ref type="bibr">Moreira and Wichert (2016)</ref> computed the interference terms in their quantum network from the face images in the categorization, decision paradigm (from <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Busemeyer et al., 2009)</ref>. They converted the images into vectors, stochastically determined assignment into good and bad faces, and computed cosine similarities between images in the different good/bad categories. These similarities were employed as interference terms in the quantum network model. In order to model interference between intermediate decisions and later confidence ratings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Kvam et al. (2015)</ref> employed a quantum sequential sampling model, involving a tridiagonal Hamiltonian, derived from the Feynman crystal model <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Feynman &amp; Hibbs, 1965)</ref>. The diagonal elements represent a potential function to drive the amplitudes for confidence in the direction indicated by the dot motion, and the off diagonal entries diffuse amplitude to adjacent states. The quantum model predicted that, without an intermediate decision, amplitudes are pushed towards extreme confidence levels; but with an intermediate decision and subsequent processing of the stimuli (second stage processing), the flow of amplitude towards extreme confidence levels is less pronounced, as empirically observed.</p><p>Interference arises in the model because the second stage processing makes the initially commuting projectors for the intermediate decision and the subsequent confidence rating non-commuting.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr">Kvam et al.'s (2014)</ref> prisoner's dilemma variant, a quantum model was built for how internal states of intention to cooperate or not relate to action. They assumed that the decision maker is initially in a superposition between being a cooperative versus a defective type of player, and the promise to cooperate induces a collapse to the cooperative type, which in turn increases the probability to cooperate with future opponents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Denolf et al. (2017)</ref> proposed a two-dimensional quantum model for the sequential version of the Prisoner's Dilemma game in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Blanco et al. (2014)</ref>. They assumed that the basis for belief judgments is related to the basis for action decisions by a unitary rotation. The main features in their model were an elaboration of assumptions (relative to previous quantum models for the Prisoner's Dilemma) regarding whether actions or beliefs could be considered compatible or incompatible.</p><p>Critical evaluation and controversy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">White et al. (2014</ref> aimed to show how the projection associated with the intermediate judgment could account for a change in second stimulus evaluation, as predicted by quantum theory. No specific fits were carried out, but the finding of the evaluation bias was considered to confirm the quantum prediction, based on certain assumptions (e.g., the relative placement of rays, which <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">White et al., 2014</ref>, justified with consistency arguments). <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">White et al. (2014)</ref> argued that the evaluation bias was an a priori prediction of quantum theory. They examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Hogarth and Einhorn's (1992)</ref> anchoring and adjustment model, as in that model an eventual judgment from multiple pieces of evidence can be influenced by intermediate judgments. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">White et al. (2014)</ref> concluded that reasonable parameterizations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Hogarth and Einhorn's (1992)</ref> model do not allow the evaluation bias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">White et al. (2020)</ref> further compared the quantum model with <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Hogarth and Einhorn's (1992)</ref>, extending the specification of both models. In their fits it was not possible to conclude in favor of one model. Memory or attention processes could also potentially account for the evaluation bias. For example, the intermediate judgment potentially creates a stronger memory trace for the first stimulus, which then creates a stronger contrast with the second stimulus. Arguably, such potential explanations for the evaluation bias are complementary to the formal description from formal theory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Yearsley and Pothos (2016)</ref> compared the quantum model to a matched classical probability model, which also incorporated error-prone decisions; the two models primarily differed in that the quantum model allows for measurement effects from constructive judgments, but in the classical model measurement was not assumed to influence the mental state (reporting a belief does not provide new evidence for a Bayesian update). Because the empirical findings showed an impact from the number of intermediate judgments, the proposed classical model performed poorly compared to the quantum model. Yearsley and Pothos's model accounted for the effects of intermediate judgments in a parameter-free way (the classical and quantum models were fit to a subset of data involving no intermediate judgements, and the fits to the rest of the data were essentially tests of generalization). However, there are a number of choices made in the construction of the models whose impact is unclear. In particular this was one of the first quantum cognition papers to utilize POVM measurements to fit behavioral data, and it is not known how much the success of the model depends on the details of the POVMs.</p><p>Wang and Busemeyer (2016b) compared their quantum model with a closely matched Markov model, but only the former could produce interference effects and so account for empirical results. Additional hidden states can be added to the Markov model to accommodate differences between categorization-decision and decision alone conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(He &amp; Jiang, 2018)</ref>, but arguably such an approach becomes less principled. In addition to the Markov model, these authors also discussed a signal detection model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ashby &amp; Townsend, 1986)</ref>, for which, following categorization, the eventual decision can still depend on the stimulus; for the Markov and quantum models, once a categorization is made, the decision depends only on the categorization. The authors argued that signal detection theory would have trouble accounting for interference, unless one introduces post hoc assumptions regarding how the response regions (for the categorizations and/or the decisions) change boundaries depending on stimulus categorization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Moreira and Wichert's (2017)</ref> quantum model for the categorization, decision violation of the law of total probability raises some questions. For example, it is unclear that the vectors in the quantum network are equivalent to the ones employed to compute the similarities. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Moreira and Wichert (2017)</ref> assumed a renormalization of the image vectors to occupy the negative part of the vector space, because this leads to a restriction to just destructive interference effects (as empirically observed), but this assumption could do with further justification. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Kvam et al. (2015)</ref> compared the quantum model to a Markov random walk model <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">(Pike, 1966)</ref>, which uses an analogous tridiagonal intensity matrix; both models were matched in terms of number and purpose of parameters. Markov random walk and sequential sampling models generally (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Ratcliff &amp; Smith, 2004</ref>) assume a trajectory of values across time, so that a specific accumulation point exists for each hypothesis at each time point (i.e., all uncertainty is epistemic). Measurement simply records these existing values and there is no default mechanism for how a judgment affects performance. Quantum models assume a dispersive wave of beliefs at each moment until a choice is made that collapses the wave; that is, choices can change the mental state. The empirically observed interference effect between intermediate decision and subsequent confidence rating could only be predicted by the quantum model, not the Markov one, and a Bayesian model comparison favored the former. One can ask whether the advantage of the quantum model could arise from other model features (e.g., the initial state and evolution operator). This is possible, however, the prediction of no interference by the Markov model is a fairly general property (not dependent on model details). Markov models could produce interference by assuming that the intermediate decision causes a change in the evolution, but this avenue does not appear promising in this case; <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Kvam et al. (2015)</ref> examined and ruled out several possibilities of this type for their data. <ref type="bibr">Kvam et al.'s (2014)</ref> quantum model predicted their prisoner's dilemma data better than a matched classical model, which lacked capacity for a constructive influence from the intermediate judgment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Denolf et al. (2017)</ref> allowed outcomes of a rating scale to be non-orthogonal vectors, which is uncommon in quantum measurement theory. However, their approach is broadly equivalent to an assumption of POVM measurement and has the advantage of requiring only a low dimensional space for representation.</p></div>

Post-study, two cue words would be presented individually with a request to recall other words from the lists just studied, with a view to examine the word senses activated by the cues, by interpreting the recalled words.

Subsequently, in a test phase, participants are exposed to a test list with words in four categories: targets, distractors semantically related to the targets, and unrelated distractors. Recognition instructions are varied factorially with the test items. The test probes included questions such as "is it a Target" (T), "is it a related distractor" (R), "is it a target or a related distractor" (T or R), which correspond to probabilities ( ), ( ), ( ) respectively. The major finding is overdistribution, defined as ( ) + ( ) &gt; ( ) (this is a disjunction error). Classically, since the categories of T and R are mutually exclusive, we expect instead that ( ) + ( ) = ( ). The surprising finding is that some test items are judged as both presented and not presented from test <ref type="bibr">(Brainerd &amp; Reyna, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Brainerd et al., 2010)</ref>. Together with overdistribution, we also have a subadditivity effect, which occurs when the probability of accepting an item in mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories is greater than one. So, subadditivity also indicates ( ) + ( ) + ( ) &gt; ( ∪ ∪ ) = 1, where NR is a non-related distractor, and T, R, NR comprise the set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive cues, but in this case there is no overt cue.</p><p>The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Atmanspacher and Filk (2010)</ref> raises the possibility of violations of classical constraints in relation to a sequence of events in memory. Consider a particular question, for example whether a hypothetical suspect is guilty or not, and evidence related to this question at different time points, t1, t2, t3. Assume that the suspect is initially considered innocent and all the pieces of evidence (fairly weakly) indicate guilt. Suppose next that participants are asked whether they changed their impression of whether the suspect is guilty or not across different time points, e.g., denote as S ( 5 , T ) the number of such 'change' judgments across the initial and final time points. Set theory can be used to show that S ( 5 , T ) ≤ S ( 5 , " ) + S ( " , T ), which is a statement that the number of changes across the extreme time points is bounded by the sum of changes at each pair of consecutive time points <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Atmanspacher &amp; Filk, 2010</ref>; this inequality is a version of the Temporal Bell inequality, which is considered in more detail in the Perception section).

Instead, they assumed that verbatim and gist information is incompatible, so that a person can adopt one perspective or the other, but not both. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Denolf and Lambert-Mogiliansky (2016)</ref> called this model the Complementary Memory Types (CMT) model.

In a four-dimensional space, three basis vectors corresponded to verbatim information for each one of the three memorized lists (in the experiment covered by the model) and one to unrelated information. An alternative basis set corresponded to gist information. Gist information was modeled with a single vector, with equal amplitudes along the basis vectors for each memorized list and zero for unrelated information.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perception</head><p>Empirical research. This section reviews two studies related to bistable perception. Bistable perception refers to the unstable perception that occurs with ambiguous figures, such as the Necker cube, which can be perceived in one of two ways, each revealing a different interpretation of the figure. Typically, there is a sensation of effort in switching between interpretations. <ref type="bibr">Atmanspacher et al. (2004)</ref> analyzed past results measuring the frequency of reversals in a Necker cube bistable perception task, where the Necker cube is presented non-continuously over time. They examined past work demonstrating an experimental effect between the off-time of the noncontinuous presentation and the switching period T and found that the switching period shows a quadratic relationship with the off-time interval. The effect matches the prediction from the quantum Zeno effect in physics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Conte et al. (2009)</ref> employed a paradigm involving the sequential presentation of two ambiguous figures (each figure could be perceived in two different ways) or the presentation of just one of the figures. It is possible that seeing a first figure may result in some bias in perceiving the second figure and indeed <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Conte et al. (2009)</ref> reported a violation of the law of total probability in the sense that ( U ∧ S ) + ( U ∧ U ) ≠ ( U ) (A and B refer to the two figures and the + and -signs to the two possible ways of perceiving them).</p><p>Quantum cognitive models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Conte et al. (2009)</ref> argued that the violation of the law of total probability in their bistable perception results indicates that the mental states corresponding to the interpretation of each figure are superpositions, so that interference effects can arise (see Equation 2). They presented a simple quantum model (using the same number of parameters as data points), which reproduced the results. <ref type="bibr">Atmanspacher et al. (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Atmanspacher and Filk (2010)</ref> developed a quantum oscillator model (which they call the Necker Zeno model) for bistable perception. The model works on a bipartite system, whose dynamics without any observation are governed by a particular unitary. Observations of the systems are modeled by projections onto the two eigenstates, corresponding to each of the two interpretations of the Necker cube. The main prediction of the model is the quantum Zeno effect, which relates three characteristic times: the switching time T, the oscillation characteristic time without observation, and the time between each observation. The model can be applied to non-continuous presentation bistable perception tasks. In general, the model predicts a quadratic relationship between the reversal time and the off-time. As discussed, the model broadly matches empirical evidence (recall, <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Yearsley &amp; Pothos, 2016</ref>, offered a direct demonstration of the quantum Zeno effect in decision making).</p><p>Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Atmanspacher and Filk (2010)</ref> showed that their Necker Zeno model predicts violations of the temporal Bell inequality. The temporal Bell inequality is a "temporal" version of the standard Bell inequality: it is expressed in terms of correlations between question outcomes for the same system between three (or four) time points <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">(Yearsley &amp; Pothos, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Atmanspacher and Filk's (2010)</ref> model illustrates an example where the violation of this temporal Bell inequality is maximal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Atmanspacher and Filk (2010)</ref> also outlined the kind of empirical tests which could be employed to demonstrate a violation of a temporal Bell inequality, based on manipulations which ostensibly lead to interpretation switches with time (recall, <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">Waddup et al., 2023</ref>, offered such a demonstration, in memory).</p><p>Critical evaluation and controversy. One concern about the <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Conte et al. (2009)</ref> results is the small sample size used in their study. Another concern is the strict interpretation that the perceptual results arise from a quantum process; there was limited consideration of possible classical explanations for the results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Atmanspacher and Filk (2010)</ref> reported that their quantum model accurately predicted the quadratic relation between lifetimes T and 'time off' found in previous research. Their work also makes a further bold implication: in order to violate the temporal Bell inequality, it has to be the case that participants would tend to not switch interpretation across 5 , " and also not switch between " , T , but then switch across 5 , T , which violates an obvious intuition of transitivity. One plausible explanation for such a pattern of results would be that the relevant mental state is extended time-wise, that is, it does not have a well-defined trajectory through time. A timewise non-local mental state may extend, for example, across both periods 5 , " , so that one can no longer assume that an event at 5 caused changes at " . So, if the predictions from this work were to be empirically confirmed, there would be intriguing implications for understanding causality across time <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">(Yearsley &amp; Pothos, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Precise predictions from Atmanspacher and Filk's (2010) framework for when the temporal Bell inequality is likely to be violated depend on the details of how the Hamiltonian and observation operators are specified. Further work is needed to motivate (ideally pre-fit with pilot data) the various components of the quantum model.</p><p>Another issue is how tightly we can make an association between a putative violation of temporal Bell and quantum-like representations. In the Memory section, we considered <ref type="bibr">Waddup et al.'s (2023)</ref> work; they employed a 'change' judgment which allowed testing of Bell's inequality, in a way which should eliminate signaling across time. In the Conceptual Combination section, we reviewed the controversy regarding signaling corrections (notably <ref type="bibr">Cervantes &amp; Dzhafarov, 2017)</ref>. In both the present case and these other cases, a subtle point is the role of signaling checks in inferring quantum-like structure, an issue which has led to interpretative challenges.</p></div>

Moreover, they checked for signaling and, in some cases, sensitivity to the counterpart's decisions was unaccompanied by signaling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Huang et al.

(2012) presented a quantum social network that builds on the same graph theoretical structure as that of a classical network, whereby vertices describe agents and edges indicate agent interactions. In classical social networks, edges reflect preexisting properties of the agents. By contrast, in quantum social networks, edges are represented with quantum states, so that without some measuring operation it is not possible to characterize them in terms of specific properties. Cabello et al. <ref type="formula">2012</ref>showed that for certain variations of the Lovasz sandwich theorem, there is no general social network that can outperform the quantum social network.</p><p>Khrennikov (2020) employed a quantum-like social 'lasing' model for information propagation in social networks, which he argued explains the bandwagon effect. In this model, each agent in the social network carries some social energy, and information transmission in the social network is analogous to stimulated emission of photons in quantum physics, except that in social communication, social action or social information, instead of photon signals is amplified. The bandwagon effect emerges naturally, as a result of Bose-Einstein statistics for indistinguishable photons in stimulated emissions.</p><p>Zhang and Busemeyer (2021) proposed a quantum walk model for idea propagation, between agents in a social network. The core of the model is a controlled unitary operator, which is defined as the tensor product between a matrix containing all controller bits and a unitary operator that turns on only when the controller bit is 1. This 'lifted' quantum walk model alleviates one important drawback of the previous, predominant approach, based on a non-lifted Hamiltonian, which could only accommodate symmetrical information flow (by contrast, information flow in a social network in Zhang &amp; Busemeyer can also be asymmetrical).</p><p>Regarding the interaction of agents, <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Waddup et al. (2021)</ref> showed that the sensitivity of one agent to the actions of another precluded the description of decision probabilities with a four-way classical probability distribution (note, there were two actions for each of two agents) and violated the Bell inequality. They reported a simple quantum model which could accommodate the data, outperforming a simple model based on baseline Bayesian probabilities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Huang et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Critical Evaluation and Controversies</head><p>Prior to <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Huang et al. (2022)</ref>, previous work relating to quantum social networks has been at a theoretical level (e.g., in terms of information-theoretic application), but with less emphasis on corresponding psychological implications. As a result, prior examinations of such ideas have not involved application to behavioral data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Huang et al. (2022)</ref> applied the lifted quantum walk model to the largest serial reproduction dataset, at the time of their investigation. However, <ref type="bibr">Huang et al.'s (2022)</ref> model incorporates an assumption of the easiest/ simplest information path in a social network and so more work is needed to examine alternative approaches, as well as the general usefulness of their quantum model in understanding social communications.</p><p>Another potential problem of existing quantum models of social networks is that the necessity of or even advantage for a quantum approach has not been sufficiently demonstrated. For example, the bandwagon effect, as explained in <ref type="bibr">Khrennikov (2020)</ref>, could also be explained by classical models. Even if a quantum model explains some data well, there is an onus on proponents of such formalisms to show that quantum features are particularly well-suited to the empirical phenomenon of interest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Huang et al. (2022)</ref> did point out that their lifted quantum walk model could potentially explain order effects, which is a qualitative effect not easily explained by a classical Markov model. However, clearly, more work is needed along similar lines. <ref type="bibr">Waddup et al.'s (2021)</ref> demonstration establishes the point that, in cases of interacting individuals, sensitivity to a counterpart's decisions sometimes exceeds the descriptive capacity of baseline classical probability approaches (that is, approaches which do not incorporate additional variables to separate out contexts). A limitation of this work is that it has not been possible to identify realistic situations exemplifying the kind of interactions assumed in the experimental paradigm and until this is accomplished the impact from this work would be limited.</p><p>Prior to Zhang and Busemeyer (2021), research in this area has predominantly utilized traditional methods in quantum probability, including standard Hamiltonian constructions, which may have difficulty modeling information exchanges that are asymmetrical. The lifted quantum walk model by Zhang and Busemeyer solves this problem, but the parameters of the lifted quantum walk model have yet to be mapped to psychological quantities in a convincing way. More work is needed to explain the conceptual and psychological implication of these lifted quantum walk models.</p><p>Overall, the research in this section encompasses empirical domains, which have only fairly recently attracted the attention of modelers. The application of quantum-like models appears promising, but it is premature to offer any stronger conclusions.</p></div>

They reported that the empirical relative frequency of choosing the risky option conformed to a very steep S-shaped function of a utility factor. The S-shaped function was shifted upwards for males as compared to females.</p><p>The Ellsberg paradox <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Ellsberg, 1961)</ref> is a decision task involving drawing colored balls from an urn. The task is to decide which color will be most likely. A particular color (say red) is associated with a fixed probability, but another one (say green) with an unknown probability. When participants are told to choose between a bet on drawing a red ball vs. a green one, then they choose the former. When participants are told to choose between a bet on not drawing a red ball vs. not a green one, then they also choose the former, displaying ambiguity aversion (aversion to ambiguous probabilities) and violating expected utility theory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Dimmock et al.

(2016)</ref> used <ref type="bibr">Yukalov and Sornette's theory (2014)</ref> to make predictions for their risky choice decision experiment. The theory essentially assumes that the decision maker's decision state is a superposition over the four combinations of belief/disbelief about how a lottery will be conducted and the risk/safe actions. They defined two other vectors: one called the prospect for taking the risk, which is a superposition over the two belief/disbelief possibilities in conjunction with the state for taking the risky option; and the second is a superposition of belief/disbelief possibilities in conjunction with taking the safe option. The decision maker can transition from the initial decision state either to the risky prospect or the safe prospect. The state-risk amplitude equals the inner product of the initial decision state with the risky prospect and the state-safe amplitude equals the inner product of the initial decision state with the safe prospect. The probability to take the risky option equals the squared magnitude of the state-risk amplitude divided by a normalization term, and the normalization equals the sum of the squared magnitudes of the state-risk and state-safe amplitudes. Then, this probability is decomposed into three parts: a probability of belief and risk, a probability of disbelief and risk, and an interference term. The sum of the first two terms corresponds to the classical law of total probability and is called the utility factor; the interference term is called the attraction factor. The utility factor is assumed to be equal to an increasing function of the ratio of expected values. The attraction factor is assumed to be ¼ in magnitude, called the quarter law, and is derived from a uniform prior distribution. Finally, the sign of the interference term is determined by a formula based on the values of maximum gains and probabilities of minimal gains. The model is then used to derive a piecewise linear function (with a discontinuity step) of the probability to choose the risky option as a function of the utility factor.</p><p>LaMura <ref type="formula">2009</ref>provided a quantum framework for expected utility, called projective expected utility theory. Whereas expected utility theory is based on the expectation of utilities represented as a random variable, projective expected utility is based on the expectation of payoff utilities represented as a Hermitian operator. The use of a quantum framework for obtaining probabilities allows for interference effects and contextual dependence, which can accommodate the Ellsberg and Allais paradoxes, amongst other results.</p><p>Al Nowaiti and Dhami (2017) focused on the Ellsberg paradox, aiming to capture both ambiguity aversion and ambiguity seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Dimmock et al., 2015)</ref>. They employed Feynman's rules for state transitions, when the intermediate steps are known vs. not known. Briefly, in a transition → through 5 , " , when the intermediate state is observed, then the overall transition probabilities are obtained by adding probabilities. However, when it is not observed, the overall transition probabilities are obtained by adding amplitudes, which can lead to interference effects. This approach could accommodate <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Dimmock et al.'s (2015)</ref> findings, depending on assumptions of whether cognitive processing is overt (probabilities combine) or covert (amplitudes combine), without parameter manipulation. Ellsberg and Allais paradoxes have been the focus of other quantum model proposals <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Khrennikov &amp; Haven, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Aerts et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Asano et al., 2017</ref>, which all share some key elements (the use of interference terms/ contextuality to accommodate the paradoxes). <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Rosner et al.

The Hamiltonian part of their model was meant to capture the oscillatory aspects of behavior and the Lindblad part stabilization towards an eventual decision. Competition between the Hamiltonian and the Lindblad parts allowed the model to capture varying degrees of stabilization of eye tracking dynamics. A novel aspect of this approach is that the Lindblad part can be specified to reflect drifts towards any of the possible decision outcomes and indeed any combination of outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Rosner et al. (2022)</ref> incorporated three possible drifts in their models, towards a yes, no, or uncertain decisions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Basieva et al. (2017)</ref> argued that Bayes rule provides incomplete coverage of everyday inference, because it precludes large jumps from priors to posteriors. Classically updated probabilities are linearly dependent on priors and the ratio of likelihoods is constrained by the ratio of priors, so that low priors will restrict posteriors. Additionally, zero priors entail zero posteriors, a situation called by the authors the zero priors trap. The zero priors trap has a long history. Oliver Cromwell allegedly said to the members of the synod of the Church of Scotland "to think it possible that you may be mistaken" (Carlyle, 1885). The idea here is that a small probability should be assigned to even highly improbable situations. <ref type="bibr">Shafer's (1975)</ref> model can circumvent the zero priors trap in an otherwise Bayesian framework, by organizing hypotheses into groups and assigning a prior probability to each group. Crucially, there is flexibility in how group probability is divided amongst individual hypotheses, and new information could lead to a reassignment that means that we no longer need to update from a zero prior. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Basieva et al.

Furthermore, the approximate agreement between the observed S-shape function of probability to take a gamble and ratio of expected utilities, and the corresponding predicted piecewise linear function (with discontinuity) is not unique to their theory.

Also, if such work is to attract interest from the community, it will have to go hand in hand with some novel prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary Evaluations</head><p>What are the main strengths of quantum cognitive models? Quantum theory has provided a new conceptual and mathematical framework for understanding behavior, with several new concepts, such as superposition, incompatibility, and interference, as well as representational and computational tools. Throughout this review, we have seen examples of behaviors challenging from a classical (usually to mean Bayesian) perspective (notably from the Tversky, Kahneman tradition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>, which have fairly natural models with quantum theory. To be clear, as discussed, for all these phenomena there are ways to offer Bayesian descriptions (e.g., through suitable conditionalizations). But invariably such approaches are not considered satisfactory (of course, there are exceptions, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Goodman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Griffiths et al., 2015)</ref>. The main strength of quantum theory is that it offers a coherent set of principles which accommodates a fairly large proportion of findings problematic from a classical perspective. Quantum cognitive models are not always successful. They tend to be successful in cases where there are interference effects (e.g., in relation to different orders, unpacking, conjunctions, disjunctions etc.), constructive influences (changes of the mental state as a result of a decision), and contextuality.</p><p>A reasonable question is whether showing consistency of some behavior with a particular formal framework adds "anything to our understanding of the underlying psychology" (we quote from Sewell's action letter regarding our paper). Of course, the same question can be stated for any theoretical concept in psychology. For example, what is the explanatory value for labelling a set of behaviors as instances of the representativeness heuristic? One generic answer is that the objective of psychology is to identify structure/ regularity in behavior and describe it on the basis of as few principles as possible. So, assuming that some behavior is consistent with a particular heuristic or with the principles of a formal framework, such as quantum theory, are both instances of pursuing such a general scientific objective. The difference between psychological theory based on verbally expressed principles, such as heuristics, and formal frameworks, such as quantum theory, is that with the latter one aims to achieve better descriptive precision and formulate more detailed predictions. We think that quantum theory has served well in these respects. For example, many of the phenomena treated with quantum theory, such as the disjunction fallacy, the conjunction fallacy, and violations of the metric axioms in similarity judgments, have largely been considered in broad terms, whereas corresponding quantum models have provided specific, quantitative predictions, which could be rigorously assessed against empirical results (of course, the same can be said for Bayesian models in these areas). Additionally, the use of such models have allowed some broad insights about behavior, in terms of the concepts of incompatibility, interference etc.</p><p>A particular added value of quantum cognitive models is that they have enabled the consideration of apparently disparate findings together, particularly in probabilistic reasoning. At a more general level, this means that a coherent explanation is possible for several different findings, as offered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al. (2011)</ref> for several fallacies in probabilistic reasoning. With hindsight, it might seem obvious that, e.g., disjunction fallacies, conjunction fallacies, and question order effects should be treated within the same theoretical framework. However, historically, many of these fallacies were explained with isolated principles, with little obvious relation to each other. It has only been more recently through the increasing use of formal frameworks, both quantum and Bayesian, that more general models have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Costello &amp; Watts, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b274">Zhu et al., 2020)</ref>. With quantum theory, the key insight is that in many (most?) probabilistic fallacies the common cause is incompatibility, which creates interference in complex probability terms. This means that both within participants and within items, evidence for one fallacy should allow predictions for other fallacies. A good example of this approach is <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley and Trueblood (2018)</ref>, but increasingly there are similar attempts in ongoing research.</p><p>Often, quantum theory does not replace explanations based on heuristics and biases, but rather extends them. That is, sometimes a quantum model competes with such explanations, but more often than not, it complements them. For example, the quantum model for the conjunction fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Busemeyer et al., 2011)</ref> was presented as a particular way to formalize the idea of representativeness from <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Kahneman and Tversky (1983)</ref>. The added value of extending or replacing some such ideas with quantum models is prediction and generative value. A prominent example is how moving away from descriptive explanations for question order effects (e.g., from social psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">Schwarz, 2007)</ref> has allowed the novel prediction for the QQ equality <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">(Wang et al., 2014)</ref>. Of course, the use of quantum theory has limitations too. For example, a notable problem in the heuristics and biases literature is the selection problem, that is, how to choose an appropriate heuristic/ bias for a given situation. However, current work with quantum models cannot offer a resolution to this problem.</p><p>Another strength of the quantum cognition research program is that it has enabled a better understanding of the impact of bounded rationality constraints in cognition. The perspective from quantum theory is that the intractability of full Bayesian rationality means that question sets are broken down into smaller sets, such that within each set the situation is Bayesian (compatible questions), but across sets non-classical effects arise (incompatibility). While the idea to explore bounded rational versions of Bayesian theory is not new (both <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Watts, 2014, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b274">Zhu et al., 2020</ref>, can be seen as attempts in that direction), quantum theory offers some new tools in the debate -notably the distinction between a Boolean algebra and a partial Boolean algebra, as well as quantitative demonstrations of differences in complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Pothos et al., 2021)</ref>. The issue of rationality, how complexity demands challenge rationality, and the behavioral approximations to rational behavior have been at the center of our efforts to understand human behavior and the use of quantum theory allows a novel pathway towards resolving this debate. A related point is that it may seem that the most natural competitor of quantum cognitive models are Bayesian models. But this is not the case. Rather, the objective is to understand the appropriate boundary conditions between Bayesian and non-Bayesian behavior, and the extent to which the latter involves a quantum-like component. It is possible that this effort will eventually elucidate key distinctions in cognitive science, such as the slow, analytic, reflective system vs. the fast, heuristic, reflexive one (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Kahneman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Sloman, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">cf. Trueblood et al., 2017)</ref>, as well as offer a reconceptualization of what it means to be rational <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">(Pothos et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What are the main weaknesses of quantum cognitive models?</head><p>We have created this review with a critical mindset and we summarize some key points here. First, most quantum cognitive models depend on incompatibility, as incompatibility allows the interference effects necessary to violate the law of total probability, produce order effects etc. How can incompatibility be determined a priori? Some investigators assess incompatibility empirically, e.g., with order effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Boyer-Kassem et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley &amp; Trueblood, 2018)</ref>. Others have employed proxy measures for incompatibility, notably style of thinking (a more reflexive vs. reflective style of thinking is more likely to lead to incompatible representations; <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Frederick, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley &amp; Trueblood, 2018)</ref>. Low familiarity with question combinations is also thought to make incompatible representations more likely <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Busemeyer et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Costello et al., in press;</ref>. Overall, however, a more general approach is needed, which would include clarity on the nature of incompatibility in cognition and how it arises and preclude mimicries between matched approaches to the same problem utilizing both compatible and incompatible representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Gronchi &amp; Strambini, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>A second related issue has been the relatively few applications of dynamical vs. non-dynamical approaches in quantum cognition. This question arises in many areas of psychology (e.g., a decision researcher can adopt a non-dynamical heuristic model vs. a stochastic diffusion model). Note, the adoption of dynamical models in cognitive psychology typically goes hand in hand with interest in modeling response times. So far, there have been limited applications of quantum models to choice response times (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Busemeyer et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Fuss &amp; Navarro, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Epping, Kvam, Pleskac, &amp; Busemeyer, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Third, violations of Bell inequalities have led to controversy in psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Dzhafarov &amp; Kujala, 2014)</ref>. Violations of the Bell inequality in physics occur with measurements from separated systems, where the measurements from one system cannot be communicated to the other. This is essential so as to characterize the cause of Bell violations as 'spooky action at a distance', with its far-reaching implications for causality and locality. But violations of the Bell inequality in psychology occur with two judgments from one and the same person <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">(Waddup et al., 2021</ref> offered an exception), and the person is obviously aware of all responses. As noted, signaling can arise from connectedness between two systems and it is easy to show violations of Bell in connected classical systems <ref type="bibr">(Aerts, 1982)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Cervantes and Dzhafarov (2018)</ref> offered a no-signaling demonstration of contextuality. However, arguably, there is still lack of clarity regarding the relative psychological importance of demonstrations of contextuality with and without signaling; the interpretative significance of no-signaling does not translate neatly in psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">(Waddup et al., 2021)</ref>. For example, some investigators would be employing Bell as a test of compositionality and in such cases it may matter less whether the cause is signaling (e.g., . Another difficulty is that a violation of Bell does not provide strong evidence for a quantum model specifically, because it can arise from a variety of models that depend on contextual judgments. Quantum theory is not unique in incorporating contextual influences, even if an advantage of the quantum approach is that there are specific rules for relating different probability spaces arising from contextuality.</p><p>Are there results disproving quantum cognitive models? Boyer-Kassem et al. (2016) and  argued that this is the case, in terms of failures of consistency with the QQ equality, constraints that ought to be adhered to if people were employing quantum probabilities, and lack of association between different results predicted from incompatibility (e.g., order effects and conjunction fallacies). There are several responses. First, Costello's arguments were focused on the compatibility assumptions required to apply the theory, rather than main axioms of the theory. Second, Boyer-Kassem et al. (2016) tests were limited to a very simple special case of quantum theory (two dimensional spaces) for their theoretical objection and there have been competing experimental results regarding their empirical objection <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">(Yearsley &amp; Trueblood, 2018)</ref>. Third, as noted, it would be extremely surprising if all behavioral phenomena can be modeled within the quantum framework and it seems likely that there are bounds of applicability in quantum cognition models. For example, regarding supercorrelations, while quantum representations can violate the classical Bell bound, they are restricted to an alternative bound -the so-called Tsirelson bound -lending themselves to simple tests. Plausibly, there would be cognitive processes outside the remit of probabilistic frameworks, classical or quantum, which would require explanations of other kinds.</p><p>Some other difficulties in creating quantum cognitive models are not unique to such models <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Busemeyer et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b266">Yearsley &amp; Busemeyer, 2016)</ref>. A space of states needs to be specified; an initial state needs to be motivated, typically by assuming uniform uncertainty regarding the available options; a choice of static vs. dynamical approach needs to be made; the relevant questions need to be represented. The latter requirement can be more involved for a quantum model, since the precise relation between incompatible representations needs to be specified. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al. (2011)</ref> the quantum model was developed in general terms and the issue of representation was addressed in terms of conditions for the required effect. Other researchers have motivated representations from the form of the stimuli (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">White et al., 2014)</ref> or parameterized and fitted representations from empirical results (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Yearsley &amp; Pothos, 2016)</ref>. A recent advance has been the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Busemeyer and Wang (2018)</ref> for extracting quantum representations from frequency tables violating classical constraints. In principle, this procedure can be adopted much like how categorization researchers have employed multidimensional scaling to extract vector representations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Nosofsky, 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Nosofsky, , 1992</ref>. A future challenge for this technique is how to accommodate representations beyond rays.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Are quantum cognitive models consistent with each other?</head><p>The short answer is no, but they do share some essential similarities, by virtue of which the label 'quantum' is justified. There are several ways to elaborate this point. First, quantum theory is a mathematical theory of probability. It would be surprising and implausible if a mathematical framework could serve as a psychological model, without any psychology-specific assumptions. Even in early quantum cognition research, where researchers tried to apply quantum theory with as few additional assumptions as possible, some assumptions were still essential. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al.'s (2011)</ref> work on the conjunction fallacy and related fallacies was mostly based on basic quantum theory, with the additional ideas that the predicates were incompatible and that order of evaluation of the predicates in conjunctions was from more likely first. So, different quantum cognitive models, even if they employ the same tools from quantum theory, might differ in terms of the particular psychological assumptions they adopt. A good example is <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al.'s (2011)</ref> work and the more recent proposal of <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Huang et al. (2024a)</ref>. In the latter case, on top of quantum theory, a response process was postulated, based on a sequential sampling process, with drifts based on the quantum probabilities and a bias. Clearly, the predictions from <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Huang et al. (2024a)</ref> do not fully overlap. For example, the latter model can account for double conjunction fallacies and violations of binary complementary, but not the former. But, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Huang et al. (2024a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Busemeyer et al. (2011)</ref> could be seen as being in a nested relationship, there are examples of quantum cognitive models which are basically at odds with each other. For example, regarding the disjunction effect, we have seen several approaches: <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Pothos and Busemeyer (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">Yukalov and Sornette (2011)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aerts (2009)</ref>, amongst others. These approaches are based on very different mechanisms. Even though detailed comparisons have not been carried out, the models vary considerably in which elements from quantum theory they apply and how.</p><p>To sum up so far, the main characteristic that quantum cognitive models share is that they all employ some concepts and tools from quantum theory. These allows considerable flexibility in the specification of these models and so there are fairly few a priori expectations regarding their consistency. This is the norm in cognitive theory. Bayesian models too vary considerably in their assumptions, specifications, and choice of processes to employ. For example, regarding the conjunction fallacy and related fallacies, the models from , <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Costello and Watts (2014)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">Zhu et al. (2020)</ref> all differ extensively in their specification and the former produces different predictions from the other two models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Jones and Love (2011)</ref> suggested that Bayesian researchers over-extend the application of the label 'Bayesian' to their models, across applications which are too disparate to be useful. We only partly agree: as long the basic processes and calculations can be traced back to the axioms of Bayesian (or quantum etc.) theory, then a corresponding label is both informative and useful. For example, Bayesian models would still be more similar to each other (even if just in terms of their fundamental assumptions) than say a Bayesian model and one based on heuristics.</p><p>Given that many of the quantum cognitive models we discussed are either plainly inconsistent with each other or have ambiguous relation with each other, one might wonder whether a review like the present one would be more useful, if it were possible to provide specific conclusions about model relationships, perhaps on the back of detailed model comparisons. This is impractical. Detailed model comparisons can be extremely involved and, indeed, are not routinely carried out. In most cases, for any two models, a detailed comparison can be a substantial project by itself. Additionally, in some cases considerable progress can be made on the basis of evaluating a model's assumptions and plausibility in general terms (that is, outside fits to empirical data). We believe the purpose of a review like this is to offer an overview and outline of existing work, and pursue comments regarding comparisons to the extent that this is possible at a general level. In the absence of detailed comparisons, one can ask whether it is possible to summarize at a broad, approximate level some main differences and similarities between the models we considered. We have addressed this by creating <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> was generated using a multidimensional scaling method based on the table in the Appendix. We applied metric multidimensional scaling with Euclidean distance as the metric and set the random state to 0. The models included in the figure were selected as representative examples from each empirical category discussed in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> of the manuscript. After obtaining the multidimensional scaling results, we identified the nearest neighbor of each model and connected them with a blue line in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. If two models are mutual nearest neighbors, their connection is marked with a green line. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> provides a visual representation of model similarities, though readers are advised to interpret the figure cautiously, as a two-dimensional representation may not fully capture all aspects of model similarities and differences. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. An approximate, visual representation of some of the model relations. The blue lines indicate the nearest neighbor of the model, and the green lines indicate that the two models are mutual nearest neighbor of each other. If a model is connected by two lines, with one being blue and the other being green, then the model's nearest neighbor is the one connected by the green line. And if the model is connected by two blue lines, then the nearest neighbor of the model is the one with the shorter distance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Are quantum cognitive models more complex than classical ones?</head><p>There are three ways to approach this question. First, there is the issue of technical complexity of quantum cognitive models. Second, we can consider the conceptual complexity of such model, that is, the extent to which the concepts involved in a quantum cognitive model are understandable to general psychologists (as opposed to just mathematical psychologists). Third, we can ask whether the formalism "can be interpreted as a one-to-one reflection of how cognition operates at a mechanistic level" (we are quoting Sewell, the action editor).</p><p>Regarding the first issue, in quantum probability theory there are two types of questions (incompatible, compatible) and only one type in classical theory (compatible). This fact may tempt the inference that quantum theory is all of classical theory (for compatible questions) and a little bit more (for incompatible ones), so that quantum cognitive models are necessarily more complex than classical ones. However, when most researchers develop a quantum model, they typically intend a model based on incompatible representations, with compatibility reserved for the matched Bayesian model, if an existing Bayesian model is not available. The issue of complexity concerns then how well constructed the quantum/ classical models are. On the few occasions when this has been studied in detail, the results favored the quantum model.  were the first to employ a Bayesian method to quantitatively compare matched quantum, classical models for data on dynamic consistency (which concerns whether decision makers follow through with plans made in advance) and the comparison favored the quantum model.  compared a hierarchy of models in a causal inference situation, including fully quantum and fully classical ones, with the deviance information criterion (DIC), and analogously for <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">Trueblood and Hemmer (2017)</ref> for results concerning episodic memory -in both cases quantum models were favored. A related issue concerns parameter recovery and quantum models have yet to be evaluated in this respect (for exceptions see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Broekaert et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Mistry et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Huang et al. (2024a)</ref> carried out detailed comparisons between a quantum model for probabilistic reasoning vs. a Bayesian one. Their quantum model was specified in such a way that quantum effects could be easily switched off. Briefly, predictions for various probability judgments could be expressed with and without various quantum interference parameters, so that, setting these parameters to zero would reduce the model to a corresponding Bayesian one. They reported that for a sizeable portion of their participants, the quantum model provided the best fit --fit measures were adjusted for model complexity. To sum up so far, quantum models are not inherently more flexible than corresponding Bayesian ones: quantum and Bayesian models simply follow different rules for probabilistic interference. Whereas quantum models are more flexible in some ways, Bayesian models are more flexible in other ways, and it is an empirical issue what type of flexibility best matches human behavior. Sometimes, quantum models have some additional parametrization (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Huang et al. 2024a)</ref>, but in such cases, model comparisons are complexity adjusted.</p><p>Beyond comparisons between specific quantum, classical models, Atmanspacher and Romer (2012) attempted to provide a general complexity analysis (focused on parameter numbers) concerning quantum and classical models for question order effects, where the number of question outcomes and questions can vary. They observed that as this number increased, a generic quantum approach would be increasingly less complex than a matched classical one, because in the former case incompatibility can keep the overall representational dimensionality low, but not in the latter case. <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Pothos et al. (2021)</ref> also argued that representation of probabilities for a set of questions is algorithmically simpler with quantum theory compared to (certainly) baseline Bayesian theory and (subject to assumptions) Bayesian theory simplified with Bayesian networks. Such efforts mirror similar attempts by Bayesian theorists (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, it has to be appreciated that any general theoretical framework is maximally general. As we have discussed throughout this review, all the results we presented in this review, including the various fallacies, can be perfectly accommodated within Bayesian theory, within quantum theory, with heuristics and biases, etc. This is exactly the nature of general theoretical frameworks, they are expressive enough to cover a broad range of situations. But, in evaluating an explanation or model, the more pertinent question is how natural or intuitive it is, whether it has generative value, and whether it allows for any a priori empirical predictions. This is exactly why, for example, no cognitive theorist accepts an explanation for the conjunction fallacy along the lines Prob(F&amp;BT)&gt;Prob(BT|some context), that is, relegating the conjunction fallacy to a difference in how the probability terms on either side of the inequality are conditionalized. In at least some of the cases for which quantum cognitive models have been proposed, we would argue that the quantum models have advantages, along the above lines, relative to alternative approaches.</p><p>Regarding the second issue, quantum cognitive models have introduced many unfamiliar concepts in psychology. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides a summary of these concepts. To mention but a few, we have encountered the concepts of superposition, incompatibility, interference, subspaces, and changes in the state as a result of measurement. It might be claimed that the unfamiliarity of these concepts in psychology creates an unnecessary onus in the field. However, we think that the novelty of these concepts presents unique opportunities too, in terms of pursuing novel theoretical directions and expanding the theoretical arsenal in the disposal of psychologists. As well, as we have tried to illustrate in this review, many of the quantum concepts can be seen as formalizing ideas with a long history in psychology. Consider, for example, the idea that a measurement can change the state. This requirement in quantum theory (from Luder's postulate) maps reasonably well with the long-standing research line in psychology, concerning constructive influences. So perhaps part of the conceptual unfamiliarity of quantum theory should be welcomed as opportunity to extend our understanding of long-standing ideas in cognition or pursue completely new directions, which would have been hard to envisage on the basis of existing psychological theory.</p><p>Regarding the final issue, the explanatory objective of quantum cognitive models is best described as top down, in the sense of <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Griffiths et al. (2010)</ref>. That is, such models primarily express the principles intended to capture regularities in behavior, as well as answer questions as to why behavior reflects certain biases, what is the purpose of particular cognitive processes etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Marr, 1982)</ref>. This objective is similar to that of Bayesian cognitive models. In addition, because of the sequential nature of a lot of calculations in quantum theory, quantum cognitive models typically include some process assumptions about the order in which predicates in complex terms are evaluated. For example, in Bayesian theory, evaluating a conjunction or disjunction between two predicates, A and B, typically does not involve any details about whether the evaluation has to take place in a particular order. By contrast, in quantum theory, assuming that A and B are incompatible, a process assumption is needed for which predicate is evaluated first. Regarding other parts of quantum theory, such as the vector space in which the subspaces corresponding to different question outcomes reside, the state vector, the form of dynamics etc., the general approach is that these can be approached in the same away as in related cognitive theory: for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Shepard's (1987)</ref> proposal of psychological spaces would be interpreted in terms of human similarity judgments being 'as if' objects were represented in a vector space, with similarity an exponentially decaying function of distance. Overall, the mapping between models and psychological explanation is no more complex with quantum cognitive models, than in other comparable cognitive models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How can quantum-like structure emerge from a classical brain?</head><p>We briefly considered this issue in the Introduction. In psychology, in the vast majority of cases, models at the behavioral level are entirely independent from models about neuronal function <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Griffiths et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Marr, 1982)</ref>. It is beyond the scope of our work to discuss why this has been the case, though, briefly, it is intuitive to recognize the difficulty of relating the function of e.g. 100M neurons with emergent properties at the cognitive level -this has simply not been happening in our field. Therefore, all behavioral models constitute hypotheses about the principles which can describe behavior, without entailing assumptions at the neuronal level. Regarding quantum cognition, quantum-like cognitive models are equally consistent with a classical or quantum brain. Specifically, assuming a classical brain (the neurophysiological evidence seems to weigh in favor of this conclusion), all quantum effects in behavior would be interpreted as epiphenomenal and their quantum interpretation valid only at the cognitive level -for example, we expect hidden variable models of quantum behavioral models, based on e.g. neurophysiological variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">(Yearsley &amp; Pothos, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Notwithstanding these points, some researchers have attempted to specify the neurophysiological origins of quantum structure in cognition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Suppes et al. (2012)</ref> proposed a neural oscillator proposal for how oscillation patterns involving synchronized neurons can correspond to stimulus, response associations. Note, there has been evidence that synchronization of firing rates amongst neurons can be related to cognitive processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Eckhorn et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">Friedrich et al., 2004)</ref>. Neural oscillators have wave-like properties and so can produce interference patterns, arising from phase differences between oscillators. De Barros (2012; de <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Barros &amp; Suppes, 2009)</ref> argued that such interference patterns can produce the dynamics required for quantum models (they did this specifically for quantum models of question order effects, e.g., ; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Khrennikov, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">, Khrennikov et al., 2018</ref>. One question for such proposals is whether there is evidence for quantum structure beyond the observation that wave-like behavior can produce interference.  showed that quantum computations can be implemented with a standard neural network. The neural network implemented three steps, a computation of amplitudes from unitary evolution, the conversion of amplitudes to probabilities, and state reduction. Notwithstanding the input and output mapping capabilities of neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Churchland, 1990)</ref>, this work provides an illustration of how a familiar, algorithmic framework can produce quantum-like output.</p><p>An interesting question is whether quantum-like processes can arise from classical ones, either through some fault or approximation in the classical process. This is not unlike similar research from Bayesian researchers, proposing that apparent fallacies arise from a faulty (Bayesian) sampling process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Costello &amp; Watts, 2014)</ref>. Beim Graben and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Atmanspacher (2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Atmanspacher &amp; Scheingraber, 1987)</ref> proposed that lack of precision in state space (coarseness in representation) could account for apparent incompatibilities, in that particular question pairs could not be resolved concurrently. A way to further develop this idea would be with arguments of why certain question pairs, but not others, appear incompatible. Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi (2015) suggested that averaging across (idiosyncratic) probability rules, that different decision makers might be employing, would result in a probability rule equivalent to that from quantum theory. This is a fascinating proposal, though it is hard to see how it can explain quantum-like behavior at the individual participant level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What are the future prospects for quantum cognition?</head><p>Equivalently we can ask, what constitutes a strong theoretical framework and a good model, and do quantum models meet the corresponding conditions?</p><p>A healthy theoretical framework arguably fulfills four conditions. First, its principles are interconnected, as this limits arbitrariness. Second, there are clear narratives about psychological process. Third, there are plausible assumptions regarding computational demands for the brain. Finally, there is sufficient generative promise.</p><p>We think the prospects regarding quantum theory are encouraging. The first characteristic is self-evident in that quantum theory, as a formal probabilistic system, is axiomatically defined. In any specific quantum model some additional assumptions might be needed, as a way to bridge an abstract mathematical framework and cognition. However, in most cognitive quantum models, such additional assumptions have been limited.</p><p>Second, the elements of quantum models are typically assigned psychological meaning. For example, in static models, representations are typically set by reference to the empirical situation and projection sequences justified as embodying relevant contextual influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Busemeyer et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Wang et al., 2014)</ref>. Entangled states are interpreted as instances of strong, contextual connectedness between the relevant entities (e.g., . In dynamical models, Hamiltonian parameters typically indicate drift rates to the various options and often interpreted as relevant utilities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Pothos &amp; Busemeyer, 2009;</ref>.</p><p>Third, the problem of computational tractability is shared by many modelling frameworks. Focusing on quantum vs. classical probabilities, the former are often simpler than the latter, because incompatibility can reduce the complexity of the required joint probability distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Pothos et al., 2021)</ref>. To use <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Tversky and Kahneman's (1983)</ref> Linda example, a classical probability approach requires conjunctions not just involving whether Linda is a bank teller or a feminist, but also where she lives, her relationships, how she looks etc. Even if many of these probabilities can be automatically set through suitable priors, the complexity of the probability distributions may still be prohibitive. We think the situation regarding brain tractability of the postulated operations in quantum theory is at least equivalent to or better than that for classical theory (note, methods simplifying classical computations could be adapted for use in quantum theory, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">Sanborn et al., 2010)</ref>. Note, the idea that quantum probabilities may be simpler than classical ones exactly underwrites the point that they may be more likely to be adopted when decision makers are less engaged or familiar with a task <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley &amp; Trueblood, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding generative value, some of the major applications of quantum theory to cognition have involved established results, such as the conjunction fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1983)</ref>, and so a concern is whether the applicability of quantum models might be restricted to redescriptions of previous results. However, this review has presented examples of quantum models which have had generative value in psychology. First, there have been examinations of compositionality in memory or conceptual combination, using the Bell/ CHSH inequality, providing new empirical tests and evidence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aerts, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Aerts et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Cervantes &amp; Dzhafarov, 2018)</ref>. Second, even though constructive influences in psychology have been explored before (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">Sharot et al., 2010)</ref>, quantum cognitive models make specific and constrained predictions regarding such influences, because of the requirement of the collapse of the state vector. Such predictions have been utilized in empirical demonstrations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Kvam et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Kvam et al., , 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Yearsley &amp; Pothos, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b254">White et al., 2014)</ref> and have been the basis for a proposal of a new decision bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">(White et al., 2014</ref>. Third, the QQ equality has been a surprising, a priori prediction from quantum theory, supported in many data sets . Fourth, the links between familiarity, cognitive style of thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Frederick, 2005)</ref>, and the emergence of fallacies <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Yearsley &amp; Trueblood, 2018)</ref>, have provided a novel individual differences perspective to dual route ideas in cognition. Fifth, quantum models predict the cooccurrence of certain fallacies, when the originating cause is the same (notably incompatibility), as is the case for e.g. the conjunction fallacy and order effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">(Yearsley &amp; Trueblood, 2018)</ref>. Beyond applications more focused on theoretical benefits, quantum models have been increasingly explored in relation to their applied potential, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Jaeger and Trueblood (2019)</ref> employed quantum theory as a framework for behavioral law and economics and <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">White et al. (2020)</ref> considered applications in organizational psychology.</p><p>There are other predictions which have yet to attract detailed empirical examination, for example regarding sequencing in temporal structure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Atmanspacher &amp; Filk, 2010)</ref>. An intriguing possibility is that quantum systems can allow speedier computations than classical systems, in certain cases, due to entanglement and superposition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Grover, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Shor, 1994)</ref>. Thus, the possibility arises that quantum-like computation at the cognitive level may be the factor partly enabling the apparent speed with which we are able to make inferences. Such ideas are potentially promising, but currently underdeveloped. One difficulty is that quantum vs. classical speedup has been documented only for specific problems and there is a challenge to translate such problems to psychological ones. Another is that quantum speedup typically requires quantum physical systems, for example it depends on quantum gates, which operate on (real) superposition or entangled states (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Behrman et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Dong et al., 2008)</ref>. As we are committed to a classical brain, it is unclear how to apply such ideas to quantum cognition (but see <ref type="bibr">Rajagopal et al., in press)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, we think that the application of quantum theory to cognition has had considerable empirical impact, whether on previous results or novel ones, and has provided a principled route to exciting predictions and debates about new hypotheses for cognitive representations and processes. We hope that the present discussion provides a degree of optimism regarding the continuing contributions of quantum cognitive models. To the extent that psychology researchers believe that part of cognition should be approached as probabilistic inference, it makes good sense to explore alternative probabilistic frameworks, and quantum theory is a possibility with considerable potential and promise. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>anchoring and adjustment model can describe order effects, but<ref type="bibr" target="#b167">McKenzie et al.
