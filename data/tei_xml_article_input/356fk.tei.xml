<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract: Theory suggests that effective real-time decision-making in classrooms requires teachers to have flexible access to rich and well-organised knowledge of effective teaching</p><p>practices. Yet prior research on the role and importance of procedural knowledge has been equivocal. This exploratory study used a new video measure of procedural knowledge to examine relationships with observed classroom quality, and establish which opportunities to learn (qualifications, professional development, classroom experience) predict greater knowledge. It focused on preschool teachers' knowledge of oral language pedagogy, on the basis that early language provides the foundation for children's later learning.</p><p>The sample comprised 104 teachers participating in a wider RCT, designed to evaluate a professional development intervention. Teachers were shown two short videos of classroom interactions and asked to identify instances of effective practice. Responses were coded to capture three facets: perceiving (the ability to identify salient language-supporting strategies); naming (the use of specific professional vocabulary to describe interactions); and interpreting (the ability to interpret the interactions observed). The three facets could be empirically distinguished. Explicit and higher-order procedural knowledge (naming, interpreting) most strongly predicted classroom quality. Formal learning opportunities were stronger predictors of procedural knowledge than classroom experience. Intervention effects on classroom quality were mediated by knowledge. Implications for workforce development are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The importance of high-quality support for early language Early language provides a bedrock for later learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bleses, Makransky, Dale, Højen &amp; Ari, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hjetland et al, 2019)</ref>. Language in preschool predicts literacy and wider outcomes at school entry <ref type="bibr">(Morgan, Farkas, Hillemeier, Hammer &amp; Maczuga, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Roulstone, Law, Rush, Clegg &amp; Peters, 2011)</ref>, which in turn predict later school achievement <ref type="bibr">(Duncan et al, 2007)</ref>. However, many children -particularly those from disadvantaged homes -start school without the language skills they need <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Waldfogel &amp; Washbrook, 2010)</ref>, with consequences for their long-term life trajectories <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Heckman, 2006)</ref>. While high-quality preschool offers a potential means of narrowing this gap <ref type="bibr">(Sylva, Melhuish, Sammons, Siraj &amp; Taggart, 2010)</ref>, evidence suggests that current practice may be inadequate to nurture children's language skills, particularly in the disadvantaged areas where it is most needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mathers &amp; Smees, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Although in-service professional development shows promise in improving practice and child outcomes, it is not uniformly effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Markussen-Brown et al., 2017)</ref>. A recent review concluded that teacher professional development in England is insufficiently evidence-based and inconsistent in quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cordingley et al, 2015)</ref>. To inform intelligent design of future training we must understand the 'dynamic and transactional teacher and learning processes' which form the mechanism of change <ref type="bibr">(Sheridan, Edwards, Marcin &amp; Knoche, 2009, p.378)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The role of teacher knowledge and the limits of current research</head><p>There is an implicit assumption in much professional development that teacher knowledge is fundamental to improved practice and child outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ben-Peretz, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Effective teaching is understood to require knowledge of both subject content (what is to be taught) and pedagogy (how to represent the content for learners) <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Shulman, 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Shulman, , 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ball &amp; Bass, 2000)</ref>, with evidence suggesting that these facets can be distinguished empirically <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baumert et al, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Voss, Kunter &amp; Baumert, 2011)</ref>. Knowledge of pedagogy can be further divided into declarative (knowing that) and procedural (knowing how), with both required for expert practice <ref type="bibr">(Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">König, 2013)</ref>. To illustrate, a preschool teacher with expertise in supporting oral language will likely know how to form the past tense of irregular verbs (content knowledge); know that children tend to overgeneralise regular suffixes and that recasting such errors in conversation supports mastery of irregular forms (theoretical knowledge of pedagogy); and know how to use recasting appropriately within classroom interactions (procedural knowledge of pedagogy).</p><p>While the language-and-literacy content knowledge of preschool teachers has been linked to practice and child outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Piasta, Connor, Fishman &amp; Morrison, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Schachter, Spear, Piasta, Justice &amp; Logan, 2016)</ref>, the same cannot be said for pedagogical knowledge. Much is inferred, for example, in studies of professional development which aim to improve knowledge and have subsequently identified effects on practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dickinson &amp; Caswell, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wasik, Bond &amp; Hindman, 2006)</ref>. Studies which explicitly assess pedagogical language-andliteracy knowledge have identified small or null effects <ref type="bibr">(Piasta, Park, Farley, Justice &amp; O'Connell, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Phillips, Oliver, Tabulda, Wood &amp; Funari, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Spear et al, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Schachter et al, 2016)</ref>. Such equivocality is puzzling, given the theoretical value of domain-specific pedagogical knowledge and evidence of its importance in later education phases, for example, in the domain of mathematics teaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baumert et al, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">McCray, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capturing procedural knowledge of pedagogy -and the case for video assessment</head><p>It is plausible that many null results identified for pedagogical knowledge stem from failings in its measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Markussen-Brown et al, 2017)</ref>. The studies cited above all used written questionnaires, primarily multiple-choice tests. Though appropriate for measuring explicit and relatively static knowledge (content, theory), questionnaires are ill-suited to capture the more dynamic and situated procedural knowledge of pedagogy <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Schachter et al, 2016</ref>) which develops and is applied in the classroom context <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brouwer &amp; Korthagen, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Eraut, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Stürmer, Seidel &amp; Schäfer, 2013)</ref>. While multiple-choice tests assume a 'correct' answer in response to a hypothetical scenario, the best course of action in a real classroom situation depends on multiple factors, including the traits and responses of the children and the pedagogical beliefs or goals of the teacher <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Putnam &amp; Borko, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Van Driel &amp; Berry, 2012)</ref>. The dynamic procedural knowledge of an expert teacher allows them to orchestrate these factors 'in the moment', applying strategies flexibly to maximise child learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Knievel, Lindmeier &amp; Heinze, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Shulman, 1987)</ref>. Studies of preschool teachers'</p><p>language-related pedagogical reasoning shows that it is multi-faceted and highly contextspecific <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dwyer &amp; Schachter, 2020)</ref>. Static questionnaire scenarios are simply too remote from the complexity of real classroom interactions to capture the contextually-codified knowledge which shapes decision-making within them <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alonzo &amp; Kim, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>This study uses videos of classroom interactions to provide a more sensitive measure of preschool teachers' procedural knowledge of oral language pedagogy. Video assessment involves teachers watching video clips and identifying or interpreting teaching practice or children's responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jamil, Sabol, Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kersting, Givvin, Sotelo &amp; Stigler, 2010)</ref>. This preserves the complexity of the classroom and offers an authentic context for assessing situated knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alonzo &amp; Kim, 2016)</ref>. It enables assessment, not just of what teachers know, but of the knowledge they are able to access, activate and use in a classroom situation -their 'useable knowledge' <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kersting, Givvin, Thompson, Santagata &amp; Stigler, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The approach is underpinned by theory and empirical evidence (elaborated below) that expert and novice teachers differ in their observational abilities, that these differences stem from variations in knowledge codification, and that effective observation supports effective practice. By developing a more discerning assessment, this study aims to illuminate the role of procedural knowledge in ensuring effective support for oral language teaching, offering immediate and practical guidance for workforce development and enabling future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Using video observations ('professional vision') to elicit procedural knowledge</head><p>At the heart of video assessment lies the centrality of classroom observation. Procedural knowledge is understood to develop through observation. Teachers notice their own and their colleagues' actions, and the consequences of those actions for children, and internalise these observations to adapt their practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jamil et al, 2015)</ref>. The cognitive scripts generated <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Moskowitz, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Schank, 1997)</ref> become more deeply and holistically codified through repeated rehearsal and observation, supporting efficient knowledge retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Sabers, Cushing, &amp; Berliner, 1991)</ref>. They enable experts to assimilate, understand and interpret new situations more quickly, accurately and comprehensively than novices <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Berliner, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bransford, Brown &amp; Cocking, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Glaser &amp; Chi, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sabers, Cushing &amp; Berliner, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">van Es &amp; Sherin, 2002)</ref>. Expert teachers become 'expert observers', able to filter out irrelevant information and focus on the features of an interaction which are salient for child learning. This ability to perceive and interpret classroom situations <ref type="bibr">(termed 'noticing' or 'professional vision')</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Goodwin, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Sherin &amp; Van Es, 2009</ref>) supports effective real-time decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(van Es &amp; Sherin, 2002)</ref>. In the context of video assessment, it can also offer a window onto teachers' procedural knowledge becausein order to perceive and interpret strategies in a video -teachers must have cognitive scripts to represent those strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alonzo &amp; Kim, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jamil et al, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Emerging evidence indicates promise. Video assessments of domain-specific profession vision in middle and secondary mathematics teachers have predicted student-reported instructional quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(König &amp; Kramer, 2016)</ref>, the cognitive quality of tests set by teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bruckmaier, Krauss, Blum &amp; Leiss, 2016)</ref> and student learning gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kersting et al, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kersting et al, , 2012</ref>, albeit often in small samples. Similar tools -largely focused on mathematics and nondomain-specific professional vision in primary, middle and secondary education -have yet to be validated but show encouraging psychometric properties (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kaiser, Busse, Hoth, König &amp; Blömeke, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Knievel, Lindmeier &amp; Heinze, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Keppens, Consuegra, Goossens, De Maeyer &amp; Vanderlinde, 2019;</ref>. To our knowledge, the only validated preschool measure is the Video Assessment of Interactions and Learning (VAIL). The VAIL, which assesses teachers' ability to identify effective (non-domain-specific) adult-child interactions, has been shown to predict observed quality of instructional and emotional support <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jamil et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wiens, LoCasale-Crouch, Cash &amp; Romo-Escudero, 2020</ref>) and may play a mediating role in the improvement of quality <ref type="bibr">(Hamre et al, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>This study builds on the successful methodology of the VAIL, adapting it to capture the professional vision of preschool teachers in the domain of oral language pedagogy, with the aim of eliciting their underlying dynamic procedural knowledge -and, more broadly, of enabling research which can inform language-specific professional development. The Observing Language Pedagogy (OLP) tool further extends the VAIL by taking exploratory steps in examining the relevance of higher-order knowledge facets such as interpretation, informed by video studies conducted with teachers of older children.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The cognitive facets of professional vision and underlying procedural knowledge</head><p>The cognitive facets of interest can be determined by considering pathways to knowledge development. Procedural knowledge may develop implicitly, through unconscious classroom observation, or through 'reactive learning' -where observation is accompanied by brief, near-spontaneous, in-the-moment reflection <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Eraut, 2004)</ref>. In this way, teachers develop procedural scripts for a range of teaching strategies, enabling them to recognise these strategies and recall their knowledge in specific classroom contexts, in order to apply an appropriate strategy <ref type="bibr">(Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001</ref>). The ability to perceive salient strategies (revealing the existence of associated knowledge scripts) is thus the first facet of interest, with evidence of its importance offered by the predictive validity of the VAIL.</p><p>Procedural knowledge may also develop explicitly. In this conception, theoretical knowledge gained through formal training (qualifications, professional development, etc.) is transformed into procedural knowledge through cycles of application and observation in the classroom <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson, 1982)</ref>. Explicit procedural knowledge is believed to be more deeply codified than tacit knowledge, and to support intentional practice through its accessibility for deliberate manipulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kind, 2009)</ref>. Examples include explicit knowledge of teaching strategies and how these relate to the broader principles of teaching and learning, and the ability to reason about how a specific strategy might support child learning <ref type="bibr">(Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Van Es &amp; Sherin, 2002)</ref>. To illustrate -alongside a tacit script governing when to use questions beginning with 'how' or 'why', a teacher might also possess an explicit, overarching script identifying these as open questions, understand when and why open questions might be appropriate (based on theory but refined by experience) and be able to analyse how effective their open question was in eliciting a specific child's thinking.</p><p>One indicator of such explicit knowledge might be the use of specific pedagogical terms (e.g. 'open questions') to describe strategies observed in video interactions. Whilst naming does not guarantee understanding, it is hard to engage in explicit discussion or reflection on a concept until one can name it -and learning the language of a discipline is part of learning the discipline itself. Although efforts have been made to detail the professional lexicon of mathematics teachers <ref type="bibr">(Clarke, Mesiti, Cao &amp; Novotná, 2017)</ref>, no such work exists for preschool language pedagogy and this facet has not yet been considered in video studies.</p><p>The use of professional vocabulary to describe video interactions is theorised to reflect both explicit procedural knowledge and the ability to articulate this knowledge to others.</p><p>The ability to interpret video interactions offers a further indicator of explicit, higherorder procedural knowledge. Expert teachers are better equipped than novices to reason about possible pedagogical intentions, alternative approaches, or children's thinking and outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Berliner, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Blömeke, Gustafsson &amp; Shavelson, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Klein &amp; Hoffman, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sabers, Cushing &amp; Berliner, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">van Es &amp; Sherin, 2002)</ref>. Studies using one of the most promising video tools -the Classroom Video Analysis (CVA) -shows that the ability of 5 th -7 th grade teachers to analyse video interactions and suggest alternative strategies predicts children's mathematical learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kersting et al, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kersting et al, , 2012</ref>. An interesting reflection is the fact that only teachers' spontaneous suggestions for improvement predicted learning gains, with no effects found for the three prompted indicators of reasoning. The authors suggest that spontaneous reasoning reflects expertise which has become embedded through repeated use and is thus 'close to the surface' and routinely applied -these were the teachers most likely to use reasoning in live situations.</p><p>The ability to interpret video interactions forms the third and final facet of interest, theorised to reflect the ability to reason during actual classroom situations to support intentional teaching. Other higher-order dimensions such as decision-making, evaluation and generation <ref type="bibr">(Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">König et al, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Knievel et al, 2015)</ref> are acknowledged, but not reflected, in the current study. The three facets of professional vision (and underlying procedural knowledge) captured by the OLP tool are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The pedagogical facets of professional vision and underlying procedural knowledge</head><p>This study focuses on procedural knowledge of how to represent content effectively for learners, and adapt teaching for specific contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Shulman, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kind, 2009)</ref>. Specifically, it aims to capture knowledge of the teaching strategies which support oral language in the early years (vocabulary, grammar/morphology, narrative, pragmatics) and which in turn underpin later reading comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hulme &amp; Snowling, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gardner-Neblett &amp; Iruka, 2015)</ref>. The specific strategies included within the OLP tool were informed by a thorough review of the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mathers, 2020)</ref> and are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. There are, of course, many other facets of pedagogical knowledge -most importantly, knowledge of learners and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Shulman, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kind, 2009)</ref>. This study does not claim to capture all domains, but rather to test the water in exploring the potential of video assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The current study</head><p>The current study sat within a wider randomised controlled trial (RCT), designed to evaluate a professional development intervention for preschool teachers targeting their languagesupporting practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mathers, 2020)</ref>. 120 schools participated in the RCT between September 2017 and June 2018, with 61 receiving the intervention and 59 in a business-asusual control group. The sample for the current study comprised 104 teachers (from 72 schools) who responded to an online survey at the post-test stage of the RCT, designed to gather data on procedural knowledge, teaching qualifications and experience. These data were combined with data on teacher characteristics and observed classroom quality to answer four questions:</p><p>1. What is the structure of preschool teachers' language-related professional vision, and underlying procedural pedagogical knowledge? 2. Does procedural knowledge predict observed quality of practice?</p><p>3. Is procedural knowledge predicted by teachers' formal and informal opportunities to learn (qualifications, professional development, classroom experience)?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Does procedural knowledge mediate intervention effects on classroom quality?</head><p>This is the first preschool video study to examine knowledge of oral language pedagogy and to examine the roles played by naming and interpreting. In relation to structure, prior evidence suggests that perceiving and interpreting can be empirically distinguished <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(König et al, 2014;</ref> but the role played by professional vocabulary (naming) is unknown. Both a three-factor model (perceiving + naming + interpreting) and a two-factor model [lower order knowledge (perceiving) + explicit, higher-order knowledge (naming/interpreting)] are hypothesised and assessed. It is also possible that interpreting is more akin to perceiving than to naming. Although interpretation is higher-order in natureimplying formal learning -like perceiving, it depends on informal opportunities to observe strategies 'in action' and their effects on children. A third possible model [observation-based knowledge (perceiving/interpreting) + formal knowledge (naming)] is therefore also assessed. Positive associations are expected between classroom experience and both perceiving and interpreting, with no association expected for naming. Formal opportunities to learn (qualifications, professional development) are anticipated to predict all three knowledge facets. Procedural knowledge is expected to predict classroom quality, with stronger associations anticipated for the explicit, higher-order facets of naming and interpreting than for perceiving. In the event that intervention effects are identified on knowledge, these are expected to partially mediate intervention effects on practice quality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling context and participants</head><p>The 120 schools participating in the wider RCT were all state funded, and recruited from Of the 104 teachers who responded to the knowledge survey -and so comprise the current sample -almost two-thirds (n=68) taught in reception, 30 taught in nursery and 6 were coded as 'other' (teachers in combined classes, leaders with no direct teaching role).</p><p>All held or were working towards the graduate level 'Qualified Teacher Status' (QTS)</p><p>[primary specialism 3-11 years=61; early childhood specialism 3-7 years=36; unspecified=5;</p><p>working towards QTS=2]. On average, participants had 10.7 years of teaching experience (range=.5-33, SD=7.6) and 8.2 years of preschool teaching experience (range .5-33, SD=7.0). Most (n=99) were female. Three quarters (n=78) had participated in the RCT since inception.</p><p>Just under half (n=50) were from schools (N=35) receiving the intervention. Of these, two thirds (n=33) had attended ≥ 5 days of the 6-day training and one quarter (n=13) had attended ≤ 2 days. Mean attendance was 4.5 days. Participants' schools tended to be located in disadvantaged areas, with four fifths (N=84) below the 50 th IMD percentile and more than half (N=59) below the 20 th percentile.</p><p>The modest response rate (63% school response, 37% teacher response) must be noted.</p><p>Although study teachers reflected the RCT sample on many dimensions (area disadvantage, intervention group status, training attendance and observed quality) they were more likely than RCT participants to be teaching in reception [F(1,281)=4.16, p=.04], and to have participated in the RCT since inception [F(1,279)=4.23, p=.04]; and it was not possible to compare the samples on qualifications and experience. As such, the possibility of response bias cannot be ruled out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p>Both the online survey (assessing procedural knowledge, teaching qualifications and experience) and the observations of classroom quality took place post-intervention, between October 2017 and February 2018. The quality assessments were conducted in one reception class per school and were available for 55 of the 104 study teachers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures of procedural knowledge</head><p>Procedural knowledge was assessed using the Observing Language Pedagogy (OLP) tool, designed to capture the facets of perceiving, naming and interpreting. An overview is provided here, and further detail on rationale and development in <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mathers (2020)</ref>. The OLP is based on a framework of 30 pedagogical strategies, generated through a review of evidence on benefits for child language and literacy outcomes and affirmed through expert review <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>. These focus primarily on adult-child interactions as the most powerful vehicle for language learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bruner, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Teachers were asked to watch 2 short (2-3 minute) videos of authentic preschool classroom interactions. In Video 1, a teacher and child interact in the block area. In Video 2, a teacher supports a small group to talk about and draw a shopping list. Respondents could download a transcript and watch videos more than once. The videos were selected from a wider pool, via piloting and expert review, as reflecting good-quality examples of many of the 30 strategies <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>. A third video showing a whole-class activity was dropped during development <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mathers, 2020)</ref>. Thus, although the use of videos of this length and number is supported by previous studies <ref type="bibr">(Bruckmeier et al, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jamil et al, 2015)</ref>, the OLP cannot be said to reflect the full range of classroom contexts.</p><p>Informed by the validated VAIL and CVA tools, the OLP employed open prompts rather than the closed rating items used in other video studies (e.g. , with the aim of eliciting knowledge which teachers are able and likely to access, activate and use in a classroom situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kersting et al, 2012)</ref>. Following the VAIL methodology, perceiving was directly prompted: teachers were asked to identify up to 8 strategies reflected in each video which might support children's oral language (Appendix A.1). The decision to prompt for 8 strategies rather than 5 (as in the VAIL) was made following piloting, to enable a more fine-grained analysis of strategy identification. Teachers' responses (≤ 8 per video) were considered valid if they matched at least one of the 30 strategies in the OLP framework.</p><p>Coding was conducted by the author, with a proportion independently coded by a second researcher who had been trained to reliability on a proportion (35%) of actual responses.</p><p>Independent coding was conducted on a further 35% of responses, with high levels of exact agreement [Video 1: 89%, Video 2: 88%) and discrepancies resolved through discussion.</p><p>Each valid strategy identified was awarded the relevant 'expert example' rating for the appropriate video <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref> to generate two perceiving scores -one for each video <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>.</p><p>Informed by the findings of <ref type="bibr">colleagues (2010, 2012)</ref>, the higher-order facets of naming and interpreting were not directly prompted. Although this risked underrepresenting teachers who could have offered an interpretation if prompted, we reasoned that spontaneous use would reflect knowledge most likely to be mobilised in real classroom situations -and thus most closely associated with actual practice. Prior piloting had indicated that this approach would elicit sufficient examples, and also that direct prompting to interpret all 8 strategies required a longer completion time than was possible within the constraints of the wider RCT. Though undeniably light-touch and exploratory as a means of examining pedagogical reasoning, the resulting responses did reflect awareness of pedagogical intention, observed effects on the children and possible alternative approaches <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>. All valid responses (≤8 per video) were coded as shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> to generate two naming and two interpreting scores: one for each video. 50% of responses were doublecoded, with high levels of exact agreement [naming: 1=100%, 2=100%; interpreting: 1=96%, 2=98%).</p><p>All respondents identified at least one valid language-supporting strategy (Video 1 mean = 5.5; Video 2 mean = 5.0). Perceiving scores were normally distributed with a broad range.</p><p>Naming and interpreting scores displayed narrower ranges, lower means and a positive skew due to a high proportion of zero responses <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref>. As noted, some zero responses may reflect teachers who could have named or interpreted if prompted. Naming and interpreting can therefore be considered as 'censored' continuous variables: they reflect a continuous underlying construct but include values which may not reflect a true position on the number line, due to limitations on measurement opportunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(McDonald &amp; Moffitt, 1980)</ref>. Despite the high proportion of zeros, scores did discriminate between respondents: 57.4% used at least one professional term (naming) and 44.2% provided at least one interpretation.</p><p>Additional reliability and validity data are presented in the results section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data on opportunities for learning</head><p>Data on qualifications and teaching experience were gathered via the online survey, and data on participation in the professional development intervention from the RCT dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures of practice quality</head><p>Three live-observation measures of classroom quality were used in the main RCT: the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale Third Edition (ECERS-3; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Harms, Clifford &amp; Cryer, 2014)</ref>, the literacy subscale from the curricular extension to the ECERS (ECERS-E; <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Sylva, Siraj &amp; Taggart, 2003)</ref> and the Sustained Shared Thinking and Emotional Wellbeing (SSTEW) scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Siraj, Kingston &amp; Melhuish, 2015)</ref>. All 3 scales are known to predict children's development (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Sylva, Melhuish, Sammons, Siraj &amp; Taggart 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Howard et al, 2018)</ref>. The ECERS-3 comprises 35 items assessing the global education and care environment, including interactions, activities, the physical environment and care routines. The 6 items of the ECERS-E literacy subscale assess support for language and emergent literacy. The 14 items of the SSTEW assess adult-child interactions supporting children's thinking, language, emotional well-being and self-regulation. All items are scored on a 7-point scale from 1 (inadequate) to 7 (excellent). Data collectors were experienced observers blind to treatment allocation, with training and reliability conducted according to author guidance. All 3 scales were completed one day: ECERS-3 over 3 hours; STEW and ECERS-E over the full day.</p><p>For the purposes of the current study, an Oral Language Quality score was generated using relevant items from all 3 rating scales. Although this departs from traditional use of these tools, it was necessary because they capture many practices not directly relevant to language pedagogy. The 10 items most closely aligned with the OLP pedagogical categories were selected by the author, based on a mapping of item content. These items, illustrative indicators, and links with the OLP are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 5</ref>. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to establish whether they formed a coherent latent construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Schreiber et al, 2006)</ref> in both the study (n=55) and full RCT (n=115) datasets. Two items with factor loadings ≤.60 were removed, with the aim of identifying the smallest number of coherent items reflecting all six OLP categories <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 5)</ref>. Model fit for the final 8-item model was good in both datasets, and Cronbach's alphas high (&lt;.90). The Oral Language Quality score was created using factor loadings from the 8-item CFA in the study sample <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 5</ref>).</p><p>In addition to the Oral Language Quality score, the overall ECERS-3 and SSTEW scores were used as broader measures of classroom quality. Descriptive data for the three quality measures are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 6</ref>. Quality was low on average (although there was variation between schools) and was representative of wider RCT sample. Associations between the quality measures were high (r=.81-.95). All 3 measures displayed normal distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The intervention</head><p>The intervention aimed to improve children's oral language skills (pragmatics, vocabulary, grammar and narrative) via improvements in language-supporting teaching practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mathers, 2020)</ref>. In intervention schools, at least one nursery and reception class teacher participated, with two reception teachers participating in larger schools. The programme comprised 6 days of training and up to 3 days of on-site mentoring per school, spanning just under one year, with design features informed by evidence on the characteristics of effective professional development (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Desimone, 2009)</ref>. Teachers attended the training and were supported to engage their wider class team in implementation. The intervention was designed to develop theoretical and procedural knowledge and to provide direct examples of effective practice. During training, teachers were introduced to a set of language-learning principles (e.g. 'be a magnet for communication', 'be a language radiator') which reflected all six of the OLP pedagogical categories <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>. They were taught how to use these principles and a range of research tools (including ECERS-3 and SSTEW) to observe practice seen in videos, and were provided with strategies and resources for refining practice.</p><p>Between training days, they were supported to use these resources to evaluate their practice and make changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data preparation and analysis</head><p>Three responses (2.9%) were missing for Video 2 of the OLP assessment. Little's MCAR Test indicated no statistically significant patterns in the missing data (p=.22). Nevertheless, to avoid bias associated with listwise deletion <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Enders, 2010)</ref>, analyses were conducted using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimators <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allison, 2012)</ref> where appropriate.</p><p>Twelve outliers were identified across the two interpreting scores. Given the low incidence of interpretations, removing outliers would exclude valuable data and potentially introduce bias. Instead, Winsorisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Blaine, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Dixon, 1960)</ref> was used, in which outliers are replaced with a value at a defined upper threshold based on the interquartile range 1 .</p><p>Descriptives for the Winsorised scores are shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.</p><p>All analyses were conducted using Stata 15 (StataCorp, 2017) and are described below.</p><p>School-level clustered robust standard errors were used to allow for within-school associations in schools with respondents from more than one classroom (of the 72 schools, 44 had two respondents and 15 had three respondents). For analyses exploring relationships between teacher knowledge and classroom quality, the sample was restricted to teachers whose classes were observed (n=55 reception teachers) and robust standard errors used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive statistics</head><p>Descriptive statistics for the six OLP scores are shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> (full sample) and Appendix A.2 (intervention group/control group). All mean scores were higher in the intervention than the control group, with the largest differences seen for perceiving and naming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliability and validity of the OLP and the structure of professional vision/knowledge</head><p>Bivariate correlations between perceiving, naming and interpreting scores are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 7</ref>. Despite commonality within score type, associations between score types were only small-to-medium, and the Cronbach's alpha statistic for all six scores was modest (α=.50).</p><p>Next, the different hypothesised models of procedural knowledge <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 8)</ref> were tested 1 Twelve values over 2.0 were replaced with 2.5: upper threshold defined as Q3 + 1.5*IQR, where Q3 is the 75 th percentile.</p><p>using CFA in a Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) framework. Theoretically justifiable refinements with a modification index (MI) ≥3.84 were adopted, specifically, method factors reflecting associations between scores derived from the same video <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Marsh &amp; Bailey, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>The 3-factor model (perceiving + naming + interpreting) provided the best initial fit to the data <ref type="figure">(Figure 1, Table 8</ref>). MIs highlighted three possible additions of which only one -a correlation between residuals for Video 2 perceiving and interpreting scores -was accepted as a method factor. The corresponding Video 1 covariance was included based on theory.</p><p>The final 3-factor model is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Loadings of observed variables onto latent variables were all ≥.6 and model fit was excellent <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 8)</ref>. Although correlations between perceiving and the higher-order facets of naming (r=.44) and interpreting (r=.57) appeared stronger than associations between the two higher-order facets themselves (r=.24), this may stem from the dependence of naming and interpreting on the reporting of a strategy. What can be confidently concluded is that -as predicted -the two facets theorised to depend on classroom experience (i.e. perceiving and interpreting) were more strongly associated than were perceiving and the more formal naming. Factor scores for perceiving, naming and interpreting were generated using the final 3-factor model, and used for all later analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does procedural knowledge predict observed quality of practice?</head><p>The next analysis examined relationships between teacher knowledge (measured by the OLP) and classroom quality as measured by the Oral Language Quality score, the SSTEW (quality of adult-child interactions) and the ECERS-3 (global quality of education and care).</p><p>Bivariate correlations are shown in Appendix A.3. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the multivariate path model assessing relationships between the three OLP knowledge factors (perceiving, naming, interpreting) and the three quality measures, for teachers whose classes were observed (n=55). Covariates were selected based on significant correlations with quality.</p><p>As expected, the explicit, higher-order knowledge facets proved the strongest predictors of quality. Naming uniquely predicted all three quality measures, with large positive associations (&gt;.5). Interpreting predicted ECERS-3 scores and fell just below significance for the SSTEW and Oral Language Quality scores. Relationships between naming, interpreting and quality are presented visually in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, for associations identified as significant in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. On average, quality increased with every additional professional term or interpretation used. This suggests that, despite the high proportion of zero scores, naming and interpreting are better represented as scales than as dichotomous variables (i.e. 0 terms vs ≤1 terms).</p><p>Although perceiving showed small positive correlations with quality in bivariate tests Ideally, all analyses would have been replicated in the control group, as representing a population unaffected by intervention. Sample sizes were too small to support robust subgroup analysis, so results are not reported here. However, exploratory analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mathers, 2020)</ref> indicates that effects for naming and interpreting are maintained for this group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Is procedural knowledge predicted by teachers' opportunities to learn?</head><p>The next stage tested associations between knowledge and teachers' opportunities to learn: type of teaching qualification, intervention participation and years of classroom experience. A path model <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>) was estimated to predict the three OLP knowledge factors (perceiving, naming, interpreting), with independent variables selected based on bivariate correlations (Appendix A.4) and theory. On the basis that expertise develops during the first 5-10 years in the classroom <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Palmer, Stough, Burdenski &amp; Gonzales, 2005)</ref>, the model was rerun excluding respondents with &gt;7 years of teaching experience (n=41).</p><p>As hypothesised, access to formal learning opportunities predicted higher levels of pedagogical knowledge. Teachers from intervention group schools were significantly better at perceiving and naming than those in the control group, though associations were small.</p><p>Effect sizes (g) were .58 and .65 respectively. To test the effects of dose, 17 intervention group teachers who had attended &lt;5 days of the 6-day training were excluded, and the analysis rerun (n=87). Most of those excluded (n=15) had joined the study (and programme) after inception. Effects on knowledge were larger for the 'full attenders' group (perceiving g=.73, naming g=.84). Significant effects were confirmed using robustness checks (Appendix A.5). The lack of data on teachers' baseline OLP scores means that we cannot ascribe effects on knowledge to the intervention with certainty. However, the fact that effect sizes were greater for full attenders -alongside the random allocation of schools -allows for relative confidence.</p><p>Options for testing qualification effects were limited, since all respondents were graduate-qualified teachers. There were indications that primary-trained teachers had greater knowledge than those with a preschool qualification, but the only significant association (for interpreting) was weak and did not stand up to robustness checks (Appendix A.5).</p><p>Turning now to informal learning opportunities, the hypothesised relationships between perceiving, interpreting and years of classroom experience were not confirmed by the path model ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Associations were larger for teachers in their first 7 years of practice but remained weak and below conventional statistical significance thresholds [preschool experience &amp; perceiving (=.26, p=.11); preschool experience &amp; interpreting <ref type="bibr">(=.19, p=.43)</ref>].</p><p>Further research in a larger sample is needed to establish more conclusively whether such skills develop during the first years of hands-on practice with young children.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does change in knowledge mediate intervention effects on quality?</head><p>Previous models <ref type="figure">(Figures 2 &amp; 4)</ref> indicated a possible indirect effect of the intervention on the Oral Language Quality Score, via the naming knowledge of the participant. A reduced path model was generated to test direct and indirect effects ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Intervention effects on the Oral Language Quality score were fully mediated by naming, with the indirect pathway accounting for 42% of total effects. Model fit was fair but not perfect ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The OLP tool captures teachers' professional vision as means of eliciting the 'dynamic' procedural knowledge they are able to access, activate and use in classroom situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kersting et al, 2012)</ref> in order to support real-time decision-making. It is the first preschool video measure to focus on knowledge of oral language pedagogy, and to take exploratory steps in considering the role of higher order knowledge for preschool teachers.</p><p>The current study examines the structure of teachers' procedural knowledge and considers whether knowledge predicts classroom quality, whether participation in different learning experiences (qualifications, professional development, classroom experience) predicts teacher knowledge -and whether change in knowledge through professional development (PD) mediates the effects of that PD on classroom quality. This section presents conclusions, interpretations and implications for each question in turn, considers measurement issues and study limitations, and highlights next steps for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Can perceiving, naming and interpreting be empirically distinguished?</head><p>Three cognitive facets were examined. Perceiving (the ability to identify salient languagesupporting strategies in video interactions) is theorised to reflect the existence of codified strategy scripts which can be recalled to support use of appropriate strategies in classroom interactions. Naming (use of professional vocabulary to describe interactions) and interpreting (the ability to interpret interactions) are theorised to reflect explicit and higher-order knowledge, accessible for deliberate manipulation to support pedagogical reasoning, intentional teaching and the articulation of knowledge to others. Findings indicate that the three facets can be empirically distinguished, with moderate associations between facets indicating that valuable information is provided by each, independent of the others. The distinction between perceiving and interpreting has been shown for secondary teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(König et al, 2014;</ref> but this study offers the first evidence for preschool teachers. The identification of naming as a third facet further extends existing research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does dynamic pedagogical knowledge predict teaching quality?</head><p>Greater knowledge of language-supporting strategies was associated with higher quality classroom practice. Together, the three OLP factors and covariates explained 27-37% of variation in quality. This confirms the theoretical importance of pedagogical content knowledge <ref type="bibr">(Schulman, 1986)</ref>, and extends empirical studies of mathematics and science teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baumert et al, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Bruckmaier, Krauss, Blum &amp; Leiss, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">McCray, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kersting 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kersting , 2012</ref> in showing that such knowledge also matters for preschool teachers.</p><p>Findings offer confirmatory evidence that procedural knowledge is important for effective teaching, that prior null results may have stemmed from measurement failings, and that video assessment offers a more sensitive means of capturing dynamic knowledge than questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jamil et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Sherin &amp; van Es, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kersting, 2010</ref>).</p><p>Despite the light-touch way in which they were captured, the explicit and higher-order facets of naming and interpreting were -as hypothesised -stronger predictors of classroom quality than lower-order knowledge (perceiving). Although there is value in knowing 'how to do', explicit knowledge of 'how and why' matters more. Unstandardised regression coefficients show that Oral Language Quality Scores were .48 of a point higher on the 7point scale for every additional vocabulary term used to describe the video interactions, and .23 of a point higher for every interpretation provided. Given the low levels of quality seen overall (mean scores all &lt;3), these differences can be considered meaningful.</p><p>This study confirms prior research suggesting that pedagogical reasoning is an indicator of teaching expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kersting et al, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Seidel &amp; Sturmer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">van Es &amp; Sherin, 2002)</ref> and offers indicative evidence of its relevance for preschool teachers. It also highlights a potential role for professional vocabulary in expert practice. Having the vocabulary with which to name a concept may allow teachers to engage in professional reflection and discussion upon that concept, supporting deeper understanding and intentional teaching.</p><p>Use of specific vocabulary may also indicate that teachers have attended prior languagerelated professional development, and thus be a proxy for wider formal knowledge. Being able to reason about classroom situations may further support teachers in intentional practice -that is, the deliberate promotion of specific language content or child outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kind, 2009)</ref>. Naming and interpreting may also aid teachers in pedagogical leadership, for example in articulating their knowledge to others and explaining why certain practices are important. This notion is supported by the fact that the SSTEW and ECERS-3 scales reflect global classroom quality, including the physical environment and the practice of adults other than the lead teacher. Thus, teachers with greater knowledge led classes which were of higher quality rather than (or as well as) displaying individually more effective practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How can procedural knowledge best be promoted?</head><p>The key question for policy and practice is how best to nurture teachers' procedural knowledge. In line with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jamil et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Seidel, Königs &amp; Stürmer, 2014)</ref>, findings suggest that 'informal' learning gained through classroom experience is not sufficient to ensure a knowledgeable workforce. Teachers also need access to formal learning opportunities, such as pre-service qualifications and in-service professional development, in order to develop the explicit and higher-order knowledge which underpins effective practice.</p><p>The strongest predictor of pedagogical knowledge was participation in the professional development intervention, with moderate effects for perceiving (g=.58) and naming <ref type="bibr">(g=.65)</ref> and larger effects (.73/.84) for teachers who had attended the majority of the training. This supports previous research in showing that preschool teachers' professional competence can be improved through carefully-designed programmes which offer a mix of theory and classroom-based support <ref type="bibr">(Hamre et al, 2012)</ref>. The path analysis offers tentative evidence of a mediating role for knowledge in improvement to practice, with 42% of intervention effects on language-supporting quality explained by growth in professional vocabulary (naming). Finally, it is notable that the professional development had no effect on interpreting. This is in some ways unsurprising, since interpreting was not an explicit focus of the programme. However, it illustrates that such learning cannot be taken for granted, even in formal programmes, and that pedagogical reasoning must be explicitly nurtured (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Santagata &amp; Yeh, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Although options for exploring pre-service qualification effects were limited, findings highlight a possible advantage for primary-trained teachers as compared with preschool specialists in relation to interpreting. It is impossible to establish whether primary programmes offer more effective preparation, or whether differences stem from the characteristics of teachers who elect to undertake this pathway. However, prior evidence from Germany indicates that pre-service graduate programmes combining theory and practical internships can promote pedagogical reasoning in secondary school teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Stürmer, Seidel &amp; Schäfer, 2013)</ref>. Similar research is now needed within the UK preschool context to explore the extent to which the diverse qualifications held by the preschool workforce are successful in promoting procedural knowledge, and identify where refinements can be made. The creation of the OLP tool makes such research more feasible.</p><p>A final reflection on the value of classroom experience: although anticipated relationships with procedural knowledge were not confirmed, small associations were seen with classroom quality (Oral Language Quality =.18, p=.09; SSTEW =.19, p=.07) which may have been statistically significant in a larger sample. Perhaps the informal learning which occurs through practice is too deeply tacit for even a contextualised video measure to detect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Is higher-order knowledge domain specific?</head><p>Ironically, having worked to capture knowledge relating explicitly to oral language, the study indicates that such knowledge may not be domain-specific. Although the proportion of variance explained was highest for the Oral Language Quality score, the OLP (alongside covariates) also explained 31% of variance in SSTEW scores and 27% of variance in ECERS-3 scores. Teachers with a richer professional vocabulary and better reasoning skills in relation to language pedagogy led classrooms which offered better quality learning environments overall. This may reflect the fact that higher-order knowledge is inherently universal rather than domain-specific. Alternatively, it may reflect the relevance of oral language to child learning across all domains and the interconnected nature of early childhood pedagogy, in which effective adult-child interactions support development in multiple domains. This does not argue against domain-specific professional development but suggests that such training should also explicitly nurture universal, higher-order knowledge and skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Issues of measurement and study limitations</head><p>This study builds on the sound methodological foundations of the first validated video measure of preschool teachers' professional vision (the VAIL), which predicted 12% of variation in classroom quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jamil et al, 2015)</ref> by assessing teacher's ability to identify effective teaching strategies (perceiving). The superior predictive power of the OLP (37% for the Oral Language Quality score) can plausibly be explained by its inclusion of higher-order cognitive facets such as naming and interpreting. Nonetheless, findings can only be regarded as exploratory. Naming and interpreting were captured in a light-touch manner. Scores reflected teachers' spontaneous use of professional vocabulary and pedagogical reasoning, and the resulting scales were blunt (0-4, 0-5) with many zero responses. Teachers who offered interpretations are likely the most 'expert' -those for whom classroom reasoning is embedded and routine -and relationships with quality may be weaker when analysis is directly prompted. The study suffers other important measurement limitations. Designed for completion in ≤30 minutes, the OLP is based on responses to 2 short videos, both reflecting child-initiated play contexts with small numbers of children. It focuses on knowledge of teaching strategies and omits other facets (e.g. knowledge of child development and learning). As such, it cannot be said to reflect all domains of pedagogical knowledge, or assess knowledge across a representative range of early childhood contexts. In addition, both the initial study response rate and the resulting sample size were modest, particularly for analyses of relationships between knowledge and classroom quality (n=55), limiting both the generalisability of results and the opportunities for robust sub-group analysis.</p><p>There is clearly much scope for broadening and deepening the OLP following this exploratory study. However, the fact that even this relatively shallow measure proved a strong predictor of quality, and that findings align with hypothesised outcomes and previous studies, offers promise for more nuanced approach in yielding further insight. Confirmatory research is now needed in a larger sample, extending the OLP's scope to capture a more holistic view of pedagogical knowledge (e.g. using a wider range of videos) and drawing on the studies of Kersting and others to elicit interpreting and naming more richly, so that associations with classroom quality and child learning can be more robustly examined.</p><p>Future research should also delve more deeply into the apparent failure of perceiving to predict classroom quality. The importance of strategy knowledge is supported by previous studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jamil et al, 2015)</ref> and should not be dismissed. It may be that the expert benchmarking process failed to capture strategy salience <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mathers, 2020)</ref>, meaning that a high perceiving score reflected indiscriminate rather than targeted noticing (i.e. a tendency to simply list as many strategies as possible). It is also possible that effects were limited by the use of a global classroom quality measure. While informal strategy knowledge may not promote global quality because it does not enable teachers to articulate knowledge to others, it may support individuals' in their own teaching. Stronger positive effects may have been seen, had a measure of individual practice been available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final thoughts</head><p>This research offers new evidence on the importance of practical classroom knowledge in ensuring high-quality teaching, but also illustrates its higher-order nature and the need for it to be explicitly nurtured. The dynamic procedural knowledge of the most effective preschool classroom leaders is multi-dimensional, complex and deeply cognitive -and does not 'come naturally'. To ensure a workforce capable of supporting young children's language and wider development, we must offer learning opportunities which are both formal and situated, and which support practitioners in transforming theory into explicit, higher-order procedural understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Eraut, 2004)</ref> -including the development of pedagogical reasoning and a rich professional lexicon. Careful attention must be paid to the optimal integration of theory and practice components within pre-and in-service training <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brouwer &amp; Korthagen, 2005)</ref>, and to the ways in which deliberative learning can be promoted in the day-to-day life of the classroom. Further empirical work is needed to examine how this can best be achieved, using the new opportunities provided by video tools to assess knowledge growth. Much would also be gained from routinely including these more sensitive measures of procedural knowledge in studies of professional development, to inform intelligent programme design.</p></div>

Factor loadings are standardised coefficients from CFAs conducted in the study sample of observed teachers (n=55) using Stata 15. To address the low case-to-item ratio (5.5:1) the same CFAs were run in the full RCT dataset (n=115; case-to-item ratio=11.5:1). Results were almost identical. The two items scored through in the table below were dropped to form the final 8-item model.
