			<abstract>
				<p>Clozapine remains the gold standard for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Although the evidence base for its wide-ranging, unique efficacy continues to expand, clozapine remains alarmingly underutilized in industrialized countries. Analyzing the causes and consequences of this problem is crucial for substantially improving the quality of care for TRS patients. Recent findings: Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic for reducing all-cause mortality in TRS. In most cases, treatment resistance emerges during the first psychotic episode. Delaying clozapine treatment has a negative impact on long-term outcome. Patients&apos; experience with clozapine treatment is largely positive despite a comparatively high rate of side effects. Patients prefer clozapine, while psychiatrists regard it as a burden due to concerns regarding safety and side effect management. Shared decision-making (SDM), which increases the likelihood of a clozapine recommendation, is not routinely used, possibly due to stigmatization of TRS patients.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Like no other medication, clozapine epitomizes two fundamental challenges in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia: a dearth of innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , and insufficient implementation of established treatments 2**, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">3</ref> . Clozapine remains the most effective antipsychotic and the only drug approved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) not least, because the neurobiological underpinnings of its unique efficacy continue to elude researchers 4* . Consequently, clozapine should be widely used for TRS but also for certain non-TRS patients. Yet, only a fraction of suitable patients actually receives clozapine <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">5</ref> often years after treatment resistance becomes evident 6**, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">8</ref> .</p><p>In this review, we contrast the literature advocating its safe and effective use with current evidence regarding the causes and consequences of clozapine underutilization. We highlight those issues we deem most relevant to remedy this crucial issue. Additionally, we discuss ongoing efforts to improve treatment efficacy and safety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLINICAL EFFECTS</head><p>Clozapine has a singular impact of on key mediators of poor illness outcome. It is the most effective drug for improving positive symptoms and global psychopathology both in the most severely ill <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">9</ref> and in the full spectrum of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">10</ref> . Its effects on negative and depressive symptoms rank among the best of all antipsychotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">10</ref> .</p><p>Clozapine shows superior anti-suicidal efficacy 11* and the largest reduction of aggression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">12</ref> . It also decreases the risk for new and persisting co-morbid substance use disorders (SUDs) 13** . Additional long-term benefits include improved treatment adherence 14** and reduced rehospitalization rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">15</ref> .</p><p>Bittner et al. -The case for clozapine treatment of schizophrenia 5</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MORTALITY-REDUCING EFFECTS</head><p>Most importantly, clozapine is also particularly relevant for addressing the substantial mortality gap of schizophrenia. Patients die approximately 15 years prematurely 16** , largely due to high rates of somatic comorbidities <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">17</ref> . For TRS, clozapine shows a greater reduction of all-cause mortality than any other antipsychotic 16** . Across all patients, only second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotics (SGA-LAIs) match this effect 16** , which likely reflects the convergence of clozapine's wideranging clinical benefits including ameliorating the substantial mortality risks associated with SUDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">18</ref> . Despite relatively high rates of metabolic side effects, clozapine's positive impact on cardiovascular mortality is comparable to other SGAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">19</ref> , not least because it induces the largest improvements in adherence to treatments for somatic disorders 20** . This makes clozapine the most effective psychopharmacotherapy for reducing mortality in TRSa long established treatment priority in other medical disciplines, which psychiatry urgently needs to adopt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE BENEFITS</head><p>Such an approach would also facilitate appreciation of clozapine's vital long-term benefits. While its psychopathological effects can be remarkable, improved treatment adherence, lower rates of rehospitalization and SUDs, as well as reduced suicide and all-cause mortality rates remain underrecognized <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 1</ref>). Yet, they are central for its literally life-changing impact on many patients and should substantially influence clinical decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRS EPIDEMIOLOGY AND NEUROBIOLOGY</head><p>Although clozapine can confer important benefits to non-TRS patients, its most important indication remains TRS, which encompasses approximately a third of all Bittner et al. -The case for clozapine treatment of schizophrenia 6 patients 21, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">22</ref> . TRS contributes the most to the overall costs of schizophrenia 21 , making clozapine treatment particularly cost-effective <ref type="bibr">23,24*</ref> . Importantly, treatment resistance is characterized by a predominantly early onset ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2)</ref>. A quarter of patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) already fulfill TRS criteria 25** , making clozapine an important element of FEP treatment algorithms. This may be counterintuitive, given that most clozapine trials studied chronically ill patients 26 .</p><p>Yet, this notion is in keeping with the neurobiology of TRS 22,27,28**,29** . Primary treatment resistance at illness onset appears to emerge directly from the pathophysiology of schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">30</ref> and shows little responsivity to standard antipsychotic treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">31</ref> . Clozapine appears to uniquely improve some of the implicated neurobiological abnormalities including glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission 28**,32 .</p><p>Conversely, treatment resistance emerging at subsequent illness stages is more likely attributable to secondary factors including insufficient treatment adherence and dopaminergic supersensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">22</ref> . Although clozapine is also effective in secondary treatment resistance, this suggests a unique neurobiological rationale for switching to clozapine in first-episode patients with primary treatment resistance.</p><p>Current findings also imply that some secondary forms of treatment resistance might be preventable. Interestingly, there is tentative evidence that SGA-LAIsthe most effective first-line treatment regarding treatment adherence and relapse prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">33</ref> might delay the onset of TRS by 15 months 34 . Unfortunately, this opportunity is presently squandered because of widespread underutilization of SGA-LAIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">33</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAFETY AND RESPONSE OPTIMIZATION</head><p>To enhance patients' benefits, optimizing clozapine safety and efficacy is essential.</p><p>Bittner et al. -The case for clozapine treatment of schizophrenia Proactive side effect detection and management constitute crucial skills, which can alleviate common concerns regarding neutropenia, myocarditis, weight gain and metabolic syndrome among others. This has prompted detailed guidelines 35**,36*,37** , which make the safe use of clozapine eminently feasible and help to minimize allcause discontinuation. The notable success rate for re-challenges after neutropenia and myocarditis of approximately sixty percent <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">39</ref> underscores the need for rechallenge consensus protocols based on more systematic studies.</p><p>Therapeutic drug monitoring (TMD) is critical for ensuring optimal plasma levels (350 to 600 ng/ml) <ref type="bibr">40</ref> . While existing studies estimate the mean clozapine response rate at 40 percent <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">41</ref> , only a fraction of them utilized TDM. Observational data have also demonstrated considerable underuse of TDM and plasma levels outside the recommended range in many monitored patients 42* . Implementing the routine use of TDM could raise response rates and patient safety substantially. However, ensuring a timely initiation of clozapine probably remains the most important and disregarded optimization strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE DELAY IN INITIATING CLOZAPINE</head><p>The delay in initiating clozapine (DIC) after establishing treatment resistance, which is estimated at around 5 to 7 years, has important prognostic value 6**, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">21</ref> . After a DIC of more than 2-4 years response rates can decline considerably 6** , while a short DIC is associated with response rates of up to 80 percent <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">43</ref> . The impact of the DIC mirrors the well-established prognostic value of the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">44</ref> , which also constitutes a risk factor for treatment resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">46</ref> . These findings hint at possible neurobiological connections between the sequelae of a long DUP and a long DIC. Furthermore, they highlight the potential of early intervention services (EIS) for detecting and managing treatment resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">47</ref> . Their success in Bittner et al. -The case for clozapine treatment of schizophrenia 8 lowering the DUP is the main raison d'être for (EIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">44</ref> . Based on the predominantly early emergence of treatment resistance 25** and recent findings demonstrating that EIS can reduce the DIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">45</ref> , strategies for detecting treatment resistance should become a standard element of EIS. The observation that EIS might have little effect on the prevalence of treatment resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">45</ref> does not argue against this strategy, but rather supports the notion that primary TRS represents a distinct group of schizophrenia biotypes unresponsive to non-clozapine antipsychotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">44</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLOZAPINE UNDERUTILIZATION</head><p>Despite the overwhelmingly favorable evidence, which is reflected in unanimous </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATTITUDE OF PSYCHIATRISTS TOWARDS CLOZAPINE</head><p>Clozapine underutilization appears to be attributable particularly to clinician's concerns regarding potential side-effects, especially an overestimation of the risks associated with blood dyscrasia 49*,52,54,55 and a lack of resources for blood sampling and other monitoring procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">52</ref> . Clinician's apprehension appears to be further amplified by limited knowledge regarding treatment algorithms and side effect management <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">57</ref> . Importantly, this might result in a vicious cycle of less prescription leading to less expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">57</ref> . Furthermore, psychiatrists predominantly presume that patients would not accept clozapine and its monitoring requirements 53* , regard clozapine treatment as a burden for both patients and prescribers 58,59** , and assume that patients receiving clozapine are less satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">60</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE PATIENTS' PERSPECTIVE</head><p>Conversely, the majority of patients consistently reports a high degree of satisfaction with clozapine alongside noticeable symptom improvements and a clear preference over previous medications 53*,55,59** . The less common negative experiences center on blood tests and common side effects, especially hypersalivation and weight gain 59** . The clear improvements in treatment adherence after switching to clozapine despite its side effects and monitoring requirements 9 underline the broad benefits experienced by patients, which might motivate them to tolerate some drawbacks.</p><p>Moreover, the reduced rate of polypharmacy promoted by clozapine treatment 61** might also diminish differences in the side effect burden and contribute to patients' preference.</p><p>Bittner et al. -The case for clozapine treatment of schizophrenia</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SHARED DECISION-MAKING</head><p>Overall, current evidence confirms "prescriber fear" <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">56</ref> the reluctance of psychiatrists to recommend clozapine out of concern for the safety and complexity of its useas a central cause of clozapine underutilization. The striking differences between patient and prescriber attitudes forms one of the most crucial barriers for adequate clozapine use. Psychiatrists might refrain from offering every eligible patient the opportunity of a clozapine trial based on the false assumption that most patients will decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">62</ref> . Importantly, by not even seriously discussing clozapine, clinicians essentially deny many patients their best chance at substantial clinical improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">43</ref> . However, patients have a right to receive the best treatment available in a safe and timely manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">43</ref> , and psychiatrists have a clear ethical and medical obligation not to deny them this right.</p><p>Accordingly, psychiatrists must not make the potentially life-changing decision regarding clozapine initiation for their patients 63** . This is particularly important given thaton average -patients' attitudes and preferences align with both the evidence and guideline recommendations, whereas psychiatrists' attitudes and actions do not.</p><p>Hence, even many severely ill patients with TRS retain sufficient capacity to make informed choices to their benefit. This underscores the need to consistently use shared decision-making (SDM). encouraged to make a more informed decision after three months of treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">72</ref> based on their personally experienced benefits and side effects. Clinician should also be prepared to make repeated offers, if necessary 3 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BARRIERS TO SHARED DECISION-MAKING</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS</head><p>Addressing clozapine underutilization rates requires overcoming prescriber-and patient-related as well as healthcare system-related barriers 50* . Although prescriberrelated barriers appear to be the most crucial, overcoming other hurdles remains essential. Specialized TRS treatment teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">73</ref> ideally in combination with national networks of excellence <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">74</ref> can comprehensively address some of the most pressing issues. This includes educating residents, caregivers and families 53* by disseminating the knowledge and skills required for successful TRS detection and clozapine use ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">75</ref> . They could also promote shared decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">52</ref> , provide access to interdisciplinary teams for side effect management 53*,55,76 and issue mandatory clozapine certifications to formalize medical training <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">57</ref> . Point-of-care devices for full blood cell counts and TDM have the potential to greatly simplify monitoring requirements 50*, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">74</ref> . Responsibly easing policies such as restrictions for re-challenging patients after mild forms of neutropenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">38</ref> and blood monitoring requirements after the initial year of treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">77</ref> should also increase clozapine use.</p><p>Finally, given that the potentially high response rates of clozapine clearly invalidate the term 'treatment resistant' for many patients, characterizing them as 'clozapineresponsive' is warranted from both a clinical and neurobiological perspective. This might also help to reduce stigma and therapeutic nihilism by shifting the focus to the essential question, whether a particular patient benefits from clozapine. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KEY POINTS</head><p>• For treatment resistant schizophrenia, clozapine shows superior efficacy regarding global psychopathology, suicidality, aggression, substance use, treatment adherence and rehospitalization rates.</p><p>• For treatment resistant schizophrenia, clozapine shows the strongest reduction in all-cause mortality and the biggest improvement in treatment adherence for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.</p><p>• The delay in initiating clozapine in treatment-resistant patients has clear prognostic value.</p><p>• Prescriber-related factors appear to be the largest contributor to clozapine underutilization, while patient's acceptance and satisfaction is high.</p><p>• Consistent use of shared decision-making is key for addressing clozapine underutilization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIGURES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Bittner et al. -The case for clozapine treatment of schizophrenia   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>guideline recommendations 48** , clozapine remains severely underused across industrialized countries 5,49*,50* with underutilization apparently most pronounced in female TRS patients 51* . There are notable differences between and within countries, which might offer important clues for the underlying causes. For instance, data from the United States indicate that in a sizeable number of states only a minority of eligible individuals receive clozapine 52,53* . Similarly, in the United Kingdom, an estimated one third of TRS patients in the UK are treated clozapine 54 , whereas clozapine prescription rates Finland in are more than twice as high 54 . Instead of clozapine, patients are often treated with considerably less effective approaches including polypharmacy lacking sufficient evidence 21,43 . Ineffective treatment considerably increases the disease burden for patients, which is caused by persistent clinical symptoms, the overall functional impairment as well as the pessimism and therapeutic nihilism widely prevalent within treatment teams 21 . Bittner et al. -The case for clozapine treatment of schizophrenia</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>SDM represents the gold standard of patient-clinician interaction across health systems 64* . The feasibility of integrating SDM in the treatment of schizophrenia and its positive impact on outcomes is well established64*,65  . Most importantly, there is evidence that using SDM and emphasizing the patient's perspective and patientspecific clinical information strongly increases the likelihood of psychiatric trainees to recommend clozapine<ref type="bibr" target="#b93">66</ref> . This indicates that focusing on the patients' needs and their potential benefits is a crucial catalyst of clozapine use. SDM is well suited to facilitate such a change in perspective in psychiatrists 67 , and allow patients' preference sufficient influence on treatment decisions 64* . Its potential for addressing clozapine underutilization underscores the urgent need for the development of standardized SDM tools their incorporation into routine clinical practice and training 64* .One potential barrier for SDM<ref type="bibr" target="#b96">68</ref> may be particularly pertinent to TRS patients. Their high levels of cognitive impairment 21,69 may raise doubts regarding their cognitive capacity. However, concluding that they are too impaired to partake in SDM constitutes a form of stigmatization 64* . The consequences of treatment resistance including persistent positive symptoms, aggression, and SUDs likely also contribute to high levels of stigma. High levels of stigma among patients or their caregivers are indeed associated with more paternalistic decision-making and less SDM 70 . Currently, the exact role of stigma as an obstacle for clozapine treatment remains unclear. However, there is unequivocal, disconcerting evidence that among mental health professionals (MHP) schizophrenia is the most stigmatized mental disorder 71 . The negative consequences for the level of care provided 64* highlight the urgent need for systematic efforts to reduce stigmatization of schizophrenia among MHP, which should also have a positive impact on SDM and clozapine use. OFFERING CLOZAPINE Decisions regarding clozapine should be informed by its unique efficacy, the full extent of its benefits, their comparatively late onset, the high patient satisfaction as well as the good feasibility of side effect monitoring and management. For patients with limited illness insight, emphasizing effects on rehospitalization rates, SUDs and mortality might be particularly valuable. Moreover, ambivalent patients should be Bittner et al. -The case for clozapine treatment of schizophrenia 12</figDesc></figure>

These include developing predictive markers for treatment resistance 28**,78**,79** , clozapine response 4*,80+,81 , and side effectsespecially agranulocytosis and myocarditis 82*,83* as well as individualizing dosing and switching regimes 84*,85* . Moreover, studies designed to conclusively determine whether clozapine might have disease-modifying properties and slow illness progression when used very early 4* are urgently needed. Finally, elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms of clozapine remains a promising strategy for the discovery of more effective compounds 4* . CONCLUSION All evidence indicates that for many patients, clozapine remains the only effective antipsychotic available. In our view, its unrivalled value constitutes an obligation for individual psychiatrists and our field as a whole to make clozapine accessible to eligible patients as widely, swiftly, safely and effectively as possible. All available evidence indicates that this would bring immense benefits to a group of people that is among the most vulnerable in all of psychiatry 21 .</figDesc></figure>
