<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>People's capacity to care for other individuals and groups, even at the expense of their own immediate interests, forms the bedrock of human societies. While research has found that people sometimes make sacrifices for others' welfare, these prosocial tendencies vary widely across individuals and contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bester &amp; Güth, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fehr &amp; Fischbacher, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hein et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Henrich et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Piliavin &amp; Charng, 1990)</ref>. Recent evidence suggests that these varying patterns of selfish and prosocial behavior might be explained by differences in attention allocation and information search across situational contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Teoh et al., 2020)</ref>. Time constraints can make people choose more selfishly or generously simply by limiting the amount of information people can search for. People then adapt to these constraints by prioritizing contextually-relevant information which then systematically biases their social decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Teoh &amp; Hutcherson, 2022)</ref>. As an example, when there are no repercussions for selfish behavior such as when playing a Dictator game, people increasingly prioritize self-relevant information under time constraints, ignore other-relevant information, and make more selfish decisions. In contrast, when selfish behavior could be penalized in an Ultimatum game, people tend to prioritize selfrelevant information less and other-relevant information more under time constraints, leading to more prosocial choices overall. However, this attentional framework has not considered whether and how individual differences in people's dispositional social preferences interact with these contextual factors to shape their information search processes and subsequent prosocial choices.</p><p>Critically, such work could not only shed new insight into the fundamental socio-cognitive processes that enable people to flexibly adapt to a myriad of social situations but also inform more effective, personalized interventions that seek to increase prosocial behavior. RUNNING HEAD: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, CONTEXT &amp; PROSOCIAL CHOICES</p><p>In particular, an extensive body of work has documented robust individual differences in whether time constraints make people more or less prosocial <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chen et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chen &amp; Krajbich, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cornelissen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pancotto &amp; Righi, 2021)</ref>. Specifically, time pressure tends to exacerbate individual differences in social preferences: selfish people tend to make more selfish choices under time constraints while prosocial people tend to make more prosocial choices. Often, researchers interpret these findings as evidence for a dual-process framework where automatic and intuitive dispositions give way to controlled deliberations, reasoning that time pressure constrains deliberation, automatically biasing people towards their own idiosyncratic social intuitions. However, here, we extend the aforementioned attentional framework and propose instead that individual differences in time pressure's effects on prosociality could also result parsimoniously from flexible and dynamic information prioritization rather than expression of default or automatic tendencies. More concretely, because selfish individuals fundamentally care more about their own interests and prosocial individuals care more about others, we predict that selfishly predisposed individuals ought to prioritize selfrelevant information, while prosocial individuals ought to prioritize other-relevant information, especially under time constraints. Given that time constraints might then force people to choose without sampling sufficient information, these information priorities then bias their choices more strongly, leading to the extremification of peoples' overall pattern of selfish/prosocial decisions.</p><p>Yet, given that social interactions in the real world often require people to contend with external (dis)incentives that conflict with their dispositional preferences, a key advantage of our attention model is not only that it provides a parsimonious and unified account of both individual and contextual differences in time pressure's effects on prosociality but that it also allows us to 6 RUNNING HEAD: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, CONTEXT &amp; PROSOCIAL CHOICES consider a more pressing question: how do people balance their own dispositional preferences against contextual (dis)incentives during social decision-making under constraints?</p><p>Thus, in this paper, we seek to demonstrate that people flexibly adapt their information search to jointly prioritize both their own dispositional social preferences and any (dis)incentives in the social environment to optimize decision-making under constraints. To do so, we first aim to simultaneously replicate existing findings that time pressure exacerbates both contextual and individual differences in prosocial choices. Second, we seek to confirm our predictions that time pressure drives people to prioritize information search more strongly for both contextuallyrelevant-i.e., (dis)incentive-compatible-information and information that aligns with their social preferences. Finally, and most importantly, we expect that changes in people's prosocial behavior under time constraint is fully explained by information prioritization during decisionmaking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>To test our predictions, we conducted a pre-registered experiment that measured participants' information search patterns and prosocial decisions in Dictator and Ultimatum games under different levels of time pressures. We recruited a random sample of participants from the US and Canada through Prolific Academic (final N=200; Gender: 102 men, 95 women, 2 non-binary, 1 preferred not to answer; Age: Mean [SD]=31.1 [9.60], Min=18, Max=67). To quantify participants' dispositional social preferences, we first measured their Social Value Orientation using the six primary item measure (SVO: Murphy et al., 2011) before they were randomly assigned to play either the Dictator (N=100) or Ultimatum Game (N=100). Our sample (SVO: Mean [SD]=27.9 [13.0], Min=-7.82, Max=46.0) consisted of 141 prosocial people who RUNNING HEAD: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, CONTEXT &amp; PROSOCIAL CHOICES valued others' welfare but to a lesser extent than their own, 22.45 &lt; SVO &lt; 57.15, and 59</p><p>individualists who valued others' welfare minimally, -12.04 &lt; SVO &lt; 22.45. Unsurprisingly, our sample had no hyper-altruists (those who valued others' welfare more than their own, SVO &gt; 57.15). An independent t-test across games further confirmed that average SVO did not differ between our conditions (b=2.703, 95% CI= <ref type="bibr">[-0.902, 6.309], t(198)</ref>=1.478, pre-registered twotailed p=.141, r=0.104). We pre-registered our sample size of N=200, with N=100 for each condition based on bootstrapped power-analyses that estimated a power of 0.857 for two-way interaction between time pressure and game context. A post-hoc conservative estimation suggests that our sample size would yield a simultaneous power of 0.857 2 = 0.734 for two independent sets of analogous effects (i.e. game context ´ time pressure, social value orientation ´ time pressure).</p><p>Our study deployed versions of the Dictator and Ultimatum game previously used in the literature to simultaneously track participants information search via mouse movements during social decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Teoh &amp; Hutcherson, 2022)</ref>. The experiment comprised of a series of trials where we presented participants with a proposed distribution of money for themselves and another person. Participants were then asked to decide whether they would like to accept or reject the proposed distribution over a default split of $50 each. Participants in the Dictator game were then told that their choices would fully determine theirs and their partners' outcomes:</p><p>accepting would result in the proposed distribution for them and their partner while rejecting would result in $50 for both them and their partner. In contrast, in the Ultimatum game, participants were told that their choices to accept or reject the proposed distribution over the default would additionally be subject to their partners' approval. If participants' partners accepted the decision, the choice would be implemented. If participants' partners did not approve RUNNING HEAD: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, CONTEXT &amp; PROSOCIAL CHOICES of the participants' choices, the choices would be vetoed and neither party would receive any money. However, to eliminate potential learning effects, participants were not provided real-time feedback about their partners' approval of their choices. Instead. they were only informed about their partners' approval on a randomly selected trial at the end of the experiment, which determined the monetary bonus for both them and their partners.</p><p>During the experimental task, we measured participants' information search using mouse-tracking in addition to participants' choices and response times (see <ref type="figure">Fig 1)</ref>. Specifically, monetary amounts for the participant and their partner in the proposed distribution were not immediately available upon trial onset. Instead, participants began each trial by clicking on a central cross that re-centered the mouse position. They could then move the mouse cursor over one of two spatially defined areas-of-interest (AOIs). This revealed information about outcomes for either themselves ($Self) or their partner ($Other), depending on the location of the AOI. The information revealed by the mouse remained visible on the screen until they moved their cursor outside the AOI. Participants were told to sample as much information as they wanted from the AOIs before making their decision to accept (click on the green check mark) or reject (click on the red cross) the proposed distribution respectively. We positioned the $Self and $Other AOI on the left and right side of the screen, and the green check mark and red cross on the top left and right corner of the screen, all equidistant from the center. Critically, the left-right mapping of AOIs, and response buttons were fully counterbalanced across participants, but were consistent from trial to trial.</p><p>To manipulate time pressure, participants' information search and choices were constrained by either a time limit of 1.5s (high time pressure) or 10s (low time pressure). This was visually indicated by the length of a red bar at the top of the screen. Additionally, RUNNING HEAD: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, CONTEXT &amp; PROSOCIAL CHOICES participants were prohibited from making choices within the first 1.5s of trials in the low time pressure condition though they were permitted to sample information during this time. After an initial practice block of 22 low time pressure trials, participants then completed another practice block of 22 high time pressure trials, before completing ten experimental blocks of 22 trials that pseudorandomly interleaved the high and low time pressure conditions. The order of blocks was specified such that participants never completed more than two blocks under the same time pressure condition. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Graphical schematic of a trial in the decision-making task. Participants begin each trial by using the mouse to click on a cross in the center of the screen. They can then sample information by hovering their mouse cursor over the self or other areas-of-interest or make a choice by clicking on either the green check mark (accept the proposal) or red cross (choose the default).</p><p>The length of a red bar at the top of the screen signalled whether they were in the low (long bar) or high (short bar) time pressure condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>… RUNNING HEAD: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, CONTEXT &amp; PROSOCIAL CHOICES</head><p>The amounts of money proposed for the participant and their partner on a given trial each varied from $0 to $100. To calculate participants' bonuses, the outcomes of a randomly selected trial was divided by a factor of 50 into US dollars. Participants were informed that their bonus would scale with the amounts in the experiment but remained ignorant of the precise exchange rate until the end of the experiment. To compensate participants for their time, they were additionally awarded US$5 for their participation. Informed consent was collected based on a protocol approved by the Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Stimuli</head><p>To construct the set of proposed distributions in our experiment, we identified 20 unique combinations of $Self and $Other. These combinations were selected such that if $Self was greater than 50, $Other would be less than or equal to 50, or vice versa. Each combination was repeated 5 times in the high and low time pressure conditions (100 trials each). We further modified the exact amount for $Self and $Other on each trial by an integer value that varied uniformly in the range U(-2,2), to prevent the caching of responses. We further added another 20 catch trials that served to orthogonalize the values of $Self and $Other where both amounts were equally larger or smaller than 50. Since the experiment was delivered online to participants' own devices using Inquisit Web 5.0.14.0, we defined the size of all stimuli relative to the device's size but minimized variability in screen-size by requiring participants to complete the task on a desktop or laptop computer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time Pressure Manipulation Check</head><p>As expected, participants in general responded more quickly under high time pressure  <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>-4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral indices</head><p>With respect to information search, we discarded all information samples that were shorter than 100ms in duration from analyses as preregistered, based on prior work on information processing latencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Manor &amp; Gordon, 2003)</ref>. With respect to choice behavior, we defined participants choices as prosocial (1) when they either accepted a proposed distribution where their outcomes were smaller than the default $50, and their partners' outcomes were greater than the $50, or (2) when they rejected a proposed distribution where their outcomes were larger than the default $50, and their partners' outcomes were smaller than the $50. We also removed all catch trials from analyses of prosociality since neither accepting nor rejecting proposals constituted prosocial responding. We defined all other responses as selfish. Finally, we additionally removed from analyses of prosociality trials those cases where participants failed to respond within the time limit of the condition (mean percentage of trials high time pressure: RUNNING HEAD: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, CONTEXT &amp; PROSOCIAL CHOICES M=6.690%; low time pressure: M =0.082%) and trials where participants chose without sampling any information (i.e., guessed: mean percentage of trials high time pressure: M =2.570%; low time pressure: M =0.118%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exclusions</head><p>Based on pre-registered criteria, we removed 239 out of 439 recruited participants. Of these exclusions, six did not complete task, one revoked consent for data-use, 35 failed comprehension checks about the task, 61 provided the same response in more than 90% of all trials, 11 failed to respond in time on more than 25% of trials in at least one of the time pressure conditions, 74 failed to make the rational response in catch trials, and 51 made choices without sampling any information in more than 50% of trials in at least one time pressure condition.</p></div>

Thus, we next sought to verify that both individuals' SVO and the game context jointly determined what information they sampled first under these constraints (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>  one-tailed p=1, post-hoc two-tailed p&lt;.001, r=-0.061), though to a lesser extent than the DG.</p><p>While this result, on surface, appears to contradict our model and prior work, these overall patterns of self-prioritization in UG are consistent with a confluence of time pressure's interaction with individual differences in prosocial dispositions and contextual (dis)incentives.</p><p>We further elaborate on this point in the discussion below. Importantly, similar to choice     Furthermore, comprehensive model comparison using stepwise regression that removed the highest-order predictor with the smallest Z-value until only first-order predictors were left identified the model that only included one two-way interaction between first information samples and time pressure as the most parsimonious (BICmin=46125.082). Inclusion of additional two-way interactions between (1) SVO and game context, (2) SVO and time pressure, and <ref type="formula">3</ref>game-context and time pressure further decreased the parsimony of the model without explaining significantly more variance (Model 1: DBIC=0.622; Model 2: DBIC=9.404; Model 3:</p><p>DBIC=10.160). Notably, these results suggest that after accounting for differences in information prioritization and subsequent search (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table S3</ref>), neither individual differences in SVO nor context further influenced changes in prosociality under time pressure independently. Moreover, differences in information search also seemed to largely account for why SVO was more predictive of prosocial choices in the DG compared to the UG.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>While popular theories of social behavior have sought to explain variability in people's selfishness and prosociality by appealing to dual-process dynamics of dispositional preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Böckler et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Moore &amp; Loewenstein, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rand, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rand et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yamagishi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Zaki &amp; Mitchell, 2013)</ref>, recent work highlights that they often fail to consider how different incentive structures across social interactions, as well as human constraints on information processing, shape the mechanistic expression of these preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Teoh et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Teoh &amp; Hutcherson, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Thielmann et al., 2020)</ref>. Here, we demonstrate that people navigate social interactions across different contexts by flexibly calibrating their information priorities to balance their own social preferences against the structural incentives and constraints of the social environment. Specifically, people increasingly prioritized both information that aligned with their dispositional social preference, and information that was incentive-compatible with the social environment under time pressure. For example, a selfishly predisposed person tended to further prioritize searching for self-relevant information under time constraints even in the Ultimatum game, where selfish behavior is disincentivized, but to a lesser degree than a similarly selfish person in the Dictator game, where such there were no such disincentives. Consequently, RUNNING HEAD: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, CONTEXT &amp; PROSOCIAL CHOICES information priorities in the Ultimatum game reflected an integration of both personal preferences and contextual incentives, tracking peoples' dispositional preferences less reliably than information priorities in the Dictator game. Moreover, we found that accounting for these differences in information prioritization was sufficient to fully explain variability in prosocial behavior across individuals, the game contexts and time pressure conditions. In other words, our results here suggest that differences in an individual's prosocial behavior across social interactions with different environmental incentives and constraints might be completely driven by what information they ultimately prioritize during social decision-making.</p><p>Yet, unlike past work, time pressure did not increase prosociality in our study, even for the most prosocial of our participants in contexts where selfishness could be penalized <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bouwmeester et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rand, 2016)</ref>. How can we reconcile these apparent contradictions?</p><p>One possible explanation is that our sample of participants did not include any hyperaltruistic participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rhoads et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rhoads et al., , 2023</ref>)-i.e., people who prioritized others' welfare over their own interests-who our theory would predict are most likely to prioritize other-relevant information and thus act more prosocially under time pressure. While theoretically plausible, such an explanation seems unlikely given that research suggests few individuals hold such extreme prosocial preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Henrich et al., 2005)</ref>, and meta-analytic evidence points to relatively consistent increases in prosociality under time pressure in some contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bouwmeester et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rand, 2016)</ref>. Instead, closer examination of participants' behavior in the Ultimatum game compared to the Dictator game point to the specific social incentives employed in the Ultimatum game as the likely explanation. Specifically, we found that differences in prosociality between the Dictator and Ultimatum game were greatest for individuals who were highly selfish. In other words, penalties for selfishness effectively deterred RUNNING HEAD: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, CONTEXT &amp; PROSOCIAL CHOICES selfishly predisposed participants from enacting those preferences, but its effects were less consistent for increasingly prosocial participants. In addition, these incentives themselves were not sufficiently powerful to counteract the preferential prioritization of self-information under time pressure, leading to overall stronger prioritization of self-relevant information in the Ultimatum game. In contrast, studies showing that time pressure increased overall prosociality often employed Public Good games where prosociality was incentivized by emphasizing the mutual benefits of cooperation: prosociality jointly maximizes participants' own outcomes and their partners' <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bouwmeester et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rand, 2016)</ref>. One might expect such forms of incentives to operate both more powerfully but also more uniformly across individuals. Future work should investigate how the nature of the structural incentives shape participants' information search strategies and decision-making, and how time pressure influences these processes.</p><p>Our results here corroborate and extend a growing body of work emphasizing people's flexibility in calibrating their own preferences against structural features of the social context when faced with decisions to act selfishly or prosocially <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hu et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Li et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Teoh &amp; Hutcherson, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Thielmann et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Thielmann et al., , 2022</ref>. Moreover, we demonstrate how both personal social preferences and structural incentives of the social context jointly determine the strategic value of different pieces of information and drive prioritization of attention during decisionmaking, especially under time constraints. These priorities then disproportionately influence the choices people ultimately make under time constraints when further information search is limited, leading to potential extremification of choice patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chen &amp; Krajbich, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Notably, our unified framework here identifies attentional prioritization as a key mechanism that expresses how people flexibly navigate social interactions where their own dispositional 25 RUNNING HEAD: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, CONTEXT &amp; PROSOCIAL CHOICES preferences may conflict with structural incentives. These findings not only parsimoniously provide a potential resolution to ongoing debates about time pressure's influence on social behavior but also makes clear predictions both about whether time pressure will increase or decrease prosociality in a new context, and for whom. Our results also speak against additional factors, such as automatic impulses, driving time-pressure induced changes in altruism/cooperation as a function of contextual or individual differences. Given intervention science's increasing emphasis on the personalization of behavioral interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Halperin &amp; Schori-Eyal, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kizilcec et al., 2020)</ref>, our framework may shed light on relevant efforts to facilitate social interactions in the real world, such as how different individuals might adapt to workplace cultures that differentially emphasize competition or collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Drago &amp; Turnbull, 1991)</ref>, or how the balance between individual and collective responsibility in public health messaging might be tailored to reach specific audiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ceylan &amp; Hayran, 2021)</ref>. It suggests that greater success could be achieved by focusing on attention than focusing on habits.</p><p>To do so, however, future work would have to develop more sophisticated models that explain and predict how people deploy their attention in more ecologically valid social interactions where social incentives are rarely made explicit, and the amount of relevant information far outstrips our information processing capacities.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>pressure exacerbates the influence of both individual differences and contextual incentives on prosocial choice. First, we sought to replicate existing work showing that time pressure exacerbated the influence of both individual and contextual factors on prosocial choice (see Fig 2 &amp;Table S1for RUNNING HEAD: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, CONTEXT &amp; PROSOCIAL CHOICES details of the full model). Consistent with this, we found that time pressure amplified the influence of SVO on prosocial choice in both the Dictator (DG: simple interaction bsvo:time=0.069, 95% CI=[-0.004, 0.143], z=1.840, pre-registered one-tailed p=.033, r=0.019) and Ultimatum game (UG: simple interaction bsvo:time=0.099, 95% CI=[0.038, 0.161], z=3.163, pre-registered one-tailed p&lt;.001, r=0.027), while also simultaneously exacerbating the difference in prosociality between the DG &amp; UG (simple interaction bgame:time=0.108, 95% CI=[0.018, 0.197], z= 2.356, pre-registered one-tailed p=.009, r=0.030).In other words, while people with higher SVO (i.e. more prosocial preferences) made more prosocial choices compared to those with lower SVO(i.e. more individualistic preferences) even under low time pressure in both the DG (simple effect bsvo=0.713, 95% CI=[ 0.544, 0.881], z=8.290, pre-registered one-tailed p&lt;.001, r=0.193) and UG (simple effect bsvo=0.336, 95% CI=[ 0.175, 0.497], z=4.088, pre-registered one-tailed p&lt;.001, r=0.092), the relationships between SVO and prosociality became stronger under time pressure (DG: simple effect bsvo=0.782, 95% CI=[0.611, 0.952], z=8.994, pre-registered one-tailed p&lt;.001, r=0.211; UG: simple effect bsvo=0.436, 95% CI=[0.273, 0.598], z=5.256, pre-registered one-tailed p&lt;.001, r=0.119). Likewise, while participants made more prosocial choices in the UG in general compared to the DG even under low time pressure (simple effect bgame=0.662, 95% CI=[ 0.432, 0.893], z=5.629, pre-registered one-tailed p&lt;.001, r=0.180), high time pressure increased this difference in overall prosociality between participants in the UG vs DG (simple effect bgame=0.770, 95% CI=[0.538, 1.002], z=6.496, pre-registered one-tailed p&lt;.001, r=0.208). More specifically, time pressure reduced prosociality in the DG (simple effect btime= -0.326, 95% CI = [-0.392, -0.260], z = -9.703, pre-registered one-tailed p &lt; .001, r = -0.090) and the UG (simple effect btime= -0.218, RUNNING HEAD: INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, CONTEXT &amp; PROSOCIAL CHOICES 95% CI = [-0.279, -0.158], z = -7.052, pre-registered one-tailed p &lt; .001, r = -0.060), but to a lesser extent in the latter.Given these results, we unsurprisingly also found that individual differences in SVO were less predictive of prosocial choices in the UG compared to the DG (simple interaction under low time pressure bsvo:game=-0.377, 95% CI=[-0.609,-0.144], z=-3.167, pre-registered one-tailed p&lt;.001, r=-0.103). However, contrary to preregistered predictions, time pressure's exacerbation of individual and contextual differences in prosocial choices appeared independent and the UG did not differently constrain SVO's influence on prosociality under time pressure (three-way interaction bsvo:game:time=0.030, 95% CI=[-0.066, 0.126], z= 0.621, pre-registered one-tailed p=.267, post-hoc two-tailed p=.535, r=0.008; simple interaction bsvo:game=-0.346, 95% CI=[-0.581,-0.111], z=-2.889, post-hoc two-tailed p=.004, r=-0.095). Separately, we note here that even our most prosocial participants in the UG became less prosocial under time pressure (simple effect in the UG at SVO=Mean+1SD btime=-0.119, 95% CI=[-0.199,-0.039], z=-2.921, post-hoc two-tailed p=.003, r=-0.033) and return to this point later in the discussion.</figDesc></figure>

Intervals between ticks on Y-axes are scaled based on the logit-transformation to mirror the analytical approach. All statistical tests were preregistered one-tailed tests unless otherwise indicated. Information priorities strongly drive prosocial choice under time pressure.While we have shown thus far that time pressure interacts with individual and contextual differences to produce similar patterns of information prioritization and behavior change in social decision-making, our theory makes the strong prediction that it is precisely this strategic prioritization of information that underlies time pressure's exacerbation of individual and contextual differences in prosocial choices. Specifically, because time pressure constrains opportunities to gather information, any information acquired first should have a much larger effect on prosociality under time pressure than it does under free response. This should be true regardless of individual differences in social preferences and game context.
