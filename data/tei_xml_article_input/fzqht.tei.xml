			<abstract>
				<p>What is the role of working memory over the course of non-native speech category learning? Prior work is mixed with respect to the role of working memory in speech learning and has focused on how this important cognitive skill might influence learning accuracy assessed at a single timepoint. Here, we substantially extend this prior work by examining the role of working memory on learning performance over time (i.e., over several months) and leverage a multifaceted approach that provides key insights into how working memory influences learning accuracy, generalization ability, and decision processes. We find that in the initial and intermediate stages of learning, working memory is associated with higher accuracy, better generalization, and more efficient and cautious decision making. During a later stage of learning when learners approached stable performance, working memory was associated with better generalization and more efficient and cautious decision making, but no longer was related to accuracy. Working memory may enhance learning by facilitating rapid category acquisition in initial stages, enabling efficient and careful decision-making strategies that may reduce the effort needed to learn, and promoting flexible generalization to novel contexts. These results have important implications for developing interventions to improve learning in naturalistic language contexts.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Categorization involves mapping variable inputs to discrete labels and is an important process that supports complex cognitive processes, such as object recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Richler &amp; Palmeri, 2014)</ref> and speech perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Holt &amp; Lotto, 2010)</ref>. Humans can learn novel categories throughout the lifespan across different perceptual modalities. However, there are also large individual differences in the underlying learning processes and outcomes. As such, there is a need to better understand what makes a successful or a less successful learner. In this study, we systematically examine the underlying processes of an ability that has been linked to category learning in prior work -working memory capacity.</p><p>Working memory (WM) reflects the resources available for the temporal storage and manipulation of information relevant for a given task <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baddeley, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baddeley &amp; Hitch, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Category learning involves many processes that are dependent on WM. Learners need to attend to task-relevant features and ignore task-irrelevant features, maintain features of a stimulus in mind as relevant or irrelevant for a decision, hold hypotheses in mind about stimulus-categoryresponse mapping, compare representations of the stimulus to previous stimuli or rules, and incorporate feedback to update existing category representations and hypotheses about category identity. The ability to learn categories across sensory modalities has generally been found to be positively associated with WM <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Craig &amp; Lewandowsky, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lewandowsky, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lewandowsky et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Maddox et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">McHaney et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Sewell &amp; Lewandowsky, 2012)</ref>. WM is thought to support faster initial category learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Sewell &amp; Lewandowsky, 2012)</ref> by allowing learners to hold multiple hypotheses about category identity at mind and test these hypotheses and specifically to rapidly and efficiently find a useful hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lloyd et al., 2019)</ref>. However, studies have primarily focused on the role of WM in initial learning, rather than maintenance of performance or learning patterns over time. This is especially relevant for categories that are difficult or challenging to acquire within a single session.</p><p>In the current study, we examine a specific case of category learning that is an important skill in second language acquisition -non-native speech category learning. The ability to learn a new language has been positively associated with individual abilities like WM capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baddeley et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cheung, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Miyake &amp; Friedman, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Speciale et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Assessed in a single session, the ability to learn sounds of a non-native language in adulthood has been positively linked to WM capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Maddox et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">McHaney et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>However, other studies examining learning across longer training periods (e.g., multiple sessions across days, rather than a single session) have found that WM ability does not predict the ability to learn non-native speech categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ingvalson et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Perrachione et al., 2011)</ref>. As such, it is not yet clear the role that WM plays in learning non-native speech categories across the trajectory of learning. It is possible that WM supports initial, but not later learning.</p><p>In the current study, we train participants on non-native Mandarin tone categories. In Mandarin, distinct pitch patterns are lexically contrastive -the same syllable produced with four different pitch patterns (e.g., high-flat, low-rising, low-dipping, and high-falling) has four unique meanings. Learning to distinguish sounds based on these pitch patterns can be difficult for nonnative listeners and there are large individual differences in learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Llanos et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Reetzke et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wang et al., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wang et al., , 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wong &amp; Perrachione, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Xu et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>For both speech and artificial perceptual categories, training beyond one session can be very successful, leading to significant learning and retention over time. In studies not focused on WM, participants learn through extensive training over several weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bradlow et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brekelmans et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hélie, Roeder, et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hélie, Waldschmidt, et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Reetzke et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Roeder &amp; Ashby, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Waldschmidt &amp; Ashby, 2011)</ref> and then sometimes are brought back for a test of retention months later (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bradlow et al., 1999 -3 months;</ref><ref type="bibr">Reezke et al., 2018 -8 weeks)</ref>. Neural representations of categories rapidly emerge within a single session of initial learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ester et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Feng et al., 2021)</ref>, but continue developing over time with more experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Reetzke et al., 2018)</ref>. The role of WM beyond initial category acquisition is not well understood. Whereas initial learning involves testing a large range of possible hypotheses about stimulus-response mapping and using feedback to update these hypotheses, learning beyond the novice stage involves refining existing hypotheses, learning about idiosyncratic stimuli, and continuing to develop and refine representations. Additionally, after a delay in experience, learners must reactivate existing representations and hypotheses to continue refining their category knowledge. In the current study, we examine the role of WM in both an initial learning session and learning sessions after one and two months.</p><p>Our approach involves inviting participants who previously completed a single session of training on Mandarin tone categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(McHaney et al., 2021)</ref> back for additional training sessions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">McHaney et al. (2021)</ref> demonstrated that WM abilities were related to success in initial learning across two experiments -one behavioral (revisited here) and one with pupillometry.</p><p>Specifically, individuals with higher WM capacity were better at learning, better at finding taskappropriate strategies, and had pupil responses that reflected better stimulus related attention.</p><p>Based on this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">McHaney et al. (2021)</ref> concluded that WM may support learning by enhancing attention to task-relevant information. Critically, because this prior study tested only a single session of learning, it is possible this conclusion may only apply to initial category learning. In the current study, we invite participants from Experiment 1 of McHaney et al. (2021) back for two additional sessions -one session one month after their initial training and another session two months after the second session. As such, we follow up with this exact sample to understand how individual differences in WM relate to individual differences in learning beyond initial acquisition.</p><p>An important aspect of understanding individual differences in learning is the acknowledgement that many individuals perform at chance levels even after extensive training.</p><p>We see two main possibilities that could explain this pattern -(1) these participants are actively engaged and trying but persistently fail to learn and/or (2) these participants are actively disengaged and are not trying to learn, so they fail to learn. Disentangling these two possibilities is challenging. Prior work on category learning takes one of two approaches regarding participants performing at chance levels. Some studies remove these participants entirely, typically by removing participants who perform at or below chance levels by the end of learning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Folstein et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hammer et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Maddox &amp; Chandrasekaran, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rosedahl et al., 2018)</ref>. Other studies retain these participants in the sample as it is impossible to know if their performance reflects a true inability to learn or whether they are disengaged (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ell &amp; Ashby, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kaplan &amp; Murphy, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Roark &amp; Holt, 2019)</ref>. The lack of consistency in these approaches across studies makes it difficult to understand this poor performing subset of the population. In the current study, we take a hybrid version of these approaches to better understand the underlying challenges in less successful performers. We examine both the entire set of participants and separate participants who perform at abovechance levels (learners) and those who do not (non-learners). By examining the patterns while considering if participants eventually learned or not, we can better understand behavior that leads to success.</p><p>In this study, we examine three sessions of learning of Mandarin tone speech categories (240 trials per session). After an initial training session, participants completed two follow up sessions. Sessions were separated by one and two months, respectively. We employ a multifaceted approach to understand what WM does or does not do for initial and later learning of speech categories. Specifically, we assess if working memory is related to (1) initial and later learning, (2) maintenance of category knowledge over time, (3) generalization of knowledge to new talkers, (4) efficiency of evidence accumulation and (5) response caution during decision making <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Initial and later learning</head><p>Based on prior work, we expect that higher WM will be beneficial to initial acquisition (i.e., session 1) of non-native speech categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(McHaney et al., 2021)</ref>. This prediction aligns with prior work on category learning that has demonstrated that higher WM is associated with faster and better initial learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Craig &amp; Lewandowsky, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">DeCaro et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">DeCaro et al., , 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lewandowsky, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Maddox et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Sewell &amp; Lewandowsky, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tharp &amp; Pickering, 2009)</ref>. We expect to observe this pattern given that the first session of training was published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">McHaney et al., (2021)</ref> and they found that among all participants, WM was positively related to learning. A subset of these participants (107/195) return for the current study.</p><p>Building on the prior study, we will probe the extent to which WM is related to performance in subsequent learning sessions. It is possible that WM provides benefits only in initial learning by quickly allowing learners to test many different hypotheses and find the ones that maximize their performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lloyd et al., 2019)</ref> and that WM is unrelated to learning beyond this novice stage. This prediction would be consistent with the observation that WM is not related to speech category learning when assessed after eight days of training <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ingvalson et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Perrachione et al., 2011)</ref>. However, it is also possible that WM provides benefits to learning beyond initial acquisition, allowing for enhanced further refinement of category representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maintenance of Category Knowledge</head><p>By probing performance after one and two months of no additional exposure or training, we will examine the maintenance of performance over time. One possibility is that higher WM may allow learners to quickly reactivate and flexibly use their category representations developed in prior session(s). However, it is possible that maintenance of performance over time may be independent of WM and could reflect long-term memory abilities instead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generalization</head><p>The ability to apply learned knowledge structures to novel information is a hallmark of categorization. We will assess generalization in each session by presenting learners with novel stimuli spoken by novel talkers that they do not encounter during training and never receive feedback about the correct category. To successfully generalize to these novel talkers, they will need to apply their existing knowledge flexibly to the new context. It is possible that generalization relies on WM, as the ability to flexibly apply rules (e.g., cognitive flexibility) is correlated with WM capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Diamond, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">McCabe et al., 2010)</ref> and generalization to novel contexts is related to individual differences in WM capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lenaert et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Wills et al., 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision Processes during Learning</head><p>Using a drift diffusion modeling (DDM) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ratcliff et al., 2016</ref>), we will examine whether different components of the decision process (e.g., efficiency of evidence accumulation and response caution) are related to WM. DDMs are popular tools to understand decision making processes from accuracy and response time measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Heffernan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Nosofsky, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nosofsky &amp; Palmeri, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Paulon et al., 2020;</ref>.</p><p>DDMs assume that during decision making, sensory evidence for multiple decision alternatives is accumulated in the human brain at varying rates, and a decision is made when such evidence reaches a particular boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref>. In the case of learning nonnative speech sound categories like Mandarin tone categories, as a participant hears a stimulus, they begin accumulating evidence towards all four of the response options (e.g., high-flat, lowrising, low-dipping, high-falling). Each of the four response options has its own decision threshold, with larger thresholds requiring more evidence to be accumulated before the decision will be made, reflecting more cautious responding. Evidence is also accumulated toward each threshold at its own rate, with faster rates reflecting more efficient accumulation of evidence.</p><p>Below we consider the possibility that WM relates to these two components of the decision process.</p><p>The classical literature on DDMs has focused almost exclusively on binary decisionmaking in static settings and does not accommodate individual heterogeneity. Recently, Paulon et al. (2020) extended these models significantly, accounting for situations with more than two decision alternatives, heterogeneity across individuals, and longitudinal evolution of the decision-making processes by considering multiple individual-specific and time-varying accumulators of evidence. As such, we will examine decision processes over time with estimates at both the group and individual subject level.</p><p>Efficiency of Evidence Accumulation. We predict that more WM resources may enable learners to acquire information from the stimulus more efficiently, thereby reducing the perceived difficulty of the task and effort needed to learn. The rate of evidence accumulation reflects the quality of information extracted from the stimulus, with faster rates reflecting a more efficient evidence accumulation process. Faster evidence accumulation rates are associated with motivation and better task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hübner &amp; Schlösser, 2010)</ref>. Prior work has demonstrated that evidence accumulation rates are related to WM abilities, with more efficient evidence accumulation associated with higher WM capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ester et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Schmiedek et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Response Caution. We predict that more WM resources may allow learners to be more cautious and less impulsive in their responses and to collect more evidence toward a particular category before making a decision. Response caution is reflected in the decision threshold.</p><p>Higher thresholds reflect more cautious responses that need more evidence before a decision is made, whereas lower thresholds reflect more impulsive responses based on less evidence. More difficult tasks result in more cautious response patterns, requiring that participants gather more information to make decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Philiastides et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref>. Individuals with higher WM capacity may have sufficient resources to gather and consult more information during decision making. As such, they may be more cautious in their responses, gathering more information to hold in WM as they learn to make more accurate decisions. This may ensure that the learner builds up enough of a representation of the stimulus before they make a response and, thus, enhance learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>To summarize, we examine the relationship between WM capacity and non-native Mandarin tone speech category learning in an extended training task with three sessions separated by one and two months. To gain mechanistic insights on the putative relationship between WM and individual differences in category learning over time, we assess behavior from multiple angles. Specifically, we examine how initial and later learning performance, maintenance of performance across delays, generalization to novel talkers, efficiency of evidence accumulation, and response caution are related to working memory capacity <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Participants completed three sessions of Mandarin tone category learning separated by at least one and two months (Session 1 to 2: M = 32.1 days, SD = 0.68, range 31.7-35.6 days;</p><p>Session 2 to 3: M = 61.4 days, SD = 2.56, range 56.6-70.9 days). Data from the first session were used in a previously published study <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(McHaney et al., 2021)</ref>, and the second and third sessions have not been presented elsewhere. Participants completed a language history questionnaire prior to participating. All participants were native speakers of non-tonal languages and reported no prior experience with any tonal languages, including Mandarin. Participants were given a sound check before the start of each session to ensure they could hear the sounds and were wearing headphones. Participants received $10/session for their participation (total up to $30 across three sessions). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p>The stimuli were natural speech productions recorded from four native speakers (2 M, 2 F) of Mandarin Chinese ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1A</ref>). Each tone category (e.g., high-flat, low-rising, low-dipping, and high-falling) were produced by each speaker in five syllable contexts (/bu/, /di/, /lu/, /ma/, and /mi/) for a total of 80 stimuli (20/category). The stimuli from two speakers (1 F, 1 M) were used during the training blocks and the stimuli from the other speakers (1 F, 1 M) were withheld for the generalization block. The stimuli were duration-normalized to 440 ms and RMSamplitude normalized to 70 dB. The stimuli are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1A</ref> in a two-dimensional space (relative pitch, pitch change) that can be used to separate the stimuli into categories and is linked to neural representations of this space <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Feng et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Li et al., 2021)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Category learning. Participants completed three separate sessions of category learning ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1B</ref>). Sessions 1 and 2 were separated by one month. Sessions 2 and 3 were separated by two months. In each session, participants completed six blocks of an identical category learning task and an additional generalization block with different stimuli and no feedback. The stimuli were the same across sessions. Participants never received feedback about the generalization stimuli. At the beginning of the experiment, participants were told that they would be grouping sounds into different categories based on corrective feedback. They were not given any specific instructions about the stimuli or what might differentiate the categories from one another.</p><p>In the category learning task, there were six blocks of 40 trials each. In the generalization task, there was one block of 40 trials. Participants heard the 440 ms duration sound, followed by a prompt about the category identity ("Which category?"). They pressed the 1, 2, 3, and 4</p><p>buttons on the keyboard to respond. Participants received trial-by-trial feedback in the category learning task where they were informed about whether their decision was 'Correct' or 'Incorrect.' The feedback was presented immediately for 750 ms. Participants did not receive feedback in the generalization task. In both tasks, there was an intertrial interval of 1 sec.</p><p>Working memory capacity. In the first session, participants first completed the category learning and generalization blocks and then completed an operation span task <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Turner &amp; Engle, 1989</ref>) as a measure of working memory capacity. Participants were shown simple arithmetic problems and reported whether the presented solutions were correct or incorrect (e.g., (1 + 7) x 2 = 16) and were then shown a letter on the screen (e.g., A). A sequence of these arithmetic problems and letters from three to seven items in length made up a trial. After a full sequence was presented, participants were instructed to recall the letters presented in order. There were 15 trials. Participants' working memory capacity was calculated based on the OSPAN score -the sum of the length of all correctly recalled spans. For example, if a participant correctly recalled a sequence of four letters (e.g., A, I, D, F), four points were added to their score. The minimum possible OSPAN score is 0 and the maximum possible OSPAN score is 75. We did not filter scores based on accuracy on the arithmetic problems <ref type="bibr">(Đokić et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>

Additionally, the model also fits offset parameters # for each stimulus category, which characterize the times taken by the actions that are not directly relevant to the actual decision-making processes (e.g., the time required to encode the s-th stimulus before evidence accumulation begins, to press a computer key, to record a response after a decision is reached, etc.). The model lets the parameters µ !,# and !,# to vary between participants, which accommodates the substantial variability across participants. Importantly, the model also allows µ !,# and !,# to evolve smoothly over time (across training blocks), explaining the changes in the decision-making processes as the participants learn over time. Since gradual improvements in making correct decisions characterize learning, in our discussions below, we emphasize heavily on inferring the parameters associated with successful identification of the stimulus (i.e., correct response), that is, µ !,# and !,# with = .</p><p>We adopted a Bayesian framework for these analyses, assigning priors to the parameters and relying on samples drawn from the posterior using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for estimation and inference. The algorithm was run for 6,000 iterations with the initial 2,000 iterations discarded as burn-in. The remaining samples were further thinned by an interval of 5 to reduce autocorrelation. MCMC diagnostics such as trace-plots of the parameters, Geweke test for stationarity of the chains, etc. indicated no convergence or mixing-related issues.</p><p>Posterior predictive checks indicated good model fit.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning performance</head><p>On average, participants learned the Mandarin tone categories across sessions and blocks with substantial individual variability in performance <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2A</ref>). We note that for visualization of performance across blocks, we grouped participants by their WM scores based on a median split (Mdn = 46), with values equal to or higher than the median defined as high WM and values lower than the median being defined as low WM. The analyses were conducted using raw OSPAN scores as a continuous variable using linear mixed effects models using the lme4 package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref> and are also shown ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2B</ref>). We examined the extent to which WM capacity, indexed by the OSPAN score, was associated with performance in the category learning task. We used linear mixed effects models with block (categorical across sessions), WM capacity, and the interaction between block and WM capacity as fixed effects, participant (intercept) as a random effect, and average accuracy across a block as the outcome variable. Block 1 of session 1 was the baseline reference level.</p><p>Full results are available in the Supplementary Materials <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1</ref>).</p><p>In session 1, WM was not significantly related to accuracy in initial learning trials (block 1: bOSPAN= 0.039, SE = 0.11, p = .83; bOSPAN*Block2= 0.050, SE = 0.079, p = .52; bOSPAN*Block3= 0.12, SE = 0.079, p = .13). However, WM was positively related to accuracy in blocks 4-6 of session 1. A one unit increase in WM score was associated with an additional increase of 0.23% accuracy in block 4 (bOSPAN*Block4= 0.19, SE = 0.079, p = .014), 0.28% accuracy in block 5</p><p>(bOSPAN*Block5= 0.24, SE = 0.079, p = .0023), and 0.30% accuracy in block 6 (bOSPAN*Block6= 0.26, SE = 0.079, p = .0011).</p><p>One month later, in session 2, WM was positively related to accuracy in all blocks. A one unit increase in WM score was associated with an additional increase of 0.28% in block 1</p><p>(bOSPAN*Session2Block1= 0.25, SE = 0.079, p = .0019), 0.31% accuracy in both blocks 2 and 3</p><p>(bOSPAN*Session2Block2= 0.27, SE = 0.079, p = .00069; bOSPAN*Session2Block3 = 0.27, SE = 0.079, p = .00054), 0.34% accuracy in both blocks 4 and 5 (bOSPAN*Session2Block4 = 0.30., SE = 0.079, p = .00015; bOSPAN*Session2Block5 = 0.30, SE = 0.079, p = .00016), and 0.28% accuracy in block 6 (bOSPAN*Session2Block6 = 0.24, SE = 0.079, p = .0023).</p><p>Two months after session 2, in session 3, the relationship between WM and accuracy was not significantly different from the first block in session 1, where there was no clear relationship (bOSPAN*Session3Block1= 0.13, SE = 0.079, p = .11). However, after the first block in session 3, WM was positively related to accuracy in all remaining blocks. A one unit increase in WM score was associated with an additional increase of 0.33% accuracy in block 2 (bOSPAN*Session3Block2= 0.30, SE = 0.079, p = .00019), 0.30% accuracy in block 3 (bOSPAN*Session3Block3 = 0.26, SE = 0.079, p = .0011), 0.31% accuracy in block 4 (bOSPAN*Session3Block4 = 0.27, SE = 0.079, p = .00057), 0.33% accuracy in both blocks 5 and 6 (bOSPAN*Session3Block5 = 0.29, SE = 0.079, p = .00029;</p><p>bOSPAN*Session3Block6 = 0.29, SE = 0.079, p = .00020).</p><p>Taken together, we found that working memory ability was positively associated with speech category learning accuracy starting in the third block of the initial learning session and persisting through most blocks of learning one or two months later. The one exception to this was the lack of positive relationship in the first block of the third session, indicating that perhaps the retention of information over a two-month delay is unrelated to WM.</p><p>Importantly, we also aimed to understand if the relationship between WM capacity and accuracy is different across participants who learned the categories and those who performed no better than chance. We identified participants who performed at or below chance levels in the final block of session 3 (defined by 95% cumulative binomial probability, 40 trials, 0.25 probability of correct response = 25% +/-10%) as 'non-learners' and compared with those who performed better than chance ('learners'; <ref type="figure">Figure 3A)</ref>. Even though the non-learners were defined based on their accuracy in the final block of session 3, non-learners had significantly lower accuracy throughout all blocks (Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons, p &lt; .001), except for the first block of session 1 (p = .078). This underlines the necessity of considering non-learners separately from learners.</p><p>A total of 32% (34/107) of participants were classified as non-learners. WM scores for learners (M = 44.1) were marginally higher than non-learners (M = 36.7; t(65.6) = 1.79, p = .078, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.84, 15.6]</ref>). This may indicate that individuals with lower WM may be more likely to be non-learners. It is important to note that we cannot completely rule out that non-learners with seemingly lower WM may have been generally disengaged in the experiment, leading to poorer performance in both the WM task and the category learning task. If this is the case, WM scores for these individuals may not reflect their true WM abilities. As post-hoc evidence that some participants may have been disengaged across tasks, we found that learners (M = 90%) performed better than non-learners (M = 79%) at identifying the arithmetic equations as correct or incorrect in the WM task (t(44) = 3.49, p = .0011, 95% CI [4.58, 17.1]; Supplementary Materials, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S1</ref>). In the following analyses, we focus on the remaining 68% (73/107) of participants who are operationally defined as 'learners' in the category learning task.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maintenance of Category Knowledge Over Time</head><p>By examining learning across several sessions separated by one and two months, respectively, we can assess the maintenance of categorization performance and category knowledge across time. We assessed category performance maintenance by comparing adjacent training blocks that were either separated by no delay (i.e., blocks 5 and 6 of the same session) or a delay of one or two months (i.e., block 6 of one session and block 1 of the next session).</p><p>Performance across these blocks and sessions for learners and non-learners separately is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A</ref>. Because we are interested in how knowledge is retained over time, we focus our analyses only on learners.</p><p>Learners were somewhat able to maintain their category knowledge after a month or more of no additional training. Between sessions 1 and 2, accuracy fell an average of 7.2%</p><p>(58.0% in block 6 to 50.9% in block 1) and between sessions 2 and 3, accuracy fell an average of 7.0% (65.6% in block 6 to 58.6% in block 1). In contrast, accuracy was relatively stable in the end of the sessions with accuracy increasing by 1.8% in session 1 (56.0% in block 5 to 57.8% in block 6) and by 0.3% in session 2 (65.2% in block 5 to 65.5% to block 6). The ability to maintain category performance in adjacent blocks both with no delay (i.e., block 5 vs block 6) and after a one-or two-month delay (i.e., block 6 and block 1 of the next session) was unrelated to learners' WM capacity ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4B</ref>, <ref type="table">Table S3</ref>). We examined the percent difference between adjacent blocks across sessions using a linear mixed effects model with time (session 1 to 2 as baseline), delay (delay as baseline), WM score (OSPAN), and all interactions as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. WM was unrelated to the retention of performance across sessions 1 to 2 (bOSPAN = 0.032, SE = 0.068, p = .64) and 2 and 3 (bOSPAN*Sessions 2 to 3 = 0.020, SE = 0.094, p = .83). The relationship between WM and retention did not depend on whether there was a delay of a month (bOSPAN*Delay = 0.012, SE = 0.094, p = .90) or two months (bOSPAN*Delay*Sessions 2 to 3 = -0.14, SE = 0.13, p = .29)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generalization to Novel Speakers</head><p>By examining how participants respond to new speakers about which they never receive feedback, we can assess the generalizability of their category knowledge. Overall, learners were successful at generalizing their knowledge to the new speakers while non-learners were unsuccessful ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5A</ref>). Once again, we focus our analyses on learners. We examined whether generalization performance across sessions was related to WM capacity by examining session (session 1 as baseline), WM score, and the interaction between session and WM score as fixed effects and participant as a random effect ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5B</ref>, <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 5</head><p>Working memory and category generalization WM ability was significantly positively related to generalization accuracy in session 1 (bOSPAN = 0.34, SE = 0.12, p = .0056), with a one unit increase in WM score associated with a 0.34% increase in accuracy. There was no significant difference in the relationship between WM and generalization accuracy in sessions 1 and 2 (bOSPAN*Session2 = -0.14, SE = 0.083, p = .11), with a one unit increase in WM score associated with a 0.21% increase in accuracy in session 2. In session 3, working memory ability was still positively related to generalization accuracy though it was significantly weaker than session 1 (bOSPAN*Session3= -0.18, SE = 0.083, p = .035), with a one unit increase in WM score associated with a 0.17% increase in accuracy. Overall, these results demonstrate that, among engaged participants, working memory is related to the ability to generalize one's Mandarin tone category knowledge to novel speakers, especially in early learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision processes</head><p>We examined participants' decision processes based on the parameters from the drift diffusion models. We will focus on the evidence accumulation rate (i.e., drift rate; <ref type="figure">Figure 6A)</ref> and decision threshold (i.e., boundary; <ref type="figure">Figure 6C</ref>) parameters. As these are Bayesian analyses, we interpret differences between groups where there is no overlap in the 95% credible intervals.</p><p>We estimated the parameters for each individual and block, separately across sessions, with all subjects together (i.e., both learners and non-learners).</p><p>First, we note the difference between learners and non-learners. Learners had higher evidence accumulation rates and higher decision thresholds than non-learners. In learners, the evidence accumulation rates increased over time, indicating that they became faster at accumulating evidence towards the correct decision. In contrast, the evidence accumulation rates in non-learners were low and flat throughout training, providing evidence of their general disengagement from the task. The decision thresholds were lower in non-learners than learners throughout the sessions, indicating that non-learners needed less evidence to make their decision.</p><p>This pattern may indicate that non-learners' decisions were based on speed rather than categorization accuracy.</p><p>Critically, our modeling approach enables estimation of the decision parameters at the individual participant level, allowing for examination of how these parameters relate to WM capacity. To understand how decision parameters differed based on WM in learners and nonlearners, we ran separate linear mixed effects models on the two parameters with blocks (categorical across sessions), WM capacity, whether the participant was a learner or non-learner, and all interactions as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. Session 1, Block for learners was treated as the baseline. Full results are shown in the Supplementary Materials (evidence accumulation: <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>, decision threshold: <ref type="table">Table S6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6</head><p>Working memory and decision processes Note. A and C: error bars reflect 95% credible intervals. For purposes of illustration, high and low working memory groups are defined based on a median split of working memory (OSPAN) scores. Groups are additionally separated into learners and non-learners based on session 3 block 6 accuracy and whether it was greater (learners) or less than (non-learners) chance performance.</p><p>B and D plot learners and non-learners separately.</p><p>For learners, WM was unrelated to evidence accumulation rate in the first block of session 1 (bOSPAN = 0.0015, SE = 0.0034, p = .67). Among learners, WM capacity was positively related to evidence accumulation rate in all blocks after the second block of session 1 (bs &gt; 0.0059, SEs = 0.0023, ps &lt; .013). Learners with higher WM capacity accumulated evidence more efficiently (i.e., faster) towards the correct decision ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6B</ref>).</p><p>For non-learners, WM capacity was unrelated to evidence accumulation rate in any block of sessions 1 or 2 (bs smaller than -0.0019, SEOSPAN*NonLearners = 0.0061, all other SEs = 0.0042, ps &gt; .09). In the final session for non-learners, WM capacity was unrelated to evidence accumulation rate in the first three blocks (bs smaller than -0.0081, SEs = 0.0042, ps &gt; .055) but</p><p>was negatively related to evidence accumulation rate in the final three blocks (bs larger than-0.00090, SEs = 0.0042, ps &lt; .030). That is, though there was generally no relationship between WM capacity and evidence accumulation rate of non-learners, in the very end of training, nonlearners with lower WM capacity had higher evidence accumulation rates. It is important to contextualize this result with the fact that non-learners generally had lower accumulation rates than learners across blocks.</p><p>Among learners, WM capacity was unrelated to decision thresholds in the first block of session 1 (bOSPAN = -0.0029, SE = 0.0019, p = .12), but by the fourth block of session 1, was consistently positively related to decision thresholds across all other blocks (bs &gt; 0.0036, SEs = 0.0016, ps &lt; .024). Just as with evidence accumulation rates, learners with higher working memory capacity had more cautious decision thresholds, gathering more evidence before making a decision. Among non-learners, WM was unrelated to decision thresholds in session 1 (bs smaller than -0.0042, SEs &gt; 0.0034, ps &gt; .15). In session 2, WM was unrelated to decision thresholds in the first three blocks (bs smaller than -0.0032, SEs = 0.0029, ps &gt; .09), but was negatively related to decision thresholds in the final three blocks (bs greater than -0.0069, SEs = 0.0029, ps &lt; .02). In the final session for non-learners, WM was unrelated to decision thresholds in all blocks (bs smaller than -0.0035, SEs = 0.0029, ps &gt; .05) except for block 4, where there was a negative relationship (bs = -0.0074, SEs = 0.0029, p = .011). While in most blocks, WM was unrelated to decision thresholds of non-learners, in several blocks there was a significant negative relationship, such that non-learners with higher WM had lower decision thresholds, reflecting higher weighting of speed over accuracy in the speed-accuracy tradeoff.</p><p>In sum, WM capacity was positively related to evidence accumulation rate in learners, but negatively in non-learners. Further, WM capacity was positively related to decision thresholds in learners and was negatively related to decision thresholds in non-learners in the second session.</p><p>In all, WM capacity impacts decision-making differently across the trajectory of learning and depending on whether participants learn or not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We investigated non-native speech category learning in initial learning sessions and in two follow up sessions with one and two months between each session, respectively. We examined the extent to which WM capacity was related to initial and later learning sessions and in which ways. Considering all participants, higher WM was associated with better category learning across learning stages. However, participants with lower WM may also have been more likely to not learn the categories than participants with higher WM. When considering only individuals who performed at above-chance levels (i.e., learners), WM was only associated with better performance during later blocks of initial acquisition (session 1) and an intermediate session (session 2) and was unrelated to performance in a later session (session 3). WM ability was generally unrelated to maintenance of category knowledge over delays but higher WM was associated with better generalization of one's category knowledge to new talkers, reflecting the ability to flexibly apply rules to novel contexts. Finally, higher WM capacity was associated with more efficient evidence accumulation and cautious decision thresholds across all learning sessions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learners and Non-Learners</head><p>Our results demonstrate that simply grouping all participants together does not tell a complete story because some participants clearly do not demonstrate learning, performing at chance levels even after extensive training. However, swiftly removing these non-learners (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Folstein et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hammer et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Maddox &amp; Chandrasekaran, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rosedahl et al., 2018</ref>) may obscure parts of the story as well. Participants who performed at or below chance levels at the end of three sessions of training were consistently poor performers across all blocks and sessions had marginally lower WM scores than learners. Importantly, it is possible that nonlearners with lower WM scores may have been generally disengaged in the experiment, performing poorly across all measures (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Materials)</ref>. In support of the interpretation that non-learners were generally disengaged in the task, they had very low and flat evidence accumulation rates across learning, which are related to general task engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balsdon et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hübner &amp; Schlösser, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Regardless of WM ability, we found that a substantial number of participants (32%) were classified as non-learners. Importantly, these individuals returned for three separate sessions of the same task that they were unable to consistently perform above chance. It is important to consider their goals and motivation for completing the task and compare this with experimenterdefined goals. Whereas we instructed them to respond as accurately as possible, their goal seemed to be to respond as quickly as possible regardless of accuracy evidenced by non-learners' much lower decision thresholds than learners. Decision thresholds (i.e., response caution) are related to the speed-accuracy tradeoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bogacz et al., 2010)</ref>, with lower decision thresholds reflecting favoring speed over accuracy. As such, we interpret these low and flat decision thresholds as a mark of these participants' disengagement in the category learning task.</p><p>Importantly, favoring speed over accuracy is an adaptive strategy if your goal is not to learn the categories, but instead to complete the experiment as quickly as possible. Interestingly, while in most blocks WM capacity was unrelated to decision processes in non-learners, we found that in some blocks, higher WM capacity in non-learners was associated with lower evidence accumulation rates and lower decision thresholds indicating that this adaptive strategy to favor speed over accuracy could be related to WM ability.</p><p>It is necessary to understand and adapt to the goals of our participants. This study was conducted using an online population, rather than a more typical convenience sample of college students leveraged in prior studies. This presents challenges, but also highlights that the goals and motivations to perform a simple experimental task may be different among a broader population than in student populations often examined in experimental psychology research.</p><p>It is important to understand how task disengagement is related to WM ability to understand potential interventions to improve learning. In these results, it is unclear if some individuals with lower WM want to engage in the task, but they are unable to or if they are actively deciding to disengage. Future work should include dynamic measures of task engagement, such as pupil dilation, to better understand how task engagement is related to WM and contributes to differences learning outcomes. If task disengagement is truly related to WM and we want to improve learning for individuals with lower WM, a first step should be ensuring that they are engaged in the task in the first place.</p><p>Together, these results highlight the importance of consideration of individual differences in learning. In particular, these results call for the need of special consideration of individuals who may be disengaged from the task. It is possible that a role that WM plays in learning is ensuring that resources are available for engagement in complex tasks.</p></div>

Our results are in line with this prior work and suggest a role for WM in initial category acquisition.</p><p>As a novel contribution, our results extend these findings and demonstrate that among participants who eventually learn the non-native speech categories, WM was related to learning performance in sessions 1 and 2, but not in session 3. This pattern of results is aligned with other work on speech category learning that demonstrates that given multiple days of training, there is no clear link between WM and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ingvalson et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Perrachione et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Our results provide a bridge between these seemingly contrasting findings and indicate that WM helps in initial acquisition of category knowledge, but individuals with lower WM can 'catch up'</p><p>given more time.

While category representations start to emerge within a single session of training <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ester et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Feng et al., 2021)</ref>, it is clear that further learning continues to shape representations and the networks supporting learning. For example, as individuals move from initial acquisition to highly experienced experts, there is a decrease in activation in sensory and frontal regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Little &amp; Thulborn, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">de Souza et al., 2013)</ref>, potentially reflecting increased efficiency with learning. Research from visual category learning demonstrates that similar neural networks support initial and well-learned categorization behavior, but that these networks become more coordinated with extensive practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(DeGutis &amp; D'Esposito, 2009)</ref>. Our results further suggest that frontal regions involved in WM and feedback-based learning may be differentially involved at initial and later stages of learning.</p><p>Together, this underlines the need to understand how learning and the cognitive abilities and processes that support categorization change from the very initial novice stages of learning to behavior in overtrained experts. This is particularly relevant for speech and language learning contexts, where expert or even genuinely stable levels of performance are unlikely to emerge in a single training session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task Difficulty and Effort</head><p>We found that WM was consistently related to more efficient evidence accumulation and more cautious decision thresholds among learners. These results are in line with prior work that demonstrates that evidence accumulation rates are linked to individual differences in WM <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ester et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Schmiedek et al., 2007)</ref>. Faster, more efficient evidence accumulation rates reflect higher motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hübner &amp; Schlösser, 2010)</ref>, faster mobilization of attentional resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sarter et al., 2006)</ref>, and lower task difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mulder et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">O'Connell et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">van Maanen et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">van Maanen et al., , 2021</ref>.</p><p>We then might interpret the persistently higher evidence accumulation rate in learners with higher WM as reflective of heightened motivation, rapid mobilization of available attentional resources, and perhaps perceived difficulty of the task. That is, even though accuracies are similar, perceived difficulty and perceived or exerted effort to achieve that level of performance may be lower for learners with higher WM. Conversely, lower evidence accumulation rates observed in learners with lower WM may be associated with slower mobilization of motivational or attentional resources and more perceived difficulty in the task.</p><p>Future research should clarify how WM relates to perceived difficulty and perceived and exerted effort during learning.</p><p>Further, learners with higher WM not only had more efficient evidence accumulation, but also had higher decision thresholds starting in the initial learning session and persisting through all other blocks of learning. This indicates that high WM enables learners to accumulate evidence more quickly and gather more information before making a decision. That is, learners with higher WM may have the sufficient resources to collect more information before needing to make a decision because they are able to gather that information so efficiently. WM helps learners make both more efficient and more cautious decisions.</p><p>In sum, these results indicate that higher WM capacity is not a guarantee of better learning. Rather, it reflects better initial acquisition due to the ability to hold multiple hypotheses in mind and more efficient decision-making processes throughout learning. Lower WM also does not doom one to poor performance and, instead, lower WM may be linked to more time and resource-dependent decision processes -which may be more effortful for the learner. Future work should address the perceived and exerted effort in learning and how this is related to WM. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>Our results demonstrate that the relationship between WM and behavior varies at different timepoints of learning and based on whether individuals were successful at learning at all <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 7)</ref>. In particular, we found that during initial and intermediate stages of learning, WM was associated with higher accuracy, generalization, and efficiency and cautiousness of decision making. During later stages of learning when learners approached stable performance, WM was still associated with higher generalization and more efficient and cautious decision making, but was not related to accuracy.</p><p>For non-learners, WM was not reliably associated with accuracy at any stage of learning.</p><p>In blocks 4-6 of the middle session of learning, higher WM was associated with less cautious decision thresholds. In blocks 4-6 of the final session, higher WM was associated with lower evidence accumulation in non-learners. Overall, these results demonstrate that WM is particularly related to accuracy of learners' performance in the initial and refinement stages of learning and is related to decision making at all stages of learning. Additionally, WM is differently associated with behavior based on whether individuals eventually learn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>We note that there was significant attrition across sessions. Whereas 195 individuals completed the first session, only 107 returned for both follow up sessions. This is a challenge for longitudinal designs using online samples but is a necessary challenge to overcome to understand learning beyond initial acquisition. While we considered non-learners who completed all three sessions, it is also important to consider participants who failed to complete all parts of the experiment. In future work, it will be important to understand participants' reasons for returning or not returning to better understand what is motivating their performance in the task.</p><p>Importantly, we found that WM did not differ based on how many sessions participants completed (see Supplementary Materials, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S2</ref>). This indicates that it was not just lower or higher WM individuals who failed to return for follow up sessions. There was also no difference in categorization accuracy based on the number of sessions participants completed. That is, within the same session, those who completed one, two, or all three sessions did not differ in their accuracy (Supplementary Materials).</p><p>Another limitation of the current work is that we used a single measure of WM, measured at a single timepoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Conway et al., 2005)</ref>. Specifically, we used an operation span measure based on ability to manipulate and remember a sequence of letters given a mathematical task interference. Operation span is extensively used and is a highly reliable measure of WM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Conway et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Unsworth et al., 2005)</ref>. Even still, one measure likely does not reflect the true complexity of WM. Future studies should collect multiple measures of WM including visuospatial and auditory WM to better understand how category learning relies on a general understanding of WM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We examined non-native speech category learning, generalization to novel talkers, and maintenance of category knowledge across three sessions separated by one and two months,</p><p>respectively. The results demonstrate that higher WM is not a guarantee of learning, nor is lower WM a sentence to learning difficulties. WM is one important ability in supervised category learning. Here, we highlight the need for an approach that considers the stage of learning and whether participants eventually learn. By leveraging a drift diffusion modeling approach and examining behavior from several different angles over time, we conclude that WM may help learners by facilitating rapid category acquisition in initial stages, enabling efficient and cautious decision-making strategies that may reduce the effort needed to learn, and promoting flexible generalization to novel contexts. These results have important implications for developing interventions to improve learning in naturalistic language contexts and understanding what it means to be engaged in a task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Participants were adults ages 18-35 recruited from Prolific (prolific.co) and participated via Gorilla Experiment Builder (Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2019).

There was substantial attrition from session-to-session, and we excluded participants who did not complete all sessions -153 completed session 2 (70 F, 83 M, M = 24.9 years, SD = 5.05), and 107 completed session 3 (47 F, 60 M, M = 24.8 years, SD = 5.07).
