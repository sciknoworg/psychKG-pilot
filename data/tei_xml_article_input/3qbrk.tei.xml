			<abstract>
				<p>Reports of academic cheating trigger fears of moral decay. This inference, that cheating is a dying canary in the coal mine of morality, assumes that youth who cheat lack genuine, moral concerns with honesty and integrity. This article proposes an alternative perspective on cheating and dishonesty. We propose that cheating and other forms of dishonesty result from (1) misperceptions of what constitutes cheating, (2) evaluations that cheating or lying is okay under exceptional circumstances, and (3) prioritization of non-integrity actions during conflict. Each of these three steps-perceptions, evaluations, and action-selections-show both situational and developmental variability. From this perspective, research on cheating shows moral engagement, not moral disengagement: Developmental and psychological research shows that, far from being a dying canary, cheating reveals the pervasive role of morality in decision-making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Canary Alive: What Cheating Reveals About Morality and Its Development</head><p>When we hear of a canary in a coal mine, we infer that the bird is dead. The metaphor comes from the defunct practice of using canaries to monitor the air quality in coal mines. The 1911 Coal Miners Act required British miners to bring "two small, caged birds" down with them <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">(Scobie, 1996)</ref>. If the birds chirped, which they did most of the time, it meant the air was breathable. If the birds died, it meant the air was toxic and the miners should get out. And it is this second image, of a small ill foretelling a greater ill, that the metaphor evokes-even if canaries in coal mines were mostly alive.</p><p>When we hear of academic cheating, many take it as a sign of moral decay in the younger generations. Each declaration of a "cheating epidemic" by journalists, educators, or scholars suggests a moral emergency (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Alschuler &amp; Blimling, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Haines et al., 1986</ref>; though see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Barnhardt, 2016)</ref>. In a 1976 article on one "cheating epidemic," Time wrote: "There is no annual tabulation to prove [an increase in cheating], just a feeling among many administrators" (p. 29).</p><p>In the article, a dean at Johns Hopkins complained that "it's hard to wall off the university" from the "morality problem in the external world" created by "Watergate and its general milieu."</p><p>Since Watergate (and probably before), each decade has brought fresh fears of cheating epidemics among educators and scholars. Meanwhile, rates of cheating among undergraduates have remained fairly stable since at least the 1960s <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Curtis &amp; Tremayne, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">McCabe et al., 2012</ref>).</p><p>Cheating became a prime case of the presumed "gap" between judgments and actions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Blasi, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Darnell et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Stephens, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b221">Walker, 2004)</ref>. Even though people agree that cheating is wrong, they still cheat. The notion of a judgment-action gap gained force from the early findings that one's stage of moral reasoning correlated only modestly, if at all, with one's propensity to cheat <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Blasi, 1980)</ref>. The discovery of the judgment-action gap prompted a search for new explanations for why people cheat and do harm <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Nucci, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Turiel, 2003a)</ref>: If moral judgments do not guide actions, what does?</p><p>It's easy to see why cheating seems like a symptom of moral decay: a dead canary in the mine of morality. According to prominent psychological theories, individuals cheat because they either (a) do not care about honesty and integrity or (b) delude themselves into excusing their own transgressions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">Waltzer &amp; Dahl, 2022)</ref>. Donald McCabe, a pioneer in research on academic cheating, concluded that "morality does not seem to be a major influence on student decisions to cheat or not to cheat" <ref type="bibr">(McCabe, 1997, p. 444)</ref>. Cheaters are said to "disengage" or "switch off" their moral principles, "making detrimental conduct personally acceptable by persuading oneself that the questionable behavior is actually morally permissible" <ref type="bibr">(Shu et al., 2011, p. 330;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bandura, 2016)</ref>. These explanations of cheating trace the roots of cheating to a moral crisis. If young people can turn off their moral principles when they want to cheat, they could also turn off their moral principles when they want to commit other misdeeds. This paper takes a contrasting view. We see cheating as an instance of moral engagement, not disengagement . It may not be a form of moral engagement researchers and teachers approve of. But it is moral engagement nonetheless-one that teaches us broader lessons about how morality lives and breathes. If cheating is a canary in a coal mine, the canary is alive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two Axioms For Research on Cheating and Morality</head><p>Our psychological account of cheating, and morality, rests on two metatheoretical axioms. Our first, ecological axiom is that, insofar as psychologists seek to explain why cheating happens, they have to study everyday life <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Dahl, 2017)</ref>. This stance pushes us beyond laboratory experiments and surveys of overall cheating frequencies to studies of daily decision-making in concrete situations over time. This commitment to studying everyday life directly calls for naturalistic observations, in-depth interviews about real-life events, and analyses of school records, all in the service of understanding when and why cheating and integrity happen.</p><p>Studies of everyday life demonstrate perceptions, evaluations, and decisions about cheating vary from one situation to the next. As we will discuss later in this paper, many acts of cheating occur because students struggle to perceive cheating accurately. Studies of everyday cheating also reveal that people evaluate cheating as generally wrong, but okay in exceptional circumstances (e.g., to help a friend), and that people are often conflicted about their own acts of cheating. The studies further reveal that students' decisions about cheating parallel their judgments: Students refrain from cheating in most situations but decide to cheat in certain exceptional circumstances. These perceptions, evaluations, and decisions around cheating vary not just situationally, from one assignment to the next, but also developmentally, from one year to the next. Since most people act dishonestly sometimes, we "cannot divide the world into honest and dishonest people" <ref type="bibr">(Kohlberg, 1971, p. 183;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">Serota et al., 2022)</ref>. Stable characteristics of individuals or institutions, while important, cannot explain why the same person will cheat in some situations and not others. To explain cheating, we need to explain both situational and developmental variability in everyday perceptions, evaluations, and decisions.</p><p>Our second, descriptive axiom is that empirical research cannot determine whether an act of cheating is morally wrong. Empirically research has no means of separating morally right actions from morally wrong ones; its scientific purview is strictly descriptive and predictive <ref type="bibr">(Dahl, in press;</ref>. Empirically, we can study whether people judge that a given act of cheating is morally wrong. We cannot use the methods of psychological science to 6 determine whether cheating is truly wrong. Our stance is not relativistic. We do not reject the distinction between what is morally right and morally wrong. As humans, we all make distinctions between right and wrong every day. We simply claim it is not the job of empirical psychology to draw that evaluative distinction. Our definitions of cheating and morality are descriptive definitions devised for doing psychological science. As our definitions are devised for a scientific project, and do not seek complete overlap with ordinary use of words like "cheating" and "morality," our definitions are not only descriptive but also technical (for discussion, see <ref type="bibr">Dahl, in press</ref>). 1</p><p>How can we define and study cheating and morality without making assumptions about which actions are morally wrong? This paper will focus on academic cheating, though we will also touch on other forms of cheating and dishonesty. We define cheating as a violation of institutional rules that is intended by the agent to go unpunished by institutional authorities and to benefit persons involved in the violation . Consider a student who collaborates on an individual assignment, even though the instructor has prohibited students from collaborating. Here, the act of cheating-collaboration-would be in violation of institutional rules ("don't collaborate on this assignment"), be intended to go unpunished (since the student hopes they will not get caught), and be intended to benefit the student (by saving time or preparing a better assignment).</p><p>Cheating can happen intentionally or unintentionally. Imagine that the above student had forgotten that the instructor had prohibited collaboration on the assignment. The act of 1 Though our definition is devised for an empirical and psychological project, our work is informed by philosophical writings on morality and related constructs. Philosophical analyses of key concepts have sharpened our thinking and helped us make distinctions we would not have otherwise made or would have made with less clarity (For discussions of relations between philosophical and psychological work on morality, see e.g., <ref type="bibr">Dahl, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Lapsley, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">Turiel, 2015)</ref>. We thank a reviewer for prompting us to acknowledge this. collaboration would still be a violation of institutional rules, be intended to go unpunished (since the student did not think there was anything to punish), and be intended to benefit the student.</p><p>Our definition takes no stance on whether or when cheating is wrong (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Bouville, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Green, 2006)</ref>. Again, defining cheating as immoral puts empirical science in the business of deciding which behaviors are right and which are wrong. That would violate our descriptive axiom. A cheater may judge that their act of cheating is wrong or they may judge that their act is morally okay, even if the act goes against institutional rules. On a personal level, a researcher may judge the cheater's act as right or wrong. Whether these evaluations are objectively correct or incorrect, neither determines if the act fits our descriptive definition of cheating.</p><p>By morality, we mean obligatory concerns with others' welfare, rights, justice, and fairness, as well as the reasoning, judgments, emotions, and actions that spring from those concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Dahl, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Killen &amp; Smetana, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">Turiel, 2015)</ref>. A person's obligatory concerns are the concerns that the person thinks anyone in their situation ought to have and that it would be wrong not to have. Like our definition of cheating, our definition of morality makes no mention of what is objectively right or wrong.</p><p>It only references what individuals consider to be right or wrong. The latter, but not the former, can be assessed with empirical methods.</p><p>These broad axioms are not shared by all scholars of integrity and cheating. The next part of our paper will discuss two frameworks that conflict with our axioms. We will argue that each framework runs into difficulties. The troubles of these approaches, along with empirical insights about moral psychology and moral development, lead us to an alternative, moral-developmental framework to studying and explaining cheating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Why do People Cheat? The Stable Predictors and Moral Disengagement Frameworks</head><p>We began this paper by pondering why so many scholars see cheating as a sign of moral crisis-a dead canary in the mine of morality. This view of cheating received support from two common frameworks for explaining why people cheat: (a) The first framework, which we will call the Stable Predictors framework, sought to predict cheating from stable, morally relevant attitudes of individuals. We will argue that this first framework falls short of our ecological axiom, which requires that research on cheating study everyday life. Limitations of the Stable Predictors framework set the stage for a second approach to explaining cheating. (b) This second framework, which we will call the Moral Disengagement Framework, sought to explain the lack of relation between stable attitudes and acts of cheating by proposing that people turn off their moral aversion to cheating when it suits their self-interest. In this section, we will briefly consider both frameworks and argue that they do not account for the empirical realities of perceptions, evaluations, and decisions about cheating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(a) The Stable Predictors Framework and the Ecological Axiom</head><p>In the early 1920s, Hartshorne and May began a pioneering study of children's cheating.</p><p>Both investigators had a background in theology and sought to examine "character education, with particular reference to religious education" <ref type="bibr">(Hartshorne, 1924, p. 397)</ref>. Addressing a core question of character education, they wanted to "discover what the relation is between behavior and the knowledge of right and wrong" <ref type="bibr">(Hartshorne &amp; May, 1926, p. 63)</ref> In the years since Hartshorne and May, researchers have continued to search for stable characteristics of individuals that predict rates of cheating (S. D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Lee et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">McCabe et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b238">Whitley, 1997)</ref>. This work has found higher rates of cheating among male students, students with lower GPAs, international students, students who are motivated more by academic results than by mastery, students who score low on the personality trait conscientiousness, or people who score lower on measures of moral identity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anderman &amp; Midgley, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Bertram Gallant et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Bunn et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b210">Teixeira &amp; Rocha, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Stets &amp; Carter, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Whitley, 1998</ref>; as this is not the place for a comprehensive review, we refer the reader to excellent and recent reviews by <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Gerlach et al. [2019]</ref> and S. D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Lee et al.[2020]</ref>).This expansive body of research has advanced our knowledge about which individuals are more likely to cheat or lie.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bandura, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Krettenauer, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Shu et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Stephens, 2018</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b) The Moral Disengagement Framework and the Descriptive Axiom</head><p>The second framework proposes that people can "turn off" their moral principles when it suits their interests. Some scholars call the turning off of moral principles "moral disengagement," others call it "neutralization," and yet others call it "rationalization" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bandura, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Cushman, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Haines et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Shu et al., 2011)</ref>. The details of each concept, and the associated theories, vary. Yet the theories all hold that a person who thinks it is wrong to cheat can excuse their own cheating by disengaging, neutralizing, or rationalizing away their aversion to cheating. <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Krettenauer (2022)</ref> captures this perspective when he writes: "Moral disengagement refers to individuals' attempts to neutralize immoral actions so that these actions are compatible with their sense of morality" (p. 4).</p><p>Moral disengagement is an appealing explanation of why people act against their general principles. If people could turn off their moral principles at will, it would be no wonder that people kept violating those principles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bandura (2016)</ref> proposed a list of mechanisms of such moral disengagement. Bandura's list overlaps with <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">Sykes and Matza's (1957)</ref> list of "neutralization techniques." Both lists included the denial of responsibility for one's actions, blaming of victims, minimization of the consequences to any victims, and the provision of socio-moral justifications for the violation. These processes are not portrayed as genuine moral functioning-they are disingenuous mental acrobatics people deploy to retain their self-image while they violate their own principles.</p><p>In support of the Moral Disengagement Framework, several studies have found that people who score higher on moral disengagement or neutralization questionnaires cheat more (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Haines et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Shu et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Stephens, 2018)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Shu et al. (2011)</ref> found that people who had cheated on a laboratory task, by overreporting how many matrices they had solved, scored higher on a Moral Disengagement questionnaire. The questionnaire included items such as "Rules should be flexible enough to be adapted to different situations" and "It is appropriate to seek short-cuts as long as it is not at someone else's expense" (pp. 345-346). The authors concluded that when "bad behavior precedes moral questioning, people bend their moral beliefs to match the preceding action" (p. 345).</p><p>But the Moral Disengagement Framework relies on a shaky distinction between moral disengagement and sincere moral engagement . The framework asserts that moral disengagement is a deviation from healthy moral reasoning, by which people apply principles to form judgments. Moral disengagement techniques are ways by which "moral selfcensure can be disengaged from reprehensible conduct" <ref type="bibr">(Bandura, 2002, p. 102)</ref>. Where healthy moral reasoning would lead to "self-censure" for one's wrongdoing, moral disengagement turns off such self-censure.</p><p>The problem is to find out which behaviors count as "reprehensible" and for which people should experience "self-censure." Simply deeming that it was okay to violate a moral principle is not enough to constitute moral disengagement. A person who judges it permissible to violate some moral principle under some circumstances does necessarily "disengage" or "turn off" their moral sense. In many instances, we celebrate people for violating their principles of honesty. Think, for instance, of people who lied to the Nazis during World War II to protect Jews from persecution and deportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Kochanski, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Oliner &amp; Oliner, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Turiel, 2003b)</ref>.</p><p>Even researchers who study cheating and dishonesty usually rely on deception to conduct their studies. In their study of how moral disengagement predicted cheating when solving matrixproblems, <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Shu et al. (2011)</ref> write:</p><p>So that participants would feel the problem-solving task was anonymous, we asked them not to report their study ID on the matrix sheet-only on the rest of the material they had received. To match participants' score reporting slips to their test sheets after the study, we changed one of the three-digit numbers in the last matrix on the test sheet so that it matched participants' study ID. This design allows us to track each individual's performance (p. 340).</p><p>To detect the participants' lies about how many matrices they had solved, the researchers themselves had to deceive the participants. We do not think that the use of deception in behavioral experiments is inherently immoral and neither-presumably-did the researchers themselves. We do think the example illustrates how most of us think it is acceptable to violate one principle, such as the principle of honesty, to prioritize another principle, such as the principle of producing high-quality science.</p><p>The upshot is that we cannot infer disingenuous, self-serving moral disengagement merely from the fact that people judge it acceptable to violate a moral principle. We would need some other criterion for separating moral reasoning from moral disengagement. Which behaviors are "immoral" <ref type="bibr">(Krettenauer, 2022, p. 4)</ref> or "bad" <ref type="bibr">(Shu et al., 2011, p. 340</ref>) from the perspective of empirical science? As we have argued elsewhere, the literature on moral disengagement has not provided such empirical criteria . While Bandura (2018) has defined moral disengagement as "a phenomenon in which moral self-sanctions are disengaged from detrimental behavior" (p. 247), he provides no empirical criteria for what counts as "detrimental," "bad," or "inhumane." Absent such criteria, the determination of whether some act of cheating or aggression is "detrimental" appears to depend on the researcher's own evaluative judgments. And the invocation of the researcher's own evaluative judgment would go against our second, descriptive axiom, which states that science is not in a position to separate moral from immoral actions.</p><p>The problems with the Moral Disengagement Framework are not just theoretical, however. We now have positive evidence that students who cheat are also highly concerned with integrity. As we discuss below, this moral engagement shows up in their reluctance to cheat, the conflicts they experience around their decisions to cheat, and the guilt they feel after cheating <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">(Waltzer &amp; Dahl, 2021a)</ref>. We now turn to an alternative, moral-developmental account, which aims to make sense of moral engagement in the context of cheating and dishonesty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Seeking An Alternative Framework For Studying and Explaining Cheating</head><p>The Stable Predictors and Moral Disengagement frameworks share one shortfall: Neither framework accounts for how actions and principled judgments covary across time. People act honestly in most situations yet cheat in some situations; and people judge that cheating is wrong in most situations yet okay in some situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Kohlberg, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Turiel, 2003a</ref> frameworks. So we also draw on scientific insights about moral psychology and moral development to develop our alternative framework for studying and explaining cheating-the moral-developmental framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Nucci, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Turiel, 2003a)</ref>. Since cheating overlaps with the moral realm, psychological claims about cheating must be compatible with psychological claims about morality, and vice versa. We could not consistently claim, for instance, that people reason carefully about all moral issues but they do not reason about cheating.</p><p>In particular, we draw on three fundamental insights from research on morality and moral development (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Killen &amp; Smetana, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Nucci, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">Turiel, 2015)</ref>. Together, these insights help explain why actions and judgments covary across situations and across development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Factual beliefs guide evaluative judgments. People form evaluative judgments</head><p>based on factual beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Wainryb, 1991</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. To make evaluative judgments, people often coordinate competing principles.</head><p>People hold many evaluative principles about how to act. These principles sometimes enter into conflict with each other. A person may hold that we should generally be honest and that we should generally promote others' welfare. When the only way to promote others' welfare is to lie, the two principles enter into conflict. In these circumstances, people can judge that it is okay to violate one principle to uphold another. In one study, most physicians judged that it was okay to lie to an insurance company to procure life-saving surgery for a patient (e.g., coronary bypass surgery) but not to procure plastic surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Freeman &amp; al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Perkins &amp; Turiel, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>III. Evaluative judgments guide, but do not fully determine, actions. When people judge that they ought to do X, they are, other things being equal, more likely to do X than when they judge that they should not do X <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 2005</ref>  . But, as we will see, the fact that we occasionally act against our moral judgments does not mean that we disengage from morality or that morality has no influence on our actions.</p><p>These three insights about factual beliefs, evaluations, and decisions in morally relevant contexts help explain both situational and developmental variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Killen &amp; Dahl, 2021)</ref>. This The moral-developmental framework analyzes decisions about cheating as the products of (1) perceptions of what constitutes cheating, (2) evaluations of whether cheating is okay, and</p><p>(3) selections of which action path to follow. In essence, the framework distills into three propositions:</p><p>(1) Perceptions of what counts as cheating shape judgments of cheating, and people's perceptions of cheating are sometimes misaligned.</p><p>(2) People evaluate acts of cheating based on multiple considerations, which leads them to judge cheating as wrong in most situations but acceptable in some situations.</p><p>(3) People mostly select actions in accordance with their judgments but decide to prioritize other concerns in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>Each of these three components involves developmental and situational change. The same person may perceive collaboration as cheating on one assignment but not in another situation (e.g., a group project) or another time in development (e.g., elementary school). They may evaluate an act of cheating as wrong in one situation at one time but not other situations or other times. And they may choose to act in accordance with a particular judgment in one situation at one time and not other situations and times. Jointly, situational and developmental variability in perceptions, evaluations, and action-selections can account for why the same person will occasionally cheat yet refrain from cheating most of the time.</p><p>Our moral-developmental framework is compatible with individual differences. Although this section focuses on intra-individual variability, not inter-individual variability, the two kinds of variability co-exist. Given the scope of our present article, we will leave it for a future article to integrate the findings on intra-and inter-individual variability in cheating.</p><p>In the following sections, we discuss evidence for situational and developmental change in the perception, evaluation, and action-selection around cheating. We also note where more research is needed, as empirical evidence is limited or indirect. Our discussion centers on academic cheating, but we will also draw on research about other aspects of dishonesty and morality.</p><p>An overall lesson emerging from this work is that students who cheat remain committed to moral principles. As we document how students strive to translate their principles into actions, our discussion of the psychology of cheating reveals not moral disengagement but moral engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perception: Does This Action Count as Cheating?</head><p>At the perception step, a student determines whether an act counts as cheating. Per our definition, this means to determine whether their action violates academic rules in a way that would benefit them, or someone else involved, provided they avoid punishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">(Waltzer &amp; Dahl, 2022)</ref>. To perceive cheating, students answer questions like: Did the instructor prohibit collaboration on this assignment? Is my submission so similar to another text that I am committing plagiarism? If a student does not perceive their act as cheating, they will have no reason to refrain from the action-at least on academic integrity grounds. (They may of course avoid the action for other reasons. It may, say, be too time-consuming ). Unfortunately for students, it can be hard to perceive cheating accurately, as we discuss below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variability in Perception Across Situations</head><p>Some acts are clear-cut cases of cheating. A student who steals the answer key from the instructor, or peeks at a peer's responses during an exam, knows they are cheating. A student who studies and completes an exam on their own knows they have not cheated. In other cases, the line between cheating and integrity is harder to draw for students. They may not know what kind of collaboration the instructor permitted <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">(Waltzer, Bareket-Shavit, et al., 2023)</ref>. When students do not perceive cheating accurately, they risk cheating unintentionally. Recounting their past acts of cheating, about half of students said they had not known at the time that their action constituted cheating .</p><p>Plagiarism presents particular perceptual problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ashworth et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Park, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>All academic writing relies on sources. This reliance can range from inspiration to verbatim copying. Different disciplines, and different individuals, draw different distinctions between appropriate use and plagiarism. In one research paradigm, participants see pairs of texts and decide whether the texts are similar enough to constitute plagiarism <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Childers &amp; Bruton, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Roig, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Waltzer &amp; Dahl, 2021a)</ref>. When the texts are highly similar, most agree it is plagiarism. When the texts are highly dissimilar, most agree it is not plagiarism. But when the similarity of the two texts is somewhere in between, teachers often disagree sharply with students-and with other teachers-about whether the text pairs constitute plagiarism <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">(Roig, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">(Roig, , 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Waltzer &amp; Dahl, 2021a;</ref>. When two people disagree about what counts as plagiarism, an assignment submitted in good faith by a student can look like plagiarism to an instructor.</p><p>In addition to textual similarity, perceptions of cheating incorporate the context of the action. To most students, copying from a source without providing a citation is plagiarism when submitting a class paper but not when preparing notes for personal use <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">(Waltzer &amp; Dahl, 2021a)</ref>.</p><p>Academic norms and expectations vary across specific assignments, different classes, and entire disciplines <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Borg, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Madigan et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Pennycook, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b229">Waltzer, Bareket-Shavit, et al., 2023</ref>). An instructor might forbid collaborating on one assignment and encourage collaboration on the next. Some activities, like poetry, tend to be done individually, whereas others, like computer programming, are more often done in teams. This changing network of implicit and explicit norms complicates students' task of separating cheating from integrity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variability in Perception Across Development</head><p>People's understanding of cheating and dishonesty changes during childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Evans &amp; Lee, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Bussey (1999)</ref> found that four-year-olds struggled far more than older children to distinguish lies from truths. In a study by <ref type="bibr">Olson and Shaw (2012)</ref>, three-year-olds found nothing wrong with copying the drawing of another person. In contrast, five-year-olds and older kids thought worse of a copied drawing than of an original drawing. And <ref type="bibr">Marlow and colleagues (2023)</ref> found that, while both 5-and 7-year-olds condemned game-rule violations, only 7-yearolds viewed cheating-rule violations that benefited the transgressor-more negatively than noncheating violations that did not benefit the transgressor. Though these findings are about children's evaluations, which we return to in a later section, the evaluative distinctions suggest a perceptual distinction between cheating and non-cheating.</p><p>In school, children's perception of cheating relies on their understanding of what the instructor considers cheating. The ability to represent other people's mental states develops substantially during the preschool years <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Hughes &amp; Devine, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Wellman, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b241">Wimmer &amp; Perner, 1983)</ref>. When they enter formal schooling, most children can infer other people's beliefs,</p><p>intentions, and desires, and these abilities continue to develop into adulthood (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Dumontheil et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">Tousignant et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Vetter et al., 2013)</ref>. There is some evidence linking individual differences in mental state understanding to children's cheating. One study of 3to 8year-olds tested both children's ability to track others' mental states and their tendency to cheat on a lab task <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(O'Connor &amp; Evans, 2019)</ref>. The researchers asked children to guess the identity of a toy placed behind them without looking. The experimenter then left the room, giving children an opportunity to cheat by peeking. Children who showed a more advanced understanding of others' mental states were less likely to cheat while the experimenter was away. The findings are correlational, and other studies have not found significant correlations between mental state understanding and cheating (e.g.,  requires youth to learn a myriad of context-specific rules (e.g., when to use citations, whether a calculator is allowed). They must navigate a landscape of dynamically shifting academic norms-many of which are unspoken and many of which differ from norms in other contexts of schooling and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ashworth et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Collier &amp; Morgan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Giroux &amp; Penna, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b229">Waltzer, Bareket-Shavit, et al., 2023)</ref>.

Instructors are the ones who decide what counts as cheating in their classes. Intervention studies evidence the crucial role of academic instruction: Training students to recognize plagiarism makes students more accurate perceivers of cheating and reduces cheating rates <ref type="bibr">(Elander et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Kashian et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Obeid &amp; Hill, 2017)</ref>. Unfortunately, most college instructors rarely talk about academic cheating or integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(McNeill, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b229">Waltzer, Bareket-Shavit, et al., 2023)</ref>. When they do talk about cheating, instructors rarely provide definitions of cheating or plagiarism to their students. The shortage of information about cheating and integrity, and the corresponding difficulty of learning how to perceive cheating, puts students at a double risk. Students risk either cheating unintentionally or refraining from using permitted resources out of a misguided fear that they would be cheating <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ashworth et al., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Even when students develop accurate perceptions of cheating, they do not always refrain from cheating. We now turn to the next step in our model: evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation: Would it be Wrong to Cheat in This Situation?</head><p>At the evaluation step, the student judges whether a particular act would be wrong.</p><p>Nearly everyone judges that cheating and other forms of dishonesty are generally wrong. Still, most children and adults judge that dishonesty is okay in certain situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Davis et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">DeBernardi et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Freeman et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gingo, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Jensen et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Perkins &amp; Turiel, 2007)</ref>. People also deem dishonesty permissible in lower-stakes situations, when, say, they don't want to ruin the surprise of a surprise birthday party.</p><p>We have already considered one source of situational and developmental variability in evaluations: perceptions of what constitutes cheating. If a student perceives their academic work as violating academic integrity norms, they have a reason to judge that action as wrong; if the student thinks their submission is in accordance with academic integrity norms, they lack such a reason to judge the action as wrong <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Pecorari, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Schmelkin et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Waltzer &amp; Dahl, 2021a</ref>. Perceptions of cheating are not the only factual beliefs that inform evaluations about cheating and integrity. These evaluations also draw on factual beliefs about harm or learning. If, say, a student believes that cheating will benefit others or that it will help them learn, they will have a reason to evaluate cheating positively.</p><p>A second source of variability in evaluations of cheating is the coordination of competing considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Killen &amp; Smetana, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">Turiel, 2015)</ref>. Children and adults often face competing considerations when forming judgments about right and wrong. Being honest can harm someone's feelings; one person's academic survival can conflict with another person's intellectual property. If an individual shifts their priority from one consideration, say honesty, to another, say academic survival, their judgments will change as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variability in Evaluation Across Situations</head><p>Virtually everyone judges as wrong clear-cut acts of cheating that lack mitigating circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Davis et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Jensen et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Waltzer &amp; Dahl, 2021a)</ref>. Students base their judgments that cheating is generally wrong on several concerns, including concerns with honesty, fairness, and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(A. Miller et al., 2011;</ref>.</p><p>But some situations pit concerns with honesty and integrity against concerns with academic success, financial needs, social obligations, and even learning. Most acts of intentional cheating happen in the face of conflicts among such concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Stephens &amp; Nicholson, 2008;</ref>. These conflicts show up in students' accounts of their own acts of cheating. Here is one story from a participant, representative of the hundreds of stories we have collected, edited for clarity and anonymity  When students encounter conflicts between concerns, they strive to balance those concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Jambon &amp; Smetana, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">McGuire &amp; Rutland, 2020)</ref>. They may look for a compromise, or they may try to decide which concern weighs more heavily in their situation. In grappling with such conflicts, students experience uncertainty and ambivalence <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Barrett &amp; Cox, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Waltzer &amp; Dahl, 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b225">Waltzer et al., 2022)</ref>. Already before they form a judgment, the efforts to coordinate integrity with other concerns, and the accompanying uncertainty, reveal students' moral engagement in the face of opportunities to cheat.</p><p>Certain conflicts among concerns lead people to judge cheating as okay. High school and college students rate hypothetical acts of cheating as more acceptable when the protagonist needs to pass the class to get a job that will help their family or when they do not want to disappoint their parents; they are much less accepting of cheating just to see if one can get away with it <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Jensen et al., 2002)</ref>. In one study, we asked college students and other adults to read vignettes about students who cheated <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(DeBernardi et al., 2023)</ref>. In half of the vignettes, the protagonist faced exceptional pressures to cheat (e.g., needing to care for a loved one). In the other half, the protagonist faced less pressure to cheat (e.g., family is healthy and well-off). For the vignettes with exceptional pressure to cheat, about half of participants said cheating was okay. For the vignettes without such pressures, fewer than one in five judged cheating to be okay. These findings are particularly noteworthy because participants were not seeking to excuse their own cheating: They were evaluating the cheating of unfamiliar others. The findings thus evidence how people who judge cheating as generally wrong also judge cheating as acceptable under some circumstances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variability in Evaluation Across Development</head><p>There is surprisingly little research on how children's evaluations of cheating develop <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Lavoie et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Marlow et al., 2023)</ref>. Scholars may have lacked interest in how evaluations of cheating develop because they assumed that everyone, even children, judged cheating to be wrong <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Bouville, 2010)</ref>. As we saw above, however, a person may judge cheating to be wrong in most situations yet okay in other situations. To sketch the development of such situated judgments about cheating, we will draw on research on evaluations of dishonesty and other socio-moral issues.</p><p>In the section on perceptions, we also discussed studies on young children's evaluations of cheating. In the studies by Shaw and <ref type="bibr">Olson (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Marlow and colleagues (2023)</ref>, children's evaluations of cheating became increasingly negative between preschool age and middle childhood (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Riggs &amp; Kalish, 2016)</ref>. By middle childhood, then, most children appear to judge cheating as wrong. But, as we saw in the section on situational variability in perception, the general prohibition against cheating, and concern with integrity, is only one part of the picture. To evaluate cheating in specific situations, individuals need to coordinate competing considerations. Children learn how to balance their concerns with academic integrity against concerns with welfare or loyalty when these conflict. They need to figure out how to make exceptions to one principle in order to prioritize another, competing principle.</p><p>In many areas of moral development, younger children are less willing than older children to make exceptions to general principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Killen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Nucci et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Talwar and colleagues (2016)</ref> found that 6-7-year-olds rated lies negatively, regardless of the consequences of those lies. In contrast, older children (8-12 years old) rated prosocial lies, meant to benefit others, as better than selfish lies, meant to benefit oneself. Gingo (2017) presented 8-12-year-olds with stories about hypothetical characters who lied to circumvent an authority figure's directive (e.g., to kick a peer). With age, children were increasingly willing to accept deception based on moral concerns with others' welfare. Throughout middle childhood and adolescence, youth learn to recognize gray areas and reason about multiple concerns when evaluating complex situations such as those that involve dishonesty and other moral issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Evans &amp; Craig, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gingo, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Nucci et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Perkins &amp; Turiel, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, by the end of adolescence and emerging adulthood, nearly all youth view cheating as</p><p>generally wrong yet acceptable in some circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Davis et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">DeBernardi et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Jensen et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Lavoie et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Waltzer &amp; Dahl, 2021a)</ref>.</p><p>These situated and developing evaluations constitute a second step in our explanation of why people cheat. But evaluations are not yet actions. We now turn to the third step in our model: action selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Action Selection: Can I Achieve My Goals Without Cheating?</head><p>Our model of cheating cannot stop at the evaluation step. After all, people do act in violations of their evaluative judgments about what they ought to do. At the action selection step, a person chooses among possible courses of action. Choosing an action involves considering how our possible actions, and their expected results, align with our judgments and goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Rettinger, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">Stone et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b240">Wikström, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b225">Waltzer &amp; Dahl, 2022)</ref>. Imagine a student who needs a high score on a test the next day but feels unprepared for the test. They also have an evening shift at their part-time job. One option the student considers is to skip their work shift and study instead. Another option is to sit next to a friend during the test and copy their answers. Only the second path frees up the student's time enough to do their work shift and get sleep before the test. To select an action, the student may consider not only their academic goal of getting a high score on the test but also other academic and personal goals (e.g., performing well in other classes, staying healthy, financially supporting themselves). Faced with this choice, they may decide to cheat, even though they judge cheating as wrong. Like perceptions and evaluations, action selections vary both situationally and developmentally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variability in Action Selection Across Situations</head><p>Most action paths that students consider do not involve cheating. We can infer that students mostly consider non-cheating action paths by considering that any one student knowingly cheats on only a small percentage of their assignments. One study found that only 3%</p><p>of undergraduate students plagiarized on their library research projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Karlins et al., 1988)</ref>. An unpublished study from our lab yielded similar rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">(Waltzer et al., 2019)</ref>. We asked students to describe their most recent writing assignments and indicate how confident they were that they had plagiarized on each submission on a scale from 0 (extremely confident they did not plagiarize) to 100 (extremely confident they did plagiarize). Of the nearly 700 assignments described, only 5% had a plagiarism confidence above 50. These findings are consistent with findings that, on an average day, people tell far more truths than lies <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">(Serota et al., 2022)</ref>. People judge dishonesty to be wrong in most situations and, accordingly, refrain from lying in most situations.</p><p>When students do cheat, even those actions can align with their judgments. In the previous section, we saw how people judge cheating and other dishonesty as okay under some circumstances. In our interviews with college students about their prior acts of cheating, 56-95% said they had thought their actions were okay at the time of the action .</p><p>These cases add to the number of cases in which people act in accordance with their own judgments-even if they do not act in accordance with the judgments of teachers and researchers.</p><p>In rare cases, however, students do cheat despite judging cheating as wrong <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Galloway, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Stephens &amp; Nicholson, 2008;</ref>. Several factors can lead students to select a cheating action that goes against their judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">(Waltzer &amp; Dahl, 2021a)</ref>. First, a student may find that their assignment is not feasible for them, given the limited resources, skills, and time at their disposal <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Devlin &amp; Gray, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Hosny &amp; Fatima, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b244">Yardley et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Second, a student may face high academic stakes: They may need a passing grade to remain in good academic standing or an A to get into medical school. Students who fear that they will not get the grades they need are more likely to cheat than those who have secured the necessary grades <ref type="bibr">(Finn &amp; Frone, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Kanfer &amp; Duerfeldt, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Murdock et al., 2001)</ref>. Third, a student may face external pressures, such as financial or family obligations. A part-time job can make an otherwise feasible assignment unfeasible by leaving the student with less time for schoolwork.</p><p>Consistent with this notion, students who are involved in extracurricular activities, such as clubs or sports, are more likely to cheat than other students <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Haines et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">McCabe &amp; Treviño, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Yu et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>If these factors coincide for large groups of students, they can create noticeable bumps in cheating rates. One such bump arose in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the spring of 2020. Cheating increased dramatically when colleges transitioned to remote instruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Flaherty, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Lederman, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Rossiter, 2020</ref>)-this also happened at our own campus, the University of California, Santa Cruz . We conducted a survey that compared students' experiences before and after the transition to remote instruction at our campus. Students experienced extra pressures-such as unreliable internet access or obligations to care for family-immediately after the COVID-19 outbreak and, correspondingly, reported higher levels of cheating (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Waltzer &amp; Dahl, 2021b)</ref>. As students adjusted to the extraordinary challenges brought by the pandemic, we expected that the exceptional pressures would subside along with the cheating rates. Indeed, this pattern appeared in campus academic integrity records in the years surrounding the pandemic outbreak. Our analyses showed a sharp increase in cheating during Spring 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, and then a return to pre-pandemic levels of cheating in subsequent terms, even though remote instruction continued. These findings suggest that the bump in cheating arose not just from the modality of online instruction, with its increased opportunities to cheat. Increased cheating also resulted from acute pressures associated with a public health emergency and rapid transitions in the delivery of education for which neither students nor teachers were prepared.</p><p>When students do go against their judgments, and cheat despite judging that cheating is wrong, they typically experience considerable conflict. In one study, we asked students to reflect on their recent acts of cheating <ref type="bibr">(Waltzer et al., under review)</ref>. Most participants said that they were the person responsible for what happened and that, if they had a do-over, they would do things differently. A laboratory study gave another group of students the opportunity to plagiarize for a collaborative essay competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">(Waltzer et al., 2021)</ref>. A confederate prompted participants' reasoning as they deliberated about whether to plagiarize. Nearly all participants resisted the confederate's suggestion to copy from the internet by hesitating or refusing; those who did copy reported more guilt and shame than those who did not copy. Of course, people also experience of conflict and guilt when acting against one's judgments or principles in nonacademic contexts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Smetana and Wainryb (2021)</ref> found that adolescents and young adults often experienced shame and guilt around experiences of lying to their parents. These conflicts illustrate how people can remain morally engaged with, and care genuinely about, a moral principle even when they violate that principle.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">-Colton et al., 2022)</ref>. Perhaps because of the lower stakes, and because they are designed to elicit cheating, laboratory studies find higher rates of cheating than field studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Gerlach et al., 2019)</ref>. Nonetheless, laboratory experiments have the advantage of affording researchers more control and greater confidence in their causal inferences.</p><p>In a typical laboratory paradigm, participants receive a difficult task that is financially incentivized (for an overview of lab paradigms, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Gerlach et al., 2019)</ref>. The researchers set up the task so that participants believe they can cheat without being detected, for instance because they can shred their worksheets and self-report how many matrices they solved on a task. This work has found, for instance, that participants cheat less after being given "moral reminders" (e.g., reciting the Ten Commandments, signing a pledge) and cheat more after witnessing an ingroup member cheat (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ariely, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Gerlach et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Hertwig &amp; Mazar, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Shu et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Even though researchers' manipulations can nudge participants' cheating up or down, even participants with elevated cheating rates cheat much less than they could <ref type="bibr">(Jacobson et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Mazar and colleagues (2008)</ref> gave participants 20 matrices to solve. In one condition, participants had the opportunity to cheat by over-reporting the number of matrices they had solved. Since their answers sheets were shredded, participants who over-reported had no risk of being detected. They were free to cheat as much as they wanted and could receive a monetary reward for doing so. Still, participants who had the chance to cheat only reported solving 4.2 matrices. That average was barely, though significantly, higher than the average of 3.1 matrices solved by participants with no chance to cheat. Participants' average overreporting was only 6%</p><p>of what it would have been if they had sought to maximize their gains.</p><p>Within the Moral Disengagement Framework, these experimental findings are taken to confirm that people readily turn off or loosen their moral principles when it suits their selfinterest <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">(Shu et al., 2011)</ref>. From this vantage point, the bigger puzzle is not why so many people cheat but "why people <ref type="bibr">[…]</ref> do not cheat to the full extent possible" <ref type="bibr">(Jacobson et al., 2018, p. 381</ref>). The main reason people do not maximize their cheating, according to this framework, is that they need to preserve their self-image. Surveying the literature, <ref type="bibr">Mazar and colleagues (2008)</ref> conclude that "people behave dishonestly enough to profit but honestly enough to delude themselves of their own integrity" <ref type="bibr">(Mazar et al., 2008, p. 633)</ref>.</p><p>Another possibility, proposed by our framework, is that people refrain from maximum dishonesty because they care about honesty. If people evaluate severe dishonesty as worse than mild dishonesty, we would predict that they would avoid severe dishonesty more than they avoid mild dishonesty. And if people evaluate even mild dishonesty as worse than honesty, we would predict that they avoid mild dishonesty more than they avoid honesty. This is indeed what we find when we survey the distributions of honest and dishonest behaviors. With so much scientific attention dedicated to the times when people cheat and lie, scholars of dishonesty have dedicated less attention to the fact that most people act honestly in most situations <ref type="bibr">(Levine et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">Serota et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Waltzer et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Next, our moral-developmental framework faces the old question: If people care about honesty and integrity, why do they ever lie and cheat? And why do they sometimes cheat more when they witness another person cheating and less when they are reminded of moral codes? Our earlier sections gave partial answers to why people act dishonestly: First, people may not perceive their act as dishonest. (Think of a poker player who gets a Royal Flush without letting out any signs of joy: Are they being dishonest or are they simply playing poker well?) Second, people may genuinely evaluate dishonesty as permissible in a particular situation, whether it's their own dishonesty or someone else's. Perhaps many research participants think it's okay to cheat in a psychological experiment, where the stakes are low, others seem to be cheating, and the researchers might well be deceiving them?</p><p>Unfortunately, few studies examine people's perceptions and evaluations of cheating and dishonesty during research studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">(Waltzer et al., 2018)</ref>. We can therefore only speculate on whether people who cheat in laboratory studies think their actions are okay, either because they do not view their actions as cheating or because they judge cheating as acceptable in those contexts. A lot hinges on this. The assertion by <ref type="bibr">Mazar and colleagues (2008)</ref> that people "delude themselves of their own integrity" (p. 633) assumes that people who cheat in lab experiments are indeed deluding themselves. If the participants in question either did not think their actions constituted cheating or genuinely evaluated cheating as okay in the experiment, they would not be deluding themselves. From the researchers' point of view, it may seem obvious that the experimental behaviors of participants constituted cheating and that the acts were wrong. But without a direct investigation of how the participants perceive and evaluate their behaviors, and the behaviors of others in their shoes, we cannot know whether they are deluding themselves or, as we suspect, mostly acting in accordance with their own perceptions and judgments.</p><p>What we know about academic cheating suggests that most cheating happens when people either do not perceive their acts as cheating or they evaluate their cheating as permissible <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Jensen et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">McGregor &amp; Stuebs, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Stephens &amp; Nicholson, 2008;</ref>. Still, we need more research on when and why students occasionally act against their judgments about cheating. As we saw above, students' accounts of their academic cheating show that they sometimes do choose actions they judge to be wrong. They may not choose such actions as often as scholars and instructors assume, but they do choose them. We already reviewed some situational factors that appear to increase the chance that students will decide to cheat, even when they judge cheating as wrong. To guide future research, our model further hypothesizes that people are more likely to act against their evaluations when</p><p>(1) those evaluations are less negative (e.g., when they judge a cheating act to be only a mild transgression) and (2) when their competing concerns-with, for instance, academic survival or family obligations-are stronger.</p><p>The fact that people occasionally do what they judge to be wrong does not render morality impotent. As the philosopher <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Wiggins (2006)</ref> put it, "there are many, many moral motives that are both disinterested and pure-manifestations neither of self-interest nor of the desire for useful consequences such as good reputation-yet are not invincibly strong" (p. 21).People can have genuine moral concerns about academic integrity that they chose to subordinate to other concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variability in Action Selection Across Development</head><p>By age three, most children can be made to cheat on a laboratory task. A study by Zhao and colleagues (2017) had three-and five-year-olds participate in a guessing game. The experimenter would hide a playing card that has a number on it and ask the children to guess whether the number on the hidden card is greater or less than 6. The experimenter also tells participants they would get a prize if they guessed correctly. During the critical trial, the experimenter leaves the room and asks the child to promise not to peek at the hidden card. In one condition, more than 60 percent of 3-year-olds, and nearly as many 5-year-olds, cheated by peeking at the hidden card.</p><p>As they age from childhood to adolescence, children cheat less in lab-based games <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Kanfer &amp; Duerfeldt, 1968)</ref>. But they also encounter new opportunities for, and pressures toward, academic cheating. One survey of over 3,000 students in California found that 39% of middle school students reported copying off someone on a test, while 75% of high school students reported doing so <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Brandes, 1986)</ref>.

We propose that these trends contribute to developmental changes in acts of cheating.

But we also propose that action selection around cheating undergoes its own developmental changes. These are changes in how children and youth imagine different paths of action, how they weigh the concerns affected by those paths, and how they plan for future events in academic contexts.</p><p>Large literatures cover how children and adolescents make decisions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Albert &amp; Steinberg, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Jacobs &amp; Klaczynski, 2002)</ref>.

From early adolescence into emerging and later adulthood, youth continue to improve their strategies to regulate themselves and form emotions adaptively <ref type="bibr" target="#b249">(Zimmermann &amp; Iwanski, 2014)</ref>. And higher executive control remains associated with lower cheating rates in adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Anderman et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>At the same time, adolescents are more inclined toward risky behaviors than children and adults (e.g., trying drugs, illegal activities; <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Kwon &amp; Telzer, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Steinberg, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">Steinberg, , 2008</ref>.

One might interpret the correlation between perceived peer cheating and reported own cheating as a sign that high schoolers and college students blindly go along with their peers.</p><p>Alternatively, the perception that all their peers cheat could lead adolescents to evaluate cheating more positively: After all, if everyone cheats, cheating no longer confers an unfair advantage to cheaters over other students.</p><p>Developmental changes in cheating also respond to changes in the contexts of cheatingnot just the decision-making of individuals. Late high school and early college are pivotal times in students' careers. Low grades in high school can keep you from getting into your dream college. By comparison, low grades in a Ph.D. program are usually inconsequential. Entry into college presents a host of unfamiliar academic, social, and financial pressures that many students struggle to manage <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Arnett, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">McCabe et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b246">Zarrett &amp; Eccles, 2006)</ref>. The stress that many students feel early in college is, to be fair, a response to a stressful situation. This brings us back to our first, ecological axiom, which calls on academic integrity research to study the everyday contexts of cheating.</p><p>By incorporating situational and developmental changes in perception, evaluation, and action-selection around cheating, as well as the changing circumstances of cheating, we can explain why the same person refrains from cheating in most situations, yet cheats in certain situations during certain developmental periods. Many open questions remain. This paper has articulated some of them. Our main goal, though, has been to provide a framework for thinking about and studying the intertwining of morality and cheating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion: What Cheating Tells us About Morality (And Vice Versa)</head><p>Reviewing the literature on dishonesty, Jacobson and colleagues (2018) lamented that the "theoretical framework for studying dishonesty is limited to a few papers" (p. 381). We are struck, in particular, by how few theoretical approaches to cheating postulate that people genuinely care about honesty and integrity. It is as if scholars noticed that most people cheat sometimes, concluded that most people do not truly care about integrity, and then built their frameworks on that premise.</p><p>We have abundant evidence that people care about honesty and integrity: Cheating scandals evoke public outrage. (If people did not care about integrity, why should they care that others cheated?) Most people-though there are exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Curtis &amp; Hart, 2022</ref>)-refrain from cheating most of the time and become prone to conflict, guilt, and regret when they act dishonestly. It is because people take integrity seriously that acts of academic cheating incur sanctions, derail student success, frustrate educators, undermine trust in academic credentials, and is a target for educational interventions. Our moral-developmental framework for cheating begins with the empirical insight that people do care about honesty and integrity. From that idea, our framework addresses the question of why people sometimes cheat.</p><p>Our answer to this question has two parts. First, we proposed to analyze cheating and dishonesty as the result of perceptions, evaluations, and action selections. People can cheat without realizing it, people can judge that cheating is okay, and people can-occasionally-cheat even though they judge their act to be wrong. Second, we proposed that each of these three components-perceptions, evaluations, and action selections-vary both situationally and developmentally. A person who evaluates cheating as wrong in one situation can judge cheating as permissible in another situation or at a different point in their development.</p><p>Analyzing cheating within the moral-developmental framework reveals that people who cheat can remain morally engaged. They can care about honesty and integrity, even as they act</p><p>dishonestly. Their moral engagement shows up in their interest in determining whether their act counts as cheating, their balancing of integrity and honesty with other concerns as they form evaluations of cheating, and their motivation to select actions that accord with their evaluations.</p><p>Cheating has been a paradigmatic test case for whether morality guides our actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bandura, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Blasi, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hartshorne &amp; May, 1924)</ref>. Many psychologists took the tension between the principle of honesty and the prevalence of dishonesty as a sign that moral principles were poor guides for actions. The tension became evidence for a wide gap between moral judgments and actions. Within extant frameworks, and especially the Moral Disengagement Framework, a key conclusion was that people readily turn off their moral principles to suit their self-interest. To return to our opening metaphor: Cheating looked like a dying canary in the mine of morality, which signaled the decoupling of our actions from our moral judgments.</p><p>If, as we argue, cheating reveals not moral disengagement but moral engagement, then research on cheating holds very different lessons about morality. Our paper proposes that if cheating is a canary for the state of human morality, the canary is alive and well.. The psychological realities of cheating do not show that young people have lost their moral concerns with honesty and integrity. The research we reviewed reveals that our moral sense does guide our actions and emotions, even when the moral sense of students and research participants deviates from the expectations of instructors and scholars. Our review of research on cheating yields the following diagnosis of morality:</p><p>(1) Moral judgments rest on perceptions about facts, and those perceptions can be accurate or inaccurate.</p><p>(2) Moral judgments often incorporate competing concerns; which concerns we prioritize and which we violate can vary, situationally and developmentally.</p><p>(3) Moral judgments guide, but do not fully determine, our actions: We are motivated to do what we deem good and right, and avoid what we deem bad and wrong, but those are not our sole motives.</p><p>(4) The "gap" between moral judgments and actions is far narrower than many have assumed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>is because people's factual beliefs, coordination of evaluative principles, and incorporation of evaluative judgments into actions change both situationally and developmentally. Across situations and developmental periods, a person may change their beliefs about which actions are harmful, change what kinds of harm they deem acceptable, and change how they weigh their moral judgment against other motives when they decide what to do. These three insights provide the foundation for our moral-developmental framework for studying and explaining when and why people cheat.

What unites the Stable Predictors Framework is the attempt to predict individual differences, averaged across time. The guiding assumption is simply that an individual's tendency to be dishonest or</figDesc><table><row><cell>honest, cheat or not cheat, is somewhat stable: some individuals will lie or cheat more than</cell></row><row><cell>others.

The Stable Predictors Framework, by definition, does not seek to explain within-person variability. The Moral Disengagement Framework attributes within-person variability in cheating to self-serving ways of condoning one's own transgression. Hence, the Moral Disengagement Framework does not incorporate how people's genuine judgments about cheating also vary across situations, whether they are judging their own behavior or someone else's. The limitations of the Stable Predictors and the Moral Disengagement approaches have spurred us toward another framework.
