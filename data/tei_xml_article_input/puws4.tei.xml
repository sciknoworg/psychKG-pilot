			<abstract>
				<p>Anhedonia, a core symptom of mood disorders such as depression, is marked by diminished pleasure and motivation for rewards. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, like the 4-arm bandit (4AB), show limited sensitivity to reward-processing impairments associated with anhedonia. Here, we developed and validated a modified 3-arm bandit (3AB) task designed to reduce cognitive load while retaining sensitivity to reward and punishment learning. Following this validation, 1,000 participants were pre-screened with the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD), and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZUNG). Participants scoring above 2 on SHAPS and below 45 on DARS were classified as anhedonic, while those scoring 0 on SHAPS and above 55 on DARS were classified as non-anhedonic, resulting in 111 anhedonic and 95 non-anhedonic individuals who completed the 3AB task. Modelling results revealed no significant group differences in reward learning rate (p = 0.23), punishment learning rate (p = 0.37), reward sensitivity (p = 0.28), or punishment sensitivity (p = 0.46). Additional assessments of win-stay/lose-shift strategies and reaction times also showed no significant differences. Bayes Factor t-tests provided moderate-to-strong evidence for the null hypothesis, with BF01 values of 3.36, 5.14, 4.97, and 5.96 for each of the above parameters, respectively. These findings indicate either that anhedonia does not impair reward and punishment learning or that the 3AB task lacks the sensitivity to detect such differences. By simplifying the task structure while maintaining core learning mechanisms, the 3AB task provides a novel approach for studying reward processing, challenging the notion that anhedonia impairs reward sensitivity and indicating that this learning mechanism may remain intact.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Anhedonia, classically defined as the diminished ability to experience pleasure, has long been recognized as a central feature of various psychiatric disorders. Initially viewed as a deficit solely in experiencing pleasure, research in recent decades suggests that anhedonia also involves a reduced motivation to pursue rewarding activities. This broader understanding links anhedonia with amotivational syndromes, such as apathy, in which impairment in reward anticipation and pursuit are key features <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Husain and Roiser, 2018)</ref>. Anhedonia can affect multiple domains, including social, sensory, recreational, and nutritional interests, each of which may function independently. This complexity presents challenges in both diagnosis and treatment, as it implicates not only the experience of pleasure but also the drive to seek out and engage in rewarding behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Treadway and Zald, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Anhedonia is a core symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) and is listed as a cardinal diagnostic criterion in the <ref type="bibr">DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013)</ref>. It is also included as a symptom across a range of psychiatric diagnoses, including schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use disorders. Beyond its role as a symptom, anhedonia is a strong predictor of future depressive episodes, highlighting its importance in early intervention and treatment.</p><p>To assess anhedonia, validated tools such as the <ref type="bibr">Snaith-Hamilton</ref> Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) and the Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS) are commonly used. SHAPS, one of the most widely employed scales, focuses on measuring overall hedonic capacity across various pleasurable activities, providing a simple self-report measure of an individual's ability to experience pleasure in everyday life <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Snaith et al., 1995)</ref>. DARS <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Rizvi et al., 2016</ref>) is a more recent tool, designed to provide a more granular and domain-specific assessment of anhedonia, allowing for the evaluation of hedonic capacity across four distinct areas: social interaction, physical sensations, hobbies, and food/drink. Despite the increasing use of DARS in research, most reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr">(RL)</ref> tasks designed to assess reward sensitivity and motivational impairment have historically been correlated only with SHAPS, missing the more nuanced picture that DARS provides. This study marks the first time the 3-arm bandit task has been correlated with DARS, offering an opportunity to assess both general and domain-specific anhedonia in relation to task performance.</p><p>RL tasks have gained significant traction in psychiatric research due to their ability to model and quantify reward-based decision-making and learning processes. These tasks provide a quantifiable measure of how individuals learn from rewards and punishments, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying motivation and cognitive impairments in disorders such as depression and anhedonia <ref type="bibr">(Sutton and Barto, 2018)</ref>. Unlike subjective self-report measures, RL tasks objectively assess the ability to learn from feedback, which is central to understanding reward sensitivity and motivational deficits. These tasks, such as the 4-arm bandit task, allow researchers to assess critical parameters like learning rates and reward sensitivity, offering a deeper understanding of reward processing impairments. However, despite their utility, traditional RL tasks have struggled to detect subtle rewardprocessing impairments in individuals with anhedonia. The difficulty arises because anhedonia often involves intact learning mechanisms but reduced motivation to act on learned information <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Treadway et al., 2009)</ref>. As a result, there is a growing need to develop more anhedonia-specific tasks that capture the motivational aspects of reward learning, as current RL paradigms tend to overlook these factors.</p><p>In parallel with the development of more sensitive tasks, hierarchical Bayesian modelling has gained prominence in computational psychiatry due to its ability to estimate both individual-level and group-level parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahn, Haines and Zhang, 2017)</ref>. Bayesian models are particularly well-suited to psychiatric research, where individual differences in symptomatology and cognitive performance are significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Gershman, 2015)</ref>. By pooling data across participants, hierarchical models provide more precise estimates of latent cognitive variables, such as learning rates and reward sensitivity, while accounting for variability across populations. This approach is ideal for studying heterogeneous symptoms like anhedonia, where motivational impairments can differ substantially between individuals. The ability to quantify both individual and group-level parameters makes hierarchical Bayesian analysis especially useful for identifying cognitive profiles that can inform tailored interventions.</p><p>In this study, we assessed the association between anhedonia scores and RL performance. A 3-arm bandit task was specifically designed to reduce cognitive load and potentially increase task sensitivity to anhedoniarelated impairments by simplifying the decision-making process. By applying hierarchical Bayesian analysis, we estimated individual differences in reward learning and sensitivity and explored whether these differences aligned with scores from both the SHAPS and DARS questionnaires. Based on the hypothesis that impairment in RL mechanisms drives anhedonia, we hypothesised that higher anhedonia scores, as measured by SHAPS and DARS, would be associated with reduced reward sensitivity and impaired learning rates in the 3-arm bandit task. Furthermore, we expected that DARS, due to its domainspecific granularity, would provide a more nuanced relationship between RL parameters and anhedonia compared to SHAPS, capturing subtle impairments in reward processing across distinct domains.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Task Overview and Validation</head><p>The 3-arm bandit (3AB) task ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref>) was designed as a simplified and modified version of the traditional 4-arm bandit (4AB) task <ref type="bibr">(Daw et al., 2006)</ref>. The 4AB task, while effective in modelling reward and punishment learning, entails a higher cognitive load due to the requirement to maintain reward and punishment probabilities associated with four stimuli over time. By reducing the number of choices from four to three, participants have to track only three sets of reward and punishment probabilities instead of four, simplifying the learning process while preserving reinforcement learning mechanisms. Additionally, the probabilities of encountering both reward and punishment were increased by a factor of 1.5 compared to the 4AB task (in which the probability fluctuated between 0 and 0.5), with the intention of creating a more engaging experience that would better highlight individual differences in learning behaviour. This structure is intended to simplify the decisionmaking process while maintaining sensitivity to learning impairments, particularly those related to anhedonia. Any arm selection can result in one of the four possible outcomes i.e. nothing, win token (green only), loss token (red only), or both. The task was designed to reduce cognitive load compared to the traditional 4-arm bandit task by limiting the number of choices and increasing the probability of both reward and punishment outcomes across trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome probabilities of win and loss events showing in (c).</head><p>A total of 111 participants (mean age = 40, SD = 12, 50% female) completed the initial validation study, which compared the 3AB and 4AB tasks. The results revealed significant positive correlations between key parameters derived from both tasks ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). Specifically, the reward learning rate (Arew, r = 0.49), punishment learning rate (Apun, r = c) Outcome probabilities b) Possible outcomes a) Trial timeline 0.46), reward sensitivity (R, r = 0.52), and punishment sensitivity (P, r = 0.61) exhibited clear positive correlations between the two tasks. This suggests that the core learning mechanisms measured by the 4AB task are preserved in the 3AB task, despite its simplifications. Therefore, the 3AB task is a valid alternative for studying reward and punishment learning in relation to psychiatric conditions like anhedonia, where cognitive load may influence task performance. Scatter plots illustrating the correlations between corresponding model parameters from the old 4AB task and the new 3AB task, using data from 111 subjects. Each subplot displays the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), assessing the consistency of individual performance across reward learning rate (Arew), punishment learning rate (Apun), reward sensitivity (R), and punishment sensitivity (P). These plots aim to evaluate the validity of the new 3AB task by demonstrating whether similar patterns of behavior are observed across both tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Prescreening Results</head><p>Following the validation of the 3AB task, 1000 participants (mean age = 38, SD = 11, female = 54%) were pre-screened using a combination of the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), the Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD), and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZUNG). These mood questionnaires provided a multi-faceted view of participants' emotional and cognitive states, allowing us to distinguish between individuals with high and low hedonic capacity. confirming that both scales effectively measure anhedonia, albeit in opposite directions (with higher scores on the SHAPS reflecting higher anhedonia and higher scores on the DARS reflecting lower anhedonia). DARS vs. GAD showed a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.39), indicating that higher anxiety levels were associated with greater anhedonia. This aligns with previous research suggesting that anxiety can contribute to emotional blunting, thereby reducing pleasure and motivation. DARS vs. ZUNG showed a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.34), suggesting that, surprisingly, higher depression scores are associated with lower anhedonia on the DARS scale. GAD vs. SHAPS showed a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.51), indicating that individuals with higher anxiety also reported greater anhedonia, highlighting the frequent co-occurrence of these symptoms in mood and anxiety disorders. SHAPS vs. ZUNG exhibited a weak negative correlation (r = -0.18), again suggesting that depression and anhedonia are quite separable. GAD vs. ZUNG showed no significant correlation (r = -0.01), which is surprising given the frequent overlap between anxiety and depression. This result suggests that in this sample, these two symptoms may manifest more independently. non-anhedonic if SHAPS = 0 and DARS &gt; 55) then performed the 3AB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Model-Based Analysis of Learning Rates and Sensitivity</head><p>To investigate how anhedonia affects learning from rewards and punishments, we applied hierarchical Bayesian modelling to the data from the 3AB task, estimating individual learning rates and sensitivity to rewards and punishments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Comparison of Learning Rates and Sensitivities Across Anhedonic and Non-Anhedonic Groups</head><p>The anhedonic group exhibited numerically higher learning rates for reward (Arew: M = 0.48, SD = 0.18) but slightly lower learning rates for punishment (Apun: M = 0.34, SD = 0.14) compared to the non-anhedonic group (Arew: M = 0.45, SD = 0.20; Apun: M = 0.36, SD = 0.16).</p><p>However, these differences were not statistically significant for reward (t = 1.19, p = 0.24) or punishment learning rates (t = -0.72, p = 0.48).</p><p>Similarly, while the anhedonic group displayed numerically greater sensitivity to both rewards (R: M = 5.89, SD = 3.13) and punishments (P: M = 4.07, SD = 2.48) compared to the non-anhedonic group (R: M = 5.53, SD = 3.45; P: M = 3.90, SD = 3.02), these differences were also not statistically significant (reward sensitivity: t = 0.77, p = 0.44; punishment sensitivity: t = 0.45, p = 0.65). Overall, the findings suggest comparable learning rates and sensitivity to rewards and punishments between the two groups, suggesting that reinforcement learning may not be impaired in anhedonia. For each model parameter, Bayesian t-tests indicated moderate-to-strong evidence in favour of the null hypothesis (BF01), suggesting no meaningful differences between the anhedonic and non-anhedonic groups. Specifically, the BF01 values were 3.36 for Reward Learning Rate, 5.14 for Punishment Learning Rate, 4.97 for Reward Sensitivity, and 5.96 for Punishment Sensitivity. These results <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref> provide quantitative support for the null hypothesis, reinforcing the interpretation of no significant group differences in these parameters. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Win-Stay and Lose-Shift Strategy Analysis</head><p>In addition to learning rates, we also examined decision-making strategies using the model-agnostic "win-stay" and "lose-shift" metrics.</p><p>The win-stay strategy refers to repeating a choice after receiving a reward, while lose-shift involves changing the choice after a punishment.</p><p>These strategies provide insights into how individuals adjust their behaviour based on very recent outcomes.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>). For the win-stay strategy, the Bayes Factor (BF01) was 2.68, indicating moderate evidence in support of the null hypothesis. Similarly, for the lose-shift strategy, the BF01 was 5.60</p><p>suggesting strong evidence in favour of the null. These Bayesian results strengthen the conclusion that there are no meaningful differences in winstay or lose-shift strategies between anhedonic and non-anhedonic groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Predicted Action Probabilities and Actual Choices</head><p>We compared the model's predicted action probabilities to the subjects' actual choices on a trial-by-trial basis.   Although correlation values are presented, these should be interpreted with caution due to the extreme groups design, which limits variability in one group and affects the generalizability of linear relationships. The figure primarily highlights that there is no strong link between subjective anhedonia group status and performance-based measures of reward and punishment processing.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref>, comparisons between the anhedonic and nonanhedonic groups reveal no significant differences in Reward Learning</p><p>Rate and Punishment Learning Rate.

These findings reinforce the absence of strong or significant relationships between specific facets of anhedonia and computational parameters.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Summary of Key Results</head><p>The current study found no significant differences between anhedonic and non-anhedonic groups relating to any of the computational parameters assessed. Effect sizes for these comparisons were small (ranging from d = 0.06-0.16), supporting the interpretation of no meaningful group-level distinctions. Additionally, model-agnostic analyses of win-stay and loseshift strategies showed no significant group differences, and the same was the case for reaction times. Bayes Factor analyses further provided moderate-to-strong support for the null hypothesis for each parameter in the group comparisons. These results suggest that, in contrast to our hypothesis, cognitive learning processes related to reward and punishment appear largely similar across levels of anhedonia. Beyond meta-analyses, individual studies provide further context. Harle et al. (2017) found that higher anhedonia was associated with reduced reward sensitivity in a 2-arm bandit task, particularly among participants relying on a softmax decision policy. However, their study also showed that learning rates remained intact, which agrees with our findings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Participants</head><p>We recruited participants from Prolific (www.prolific.co To recruit 100 participants in the anhedonic range and 100 in the nonanhedonic range, we pre-screened a total of 1,000 participants. We classified participants as anhedonic if they scored &gt;2 on the SHAPS and ≤45 on the DARS. This DARS threshold was determined based on 1 standard deviation (SD) below the mean, as reported in the original DARS validation study <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Rizvi et al., 2015)</ref>. Conversely, participants were classified as non-anhedonic if they scored 0 on the SHAPS and &gt;55 on the DARS, indicating a higher hedonic capacity. This pre-screening aimed to ensure a clear distinction between anhedonic and non-anhedonic groups for the study.</p><p>In a prior validation study, we tested the 3AB task against the 4AB task with 100 participants in each group. From these groups, only 15 participants scored within the anhedonic range based on a SHAPS cut-off score of &gt; 2 and a DARS cut-off score of ≤45. Given this low proportion of anhedonic participants in the general population, we pre-screened a larger sample of 1,000 participants to ensure we reached our target of completed the initial pre-screening phase (mean age = 38, SD = 11, 54% female), and 206 participants who met the anhedonic and non-anhedonic cutoffs were selected to complete the final study (mean age = 39, SD = 11, 61% female). Of these, 111 participants were classified as anhedonic and 95 as non-anhedonic (Demographic information breakdown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table   3</ref>).  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">-7)</ref>, and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZUNG), to assess anhedonia and other related symptoms.</p><p>The SHAPS cut-off score of &gt;2 was used to define anhedonia, as this is a recognized clinical threshold indicating significant deficits in hedonic capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Snaith et al., 1995)</ref>. For the DARS, participants who scored ≤45</p><p>were classified as anhedonic.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">The 3-armed bandit reinforcement learning task</head><p>We developed a 3AB task, a modified version of the original 3AB task, in which participants learned to simultaneously pursue rewards and avoid punishments. On each trial participants had 3 seconds to choose one of three options, shown as distinct visual stimuli, using the W/A/S keys on their keyboard. The chosen option was highlighted by red dotted border, and participants were presented with the outcome for that trial for 1.5s.</p><p>This could be one of 1) no outcome (two grey circles, 2) win token (one green and one grey circle), 3) loss token (one red and grey circle), or 4) both (one green and one red circle). We encouraged participants to collect as many green tokens as possible by informing them that they could earn a bonus payment based on the number of tokens earned during the task.</p><p>If no choice was made after 3s, the text 'You need to respond in time!'</p><p>was shown for 1.5s and the trial was skipped. Participants completed 200 trials which took 15-20 mins on average across the groups. Each arm was associated with separate probabilities of producing the reward/loss tokens <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1)</ref>, and these probabilities fluctuated randomly over trials. All three arms could deliver both reward and loss tokens. We made several modifications to the original 4AB behavioural task. First, we reduced the number of arms from four to three, with the aim of reducing exploration heuristics and cognitive load due to fewer options. Second, we increased the probability of both win and loss outcomes by 1.5 times to promote greater task engagement: in the original task, rewards or punishments were relatively infrequent. Third, we ensured uniformity in the outcome stimulus format by using two circles for all outcomes (either grey (absence of outcome), green (win) or red (loss). This modification aimed to eliminate any potential bias that may have been introduced by varying formats across trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Task Validation with original 4-arm Bandit Task</head><p>To validate whether the 3AB task captures the same learning mechanisms as the 4AB task, a pilot study was conducted with 111 participants completing both tasks in random order. The use of randomization ensured that there was no learning bias from one task to the other. Hierarchical Bayesian modelling was applied to both tasks to estimate key parameters related to learning rates and sensitivity to rewards and punishments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Data cleaning</head><p>As the task was implemented online where we could not ensure the same testing standards as we could in-person, we used 2 exclusion criteria to improve data quality. We excluded those who responded with the same response key on 20 or more consecutive trials (&gt; 10% of all trials).</p><p>Additionally, we also excluded those who did not respond on 20 or more trials out of the total 200 trials.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.2">Model Specification</head><p>We applied a hierarchical Bayesian model inspired by Seymour et al. Model fit was assessed via log-likelihood of observed choices, with posterior predictive checks to confirm that the model reproduced observed choice behaviour. Convergence diagnostics, such as the Gelman-Rubin statistic, verified adequate parameter convergence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.4">Simulated Data</head><p>To validate model parameters, we simulated 200 trials per subject in a 3armed bandit structure. Choices were generated based on each participant's estimated parameters (Arew, Apun, R, P), using the softmax function to determine probabilities of selecting each option. Outcomes were sampled based on predefined reward and punishment probabilities, and Q-values were updated accordingly. For unchosen options, Q-values were updated using counterfactual updates, where no reward or punishment (i.e., an outcome of zero) was assumed.

This suggests that selfreported anhedonia and task-based computational parameters may assess distinct facets of reward and punishment processing or that the influence of anhedonia on these parameters is minimal. Further investigations with larger samples and alternative designs may help clarify these relationships.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_11"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Anhedonia and Cognitive Learning Our findings suggest that individuals with anhedonia are not fundamentally impaired in their ability to learn from rewards and punishments, as they performed comparably to non-anhedonic individuals on reinforcement learning tasks. This result challenges the straightforward hypothesis that anhedonia is directly caused by disruptions in reinforcement learning processes. However, an alternative explanation is that the 3AB task-and by extension, other simple RL paradigms-may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect subtle impairments in reward processing associated with anhedonia. Instead, it indicates that while the core cognitive mechanisms for reinforcement learning remain intact, the deficits associated with anhedonia may stem from how reward-and punishment-related signals are experienced, valued, or integrated into behaviour. This perspective refines our understanding of anhedonia, suggesting that its origins may lie in impairments in the emotional or motivational aspects of reinforcement learning rather than a breakdown of the cognitive learning mechanisms themselves. These findings underscore the importance of distinguishing between the computational processes that underlie learning and the affective processes that shape the subjective experience of reward and punishment. Future research should investigate how disruptions in these interactions contribute to anhedonia, using multi-modal approaches to bridge the gap between behavioural performance and the underlying emotional and neurobiological mechanisms. 3.3 Contextualizing Findings Within Existing Literature Reinforcement learning paradigms have been central in research into reward processing abnormalities in psychiatric conditions, such as depression and anhedonia. Unlike static reward tasks, such as the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT), which emphasize reward bias, in dynamic bandit paradigms there is a need for continuous adaptation to changing contingencies. The present findings suggest that core reinforcement learning mechanisms are preserved in anhedonia and, as such, argue against a broad impairment in reward and punishment learning in anhedonia. Specifically, meta-analyses of reward processing in depression and mood disorders have indicated that deficits are replicable and include both reward and punishment learning deficits (Pike &amp; Robinson, 2022; Halahakoon et al., 2020). In this regard, Halahakoon et al. (2020) have estimated that depression was associated with small to medium impairments in reinforcement learning with SMDs of 0.352, option valuation with SMDs of 0.309, and the greatest impairment in reward bias, with an SMD of 0.644. Meanwhile, Pike &amp; Robinson (2022) investigated only computationalreinforcement learning models and found that for SMD = 0.107, punishment learning was higher, while the reward learning rates were somewhat lower at SMD = -0.021 among individuals with mood and anxiety disorders. However, the results also indicated significant heterogeneity among studies, which may suggest that the size of the effects could be influenced by task design, parameter estimation, and disorder severity.These meta-analyses encompass reinforcement learning tasks across probabilistic choice paradigms and bandit tasks, among others, but are not confined to measures of reward bias alone, such as the PRT. Our findings extend these observations by showing intact learning mechanisms in anhedonia even in the context of a dynamic decisionmaking task. This suggests that anhedonia-related impairments may be more pronounced in tasks requiring effort-based decision-making or explicit reward valuation rather than trial-by-trial reinforcement learning efficiency.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_12"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Contrary to traditional models suggesting impaired reward sensitivity, our findings indicate that the core cognitive mechanisms underlying reward and punishment learning remain intact in individuals with anhedonia. Bayesian analysis provided strong support for the null hypothesis (BF01 = 3.36-5.96), with no significant group differences in learning rates, reward sensitivity, or reaction times. These results suggest that the impairments associated with anhedonia may not arise from fundamental disruptions in reinforcement learning but could reflect impairments in how rewardrelated information is valued or integrated. The disconnect between self-reported anhedonia and computational parameters raises important questions about the relationship between subjective experiences and behavioural performance. This highlights the need for future research to explore how emotional and motivational processes interact with reinforcement learning mechanisms to contribute to anhedonia. Integrating multi-modal approaches, such as neuroimaging and biomarkers, could provide deeper insights into the mechanisms driving anhedonia and inform the development of targeted interventions for mood disorders.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_13"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>participants.Each self-report mood questionnaire included an attention check item to identify and exclude inattentive responders. These items were chosen to be logically improbable statements, making inattentive responses easily detectable without directly signalling the check. The attention checks were as follows:1. GAD-7: "Have there been times in your life where you blinked your eyes at least once per day?" 2. SHAPS: "Have there been times of a couple of days or more when you were able to breathe underwater (without an oxygen tank)?"3. ZUNG: "I have never used a computer." 4. DARS: No attention check was included, as participants provided subjective responses across multiple items, ensuring engagement. Findings from Zorowitz et al. (2023) underscore the importance of attention checks in symptom surveys, as inattentive responses can artificially inflate correlations between self-reported symptoms and cognitive measures. In our study, any participant failing even one attention check was excluded to ensure robust data quality. This rigorous approach reduces the risk of spurious findings and enhances the reliability of observed relationships between symptom measures and task performance, providing a clearer view of the psychological profiles of anhedonic and non-anhedonic participants.</figDesc></figure>

This criterion assesses the predictive accuracy of each model by estimating how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. A lower LOOIC score indicates better predictive performance.We opted to present relative LOOIC values for easier interpretation. By subtracting the lowest LOOIC value from all other models, we could more clearly see how much worse each model performed compared to the bestperforming one. The model with a relative LOOIC value of zero is the best, and the remaining models' performances are expressed relative to that baseline.As shown inFigure 9, the relative LOOIC values of the models are visualized to provide a straightforward comparison. Based on this comparison, we selected the Learning from Reward/Punishment, Sensitivity model as the best model for our analysis. Its flexibility in learning from both positive and negative outcomes makes it a strong fit for capturing participant behaviour in the task. The "Best Model" is highlighted in the figure for clarity.</figDesc></figure>

This distinction underlines the importance of task design, as some psychiatric populations may show heightened punishment learning, while anhedonia is perhaps better characterized by impairments in reward valuation. Notably, this is the first study to use both the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) and the Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS) alongside a reinforcement learning task. The inclusion of both scales allowed for a more comprehensive exploration of anhedonia, Future studies should recruit larger sample sizes to improve sensitivity to small effects and refine task designs to explore subtle group differences in reward and punishment processing.Additionally, the use of an online sample from Prolific, where mental health conditions may be overrepresented, presents both strengths and limitations. Prolific enables access to diverse samples, but the symptom severity in these populations may differ from clinical settings, where anhedonia is often more pronounced. Although we employed a cut-off of 3 on the SHAPS, as recommended to detect clinically significant anhedonia, the self-selected nature of online participants might introduce biases that differ from those in clinical populations. Future research should replicate this work in clinical populations to ensure generalizability and include neurobiological measures, such as neuroimaging or biomarkers, to further</figDesc><table><row><cell>Halahakoon et al. (2020) and Kieslich et al. (2022) stressed the importance of distinguishing cognitive, emotional, and motivational components of reinforcement learning. Our findings support this perspective: belief updating and reinforcement-based learning mechanisms appear intact in anhedonia, but altered motivation and subjective reward valuation may still influence behaviour. According to Kieslich et al. (2022), impairments in reward processing associated with anhedonia may be more strongly linked to reduced reward valuation and anticipation, and less consistently linked to impairments in reinforcement learning efficiency. This could explain why tasks focused on reinforcement learning, but not reward anticipation or valuation, might not capture expected group differences. In showing that anhedonic individuals do not exhibit learning deficits on this task, our findings indicate that basic reinforcement learning capabilities are intact. Instead, motivational and affective reward processing dimensions might be more central to an understanding of the impact of anhedonia on decision-making. 3.4 Contributions to Computational Psychiatry This study contributes to computational psychiatry by validating a 3AB task against the traditional 4AB, demonstrating its utility in capturing key reward and punishment learning mechanisms while reducing cognitive load. encompassing not only general hedonic capacity but also domain-specific aspects of reward engagement across daily activities. Exploratory correlations between DARS subscales and computational model parameters provided initial insights into these domain-specific dimensions, although no associations survived correction for multiple comparisons. The task's high parameter recovery, along with consistent results from hierarchical Bayesian modelling, supports its application in research focused on populations where cognitive load might impact performance, such as clinical settings. 3.5 Limitations and Future Directions A sensitivity power analysis revealed that our study was adequately powered (80%) to detect medium-sized effects (d ≥ 0.39) but underpowered to reliably detect smaller effects. This indicates that while the study was well-suited to identify moderate group differences, it may have missed more subtle variations in reinforcement learning processes associated with anhedonia. Consequently, the absence of significant findings should be interpreted with caution, as smaller effects might not approaches could enhance our understanding of how anhedonia influences reward processing and decision-making across diverse contexts, ultimately informing the development of targeted interventions for mood have been captured. elucidate the mechanisms underlying reward learning in anhedonia.
