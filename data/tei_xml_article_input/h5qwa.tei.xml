<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The public significance statements</head><p>This research underscores the intricate nature of how people make decisions when they need to cross a road while a vehicle is approaching. A novel computational model has been put forth to better grasp the thought processes and brain functions involved in such decisions. This discovery holds great significance, as pedestrians represent one of the most at-risk groups on the road, and accidents involving pedestrians crossing streets are a leading cause of injuries and fatalities. Understanding how our brains work when we make these choices can ultimately help us improve road safety for everyone, whether you're an expert in the field or someone interested in staying safe while walking on the streets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deciphering the Cognitive Complexity of Road Crossing Decisions: A Novel Model Integrating</head><p>Time-Varying Drift Rates, Signal Suppression, and Utility Maximization Inhibition control is a fundamental cognitive process underpinning numerous facets of human decision-making. From the restraint observed in the stop-signal paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Logan, 1994)</ref> to identifying targets amidst distractors in the flanker paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Eriksen &amp; Eriksen, 1974)</ref>, as well as suppressing the intention to cross a road when faced with imminent collision risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kwon et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Schiff &amp; Oldak, 1990)</ref>, inhibition control plays a central role in decision-making.</p><p>This paper studies road-crossing decisions to shed light on the underlying cognitive mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a novel decision-diffusion model incorporating dynamic drift rates, signal suppression, and utility maximization <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lin et al., 2022)</ref>. Our primary objective is to investigate the hypothesis that signal suppression contributes significantly to the decisionmaking process when faced with the challenge of road crossing, emphasizing one crucial factor: a vehicle's time-to-arrival (TTA). We also examine this model's predictions through the analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs), particularly the centro-parietal potential (CPP), which has been associated with the decision variable in the classic decision-diffusion model (DDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Twomey et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prior Research and Theories</head><p>Prior studies on crossing decisions predominantly originate from naturalistic and seminaturalistic contexts, often failing to observe the unobservable cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bella &amp; Nobili, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chu et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gorrini et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Liu &amp; Tung, 2014)</ref>. These studies have mainly focused on the influence of external factors such as pedestrian trajectories, walking speeds, and environmental conditions, with limited exploration of the underlying cognitive constructs.</p><p>One prevalent theory applied to bridge this gap is Situational Awareness (SA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Endsley, 1995)</ref>, which draws on established theories like prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref> and cognitive dissonance theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Festinger, 1957)</ref> to explain crossing decisions as dynamic processes influenced by perceived environmental risk, available cognitive resources, and individual risk preferences. Despite the wealth of ideas proposed within the SA framework, empirical research has lagged, leaving untested hypotheses regarding the cognitive processes involved in crossing decisions, particularly when paired with formal cognitive modeling and ERP data.</p><p>Building upon the work of our colleagues who incorporated external influences into a detailed quantitative model <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Pekkanen et al., 2021)</ref>, we extend this line of inquiry. Our primary focus is understanding the relationship between one crucial external influence, an approaching vehicle's TTA, and the hidden psychological processes underlying the decision-making. A key distinction lies in our approach as we capitalize on a formal likelihood function solved within our newly developed cognitive model <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lin et al., 2022)</ref>. Specifically, we posited three core hypotheses:</p><p>1. A time-varying process of utility evolution is the input of the drift rate.</p><p>2. When undisturbed, the utility evolves to maximize and is the input for the decision variable.</p><p>3. The maximization process interacts with the signal suppression influenced by the external TTA factor.</p><p>In the road-crossing task, the suppression was due to the collision concern about the oncoming car. We assumed the suppression signal resulted from the top-down concern for one's safety and the bottom-up perceptual dynamics of the oncoming vehicle. We linked the utility function to the TTA so that the external element becomes an input that affects the model, and from there, we inferred what might happen in the unobservable decision variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship Between the Classic and the Road-crossing Tasks</head><p>To study road-crossing decisions, we draw parallels with three classic paradigms: the stop-signal task, the flanker task, and the two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task. However, adapting these classic paradigms to the complex real-world scenario of road crossing requires addressing critical differences. For instance, while the road-crossing task shares similarities with the stop-signal task in halting a planned action, the nature of the no-go signal varies significantly.</p><p>In the stop-signal task, a static and often unpredictable cue is employed, whereas, in road crossing, the no-go cue arises from the evolving collision threat.</p><p>Similarly, the road-crossing task resonates with the flanker task due to the continuous influence of a signal suppressor directing choices toward a no-go direction. However, this analogy simplifies the perception of an approaching vehicle to a series of discrete images, overlooking the fluidity of real-world visual information. Additionally, a comparison with the 2AFC paradigm is possible, viewing the oncoming vehicle as a source of continuous perceptual input. Still, this framing lacks the dynamic aspects of TTA assessment and top-down collision risk evaluation that characterize road-crossing decisions.</p><p>Given these challenges, we introduce a novel quantitative model incorporating essential features from the three classic paradigms, allowing us to better account for the complexities of road-crossing decisions. Our motivation arises from the necessity to bridge the gap between these classic paradigms and the nuanced real-world road-crossing task. While the classic paradigms and their computational models <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Logan, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">White et al., 2011)</ref> have provided invaluable insights, they require significant simplifications and often present conflicting assumptions when applied to road-crossing decisions.</p><p>Further, we examine how we might associate the crossing decision with the CPP component <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Twomey et al., 2015)</ref>, a presumptive brain signature for the decision variable. This experiment tested our hypothesis about different signal suppression processes in the division of the crossing decision: the pre-vehicle and post-vehicle choices and the safe and unsafe outcomes.</p><p>In the discussion, we addressed the current model's limitations and future directions of model development that optimize this approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Objectives</head><p>Two overarching objectives guide this study. Firstly, we seek to develop a new computational model that rigorously tests the viability of three core hypotheses: (1) the presence of a time-varying utility evolution, (2) the centrality of utility maximization in decision formation, and (3) the interaction between utility maximization and signal suppression, influenced by the TTA.</p><p>To achieve these objectives, we employ an extensive approach consisting of four subobjectives. We begin by investigating the role of the utility function as a driving force for the dynamic drift rate, a novel extension of existing models <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Roe et al., 2001)</ref>. We examine how visual looming, safety pressure and their interplay quantitatively affect road crossing decisions.</p><p>Furthermore, we introduce hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) to analyze data at individual and group levels, enabling a more nuanced understanding of individual differences and group-level patterns in road-crossing decisions. Finally, we explore whether the parameters within the utility function fulfil their intended functions and evaluate how TTA influences roadcrossing decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TTA, Crossing Decisions, and the Decision Variable</head><p>The TTA or collision time has been studied in the context of drivers' braking decisions based on visual perception and time estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lee, 1976)</ref>. Early research led to the tau hypothesis, which posited that TTA could be precisely determined by the ratio of an object's image size to the rate of size change on the retina. However, the tau hypothesis has limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Tresilian, 1999)</ref>, particularly when faced with dynamic scenarios such as object acceleration or irregular object shapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Schiff &amp; Detwiler, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Vagnoni et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>A more contemporary perspective views TTA estimation as an interactive process between an agent and its environment, influenced by physical and informational control laws <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Warren, 2006)</ref>. This view aligns with SA theory, which posits that traffic decisions are shaped by considerations of perceived environmental risk, cognitive resource availability, and individual risk preferences.</p><p>Our study adopts this contemporary perspective, assuming that signal suppression is correlated with safety concerns. We illustrate the connection between TTA, the utility function, the drift rate, and the decision variable in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, underscoring how TTA influences the decision-making process by affecting the growth and decline of the time-varying drift rate.</p><p>Firstly, we quantitatively depict the correlation between signal suppression and people's safety concerns <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 1a</ref> describes how the TTA correlates with the unobservable utility function <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b)</ref>, which, when undisturbed, is a maximization process. The maximized utility corresponds to the constant drift rate in the classic DDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Then, we linked the utility function to the drift rate ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1c)</ref>. We extended the constant drift rate to a series of changing rates. <ref type="figure">Figure 1c</ref> shows a trend of decreasing rates before the car arrived at the crossing zone and returned to a constant value afterwards. The safety concern depended on the TTA, suppressed the utility <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b)</ref>, and resulted in the maximized utility being less than its ideal undisturbed state. For example, the utility dropped to negative infinity when the car was physically at the crossing zone. Lastly, <ref type="figure">Figure 1d</ref> depicted how the changing rate transitioned to the decision variable, resulting in a crossing decision. Therefore, whether a crossing action happens in front of the vehicle or after it passes depends on the decision variable <ref type="figure">(Figure 1d</ref>), the individual's preference for risky behavior, and the noise level of evidence accumulation. Next, we used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to link the individual data to the group-level data. In Modeling the TTA section, we described the mathematical equation underpinning the connection between the four figures. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Association Between the Vehicle's Arrival Time and the Utility Function.</head><p>Note. ti = times to arrival (i represent the discreate steps); the utility = Ui; the drift rate = μ; and the decision variable = Xi. The lighter-shaded area shows the time the pedestrian needs to walk to safety.</p><p>The darker-shaded area is when a vehicle is physically at the crossing zone. The utility was truncated when its value was negative infinity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New Features in Road-Crossing Decisions</head><p>Our road-crossing task introduces several novel features, setting it apart from the traditional 2AFC paradigm. Firstly, it incorporates continuous changes in visual information, replicating real-world scenarios where impending threats like oncoming vehicles continuously evolve. This continuous information change differs from the discrete changes often employed in previous studies, adding a layer of complexity to TTA judgments. Secondly, our task introduces time pressure as a critical factor. Unlike classic 2AFC tasks, where time limits are static, our road-crossing task gradually reduces the available response time as the vehicle approaches. This dynamic time pressure is not explored in previous time-varying models for 2AFC tasks.</p><p>Another novel feature is the emergence of a bimodal response time (RT) distribution.</p><p>This bimodality, while observed in tasks like the feature-switch paradigm, where the stimulus changed partway through a trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Holmes et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lin et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Trueblood et al., 2021)</ref>, presents a unique challenge in the context of road crossing. Responses are divided into prevehicle and post-vehicle decisions, and these two response types exhibit continuous correlations.</p><p>Lastly, our road-crossing task yields fast and slow responses, a characteristic not typically observed in 2AFC tasks. While slow responses are often attributed to attention lapses and discarded in analyses, our study suggests that slow responses in road crossing may result from a multi-step decision process. This process involves the decision to cross and the possibility of halting before the vehicle passes. This multi-step decision-making aspect, while explored in group influence on decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Tump et al., 2020)</ref>, has yet to be extensively studied in the context of road-crossing decisions.</p><p>In summary, these four novel features present a compelling case for developing a new model tailored to the intricacies of road crossing decisions. Our paper introduces this innovative computational model with a likelihood solution, providing a valuable addition to the current understanding of decision-making processes in complex real-world scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling the TTA</head><p>The DDM has shown promise in explaining steering decisions in one-choice and twochoice driving tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Ratcliff, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Ratcliff &amp; Strayer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Vanunu &amp; Ratcliff, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>However, the existing applications of DDM primarily focus on one-stimulus, 2AFC paradigms.</p><p>Recent studies have hinted at extending DDM to account for driver-turning decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Zgonnikov et al., 2020)</ref> and pedestrian-crossing decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Pekkanen et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Our study extends the DDM framework to incorporate our three core hypotheses. First, we connect a utility function to the drift rate, introducing a time-varying maximization process that links pedestrian and vehicle kinematics. Specifically, we emphasize the significance of TTA as a primary influence on the utility function, forgoing other environmental factors to focus on the computational implications of TTA. This approach requires modifying the stochastic differential equation (SDE) underpinning the canonical DDM to accommodate safety concerns tied to TTA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>= ( , ) +</head><p>(1)</p><p>This equation consists of the drift component A(Xt, t) and the diffusion component σ. Xt</p><p>represents the decision variable, while dt and dWt denote infinitesimal time steps and white noise. The subscript t indicates the time step. We determined the value of σ, set at 0.3, to calibrate the model's data generation, closely aligning with the patterns observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Giles et al. (2019)</ref>.</p><p>We introduce two core parameters within the utility function to capture this relationship:</p><p>kg and kc. The parameter kg relates to the change rate in the distance to the destination from a pedestrian's perspective, given the constrained walking speed. The second parameter, kc, is linked to TTA (ti), tying collision concerns to pedestrian walking speed (vp) and the surrogate drift rate parameter, kg.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= + ⁄<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The utility function exhibits a deterministic process influenced by TTA, which shifts from a constant value to negative infinity when a vehicle approaches and a rapid rebound once the vehicle clears the crossing zone. We scale the utility function outputs using an exponential function, aligning with the assumption that neural activation cannot fall below zero.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( , ) = + (3) = ( )</formula><p>The decision rate (μ) is calibrated by signal suppression, proportionally tied to the accumulated evidence (γXt), a mechanism we explore to test the signal suppression hypothesis.</p><p>While this variant of the DDM, known as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, has been proposed as a solution for preference reversals under time pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1993)</ref>, its application in real-world tasks with novel features has yet to be rigorously tested.</p><p>Therefore, we have a relatively simplified traffic decision model, incorporating the timevarying drift rate, the utility maximization process, and the signal suppression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The CPP and the Decision Variable</head><p>Recent studies have suggested that the unobservable decision variable can be indirectly observed by analyzing ERPs, particularly the CPP component <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Twomey et al., 2015)</ref>. The CPP exhibits a distinct pattern of initial rise, slow down, and subsequent acceleration in response to experimental manipulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we explore the signal suppression in ERP data during road crossing, where individuals are explicitly motivated to suppress the decision to walk when faced with imminent collision risk. Through the TTA factor, we manipulate the γ parameter to investigate one possible mechanism for signal suppression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We enlisted 24 participants (13 females; 22 to 64 years old), compensating them with £10 for a one-hour online session. Participants were debriefed about the study, downloaded the task software, completed the task on their personal computers, returned to the virtual meeting room, and uploaded their data files to a cloud server.</p><p>Data from 15 participants were included in our analysis. The low complaint rate was due to the data collection coinciding with a UK nationwide COVID lockdown. Four participants failed to participate or follow task instructions. An additional five were excluded because they took nearly 2 hours to complete the task, double the expected time. We interviewed participants after practice sessions and emphasized the importance of making pre-vehicle responses. One participant consistently preferred post-vehicle responses and was excluded.</p><p>Before starting, we established three stopping rules for data collection: (a) reaching a maximum of 25 participants, (b) achieving the target of 20 valid participants per experiment, and (c) surpassing the planned recruitment end date. Data collection ceased when any of these criteria were met. We chose 20 as the target number because the previous CPP study also used a similar sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kelly &amp; O'Connell, 2013)</ref>. Power analyses were not conducted initially due to a lack of comparable studies using the same variables and tasks. The study received ethical approval from the School of Psychology Research Ethics Committee at the University of Leeds on 24 January 2021 under the reference number PSYC-199.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>The road-crossing task simulated a first-person perspective scenario, where participants acted as pedestrians about to cross a road. We used Unity® for high-quality 3D scenes and motion control. Pedestrian walking speed was set at 1.6 m/s (5.3 ft/s), representing a typical fast walking speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fitzpatrick et al., 2006)</ref>. Pedestrians stood 0.5 meters from the roadside on a 4.2meter un-signaled road ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>).</p><p>We instructed participants to balance response speed and crossing safety and to cross before an approaching vehicle when possible. They could walk or wait by hitting the space bar before the car passed. Response accuracy depended on remaining TTA, walking speed, and road specification. If participants chose to wait, they could change their decision before the trial ended. However, we did not record these wait responses. There were no restrictions on starting to walk while the vehicle was closing in, but few participants did so. All post-vehicle responses were to walk.</p><p>Our experiments were not pre-registered on public websites. Still, we submitted a plan to the local ethics committee, particularly for participant recruitment during the pandemic. We provide data and analysis code (Appendix D). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>We employed a two-by-four, repeated-measures analysis of variance design, with factors for left-versus-right (LR) and TTA (2.5, 3, 3.5, &amp; 4 seconds). When inferring unobservable processes, we treated these conditions as a continuous variable in the utility function, following a similar approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Usher &amp; McClelland (2001)</ref> and as an ordinal variable in generalized linear models (GLMs) when analyzing manifest data. Treating TTA as continuous was motivated by the influence of contextual factors on time perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gorea &amp; Hau, 2013)</ref>. We chose 2.5 seconds as the minimum based on observational studies (Zhao et al., 2019) and start-up road-crossing times for pedestrians <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fitzpatrick et al., 2006)</ref>. Conditions were block-randomized to ensure participants estimated TTA attentively.</p><p>We expected TTA to influence responses based on findings in naturalistic studies <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yannis et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2019)</ref> and controlled studies using abstract images <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Schiff &amp; Detwiler, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Vagnoni et al., 2012)</ref>. Our task has yet to test audio cues because they affected TTA judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Schiff &amp; Oldak, 1990)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The task began with a practice block and four testing blocks containing 32 trials (eight per TTA condition), with self-paced breaks between blocks. Each trial began with a fixation cross followed by a randomized delay of 2, 2.5, or 3 seconds before an oncoming vehicle appeared.</p><p>The viewpoint was either left or right, depending on the pedestrian's standing. After crossing, the scene faded for 0.25 seconds before a new trial started-trials without a response ended after the vehicle left the screen, plus a 0.25-second fade. When a collision happened, a warning sound was played.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis Methods</head><p>In both experiments, we recorded only seven (0.07%) unsafe crossings when participants responded after the vehicle had passed. Of these, five occurred with TTAs of 3.5 and 4 seconds, and two with a TTA of 2.5 seconds. These responses appeared anticipatory because (1) five had a difference between reaction time and TTA of within 0.3 seconds (an implausible value), and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2</ref>the other two had a difference of around 1.5 seconds, close to a collision.

The Bayesian MCMC technique sampled plausible parameters from a target distribution derived by combining a joint prior distribution with the likelihood function. We chose a set of weakly informed prior distributions to align with fundamental model assumptions, such as ensuring non-negativity of the non-decision time.</p><p>Specifically, we used the software <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Lin &amp; Strickland, 2020)</ref>, which incorporates differential-evolution MCMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hu &amp; Tsui, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Turner et al., 2013)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RT and Response Proportions</head><p>Figure 3A showed no discernible difference between the baseline model, m0, and the model, m2. The latter model assumed only an LR influence, suggesting that adding the LR influence did not improve the model fit to the data. This was found across all dependent variables.</p><p>The model comparison showed that the models assuming a TTA influence (m1, m3, &amp; m4) fit the data better than those assuming no TTA influence (m0 &amp; m2). The interaction term did not improve the model fit (m4 vs. m3). Therefore, we interpreted that the TTA unambiguously affected (a) the proportion of pre-vehicle responses given they were safe, (b) the proportion of safe responses made before the vehicle passed, (e) the safe RTs made after the vehicle passed, and (f) the unsafe RTs made before the vehicle passed. Furthermore, we found that the TTA has no apparent impact on (c) the proportion of safe responses made after the vehicle passed and (d) the safe RTs made before the vehicle passed.</p><p>The goodness of fit aligned with the WAIC result. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3B</ref> shows the TTA affects (a), (b), and (e) but not (c) and (d). We made this interpretation based on whether the selected model, m1, clearly mimicked the data patterns. Furthermore, the goodness of fit also favored that the dependent variable (f) was also affected by the TTA; however, we acquired only 7 and 4 data points in the long arrival times at the 3.5-second and 4-second TTA. Thus, we tested the two short arrival times (2.5 s vs. 3 s), F(1, 12) = 92.49, partial η 2 =0.89, p &lt; 0.0001, BF ≅ 1e3 1 . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RT Distributions</head><p>We constructed distributions by binning RTs into 64 94-ms bins and calculated their proportions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4B</ref>). Given that the outcome was safe, the pre-vehicle distribution at the 3second TTA was more symmetrical than the distributions in the other TTA conditions, F(1.61, 20.98) = 10.36, p = 0.001, partial η 2 =0.44, BF = 162.2. We excluded the 2.5-second TTA in this test because the condition produced only three pre-vehicle, safe responses. The means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the skewness were 0.29 (0.05, 0.52), 0.99 (0.32, 1.66), and 2.20</p><p>(1.24, 3.15) for the 3, 3.5, and 4-second TTA. The distribution of 3-second TTA shifted more towards symmetrical form than that of 4-second TTA, t(13) = −4.22, p = 0.003, BF = 39.21. No significant difference was found when comparing the 3-second TTA condition to the 3.5-second condition, t(13)=−2.28, p = 0.12, BF = 1.86, and the 3.5-second condition to the 4-second condition, t(13) = −2.46, p = 0.09, BF=2.42. Therefore, it was unclear whether the 3.5-second TTA exerted any time pressure, as in the 3-second TTA.</p><p>For the post-vehicle distribution, we found the first 10% percentile RT correlated with the TTA, BF = 472, r = 0.48, 90% CI [0.27, 0.67]. Such an observation supported our hypothesis that the TTA is essential in generating the post-vehicle responses, which were not completely independent of the pre-vehicle responses. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>In summary, we highlighted the following six findings in Experiment 1 manifest data:</p><p>1. We observed that participants perceived a sense of urgency when they had only 3 seconds to decide, as supported by the change in skewness in the 3-second TTA.</p><p>2. Participants made accurate estimates of the available time, consistent with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Schiff &amp; Detwiler, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Schiff &amp; Oldak, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Vagnoni et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>3. Participants rarely crossed safely when they had less than 2.5 seconds, which suggests that the previous study on the time gap between cars can be generalized to the assessment of the remaining time of an approaching vehicle <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gorrini et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>This finding also supports the validity of our computerized task as a simulation of real-world road crossing.</p><p>4. Individuals demonstrated a range of risk-taking behaviors when crossing in front of oncoming vehicles. This interpretation is supported by the broader spread in individual data points in the pre-vehicle response shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4A</ref>, sub-panel (a) and (d). To further investigate this point, we conducted diffusion-model analyses.</p><p>5. Despite the near impossibility of crossing safely in 2.5 seconds, participants adjusted their response proportion accordingly, supporting the hypothesis that people did consider the numerical information of the TTA.</p><p>6. The TTA factor affected only the response immediately after the vehicle passed but not the subsequent post-vehicle responses.</p><p>It is unclear whether TTA affected the pre-vehicle safe RT. In Experiment 2, we further tested this point. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4A</ref> provides an overview of the model's performance in accounting for various aspects of the data, both before and after the vehicle passed. Notably, the model simulations closely captured:</p></div>

In this case, the data indicated an average safe RT of just under 0.6 seconds. However, the extended diffusion model predicted a longer RT of 1.77 seconds ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4A, subpanel d)</ref>. Notably, the HB Gaussian model provided a prediction closer to the data, with an estimate of 0.5 seconds ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3B, subpanel d)</ref>.</p><p>The second misfit pertained to the proportion of safe responses in this condition. The data indicated fewer than 0.6% of trials resulted in safe crossings. In contrast, the extended diffusion model predicted a substantially higher proportion of 55%. Conversely, the baseline and the best binomial models predicted proportions slightly above 25% and around 90%, respectively ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure   3B</ref>, subpanel b).</p><p>The third misfit concerned the unsafe RTs observed in the 3.5-second and 4-second TTA conditions, each based on a limited number of trials (seven and four, respectively). In these conditions, the model predicted zero responses.</p><p>In summary, the model demonstrated a credible fit to various aspects of the data.</p><p>However, these discrepancies warrant further investigation, particularly in rare responses and unique task demands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Comparisons and Parameter Estimation</head><p>We explored three critical questions in the model comparison:</p><p>Fixed-Effect vs. Random-Effect Influence on TTA:</p><p>We assessed whether TTA should be treated as a fixed-effect or random-effect influence.</p><p>In other words, we considered whether the four TTA conditions were merely a sample from an infinite range of potential TTA values. This examination involved a comparison of two model types. The first type incorporated all TTA conditions collectively, with Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2) contingent</ref>on the TTA value. The second type, conversely, fitted each TTA condition independently, suggesting that individuals' utility functions were distinct for different TTA conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hierarchical vs. Non-Hierarchical Modeling:</head><p>To discern whether assuming the independence of individuals provided a better fit to the data than presuming correlations among them, we compared the hierarchical model to the nonhierarchical model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incorporating Safety Concerns and Time-Varying Drift Rate:</head><p>We investigated whether the hypothesis of an unobservable process, which integrates safety concerns into utility maximization and incorporates a time-varying drift rate, offered a plausible account for the data. Our model comparisons sought to determine whether the parameters kg, kc, and γ significantly influenced the model's fit to the data. Note. t0 = non-decision time. tp = foreseeing time. TTA = time-to-arrival.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TTA Modeling</head><p>Fitting separate models for each TTA condition better fits the data than fitting a single model for all conditions (BF &gt; 1000, m11 vs. m10). This supports the idea that TTA has a fixedeffect influence on crossing decisions. Hierarchical models also fit the data better than nonhierarchical models in both the full model (BF = 109.46, m11 vs. m7) and the reduced model (m9 vs. m5, <ref type="bibr">BF = 27.42;</ref><ref type="bibr">m8 vs. m4,</ref><ref type="bibr">BF = 39.42)</ref>. These three comparisons suggest that pedestrians share common characteristics in their crossing decisions and TTA assessment and should not be treated as entirely independent.</p><p>The Time-varying Drift Rate.</p><p>The full model, which included a time-varying drift rate (kg), fit the data better than the model with a fixed kg, irrespective of whether the TTA conditions were fitted together or separately (BF &gt; 1000). This supports the role of kg in accounting for the data. In particular, model m10 (with kg) was more likely to account for the data than model m8 (fixing kg). When fitting all TTA conditions together, the Bayes factor of the two models exceeded 1000. When fitting the TTA conditions separately, the Bayes factor for model m11 (with kg) versus model m9 (fixing kg) was 840.87.</p><p>kg also contributed significantly to the model fit at the individual participant level. When fitting the TTA conditions separately, the model with kg outperformed the model setting kg constant in 6, 10, 6, and 7 participants in the four TTA conditions, respectively (BFs &gt; 10). We obtained a similar result when fitting the TTA conditions together, suggesting that kg played an essential role in crossing decisions irrespective of the assumption made about TTA processing.</p><p>Furthermore, we examined the influence of kg in the 3-second and 3.5-second TTA, two conditions for which participants must carefully assess the remaining time to cross safely. We found significant correlations between the kg estimates and the safe proportion before the vehicle passed in both conditions: r = 0.69, t(12) = 3.33, p = 0.006 (3-second TTA), and r = 0.60, t(12) = 2.57, p = 0.02 (3.5-second TTA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Signal-suppression and Safety Concerns</head><p>Fixing the γ or kc parameter resulted in a substantially worse fit to the data than the full model (m1 vs. m7 and m3 vs. m7; BFs &gt; 1000), supporting the significant role of both parameters. These results were independent of the essential role of kg, as evidenced by the BF of 758.83 for comparing m7 to m5. Even with the addition of γ and kc, kg still significantly influenced the model fit to the data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Parameter Estimates</head><p>Note. The estimates were from the model m11. Each segment represented the posterior of an estimate for a participant in a TTA condition (i.e., y-axis labels). The thick and thin lines showed the 80% and 95% highest density intervals. We used the white circle, the 50% percentile, to sort the segments.</p><p>Parameter Estimation <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> summarizes the estimates of the four main parameters, supporting our hypotheses about the fundamental role of signal suppression in safety concerns. <ref type="figure">Figure 5(a)</ref> showed the kc estimates negatively correlated with the pre-vehicle response proportion at the 3.5second TTA (BF = 2.54, r = −0.40, 90% CI [−0.76, 0.0067]), indicating that stronger signal suppression was associated with a lower probability of crossing the road before the vehicle arrived. Additionally, the TTA at 2.5 and 3 seconds resulted in consistently higher kc estimates than the other conditions, suggesting that signal suppression was more pronounced when participants had less time to decide.  The Association of the kg and the Individual Response Time Distributions.</p><p>Note. We sorted the participants separately based on the kg estimates at each time-to-arrival (TTA) condition. The model simulations were presented in gray color. The dashed line marked the TTA time.</p><p>To further investigate whether kg provided a meaningful mechanistic account at both individual and group levels, we summarized the results in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> and interpreted them as follows.</p><p>Among pre-vehicle responses, the kg estimate negatively correlated with safe reaction times at the 3-second TTA <ref type="bibr">(BF = 9.54,</ref>). This indicates that participants with higher kg values responded faster. A similar correlation was found at the 4second TTA <ref type="bibr">(BF = 17.15,</ref>) but not at the 3.5-second TTA <ref type="bibr">(BF = 1.95,</ref>). Figures 5(c) and 6 (3 and 4 second panels)</p><p>illustrate the correlation. Specifically, the pre-vehicle RT distribution in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> becomes more dispersed with increasing kg values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Our extended diffusion model effectively captured the decision-making patterns in roadcrossing scenarios. However, it exhibited limitations when participants produced only a few responses, a phenomenon commonly observed in DDM literature. Similar challenges arise when modeling error RTs and responses in high percentiles within the classic 2AFC task. Recent studies, such as one involving steering decisions, encountered misfits when participants produced fewer than five responses (evidenced by the green 'x' in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>, as seen in Dark, Speed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Vanunu &amp; Ratcliff, 2022)</ref>. These observations align with findings in time-varying models, where scant data pose challenges in model fitting (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Evans &amp; Hawkins, 2019</ref>, and <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Teodorescu et al., 2016)</ref>. In sparse data, a good fit and a misfit may not offer substantial insights into the model's performance.</p><p>In our study, we deliberately chose not to fine-tune the model specifically for conditions characterized by minimal responses. Such adjustments could risk overfitting the model to taskunrelated processes. Our rationale for this decision was threefold. Firstly, the model demonstrated a close fit to proportion data and exhibited strong alignment with safe RTs following the vehicle's passage while reasonably approximating unsafe RTs' patterns. These accomplishments, achieved through our core hypotheses, underscored the model's overall performance, even in the face of limited data. Secondly, we recognized the potential pitfalls of overfitting a model to a small data set and the unrealistic assumption that pedestrians would never accelerate when faced with short TTA. For instance, the three pre-vehicle responses in the 2.5-second TTA condition likely resulted from participants anticipating a high-speed vehicle and initiating a response before its appearance. Lastly, the parameters underlying our assumptions provided a meaningful account of the decision-making process in road-crossing scenarios.</p><p>Nonetheless, the distributional data regarding whether a 3.5-second TTA-induced time pressure in Experiment 1 was ambiguous. To address this, we conducted Experiment 2 in a laboratory so we could supervise the participants. Another critical question arising from the diffusion model comparison was whether the utility function should assume TTA as a fixedeffect or a random-effect influence. Additionally, we aimed to explore whether signal suppression impacted the unobservable decision variable reflected by the CPP component, as previously predicted <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018)</ref>. The earlier study had tested their model and ERP data in the classic 2AFC paradigm, with results deemed applicable to the traffic context we examined here.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-validation Test</head><p>In our cross-validation examination, we used the parameters derived from models m10 and m11, optimized using Experiment 1 data. Subsequently, we generated simulations based on these models and compared them with the fresh data obtained from Experiment 2. Our primary objective was to assess whether model m10, which factored in the TTA variable numerically within the utility function, yielded a better fit to the new dataset than the approach of fitting each TTA condition separately, m11, a model positing that participants treated each TTA scenario as unique and processed them independently.</p><p>To quantify the disparity in cross-validation predictions, we calculated the cost function, namely the root-mean-square difference, to gauge the dissimilarity between the data and the simulations. We performed this calculation separately for all participants across each TTA condition. Our examination involved a range from 0.01 to 1.91 seconds, with intervals of 0.1 seconds, to scrutinize the potential impact of varying kernel bin widths on the outcome.</p><p>Our results across different bin widths consistently indicated that the model incorporating numerical processing of TTA outperformed the model optimizing each TTA condition separately, with particularly compelling evidence in the cases of 3.5-second and 4-second TTAs. In the 2.5second TTA scenario, depending on the bin width, we occasionally encountered weaker evidence. Interestingly, at the 3-second TTA, no clear distinction emerged between the two models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CPP</head><p>The response-locked curves rose gradually until the participant responded. We found that our stimulus-locked waveform aligned with the result of the RT distribution, showing that the 3.0second condition significantly deviated from the other conditions. The interesting finding is the stronger downward going in the 3.0-second TTA around nearly 20 milliseconds, around 100 milliseconds, and between 300 and 450 milliseconds after the stimulus onset. The ultra short latency (e.g., 20 milliseconds after the stimulus onset), although seemingly unlikely, must be considered together with the varying signal delays and the TTA. That is, participants could anticipate the upcoming stimulus by observing the wait time (i.e., the signal delay plus the TTA).</p><p>Importantly, all three ERP changes happened before the averaged RT, 603 milliseconds. The response-locked curve also showed such a pattern, but the permutation test comparing the three conditions did not report any significant difference. Neither did any post-vehicle CPP curves show any difference.</p><p>In comparison to the previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Yau et al., 2021)</ref>, we argued that our downward going curve at the 3.0-second TTA was similar to the two subsets of EEG data -low-value correct slow responses and low-value error responses -reported by Afacan-Seref and colleagues 2 . However, our topographic map was more similar to those reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Yau et al. (2021)</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Figure 5a</ref> to 5d) than to those reported earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kelly &amp; O'Connell, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">O'Connell et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Steinemann et al., 2018)</ref>. One common observation in ours and Yau and colleagues' data (2021) is that both topographic maps were occipital inclination, and both studies used the stimulus emphasizing the time-evolving changes.</p><p>In contrast, the early reports used a static stimulus and the task akin to the classic 2AFC task.</p><p>The earlier studies showed topographic maps peaking around the centroparietal region.</p><p>Previously, the CPP was established by showing stereotypical buildup over time and peaked close to the time of response, an argument that this characteristic is consistent with the build-to-threshold dynamics assumed in the DDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kelly &amp; O'Connell, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">O'Connell et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Yau et al., 2021)</ref>. We tested this characterization in our ERP by dividing the responselocked CPP curves, starting from 500 milliseconds before the response, into six 78-millisecond bins, calculating their slopes, and then comparing each succession of the slope with the first one, the second one, and so on.</p><p>We examined the safe, pre-vehicle responses and found that across the three TTA conditions, the CPP segment closed to the response anchor rose significantly. In the 3.0-second TTA, the most robust evidence was observed between the segment immediately before the response onset and between 344 to 266 milliseconds before the response, BF = 33.99. In both the 3.5-second and the 4.0-second TTA, the most robust evidence was observed between the segment immediately prior to the response onset and the segment between 422 and 344 milliseconds before the response, BF = 40.61, and 33.50. None of the response-locked curves at the post-vehicle response showed ramping-up evidence. We had not tested the unsafe response because of insufficient trials.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The field of decision neuroscience often embarks on its explorations with high hopes of translating its findings into real-life applications. However, these studies sometimes fail to address the intricacies inherent in real-world scenarios. Our study confronted these complexities, revealing that real-life decision-making mechanisms diverge from the standard models and traditional paradigms.</p><p>We hypothesized that the outcomes of a task involving the assignment of utility, or value, to abstract geometric shapes could find relevance in real-life contexts, including high-stakes traffic situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018)</ref>. This proposition suggested that in situations with time constraints and where errors carry substantial risks, decision processes should prioritize sensorimotor considerations, guided by carefully assessing anticipated costs and benefits to optimize expected gains. Our study tested this hypothesis and demonstrated how this prioritization manifests in traffic decisions where safety is paramount.</p><p>We tackled several previously unexplored challenges by introducing a time-varying decision process model, integrating three fundamental concepts: maximization of expected gain, time-varying decision rates, and signal suppression. When applied to a real-life task, this model offers a testable framework for understanding the intricacies of decision-making in high-stakes scenarios. By co-analyzing the model, the task, and the dynamics of the neurophysiological decision signal, we provide valuable insights into the decision mechanisms at play in dynamic, life-threatening, and time-critical situations. More broadly, our work underscores the necessity of considering task-specific features when constructing decision models and investigating how these features influence the core mechanisms of the decision processes.</p><p>A central element of our model's innovation lay in predicting a suppression effect induced by an approaching vehicle. Initially, the decision variable followed its expected trajectory, but as anticipated, it decelerated and rapidly recovered once the safety concern subsided. The observation of this model prediction in both behavioral and neurophysiological data represents a groundbreaking revelation in the context of decisions like these. While dynamic shifts in the dominance of competing alternatives, driven by their connection to utility, have been noted in situations involving multiple conflicting sensory stimuli, such as the flanker task <ref type="bibr">(Gratton et al., 1988)</ref>, choice tasks related to monetary rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018)</ref>, or the influence of group dynamics on decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Tump et al., 2020)</ref>, our study introduces a novel perspective. We explore the effect of a go-no-go (but not exactly identical) style decision in response to time-evolving sensory stimuli, revealing the interplay between top-down conflict resolution and bottom-up sensory information. Furthermore, the results from our 3.0-second TTA condition illuminate the role of safety-linked time constraints in calibrating decisions based on the desire to cross the road safely. The decision dynamics we uncover distinguish them from the reversal dynamics reported in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018)</ref> and introduce a new form of "changes of mind," akin to observations in monkey participants <ref type="bibr">(Kiani et al., 2008)</ref>. The critical distinction here lies in the systematic shift in the balance between implicit utility related to safety criteria and the explicit threat posed by the sensory stimulus.</p><p>Our discovery of experimentally induced signal suppression in the accumulation of neurophysiological evidence, as reflected by the CPP, suggests that utility extends beyond experimental rewards or monetary values. It also encompasses the motivation to complete a task and ensure safety when it directly affects the input of the accumulation process. Our findings support the hypothesis that utility modulates the bias in the drift rate, a modulation that fluctuates over time as reference values change. Specifically, within the context of the road-crossing task, this bias is influenced by time constraints and safety considerations associated with the TTA, leading to a gradual decrease in the value that is able to be maximized. Our modeling results offer clarity regarding earlier studies that separately employed three experimental techniquessensory representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Reynolds et al., 2000)</ref>, expectation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kok et al., 2013)</ref>, and reward sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Stănişor et al., 2013)</ref>-to influence early visual activities. Moreover, our work sheds light on recent research that integrated all three techniques within the single-stimulus task <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time-varying Mechanisms in Single-stimulus Decisions</head><p>In recent discussions about the significance of time-varying mechanisms, two central questions have come to the fore. First, we explored whether including extended task features in the single stimulus 2AFC task is crucial for introducing time-varying parameters. Second, we investigated whether these task features effectively capture the underlying cognitive processes.</p><p>Our investigations led us to explore two distinct time-varying mechanisms: the concept of a decreasing accuracy criterion (later referred to as the "collapsing bound hypothesis") and the presence of a motor-related urgency signal influencing drift rate. These mechanisms were proposed as plausible explanations for the impact of time pressure, as initially reported in Thura and colleagues' study (2012).</p><p>The collapsing bound hypothesis posits that decision-makers seek to optimize rewards, resulting in the observed pattern of symmetrical RT distribution-a phenomenon frequently observed in studies involving monkey participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Thura et al., 2012)</ref>. This hypothesis has garnered attention due to its intuitive appeal, suggesting that individuals tend to expedite their decisions when confronted with insufficient information. However, our findings reveal a more nuanced picture, indicating that this theory better accounts for data influenced by time pressure in specific contexts. For instance, Evans and colleagues conducted experiments among student participants, manipulating rewards and imposing a 1.3-second time limit in a random-dot motion task <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Evans et al., 2020)</ref>. Their data supported the collapsing bound theory in scenarios involving time constraints but not manipulating rewards.</p><p>It is worth noting, however, that the advantage of the collapsing bound mechanism was not consistently observed in other research reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Voskuilen et al., 2016)</ref>. In studies involving four numerosity discrimination tasks where participants judged whether an array contained over 50 asterisks, these reports failed to uncover any discernible benefit associated with including the collapsing bound mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Voskuilen et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, a reanalysis of the data from the feature-switch task <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Trueblood et al., 2021)</ref> revealed that the model's performance depended on the specific information criteria employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Our investigations have illuminated the critical role of time-varying drift rate and signal suppression in tasks with several extended task features. These factors have led to significant shifts in behavioral RT distributions and left their mark on neurophysiological data. While our data do not definitively establish the superiority of one time-varying mechanism over the other, they underscore the pivotal role played by both the time-varying mechanism itself and the rich task features in the success of the extended diffusion model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitation</head><p>Although our study identified a signal suppression effect in the CPP component under tight time constraints, the CPP curve may be subject to precocious sensory representation, as suspected by the prior study <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018)</ref>. Our ERP topographic maps notably revealed a peak leaning towards the occipital region, deviating from the more typical centroparietal localization. This intriguing observation aligns with the recent finding in tasks utilizing time-evolving stimuli rather than time-invariant ones, prompting us to question the assumption of an as-yet-unstabilized neural representation within our data. Notably, our ERP data exhibit similarities to the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Yau et al. (2021)</ref>, distinguishing them from the data reported by <ref type="bibr">Kelly and colleagues (Afacan-Seref et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Steinemann et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kelly &amp; O'Connell, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">O'Connell et al., 2012)</ref>, primarily regarding CPP amplitude. The latter group used typically rudimentary stimuli, such as visual contrast, but Yau et al's and our stimuli were more complex. Using the contrast stimuli, the latter group consistently reported amplitudes peaking in the range of a few dozen microvolts, with the smallest amplitude reported at approximately three microvolts. Future work should investigate the impact of time-evolving versus time-invariant stimuli on the CPP component.</p><p>Another noteworthy limitation concerns our consideration of motor preparation and its influence on decision-making. In our computerized task, participants made decisions by pressing the space bar. However, it is improbable that an action resulting from a decision could be executed within the rapid timeframe of a keypress. Consequently, we could not acquire the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), a crucial marker of motor preparation. This limitation is especially significant given the relevance of the ability to enact physical movements, particularly in slowing down locomotion, in the decision-making process of older pedestrians <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lobjois &amp; Cavallo, 2007)</ref>. Moreover, an earlier study employing an alternative response recording method highlighted the prevalence of rapid responses, possibly driven by stimulus anticipation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Noorbaloochi et al., 2015)</ref>. Similar to the slow reaction times observed in the post-vehicle distribution, these anticipated responses may carry valuable information concerning pedestrians' decision-making processes.</p><p>Future work should test the task by incorporating two novel parameters: foreseeing time and action time to address these limitations. This addition holds promise for enhancing the model's ability to capture decision-making dynamics in scenarios where actions are not executed instantaneously. Subsequent investigations could put this updated model to the test in more realistic tasks where actions are realized after a brief delay. Additionally, augmenting the number of trials to bolster the dataset represents another viable approach for addressing our study's limitation. Furthermore, introducing an acceleration factor, permitting participants to increase their pace while crossing, may offer a valuable avenue for future exploration and data refinement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In departing from the conventional exploration of single-stimulus decisions in contexts devoid of personal safety considerations, our study has given rise to an extended diffusion model tailored to address the complexities of the road-crossing task-a multi-step decision-making process. This task involves the novel challenge of reversing perceptual information on two occasions, allowing decision-makers the flexibility to defer their choices. We elucidate this process by an integrative account of utility maximization, time-varying drift rates, and signal suppression.</p><p>Beyond developing this innovative model, our research has unveiled three crucial insights with implications for road safety. First, our findings suggest that pedestrians, albeit not with absolute precision, incorporate considerations of vehicle arrival times into their decision-making calculus. Second, we have illuminated the potential variability in the crossing-decision process among individuals, a revelation supported by the discernible differences between hierarchical and non-hierarchical models. Each unique decision-making process exhibits distinct characteristics related to decision speed, risk aversion, and the calibration of evidence. Third, our study underscores the indispensable roles played by task features absent in the classic paradigm, such as the dynamic nature of information, time constraints, and collision risks, in shaping the deliberative process underpinning road crossings. These elements collectively enrich our understanding of this critical aspect of road safety.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Predictions</head><p>This section presents the model predictions, examining each parameter in isolation while holding others constant. Our goals are twofold: firstly, to offer insight into the solution of the extended diffusion model's probability density function (PDF), and secondly, to provide readers with guidance on acquiring the PDF.</p><p>We defined a time domain spanning up to 8 seconds with a 0.005-second increment and an evidence domain ranging from -1 to 1, also with a 0.005 step. The initial position of the accumulator was set at 0. The upper time bound was determined by considering prior data <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Giles et al., 2019</ref>) and the longest TTA tested in our study.</p><p>In our scenario, we envisioned a road-crossing situation where a pedestrian could anticipate the next move by 0.3 seconds, with an action time of 0.025 seconds. The vehicle, measuring 4.5 meters in length, became noticeable to the pedestrian when it was approximately 40 meters away. The vehicle approached the crossing zone at four distinct speeds: 16, 13.33, 11.43, and 10 m/s, resulting in arrival times of 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 seconds, respectively. The vehicle took 0.28, 0.34, 0.39, and 0.45 seconds to traverse the entire crossing zone. Notably, the vehicle was driven in the middle of the road, providing a 0.72-second buffer between the participant's initiation of crossing and potential collision with the vehicle. Additionally, the vehicle followed a perpendicular trajectory to the pedestrian (resembling a "pass-by" scenario described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Schiff &amp; Oldak, 1990</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C Parameter Recovery</head><p>This section examines the extent to which we can recover model parameters and the associated uncertainties. To mimic the empirical data conditions, we conducted a series of parallel studies to simulate an equivalent number of trials for each TTA condition. To do this, we generated 14 sets of model parameters, each representing a hypothetical participant. These parameter sets were drawn from population-level distributions as follows:</p><p>• Three Gaussian distributions characterized by the location parameters, 1.83, 2.58, and 1.5, and a standard deviation of 2 for kg, kc, and γ.</p><p>• Two uniform distributions spanning the ranges of 0.45 to 1 and 0.15 to 1 for the location parameters, tp and t0.</p><p>• Five uniform distributions spanning the range from 0 to 10 for the remaining parameters.</p><p>Our analysis yielded several significant findings. First and foremost, our model successfully recovered the data patterns, affirming its validity and reliability. Furthermore, our investigation into parameter uncertainty revealed interesting nuances. Notably, the embedded parameters, such as γ and tp, indirectly influenced by the manifested variables, response times, and choices, exhibited lower precision than the non-embedded parameter t0. Specifically, the recovery rates within the 95% highest density interval (HDI) for γ and tp were 66.1% and 71.4%, respectively, whereas t0 exhibited a notably higher recovery rate of 89.2%. Similarly, parameters kg and kc also demonstrated robust recovery rates, hovering around 87.5%. <ref type="figure">Figure C1</ref> shows the model can recover the data generated from itself, using close numbers of trials as the experiment. Note. The yellow strip shows the vehicle's entry and exit from the crossing zone, and the grayish-yellow region highlights the collision time window.</p><p>Appendix D ∼ ( , ) ( ) = + 1 ( , 1 ) ∼ (0, 10) 16 m2 ∼ ( , ) ( ) = + 2 ( , 2 ) ∼ (0, 10) m3 ∼ ( , ) 17 ( ) = + 1 + 2 ( , 1 , 2 ) ∼ (0, 10) m4 ∼ ( , ) 18 ( ) = + 1 + 2 + 3 ( , 1 , 2 , 3 ) ∼ (0, 10) Note.
