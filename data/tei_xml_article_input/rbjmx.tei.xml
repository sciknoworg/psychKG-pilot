			<abstract>
				<p>Children often mistake things that appear to move without visible external intervention, such as clouds, for being alive. Interestingly, these mistakes are still made by adults under time pressure. Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009) demonstrated this using a rapid classification task, and showed that adults make more errors when judging if plants and moving natural things are alive (compared to animals, and still or artificial things). Over four experiments, we explored Goldberg and Thompson-Schill&apos;s (2009) proposal that connections formed in childhood between movement and aliveness are used in adulthood to make decisions about aliveness. Our findings replicated Goldberg and Thompson-Schill&apos;s (2009) results, that plants and moving natural things were more difficult to classify by aliveness. In addition, we showed that plants and natural things used in their study were also less familiar and harder to visualise than other categories. Interestingly, participants intuitively believed that moving natural things can move without external intervention, suggesting that associations between movement and aliveness influence decisions made without time pressure. These results suggest that movement is an important part of our conceptual understanding of aliveness, and how we encode objects in our environment.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>suppressed rather than overwritten <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelemen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Shtulman &amp; Valcarcel, 2012)</ref>. To test whether this these childhood associations between movement and aliveness were still present in adults, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref> presented adults with words for living or non-living objects, moving or still objects, and man-made or natural objects, and asked them to judge whether each item was alive or not. Under time pressure, both undergraduate students and biology professors mistakenly classified plants as non-living more often than animals, and mistakenly classified moving and natural things as alive more often than still and artificial things. As a result, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref> concluded that there are 'roots' of childhood knowledge that adults use to make decisions about aliveness when sufficient biological knowledge is unavailable, such as under time pressure.</p><p>The underlying reason for these difficulties in classifying plants and natural moving things, however, remains unclear. For example, it is possible that some of the words are simply less familiar, and therefore harder to judge on any semantic dimension. Around half of the words in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill's (2009)</ref> plant category are specific flower names (such as poinsettia, hyacinth), which are less frequent than the other plant words (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref>. Furthermore, the movement properties of the stimuli vary substantially; compare the movement of a clock, for example, to a planet or to a tiger. We know very little about which characteristics of movement (e.g., autonomy, speed) influence these judgements of aliveness.</p><p>In the current study, we used four tasks to replicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref> and then gain insight into what processes or biases might be driving these findings.</p><p>Firstly, we directly replicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref>'s aliveness classification task in Australian undergraduates. Secondly, we looked at three different variables that might explain categorical differences in performance on the aliveness task: how familiar participants were with the stimuli (familiarity), how easy they were to visualise (imageability), and how they move (e.g., speed, autonomy).</p><p>To foreshadow results, we replicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill's (2009)</ref> results.</p><p>In addition, we found familiarity and imageability were correlated with both accuracy and reaction time in the aliveness classification task, with plants and moving natural things being less familiar and harder to visualise. We also showed that movement characteristics differ dramatically across categories, and that moving natural things are intuitively believed to move independently. Our findings suggest that even without time pressure, moving natural things are still perceived to have autonomous local and global movement, pointing to a pervasive influence of movement on adult conceptions of aliveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>To investigate how associations between movement and aliveness developed in childhood influence adult cognition, we used four different tasks. Methods and results for all tasks are written together to avoid unnecessary repetition and facilitate comparison, as the data for each task is analysed in relation to the others and there is substantial methodological overlap.</p><p>An independent group of participants completed each task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participant characteristics for all tasks are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. All participants were undergraduate students at the University of Sydney, recruited online in return for course credit. All participants reported that English was the first language they learned to read and speak and gave informed consent before commencing the study. The study procedures were approved by the University of Sydney ethics committee. Note that for the movement ratings, data from three participants were incomplete, but contained more than half of the trials. The partial data from these participants was included, but recall data for these participants was missing, so recall data and category observation data is from 105/108 subjects. Exclusion criteria for each task are explained below with the description of the task. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref> found some differences between biology professors and undergraduate students, we also collected information about participants' level of education in biology. Participants were simply asked whether they had completed any high school biology course, or a university biology course. *Where these do not sum to the final N, additional participants answered "Prefer not to say." ^ N excluded are not included in the final N, i.e., the total number of participants is the Final N + N excluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and procedures</head><p>For all tasks, participants completed the experiment online on a laptop or desktop computer, hosted on Pavlovia <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Peirce et al., 2019</ref>, https://www.pavlovia.org/), coded using tools in JSPsych (de Leeuw, 2015), and guided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Grootswagers (2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p>Stimuli were the same across all tasks, taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref>.</p><p>The full list can be found in the OSF repository for this study (https://osf.io/m84pr/). There were 140 words in total, sorted into 6 categories: plants (30 words, e.g., cactus, gardenia), animals (30 words, e.g., falcon, octopus), moving artifacts (20 words, e.g., rocket, bicycle), moving natural kinds (20 words, e.g., cloud, monsoon), non-moving artifacts (20 words, e.g., towel, teaspoon) and non-moving natural kinds (20 words, e.g., stone, boulder). Note that only movement is balanced across the stimuli; there are more non-living words (80) than living words (60), and more natural stimuli (100) than artificial stimuli (40). The word lists for animals and plants were equated on mean number of letters, number of syllables, and their frequency in speech using log transformed HAL Frequency Norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balota et al., 2007)</ref>. The same procedure was also applied to selection of words for the non-living lists (non-moving artifacts, non-moving natural kinds, moving artifacts, and moving natural kinds), such that word length and syllables were roughly equal between lists. To check that participants were completing the task properly, three non-words ("koret", "malfer", and "serone") were also included in all tasks except the aliveness classification task. If participants rated the three non-words, on average, as above 25 on familiarity (familiarity or movement task) or imageability, they were excluded <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aliveness classification task</head><p>All materials and procedures were designed to be as similar as possible to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg &amp; Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref>. Participants were presented with a single word in the centre of the screen and asked to indicate whether it was alive or not by pressing the 'F' or 'J' key on their keyboard ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>). Key mapping was randomly allocated. All words were displayed in black 18pt Arial font on a white background. The entire experiment typically took less than 15 minutes. All participants responded to all 140 words. Each trial began with a fixation cross in the centre of the screen for a random duration between 500ms and 1000ms ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>).</p><p>The fixation was then replaced by the target word, which remained on the screen for 1000ms.</p><p>If the participant responded within 1000ms, the fixation cross returned to the screen for a random duration between 500ms and 1500ms, and the next trial began. If the participant did not respond, they were shown a time out message "No response recorded" for 1000ms before the next trial commenced. Trials were presented in blocks of 20 words, separated by breaks in which participants clicked a button on the screen to continue. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref>, participants with accuracies below 75% were excluded from analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Familiarity and imageability ratings</head><p>For both the familiarity and imageability tasks, participants rated each word, one at a time.</p><p>For the familiarity task, participants were asked to rate "…how familiar you are with each word" ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>). For the imageability task, participants were asked to rate "…how easy each thing is to visualise, or how well you are able to picture an example of the thing in your mind's eye" ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1C</ref>). They were told to "Go with your first impression, don't spend too long on each item." For the imageability task, participants were also instructed at the Sample sequence of the aliveness task (A), sample rating screen for the visualisation task (B) and imageability task (C).</p><p>beginning of the task "Note that if you don't know what a word means, it might be difficult to visualise", so it was clear what to do for the three non-words included as an attention check.</p><p>Each word was presented one at a time, in the centre of the screen in capital letters in 30pt font. For each word, participants were presented with a sliding scale representing 0 -100. For familiarity, 0 was labelled as "very unfamiliar" and 100 labelled as "very familiar".</p><p>For imageability, the scale had ticks at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 with the labels "extremely difficult", "difficult", "neither easy nor difficult", "easy", and "extremely easy". Instructions under the slider reminded participants of the task: "How easy is it to visualise this thing?" or "How familiar are you with this thing?" To compare across categories, scores from all participants were collated and averaged for each category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Movement ratings</head><p>Theoretical models of aliveness suggest that movement is crucial for making aliveness judgements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Yorek &amp; Narli, 2009)</ref>, but it remains unclear what characteristics of movement are important. For example, plants and animals are differentiated by the speed of their movement, and children rely on autonomous movement as a clue to aliveness. To answer these questions, we gathered ratings of several movement characteristics. Participants answered eight questions relating to how each item was able to move, shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The familiarity scale was included primarily to serve as the attention check, but also to replicate the findings of the familiarity task. Each word was shown at the top of the screen, with a series of sliders underneath for the questions in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. Participants needed to move the slider (0-100) on every question from its initial starting location at the mid-point (50) to advance to the next word. Across all participants, each word was responded to at least 20 times (range 20-32).</p><p>Participants began by viewing a set of instructions, designed to help them understand the intended meaning of the questions. For example, to explain the difference between question two (about any kind of global movement) and question three (about self-generated global movement), participants were shown an animation of two men throwing a pile of leaves in the air and an animation of leaves falling off a tree, and told "For example, an object might change position if it is moved by the wind or gravity, or if a human picks it up or intervenes in some other way." Local movement was explained as "… movement when the object is stationary, such as changing shape, growing, or having moving parts". A full copy of the instructions in context can be found at the experiment repository (https://osf.io/m84pr/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>At the end of all the tasks</head><p>At the end of all tasks, participants were presented with closing questions. First, there was an open text box and participants were asked to "type any words that you can remember from the experiment". They were not informed in advance that they would be asked to recall the words. For each participant, the average number recalled for each category was calculated, and averaged across participants to estimate the proportion of words recalled across different categories. Participants were also asked, "Did you notice any categories of words appearing in the list?" to investigate whether any categories were obvious from the set of words. Data on category observations was absent for seven subjects in the aliveness classification task due to a technical error. These free text entries were fed to the WordCloud library in python <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mueller, 2022)</ref> to create a qualitative representation of the frequency with which particular categories are mentioned. Small words ('there', 'were', 'some') were removed, and words less than three letters were also excluded. The word cloud ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2F)</ref> shows the 100 most frequent words. We also asked participants "Do you have any observations about the words you responded to?" A full list of observations is available in the OSF repository (https://osf.io/m84pr/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparing across tasks</head><p>To compare how the characteristics studied in each task relate to each other, and might explain accuracies in our aliveness task in the aliveness classification task, we looked at Spearman Rank correlations between measures ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). In addition to familiarity and imageability estimates, as well as the movement questions, we also included some measures taken from linguistic databases to investigate how these factors might be related. Age of Acquisition is a measure of the age at which a child can produce a given word, as rated by adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kuperman et al., 2012)</ref>. This measure can also be used to examine <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill's (2009)</ref> thesis that the same words that are difficult and confusing in childhood remain so in adulthood, as this would predict a positive correlation between age of acquisition and reaction time in the aliveness classification task. The Age of Acquisition data was retrieved from the English Lexicon Project <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balota et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kuperman et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>We have also included the frequency on twitter (TwitterFreqPm) from Worldlex <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gimenes &amp; New, 2016)</ref> as an alternate frequency measure to compare to the Log HAL frequency norms that were used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref> to balance the stimulus set, particularly given our participant sample is younger and potentially interacting more frequently with Twitter-style text than the news sources that the HAL measure is based on. Reaction times and accuracy for both experiments from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref> was retrieved from the supplementary materials available online. Concreteness was also retrieved from the English Lexicon Project, as another measure on which the moving natural things might differ. Spearman correlations based on experimental data were calculated item-wise, using the average for each item across participants. To test if correlations were above chance, we used a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons at p&lt;.05, where p &lt; .00018.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical inference</head><p>Statistics were based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref>, though in addition to the traditional frequentist approach we also examined results under a Bayesian framework.</p><p>Throughout, results are only interpreted as meaningful when both Bayesian and frequentist approaches indicate evidence for the alternate hypothesis. All Bayesian statistics were run using the BayesFactor package for R, using the default two-sided prior with a width of 0.707.</p><p>Bayes Factors can be interpreted as odds ratios; a Bayes Factor of 3 indicates three times as much evidence for the alternate hypothesis compared to the null hypothesis. Bayes Factors are interpreted as according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jeffreys (1961</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jeffreys ( /1998</ref>, where BF&gt;30 is very strong evidence for the alternate hypothesis, BF&gt;10 is strong evidence, BF&gt;3 is some evidence, and BF&lt;1/3 is evidence for the null hypothesis.</p><p>Animals and plants were compared using two-sided t-tests, or a Bayesian t-test with a two-sided prior. The effect of movement and naturalness was compared using a two-way ANOVA, or the Bayesian equivalent of an ANOVA (using the anovaBF function of the BayesFactor package), where we can calculate the effect of a given variable by comparing the evidence for a linear model containing that variable to one that does not contain that variable. Comparisons between each category of objects were done using Bayesian t-tests, and Tukey HSD tests, with the family-wise error rate corrected to .05. Code for all statistics and other data processing is publicly available, with the data, on the OSF repository (https://osf.io/m84pr/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To investigate how aliveness judgements are affected by movement, data was collected from four different tasks: a replication of the rapid aliveness classification task from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref>, judgements of familiarity and imageability, and ratings of movement characteristics. All raw data and results can be found in the OSF repository for this study (https://osf.io/m84pr/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Replication of results from Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009).</head><p>First, we directly replicated the rapid aliveness judgement task from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref>. Our results were remarkably similar to the original study. When judging the aliveness of different words, participants responded with an average accuracy of 82% (range 75 -92). Many words were near ceiling levels of accuracy, with 65% of words above 80% mean accuracy. Several words were classified accurately by all participants, including octopus, boat, taxi, truck, wagon, dish, vase, ruler, towel, pencil, window, teaspoon, stone, gravel, and diamond ( <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure 3)</ref>. The least accurate words were hemlock (16.13% participants correct), carnation (25.81%), poinsettia (25.81%), and elm (38.71%).</p><p>As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref>, accuracy was significantly lower for plants compared to animals, t(30) = 8.23, p &lt; .001, BF10. = 5.76x10 6 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2A)</ref>, and responses for plants were slower than for animals, t(30) =6.31, p &lt; .001, BF10. = 4.73x10 4 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>). There was a main effect of both movement and naturalness on reaction times ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>). Moving things were responded to more slowly than still things, F(1,120) = 6.22, p = .014, BF10. = 4.37x10 2 . Natural things were responded to more slowly than artificial things, F(1, 120) = 13.59, p &lt;.001, BF10. = 1.18x10 6 . The interaction effect was not significant, F(1, 120) = 1.85, p = .18, BF10. = 5.91.</p><p>Movement and naturalness also impacted the accuracy of responding, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>. Participants responded more accurately to still stimuli compared to moving stimuli, F(1, 120) = 17.98, p &lt; .001, BF10. = 2.33x10 3 . Artificial stimuli were classified more accurately compared to natural stimuli, F(1, 120) = 43.22, p &lt; .001, BF10. = 1.70x10 8 . For accuracy, the interaction term was significant, such that naturalness decreased accuracy for moving stimuli more than still stimuli, F(1, 120) = 6.01, p = .02, BF10. = 1.48x10 1 , reflecting the substantial decrease in accuracy for moving natural stimuli ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>). Plants were reported incorrectly more often than all other categories except moving natural things, and responses to moving natural things were significantly less accurate than all other categories except plants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plants and moving/natural things are less familiar.</head><p>To investigate other possible factors that might influence judgements of aliveness, we gathered ratings of how familiar participants were with the stimuli from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref>. The average familiarity rating ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2C</ref>) was 89.03/100, suggesting that the majority of words were familiar to most participants. Many items were scored at near ceiling levels of familiarity; 70% of stimuli were rated above 90/100 for familiarity, and 86% were above 80/100. The least familiar items were poinsettia (11.7/100), hyacinth (23.68/100), hemlock (34.88/100), geyser (44.29/100), elm (47.5/100) and sleet (53.29/100).</p><p>For living things, plants were less familiar than animals, t(30) = 10.78, p &lt; .001, BF10. = 1.09x10 9 . For non-living things, moving things were less familiar than non-moving things, F(1, 120) = 10.56, p = .001, BF10. = 5.09x10 , and natural things were less familiar than artificial things, F(1, 120) = 4.86, p = .029, BF10. = 9.42x10 3 . The interaction effect was not significant, F(1,120) = 0.019, p = 0.89, BF10. = 0.06. Plants were less familiar than all other categories. Still artificial things were also more familiar than moving natural things.</p><p>Plants and moving/natural things are also harder to visualise.</p><p>Given almost ceiling familiarity with the stimuli, we also gathered ratings of how easy each stimulus was to visualise, a metric used in linguistics as a measure of semantic richness <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Yap et al., 2012)</ref>. The mean imageability rating was 80.44/100, indicating that on average participants found most words easy to visualise. 66% of items were rated above 80/100 on ease of visualisation, but only 46% were rated above 90. The easiest item to visualise was grass (98.18/100), and the most difficult items to visualise were poinsettia (13.15/100), hyacinth (14.44/100), hemlock (17.46/100), petunia (30.92/100), and elm (30.95/100). Note that three of these difficult items (poinsettia, hemlock, and elm) were also among the least familiar.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2D</ref>, animals were easier to visualise than plants, t(38) = 12.27, p &lt; .001, BF10. = 2.43x10 11 . Artificial things were easier to visualise than natural things, F(1, 136) = 16.48, p &lt; .001, BF10. = 1.65x10 11 , and still things were easier to visualise than moving things, F(1,136) = 28.64, p &lt; .001, BF10. = 1.75x10 17 . The interaction effect was nonsignificant, F(1,136) = 0.34, p = .593, BF10. = 1.08. Plants were harder to visualise compared to all other categories, and still artefacts were easier to visualise compared to all other categories except still natural things. Moving natural things were also more difficult to visualise than all other non-living items (moving artificial, still natural, and still artificial).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Movement characteristics vary systematically across categories</head><p>To investigate how differences in movement characteristics across categories may explain the difficulty classifying plants and moving natural things as alive, participants answered a series of questions about the speed of the movement, whether the movement is more local or global, and how much the movement is agentive (self-driven). All movement results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. For brevity, not all statistical tests are reported in the main text, as many of the outcomes are similar; for example, stimuli that were designated as 'moving'</p><p>were rated as more likely to move, and move more quickly, than those designated as 'still' by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref> in all questions <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>. Statistics for all comparisons and ANOVAs can be viewed on the online repository for this manuscript, and as A familiarity question was included as an attention check, and to replicate the familiarity task. As in the familiarity task, moving things were less familiar, as were natural Results per category for accuracy (A) and reaction time (B) in the aliveness classification task, familiarity judgements (C) and imageability (D). Moving stimuli are shown with diagonal hatching, natural things are green and artificial things are blue. Mean number of words recalled per category, across all experiments, is shown in (E). Individual markers show average recall per task. Participants also described what categories of objects they saw, after completing the task. These are combined into a word cloud in (F), where larger words were mentioned by more participants. things. Plants were less familiar than all other categories, and moving natural things were less familiar than all other categories except plants.</p></div>

As agency is clearly an important element of movement for classification, we asked participants separately about any kind of movement, and specifically about intrinsic, agentive, or selfdriven movement. When considering movement from any source, including external intervention like a human or gravity, artificial things were more likely to move overall, and move more quickly than natural things <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). However, when only considering intrinsic (self-driven) movement, the pattern was reversed; natural things were more likely to move independently, and move more quickly, than artificial things. Local movement was more similar to intrinsic global movement, such that natural things were more likely to move locally, and this movement was more independent.</p><p>Plants were less likely to change position than animals, and did so more slowly, both overall, and independently.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulability</head><p>How much an object is 'action-oriented', whether it is manipulable, and whether it moves or is stable, appears to be processed automatically by the visual system <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Magri et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mahon et al., 2007)</ref>, suggesting the way an object is manipulated is relevant to how it is processed and categorised by the brain. Therefore, we also queried the motor-relevance of objects by asking about how easy items were to manipulate. We found that still things were easier to manipulate than moving things, and artificial things were easier to manipulate than natural things. Most importantly, each category had a unique constellation of these characteristics, as shown by the different patterns across categories shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Correlations between the results of all four experiments, as well as other relevant measures. Spearman rank correlations were calculated item-wise. Coloured boxes indicate correlations that were significant after a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (p &lt; .00018). G&amp;T-S refers to the results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill's (2009)</ref> experiments with this same stimulus set, obtained from the supplementary materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>More familiar and imageable items are easier to judge in the aliveness task</head><p>To investigate whether factors like imageability and familiarity might influence performance in the aliveness task, we looked at the correlation between these attributes.</p><p>Performance in the aliveness classification task was correlated with both familiarity and imageability, such that things that were familiar and easier to visualise were responded to more accurately and more quickly. This can be seen at the category level in the similar pattern of results across <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>, 2C, and 2D. As expected from the similarity in response patterns, familiarity and imageability are also closely correlated. In addition, words with an earlier Age of Acquisition were also responded to more accurately and more quickly in the aliveness classification task, and were more familiar and easy to visualise. Together, these relationships suggest that less familiar words that are acquired later in life are more difficult to classify as alive or not, providing support for <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill's (2009)</ref> proposal that associations in childhood impact on adult categorisation behaviour.</p><p>Interestingly, concreteness was significantly correlated with reaction time, but not accuracy, in the aliveness classification task, such that more concrete things were responded to more quickly. As only reaction times for correct responses were included in measures of reaction time, this suggests that less concrete things are harder to classify by aliveness. The concrete things are also generally more familiar, and easier to visualise. However, the correlation between all of these measures is moderate (maximum r=0.45), reaffirming previous findings that though imageability and concreteness are related, they are not completely overlapping concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kousta et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individually, movement attributes are not correlated with accuracy in aliveness judgements</head><p>To investigate how the semantic and linguistic characteristics are related to each other and performance on the aliveness task, we looked at the correlations between them. Despite movement overall being an important variable in the aliveness judgement task, there were few significant correlations between the ratings of specific movement characteristics and performance on the aliveness task. Firstly, words with higher likelihood and independence of local movement were responded to less accurately in the aliveness classification, and were also recalled more often. Words with higher likelihood of intrinsic local movement were also more likely to be recalled. This is possibly driven primarily by animals, which were responded to accurately in the aliveness classification task, and also rated highly on local movement. Local movement may be the best correlate of accuracy in the aliveness task because the same division between living and non-living is reflected in both tasks: ratings of local movement reflect the divide between living and non-living things, with animals and plants primarily rated as more likely to have local movement and still artefacts and natural things as less likely to have local movement.</p><p>Overall, these correlations reveal that though there are differences in movement across different categories, a large portion of the results in both <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill's (2009)</ref> results and our replication can be attributed to the effects of familiarity and imageability, as well as word frequency, concreteness, and average Age of Acquisition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Memorability</head><p>As recent findings have shown categorical biases in recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bonin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Popp &amp; Serra, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">VanArsdall et al., 2017)</ref>, we also had participants recall as many words as they could at the end of the experiment. Results from recall are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. In all tasks, participants recalled more moving things than still things. For all tasks except for familiarity ratings, natural things were more also recalled more frequently than artificial things. For the aliveness classification task and the imageability task, plants were recalled more frequently than animals. Results are shown visually, for each experiment and on average in <ref type="figure">Figure 2E</ref>.</p><p>While there is some variation across experiments (individual markers), the general pattern across categories remains similar. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Over four experiments, we explored findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref> suggesting that adults rely on associations between movement and aliveness that are developed in childhood when making decisions about whether something is alive or not. We first replicated their results in Australian undergraduates, then demonstrated that familiarity and ease of visualisation differ across categories. Specifically, words that participants have difficulty classifying by aliveness, plants and moving natural things, are also less familiar and harder to visualise. We also show that associations between movement and aliveness are reflected in intuitions about the characteristics of movement in plants and moving natural things. Participants seem to intuitively believe that moving natural things can move without external intervention, and these moving natural things are less manipulable than other object categories. Overall, the findings suggest movement is an important part of object processing and our conceptual understanding of what it means to be alive. Differences in manipulability and global movement may explain why plants and moving natural things are more difficult to classify by aliveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plants and moving natural things are less familiar and harder to visualise.</head><p>The familiarity and visualisation ratings showed that words that were difficult to classify as living also tended to be less familiar and harder for participants to visualise. These measures also showed a similar pattern across categories to those in the aliveness classification task <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). Though ratings of familiarity for the available stimuli in previous corpuses are fairly similar across classes (e.g., ranging from 5/7 to 5.87/7 in the Glasgow Norms; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Scott et al., 2019)</ref>, almost half of the plant words are absent from these corpuses, suggesting that some of the effects here may be driven by the words obscure enough to not be in corpuses containing the most frequent words.</p><p>Though these findings point to a systematic effect of word familiarity and imageability on accuracy and reaction time in the aliveness classification, the correlations used here are unable to determine the directionality of this relationship. It is therefore unclear whether this result arises from this specific set of words, or something that is more intrinsic to a particular category. Individuals could be poor at classifying plants as alive because they are unfamiliar with them, but they could be unfamiliar with them because they are not the typical examples of living things. For example, it is possible that participants do not perceive these plants and moving natural things as 'objects' but as part of the environment, thus paying less attention to them and being less familiar with their attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Torres-Porras &amp; Alcántara-Manzanares, 2019)</ref>. A lack of knowledge about, and exposure to, these items may then make it more difficult to retrieve semantic information required to judge aliveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Monsell et al., 1989</ref>), leading to the decreased accuracy. Other linguistic and conceptual factors may also influence ratings of familiarity and imageability. For example, the decrease in imageability for moving natural things may also be a result being less concrete (e.g., fog, mist), as previous research has shown that concreteness is closely related to imageability <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kousta et al., 2011)</ref>. One way to address this in future research would be to use images instead of words as stimuli.</p><p>Plants lack global movement, separating them from human-centric concepts of aliveness.</p><p>The categories that were substantially different to others across all tasks were those which defy conventional associations between movement and aliveness, plants and moving natural things. These are the same items that participants had difficulties with in the aliveness task. Plants were not only harder to visualise and less familiar than other categories, but were also more memorable. As expected, plants show comparable likelihood of local movement to animals but less and slower global movement <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>. In addition to being less familiar, plant words tended to have a later age of acquisition ( <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure 1)</ref>. This is consistent with the hypothesis that developing an understanding that plants are living occurs later in development than animals because the animals pose a more immediate potential threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(New et al., 2007)</ref>, and plants do not move so decisions (e.g., whether to eat a given plant) are less urgent. It also supports theories of aliveness based on a human prototype <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Carey, 1985;</ref>, so things that don't change position with speed are further away from the prototype and therefore harder to classify <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Posner &amp; Keele, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rosch &amp; Mervis, 1975)</ref> .</p><p>Participants are aware that the plant words are difficult</p><p>Participants were cognisant of their own difficulties in classifying plants as living.</p><p>When asked if they had any observations after the aliveness classification task, several participants commented on the difficulty with plants, with one noting that "[i]t was difficult for me to categorise plants as living organisms…", and another observing that "I often did not include plants as living". Some participants also identified the difficulty with moving natural things in their comments, with one participant noting, "I seemed to respond 'living' to a number of non-living but natural features associated with nature and living things…".</p><p>Many participants were aware of their own difficulties, indicating that some of these effects were consistent enough to be conscious to participants.</p><p>Moving natural things are perceived to have agentive movement.</p><p>Moving natural things were difficult to classify in the aliveness task, less familiar, more difficult to visualise, and more memorable. Interestingly, participants rated moving natural things as having substantially more agentive or internally driven movement compared to other non-living things <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>, despite instruction to consider forces like gravity and wind as 'external intervention'. This was the case both for global movement (changing position), and for local movement (having moving parts, growing, changing shape).</p><p>Developmental researchers have suggested that these items are difficult for children because there is no clear agent intervening, and therefore they appear to move by themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gelman &amp; Gottfried, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Poulin-Dubois &amp; Heroux, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Richards &amp; Siegler, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sharp et al., 1985)</ref>. It is possible the same factors are driving adult intuition here, with some adults relying on 'intuitive biology' <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Atran &amp; Medin, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Coley et al., 2017)</ref> to judge agency when there is no obvious intervening agent, even without time pressure.</p><p>Memory was best for plants, animals, and moving natural things.</p><p>Prior work using free recall tasks has shown a clear advantage for animate recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bonin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Popp &amp; Serra, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">VanArsdall et al., 2017)</ref>, even when participants are not told they would be tested on recall as in the current study <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bonin et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Leding, 2018)</ref>. However, we found that while animals were often recalled well, plants and moving natural things were also frequently recalled by participants ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2E</ref>).</p><p>Though the results are slightly different across each experiment, this general pattern suggests that in addition to animates, we may also encode items that violate our assumptions of animacy more strongly (i.e., plants, which are alive but don't move and moving natural things that move but aren't alive). One possibility, given that the same categories that are difficult on the aliveness task, less familiar and harder to visualise are also the ones that are recalled best, is that these words are just viewed and processed for longer. However, memorability was not significantly correlated with viewing time in any task. While recent large-scale memorability work has shown that animacy is a good predictor of recall, it still only explains a small amount of variance in what we remember, and elements like size and usefulness for human survival also predict recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Madan, 2021)</ref>. Few other factors were significantly correlated with memorability. Familiar items were recalled better in the familiarity task, and items with global intrinsic movement, and local independent movement were recalled better the movement task <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>). Overall, while memorability ratings show that animates are remembered well, items that violate traditional associations between movement and aliveness also seem to be recalled well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical implications</head><p>Our results provide support for theories of continuous conceptual development from childhood to adulthood (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Eimas, 1994)</ref> and for models of aliveness such as the animisticanthropocentric model <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Yorek &amp; Narli, 2009)</ref> which have a human-centric conception of 'life status' and include movement as a key variable influencing this similarity to humans.</p><p>Neuroimaging studies have shown that models of animacy (including humans/ animals, excluding plants) capture neural activity better than models of aliveness (including plants) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Contini et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jozwik et al., 2022)</ref>. Our movement results suggest that this could be because plants move on a different global scale and frequency, the same explanation as others have provided for plant blindness <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Wandersee &amp; Schussler, 1999)</ref>. Processing movement alongside aliveness may be adaptive as it informs how we interact with an objectmanipulability judgements revealed that moving things were harder to pick up and move compared to still things.</p><p>Our results also provide support for views of conceptual development that are continuous, where intuitions from childhood are suppressed but not erased <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelemen et al., 2013)</ref>. In addition to replicating findings showing that movement continues to influence judgements of aliveness under time pressure in undergraduate students, we also showed that students believe that moving natural things can move independently. This dismissal of invisible forces relies on an intuitive physics, and demonstrates a pervasive influence of intuition even when there is no time pressure. Additionally, words with an earlier age of acquisition were also responded to more accurately and more quickly in the aliveness classification task, and were more familiar and easy to visualise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualifications</head><p>Though our results provide some potential explanations for the effects in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref> and affirm models of human-centric reasoning on aliveness, they must be considered with some caveats. Firstly, we only considered a small number of variables that could explain, or mediate, differences between categories. For example, realworld object size is related to manipulability, and has been shown as an important organising factor in the neural processing of objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Konkle &amp; Caramazza, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Long et al., 2019)</ref>, and therefore may mediate some of the relationships seen here. This seems likely, given that manipulability judgements varied so substantially across categories, and real-world size is closely related to whether an object is manipulable and stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Magri et al., 2021)</ref>. Secondly, our study is entirely based on this specific set of words used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref>, and future research should verify if the effects are still present for a different set of words or for images to determine if these effects are robust beyond this particular set of stimuli, particularly given our findings suggest there are several words that are unfamiliar and potentially problematic in this set. This, however, may be a challenging task. When we tried to re-run the experiment with different words, or simply replace those revealed to be problematically unfamiliar, we found that there were many fewer 'general' or basic-level words describing plants, and this proved a very difficult task. Indeed, in participants' observations, 'flowers' were noted as a stimulus category more often than plants more generally ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2F</ref>). The decreased familiarity with plants may indeed be reflected in, and reinforced by, the sparsity of terms in English to describe plants, particularly as Western, non-farming cultures tend to identify plants in categories like 'trees' rather than by specific names <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Berlin, 1972)</ref>. One way to resolve this, and remove potential linguistic influences or differences in imageability, would be to use images instead of words in future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Overall, our findings replicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg and Thompson-Schill (2009)</ref> and show that movement and aliveness are intrinsically linked in our understanding of the world. Moving natural things (e.g., planets, clouds) are perceived to have agency in their capacity for both local and global movement. The same items that children tend to make errors on, natural moving things like the sun and ocean, are even difficult for adults to perceive as moving in a non-agentive way. Differences in global movement may explain why plants are often neglected in our concept of living things. Together, our findings suggest that in the absence of top-down scientific knowledge, not only do we rely on associations between movement and aliveness that are developed in childhood, but these 'roots' of childhood understanding are more pervasive than originally proposed and occur even in the absence of time pressure.</p><p>Future work should look to replicate these findings with different stimuli to ensure the effects are not specific to the particular objects used here.</p><p>Within categories, there is considerable variation between items, with some items being difficult in all the experiments. For example, window and pencil are in the top 10 items for accuracy on the aliveness classification task (A), familiarity (B) and imageability (C). Poinsettia, hemlock, elm, and hyacinth are also all in the bottom 5 for the aliveness task (A), familiarity (B) and imageability (C). The gradient also visually displays the trend across tasks for the majority of stimuli to be responded to at ceiling level, with a few items driving categorical differences. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Figure 2</head><p>Many of the words in the plant category describe specific kinds of flowers. Participants were more likely to write 'flower' as a category of stimulus than 'plant' ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2F</ref>). We ran some quick checks to determine if flowers were quantitatively different from the other plants. There are no differences on age of acquisition (t(29) = 0.58, p = .56), imageability (t(29) = 1.89, p = .07), or familiarity (t(29) = 0.99, p = .32). Flowers differ in word frequency from the rest of the plants, t(29) = 2.97, p = 0.0060.</p></div>			</div>
