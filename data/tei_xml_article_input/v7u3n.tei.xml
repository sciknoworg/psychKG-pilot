<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) research has furthered understanding of human PMd function due to its unrivalled ability to measure the inhibitory and facilitatory influences of PMd over M1 in a temporally precise manner. Findings from TMS research indicate that PMd transiently modulates inhibitory output to effector representations within M1 during motor preparation depending on which effectors are selected for response, and that the timing of these modulations correlates with the cognitive demands of the task. In this review, we critically assess this literature within the context of prevailing theories of PMd function borne out of single/multi unit recording research in non-human primates. Through this process we identify gaps in the literature and propose future experiments to address lingering questions.</p></div>

Yet several questions regarding this putative neural mechanism remain and a comprehensive theoretical framework on which to base experimental predictions is lacking. Juxtaposing human brain stimulation studies with single unit recordings from PMd and M1 taken during motor task performance in non-human primates (NHP) may provide one avenue to bridge the remaining theoretical gaps and guide future experimentation.</p><p>Commonalities between the findings of these studies converge on rapid changes in PMd activity during motor preparation and show that preparatory activity correlates with kinematic features of motor responses.</p><p>The overall purpose of this review is to critically re-examine TMS literature investigating the role of PMd in voluntary movement production in the context of prevailing theoretical models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Box 1: Anatomical connectivity of PMd and M1</head><p>"Premotor cortex" is a term used to refer to the cortical regions just anterior to the precentral gyri, home of the primary motor cortex (M1). In general, premotor areas are thought to be involved in higher order aspects of movement planning and execution. The premotor cortex is typically separated into 4 subsections; the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), the ventral premotor cortex (PMv), the supplementary motor area (SMA), and the cingulate motor area (CMA). These distinctions are based on anatomical <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, histochemical <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, cytoarchitectural <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and neurophysiological <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> features.</p><p>Tracer studies allow researchers to investigate to what degree neurons in PMd are connected with neurons in M1 and other premotor regions. In one seminal study, the precise location of forelimb representations in M1 and PMd in the left cerebral hemisphere in Cebus monkeys was identified by applying intracortical microstimulation and measuring responses in forelimb musculature <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Retrograde tracers were then injected at each of these locations to establish anatomical connectivity between the two regions. ~50,000 cells per subject in premotor and parietal regions were labeled by the tracers.</p><p>Both M1 and PMd were shown to send and receive dense projections to and from one another (23-28% of labelled cells). M1 also received dense input from PMv (20% of labelled cells). Input to M1 from SMA was moderately dense (9.5% of labelled cells). PMd received moderately dense input from PMv (18.1% of labelled cells) and dense input from SMA (21.3% of labelled cells). Notably, PMv received moderately dense inputs from prefrontal regions of the cortex (13.5% of labelled cells), whereas PMd and M1 received almost none (0.8% of labelled cells). A later study largely replicated these findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>PMd and M1 are also interconnected with their counterparts in the opposite hemisphere, via the corpus callosum, although the number of cells in the contralateral hemisphere labeled by tracers is generally much lower than in the ipsilateral hemisphere [~50,000 vs.  Location of the hand region of primary motor cortex (M1) and the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in humans. The thickness of the black lines represents the density of connections between each region based on anatomical tracer studies in non-human primates. Ipsilateral connections between PMd and M1 are most dense, followed by homotopic transcallosal connections, followed by heterotopic transcallosal connections. Double stimulation TMS protocols can also be used to assess the engagement of inhibitory or facilitatory mechanisms in behavioural tasks, by programming TMS stimuli to arrive at specific points within a task and examining changes in the resulting MEP amplitudes relative to rest or across task conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PMd-M1 circuits and choice reaction time tasks</head><p>The modulation of PMd-M1 IHI and IHF was investigated across regular timepoints after the onset of an imperative stimulus in an auditory 2-choice RT task <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Participants responded with index fingers, and the tone of the imperative stimulus communicated which finger should produce the movement on a given trial. This design allowed for the collection of MEPs in selected and non-selected effectors. Subthreshold (80% AMT) and suprathreshold (110% RMT) conditioning stimuli were applied over PMd with an ISI of 8ms to assess the modulation of facilitatory and inhibitory interhemispheric circuits respectively. From left PMd to right M1, stimulation parameters that elicit IHF at rest produced significant facilitation in the selected effector exclusively at 75ms post imperative signal, while stimulation parameters that elicit IHI at rest resulted in significant inhibition in the non-selected effector exclusively at 100ms post imperative signal. From right PMd to left M1 a similar pattern was found for IHI, but not for IHF parameters, which remained neutral throughout the reaction time period, perhaps suggesting hemispheric asymmetry in how these circuits are modulated during movement selection. However, no evidence was found for facilitation of non-dominant PMd to dominant M1 with these stimulation parameters at rest, suggesting that the stimulation parameters needed to target this circuit may differ between hemispheres.</p><p>A similar pattern of modulation in PMd-M1 interhemispheric circuits was found across a visual choice reaction time task with 4 stimulus-response mappings <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Stimulation parameters which elicit PMd-M1 IHI at rest were shown to elicit IHF in the selected effector representation at 75ms post imperative stimulus, similar to the transient spike in PMd-M1 IHF discussed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. MEPs were collected for both hemispheres and no "hemisphere x stimulus onset asynchrony" interaction effect was found, suggesting that the effects were similar for both hemispheres. However, this study may have been underpowered to detect the interaction effect (F1,5 = 6.110, p = 0.056).</p><p>A similar auditory 2-choice RT study used custom TMS coils to measure intrahemispheric PMd-M1 facilitation in the dominant hemisphere and found that stimulation parameters which elicit PMd-M1 facilitation at rest were more facilitatory in the selected effector representation at 125ms compared to 100ms post imperative stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In contrast, PMd-M1 facilitation was reduced in the non-selected effector representation at 125ms post imperative stimulus compared to the selected effector representation. These results suggest that PMd-M1 interhemispheric circuits are active earlier in the reaction time period than intrahemispheric circuits and it could be the case that interhemispheric changes directly influence the observed changes in intrahemispheric circuits. However, it is not clear whether these circuits directly interact, and future studies using triple stimulation methods should investigate this outstanding question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PMd-M1 circuits and simple reaction time tasks</head><p>Similar to choice reaction time task, stimulation of PMd-M1 IHI during a simple reaction time task transiently facilitates the selected effector; however this facilitation occurs 25ms earlier than during choice reaction time tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. This finding is important because it suggests that the timing of task relevant changes in PMd-M1 interhemispheric circuits varies with the selection demands of the task. Other studies similarly observed that PMd-M1 IHI became facilitatory in the selected effector representation at 20% of participant mean reaction time (~40ms) post imperative visual stimulus during a simple reaction time task <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. This was in stark contrast to M1-M1 IHI, which released much closer to the onset of voluntary EMG activity (~180 ms post imperative stimulus), in agreement with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. Thus, the timing of task related changes early in the pre-movement period were specific to PMd and not a general property of cortical sensorimotor regions at large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PMd-M1 circuits and Go/NoGo tasks</head><p>Left PMd -right M1 interhemispheric circuits showed a similar pattern of modulation to RT tasks across performance of a Go/NoGo task <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Participants were instructed as to whether the upcoming movement would require movement of the left or right index finger, and after a delay period of 2s were displayed a visual "Go" or "NoGo" stimulus and responded accordingly. It was found that stimulation parameters which elicit PMd-M1</p><p>interhemispheric inhibition at rest became strongly facilitatory in the selected effector representation at 150ms post GO stimulus but remained inhibitory in the non-selected effector representation. PMd-M1 IHI was maintained throughout NoGo trials for both selected and non-selected representations. M1-M1 interhemispheric effects were also assessed and found to follow a similar pattern to PMd-M1 interhemispheric effects, although the transient switch to facilitation in the selected effector representation at 150ms post imperative stimulus on Go trials was less pronounced (110% versus 140% facilitation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PMd-M1 circuits prior to presentation of an imperative stimulus</head><p>Several studies have examined the modulation of PMd-M1 circuits prior to the onset of an imperative cue. During Go/NoGo trials, stimulation parameters which elicit PMd-M1</p><p>IHI at rest produced similar levels of inhibition in the selected effector at 300ms post presentation of the instructional cue which communicated which effector would perform the upcoming movement, but neither inhibition nor facilitation was present at 200ms prior to the presentation of the Go/NoGo stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. For the non-selected effector, neither</p><p>PMd-M1 IHI nor facilitation was present at either time point. During a simple RT task, the magnitude of right PMd-left M1 IHI present at 40ms prior to the onset of the imperative cue was similar to that found at rest <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>The influence of PMd on M1 during the preparation phase of a complex bimanual coordination task was investigated using a task which required participants to simultaneously rotate circular manipulanda using both of their index fingers to move a dot along a path on a computer monitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Different conditions of the task required that participants rotate their index fingers at different velocity ratios (3:1, 1:1, 1:3). The path for participants to trace with the dot was presented as a preparatory cue for 2s followed by the presentation an imperative stimulus, i.e., a white dot moving along the target path. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Making sense of PMd-M1 circuit modulations</head><p>Evidence for gating or a dynamical system? It is worth noting that corticospinal excitability as assessed by single stimulation TMS over M1 follows a similar temporal pattern to the changes observed in PMd-M1 IHI/IHF during motor preparation. During the instructed delay period of a simple reaction time task, MEPs are inhibited compared to those collected at rest in both selected <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and nonselected effectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. After the onset of the imperative stimulus, corticospinal excitability gradually ramps to higher than baseline levels in the selected effector <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> and decreases in non-selected effectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> as the onset of voluntary EMG activity draws near.</p><p>The similar timing of PMd-M1 effects and M1 corticospinal excitability modulation across the preparatory period raises the possibility that PMd input to M1 acts as a gate on corticospinal excitability during movement preparation. This 'representational perspective' conceptualizes preparatory activity in PMd and M1 is a subthreshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and/or gated <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> representation of the planned movement. Inhibition of the preparatory activity prevents early movement onset, and the release of inhibition results in movement initiation. Such a mechanism could theoretically be useful for maintaining separation between motor planning and motor execution processes, so that movements can be accurately selected and/or planned by areas upstream of corticospinal neurons without risk of any planned responses being prematurely read out into muscle activity.</p><p>However, intracranial recordings in macaques during the performance of an instructed delay reaching task do not support the existence of an inhibitory gate <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. This work showed no evidence for the recruitment of intracortical inhibitory interneurons during the preparatory delay period. Instead, NHP cortical activity has been more successfully modeled as a dynamical system with population level preparatory activity in PMd reflecting a temporary state of the motor system before it is "put in motion" <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, the primary visual cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, and the primary auditory cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> and some contend normalization represents a "canonical neural computation" used throughout the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p><p>The example of normalization is invoked here not to suggest that the transient changes in PMd-M1 inhibitory circuits discussed in this review necessarily reflect the implementation of normalization in the motor system, but merely to showcase that transient changes in the states of inhibitory circuits in the motor system need not entail the literal suppression/facilitation of motor responses. Instead, these changes in the output of inhibitory circuits could be one component of a larger overarching computation which itself facilitates movement. This is particularly important to bear in mind with TMS/EMG data since it is known that the indices of neural activity captured by single and double stimulation TMS encapsulates only a fraction of total ongoing neural activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Temporal correlations between PMd-M1 circuit modulations and condition invariant signals</head><p>A cardinal feature of the CIS is that it arrives ~150 to ~280ms before movement onset and is highly predictive of reaction time on individual trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. Therefore, if PMd-M1 modulation occur in the wake of an external CIS, then we would expect a similar relationship between the timing of PMd-M1 circuit modulations and RT across a given RT task paradigm. While not all the previously described TMS studies report average reaction times, the available data hint at a correlation between PMd-M1 circuit modulations and RT. For example, studies using a simple reaction time task show that PMd-M1 IHI modulation occurs at 40-50ms after the imperative stimulus, about 150ms before typical reaction time for this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Similarly, studies using 2-choice reaction time tasks</p><p>show that the switch from PMd-M1 IHI to IHF occurs at 75-100ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, with reaction time in these tasks typically falling in the range of 150-280ms after this time period. The single published study examining PMd-M1 modulation during a visual Go/NoGo task was conducted in the same lab that investigated this circuit during an auditory 2-choice reaction time task, and they report that reaction times were slightly longer in the Go/NoGo task <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In line with this longer RT, a switch in PMd-M1 modulation was found later in the RT period, at 150ms post presentation of the imperative stimulus.</p><p>While these data generally fit well with the timing of CIS onset found in non-human primate single neuron recording studies, it should be stressed that most of the TMS studies were conducted in different laboratories, using different stimulation parameters to evoke PMd-M1 IHI/IHF and different criteria for targeting PMd. Furthermore, one study using a 4-choice reaction time test with 2 possible responses and 4 stimulus-response mappings did not fit the timeframe outlined by the single neuron recording studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Here, a release of PMd-M1 IHI was found exclusively at 75ms post imperative stimulus onset, while a mean reaction time of ~700ms was reported, well beyond even a liberal estimate of the timeframe for CIS onset. If PMd-M1 modulation reflects the action of CIS, then it is not clear why they would occur so early in this task. One possibility is that the temporal profile for CIS onset is different with a 4-choice reaction time task. Perhaps a more likely possibility is that this particular experiment simply did not sample MEPs far enough into the reaction time period to capture the true onset of the CIS. The latest timepoint at which MEPs were sampled was 150ms after the onset of the imperative stimulus, where data from non-human primate studies would place the CIS occurring 400-550ms post imperative stimulus in a task that evoked an RT of 700ms on average. However, it is also worth considering with available evidence how valid it is to draw comparisons between these two distinct approaches to measuring neural activity. In single neuron recording studies, on the order of 100s of neurons are typically included in data analysis, and neuronal activity is recorded either one by one using a single electrode or by implanting a 100-electrode array into the cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. In the case of single electrode recordings, neurons are typically selected according to whether or not they show preparatory tuning during performance of the behavioural task of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Similarly, neuronal activity data collected through 100-electrode arrays are usually not included in analyses unless they show some degree of preparatory tuning. M1, for example, has approximately 138,000 cells/mm 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, many of which do not show preparatory tuning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drawing parallels between single neuron recordings and TMS derived MEPs</head><p>Therefore, the selection bias inherent to single neuron recording studies means that such studies do not capture the gross activity of a given brain region per se, but rather the activity of a narrow subset of neurons within that brain region.</p><p>In contrast to this, the MEPs evoked by TMS which are used to infer neural activity in motor and premotor regions are the result of the stimulation of a much larger number of neurons, some of which synapse onto the corticospinal neurons whose activation ultimately produces the change in muscle activity observed using EMG. Other cortical and subcortical mechanisms downstream from the cortical site of stimulation can also independently influence MEP characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>. By its very nature then, TMS generates a record of cortical neuronal activity in a much more non-specific manner than single neuron recording studies. Indeed, while a recent study found that a single pulse of TMS reliably evokes action potentials within a remarkably restricted circular area with a diameter of just 2mm, it was also found that at least a third of all recorded neurons showed some excitatory or inhibitory response to a single pulse of TMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. This puts a conservative estimate of the total number of neurons affected by TMS at least on the order of tens of thousands.</p><p>Given the clear discrepancy in the number of neurons contributing to these two measures of neural activity, insights related to motor preparation gathered from both methods need not have a direct one-to-one relationship with one another. So, while we have outlined similarities in the time course of PMd-M1 intercortical circuit modulation during motor preparation shown in TMS studies and changes in neuronal firing rates across motor preparation shown in single neuron recording studies, it may be the case that these similarities are superficial, and that both methods are measuring distinct processes.</p><p>Ultimately, in order to effectively bridge the knowledge gap between TMS and single neuron recording studies, more research which combines the two approaches is required.</p><p>For example, if TMS does tap into a similar set of neurons to those captured in single neuron recording studies, then one would expect application of TMS to PMd or M1 should perturb the trajectories of population dynamics, at least transiently. Studies of this nature will ultimately inform us of the extent to which the application of theoretical accounts derived from single neuron recordings to TMS data is a productive endeavour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding remarks</head><p>TMS research has made significant contributions to our understanding of the functional role of PMd in action preparation. Well controlled experiments have led to the discovery of inhibitory and excitatory circuits between bilateral PMd and M1. This knowledge in turn has allowed researchers to investigate how the balance of excitation and inhibition between these cortical regions changes across motor preparation, with a degree of temporal specificity unrivalled by other non-invasive brain imaging techniques.</p><p>While significant progress has been made, the field could benefit from a more comprehensive theoretical framework to better explain existing disparate findings and guide future experimentation. NHP single cell experimental research and associated computational modelling motivate future directions. One influential hypothesis models PMd population activity as a dynamical system <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>, and key to this hypothesis is the notion of a change in state of cortical activity from output-null to orthogonal output-potent spaces after the onset of the condition invariant signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>Transient modulations in PMd-M1 circuits captured by dsTMS during the pre-movement periods of RT tasks may reflect a change in state of PMd activity from output-null to output-potent dimensions after the onset of a CIS. Conceiving of PMd-M1 circuits in this manner allows us to make a strong prediction that the timing of PMd-M1 modulations correlates with reaction time, for which there is some support in the existing literature.</p><p>However, some studies do not fit neatly with this hypothesis, and a comprehensive investigation is required (see Outstanding Questions).</p><p>Answering these questions about the fundamental role of PMd in motor control will be vital in improving clinical treatment of brain disease and injury. The finding that interhemispheric pathways appear to play a functional role in defining the kinematics and timing of simple movements is particularly relevant to stroke, which typically results in lateralized injury to the sensorimotor regions of the brain. Existing MRI literature has already shown that structural integrity of interhemispheric pathways connecting premotor and prefrontal cortices correlates with motor impairment in chronic stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, while functional connectivity between contralesional PMd and ipsilesional M1 correlates with motor recovery after stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, suggesting an important role for PMd in stroke rehabilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. While a wealth of research has applied dsTMS to investigate interhemispheric M1-M1 circuits in stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, activity, more research which combines the two approaches is required to understand the degree to which they measure common neural processes.</p><p>How is PMd-M1 circuit modulation during motor preparation affected by brain injury and disease? Activity in PMd-M1 circuits may be critical to the production of externally guided movements, but it is currently unknown how they are disrupted by injuries and diseases affecting the motor system and if they correlate with motor deficits measured using clinical assessments.</p><p>How does modulatory activity in PMd-M1 circuits during motor preparation change across recovery of motor function in stroke? Many studies have shown a relationship between changes in M1-M1 interhemispheric circuits and recovery of motor function after stroke, but it is unknown how PMd-M1 circuits vary across the same period, and how they correlate with changes in motor deficits measured using clinical assessments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>~2,500] [14,16].

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Box 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Transcranial magnetic stimulation methods for the investigation of cortical circuits Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive electrophysiological technique that enables stimulation of cortical tissue through the intact scalp of conscious participants. A short latency electrical pulse (~200 us) of up to 5 kA is induced in a stimulation coil positioned over the scalp of a participant. This pulse generates a magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of the coil, which penetrates the scalp and induces an electrical current in the cortex perpendicular to the magnetic field. When applied over the primary motor cortex (M1), TMS can elicit descending volleys of activity within corticospinal (CS) projection neurons, which activate spinal motoneurons predominantly contralateral to the site of stimulation. The activation of spinal motoneurons can evoke a twitch in a targeted muscle or group of muscles, which can be recorded using electromyography (EMG) in the form of a "motor evoked potential" (MEP). MEPs typically have a bipolar shape, and the amplitude, duration, and latency of MEPs are used to assess corticospinal output. Double stimulation TMS (dsTMS) paradigms are used to isolate the influence of a specific cortical or subcortical region on CS output. With this approach two consecutive stimuli are administered either through two TMS coils positioned over different regions to determine the effect of the first conditioning stimulus on the readout of the second test stimulus. Typically, a conditioning TMS stimulus is delivered 1-100ms before a test TMS stimulus. By expressing the amplitude of dsTMS MEPs as a percentage of the amplitude of MEPs generated by a test TMS stimulus alone, it is possible to assess whether the distal cortical region of interest has an inhibitory or facilitatory influence on corticospinal output. When the conditioning stimulus is delivered over a cortical region contralateral to the M1 test stimulus (e.g. conditioning stimulus over contralateral M1 or contralateral PMd) and results in a reduced MEP amplitude relative to single-pulse M1 TMS, the effects are referred to as interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) [19]. Conversely, an increase in MEP amplitude resulting from similar bilateral positioning of TMS coils is referred to as interhemispheric facilitation (IHF) [20]. Adjusting stimulation parameters such as conditioning stimulus intensity and interstimulus interval (ISI) can preferentially target inhibitory or facilitatory transcortical circuits.</figDesc></figure>

MEPs elicited by TMS over M1 are captured by continuous EMG recording of the effector(s) of interest. Double stimulation TMS parameters can be varied to target specific inhibitory and facilitatory neural circuits. (B) MEPs can be sampled at rest (1) or at different points within a trial of a behavioural task. For example, MEPs could be collected prior to the onset of an imperative "GO" stimulus (2), or after the onset of an imperative stimulus but before the onset of reaction time related EMG activity (3), (4).

This is achieved by programming TMS stimuli to be delivered at different points during behavioural tasks and tracking how the resultant MEPs change across time(Figure 2). To date, this approach has been used with simple reaction time tasks, choice reaction time tasks, Go/No Go tasks, and bimanual coordination tasks(Figure 3).</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head>A</head><label></label><figDesc>relatively consistent picture of how PMd-M1 circuitry is modulated during preparation and initiation of externally guided simple movements has emerged from this collection of TMS studies. When individuals are actively preparing a motor response, PMd-M1 IHI to the selected effector is maintained or increased up until the onset of the imperative stimulus. After the onset of the imperative stimulus, PMd-M1 IHI to the selected effector is briefly released while PMd-M1 IHF to the selected effector is briefly increased, with the timing of these rapid circuit modulations occurring relatively early in the reaction time period and depending on the selection demands of the task. Concurrent with this facilitation of the selected effector, PMd-M1 IHI to non-selected effectors is maintained or increased. The temporal pattern of PMd-M1 IHI/IHF modulation stands in contrast to other inhibitory circuits such as M1-M1 IHI, which is released much closer in time to the onset of voluntary EMG activity. These temporally specific effects support the interpretation that PMd TMS reveals regionally specific effects and furthermore suggests PMd is engaged before M1 during response preparation in a variety of behavioral task contexts.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>reasons to proceed with caution Despite some inconsistencies, as we have outlined above, reconsidering results from TMS studies that use single and double stimulation methods to index changes in intercortical circuits as movements are prepared in the context of the emerging theories in the single-neuron recording literature may provide a fruitful avenue for explaining the available data and planning future investigations. Indeed, a series of recent TMS studies investigating fluctuations in corticospinal excitability during motor preparation explicitly designed in response to these emergent theories have yielded interesting results that may push the field in productive new directions [64-66] .</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_8"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>areas outside M1 including PMd have received relatively little attention in the field. Applying dsTMS techniques to investigate PMd-M1 circuits across movement preparation in parallel with continued investigations in healthy populations will help to inform basic questions about the role of PMd in motor control and provide opportunities to identify biomarkers for recovery and therapeutic response that could improve rehabilitation outcomes after stroke. Outstanding Questions What is the relationship between the timing of PMd-M1 circuit modulation during motor preparation and reaction time? While available data generally indicate that the timing of PMd-M1 IHI/IHF modulation fit well with the timing of CIS onset found in non-human primate single neuron recording studies, inconsistencies within the existent literature point to a need for a more systematic investigation. Future studies could vary the number of choices available within an RT task and examine patterns of PMd-M1 circuit modulation across the reaction time period. If it is assumed that PMd-M1 circuit modulations reflect the action of a CIS as described by the dynamical systems framework, added choices should add more processing time and therefore push the timing of transient PMd-M1 modulations later into the post-imperative/pre-movement time period. Perturbing PMd circuits with repetitive TMS protocols should influence both the modulatory changes in PMd-M1 circuits, corticospinal excitability, and RTs, offering another avenue for further hypothesis testing. Are indices of PMd population activity captured by single unit recording studies comparable to indices of PMd activity captured by double stimulation TMS? Given the large discrepancy in the number of neurons contributing to these two measures of neural</figDesc></figure>

There was no interaction effect of long (40ms) vs. short (8ms) latency ISI and no effects were observed for TMS in the right PMd -left M1 direction, again hinting at hemispheric asymmetry in the influence of PMd on M1. Collectively, these findings suggest PMd influences M1 during response preparation on a variety of tasks.</figDesc><table /><note>Stimulation parameters which elicit long (40ms ISI) and short (8ms ISI) PMd-M1 IHI at rest were sampled at the presentation of the path cue and 50ms prior to the onset of the imperative stimulus.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>and generates movement. In this framework, preparatory activity in PMd neurons need not have a one-to-one mapping with execution related activity but could still predict kinematic aspects of upcoming movements. One influential hypothesis that has emerged from this dynamical system framework is that preparatory activity resides in an output-null neural subspace that transitions to an orthogonal output-potent subspace during movement initiation<ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. Motor cortical activity in the output-null subspace is hypothesized to cancel out at the level of the muscles, with a similar process possibly governingcommunication between brain regions, including PMd to M1. The null-space hypothesis offers an eloquent solution to many of the challenges faced by representational perspectives on motor preparation, and it is worth reconsidering TMS studies of PMd-M1 connectivity across motor preparation in light of its predictions. If the observed patterns of PMd-M1 IHI/IHF during response preparation and initiation do not reflect the activity of a gating mechanism, then perhaps they instead reflect the arrival of a condition invariant signal (CIS) in PMd that prompts a state change in PMd population activity from output-null to output-potent dimensions which subsequently drives a change in M1 dynamics and produces movement. A limitation of the kind of single-neuron recording studies that led to the development of the null-space hypothesis is that the connectivity between the recorded neurons is frequently unknown, making it difficult to establish the direction of communication across sub-populations of neurons. Yet by applying this method for identifying output-null and output-potent spaces, it was shownthat PMd may also exert control over M1 dynamics by shifting M1 activity between these orthogonal subspaces<ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Such shifts may be underpinned by activity in the same PMd-M1 circuits probed with the dsTMS protocols reviewed here. If we were to only observe the activity of ORNs and lateral inhibitory cells, we might conclude that the function of this inhibition is to reduce firing in competing ORNs and allow the active ORN to feed-forward information about the active odor to the olfactory cortex. However, concurrent recording of ORN and PN combined with deactivation of lateral inhibition using GABA antagonists reveals that the function of lateral inhibition is better described as modulating the gain of the input-output function between ORN firing rate and PN firing rate<ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. This has the effect of normalizing ORN input to the total activity level of all active ORNs, which decorrelates activity in PN and ultimately improves discrimination between odors in upstream Kenyon cells (KCs), which integrate input from multiple ORNs. The process of normalization is found in other sensory systems, including the retina</figDesc><table><row><cell>Box 3.
