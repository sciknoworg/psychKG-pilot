				<p>Assessing a parent&apos;s ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for their children is a challenging task for child welfare workers. Given the complex and indefinite nature of parenting, decision-makers often rely on subjective criteria in their evaluations. In Study 1 (N = 49), we examined the variability among child welfare professionals as they independently assessed the overall quality of care in ten vignettes, each depicting different scenarios. We found an inter-rater reliability of .50, indicating a concerning level of unwanted variability (&apos;noise&apos;), with 24.7 % of the variance attributable to average differences between raters. This suggests that raters have different thresholds for what constitutes unsafe parenting. In Study 2 (N = 44), we examined whether aggregating domainspecific evaluations would reduce noise, but the resulting improvement in inter-rater reliability to .54 was not statistically significant. We found 28.7 % level noise after aggregating. We conclude that noise-reduction strategies are appropriate and necessary to improve the consistency of assessments in child welfare decisions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Child protection agencies play an essential role in safeguarding children's rights and ensuring their well-being. This dual mandate involves protecting children from serious harm while also being cautious not to intrude excessively into private family life. This delicate act of balancing requires utmost professionalism at every step of decision-making. A significant challenge for child welfare service agencies is discerning between children genuinely in need of protection and those who are not. Two primary errors can occur in this process -intervening when unnecessary or overlooking a genuine need for intervention. In the field of child welfare services, the principle of erring on the side of safety, commonly applied in other risk management contexts, is complicated by the fact that both intervention and non-intervention carry distinct risks and potential harms. While the risks of nonintervention may disproportionately affect the child and the reputation of the profession, the harms of unnecessary interventions falls heavily on families including children and particularly those from marginalized groups. This dynamic helps sustain a bias towards avoiding errors of non-intervention over those of intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Wilkins &amp; Meindl, 2024)</ref>. The decision-making landscape in child protection is also notably intricate. Numerous factors come into play, each accompanied by its own set of uncertainties. Every decision must be definitive, consolidating a broad range of elements into a singular action. In such complex scenarios, variability in decision-making is bound to emerge, as child welfare workers are compelled to rely to a greater or lesser extent on their intuitions as well as procedures and evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Munro, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Several investigations have shown that ensuring consistency and accuracy in child welfare decision making represents a formidable challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Benbenishty et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Keddell, 2017)</ref>. In their review, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hood et al. (2022)</ref> summarize research on child welfare decision making into five categories: Accuracy (whether a judgment is correct given some corroborating evidence), consistency (whether judgments are consistent across raters and time), outcomes (whether judgments leads to improved outcomes), practice (whether a judgment is in agreement with best-practice procedures) and equity (whether judgments are unfairly impacted by information regarding social or demographic group membership). Child welfare decision making can also be understood in terms of statistical decisionmaking theory where errors are either due to bias or noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Lwin &amp; Beltrano, 2022)</ref>. A biased judgement is when many evaluators converge on an erroneous judgement. A forecasting study allows researchers to assess whether a given forecast matches with reality after the fact. For example, you can ask social workers to predict whether a child will go into care, or whether a closed referral will be re-opened within a defined period and compare their predictions with the outcome to calculate accuracy and measure bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Meindl and Wilkins, 2021)</ref>. Noise, on the other hand, refers to the spread of the distribution of judgements. Judgements are noisy if there is variability in ratings that should be identical. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rustad et al. (2022)</ref> found substantial variability in the threshold for investigating referrals to child welfare services between different Norwegian counties. Previous research indicates that child welfare decisions can be both biased and noisy. In a series of publications, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Wilkins and Meindl (2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, 2023</ref> explored the forecasting accuracy of child welfare workers by examining their predictions about the likelihood of various future actions and events. The studies overall conclusion is that average forecasts are close to chance-level, the theoretically lowest accuracy for random forecasts. In addition, child welfare workers tend to overestimate the likelihood of adverse outcomes, perhaps to prioritize the avoidance of missing genuine cases of abuse, thus erring on the side of false positive errors over false negatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Wilkins &amp; Meindl, 2023</ref>. This research is based on vignette studies, which involve creating brief, anonymized descriptions of hypothetical cases for analysis.</p><p>One double-edged feature of forecasting studies is the use of real-life outcomes as a measuring stick. Given the ubiquity of noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Kahneman et al., 2021)</ref>, while there is inherent validity in assessing forecasts made by child welfare workers in relation to a court decision or a clinical assessment, the measuring stick itself is unreliable. A crime might not be reported, a judge might not evaluate an action as a crime, and domestic abuse might be concealed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Austin &amp; Thomas, 1977)</ref>. This is well-documented in many aspects of the legal system, such as UK assessment of asylum seekers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Burridge &amp; Gill, 2017)</ref>. Researchers and practitioners face a fundamental challenge in evaluating bias in child welfare decisions, as absolute truth is often unknowable and, in some cases, may not exist objectively. In contrast, noise is easier to measure, objectively true, and always a source of error.</p><p>A recent study shows that variability between different child welfare workers is a key component of erroneous decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lwin et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we quantify the amount and nature of statistical noise by comparing the assessment of several professional child-welfare workers with identical information. We aim to answer the following research questions. First, how much noise is present in the assessments of realistic, yet fictitious vignettes made by Norwegian child welfare workers? Vignette studies involve presenting respondents with standardized case descriptions that simulate real-world decision-making scenarios, allowing researchers to isolate variation in judgments that arises from individual differences rather than case-specific factors. In child welfare research, vignette studies are frequently used to examine inconsistencies in professional assessments, identify sources of discretionary variation, and evaluate the impact of background characteristics, training, and contextual influences on decision-making. Our study builds on similar investigations conducted in the UK and the US <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lwin et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wilkins &amp; Meindl, 2022)</ref> that document a high prevalence of noise in child welfare assessments. However, child welfare systems differ significantly across countries in terms of legal frameworks, professional discretion, and decision-making structures. This study contributes to the literature by being the first to examine statistical noise in a Nordic context, where child welfare services are characterized by a high degree of professional autonomy. Secondly, while previous research has demonstrated high levels of noise, we aim to expand on this by decomposing it into level noise and pattern noise. Level noise is composed of the variability that can be captured by the means of each rater, e.g. if a rater is distinguished by overall leniency towards parents across cases. In contrast, pattern noise is the idiosyncratic noise that arise across rates and different vignettes. This distinction is important because addressing level noise and pattern noise requires different strategies. Thirdly, does breaking the global assessments down into smaller, domain-specific assessments reduce the noise? This idea builds on findings from other fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arkes et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kahneman et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yu &amp; Kuncel, 2020)</ref>, which suggest that global evaluations-those that cover multiple aspects of an issue-tend to exhibit higher levels of noise compared to disaggregated assessments broken into specific sub-components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>This study was conducted within a cross-county division of the Norwegian Child Welfare Services. Child welfare workers from a total of 11 counties participated in two surveys. All participants were actively employed as child welfare workers at the time of the study. The majority held a bachelor's degree in child welfare or a related field (94 %), while a minority had a master's degree (6 %). The first survey was completed by all counties within one month, while the second survey was conducted six months later. Participation in the study was voluntary but encouraged by the heads of the local offices. To ensure consistency, the lead author traveled to each county to distribute paper-based questionnaires. Participants were presented with ten realistic yet fictitious vignettes. The two Norwegian authors created the vignettes together with three heads of agency, all of whom have decades of experience from child welfare work. The aim was to ensure realism of the descriptions while retaining anonymity. The vignettes were designed to span a range of severity and encompass various domains of child welfare concerns. For instance, one vignette included a lengthy and detailed description of a caseworker's suspicions of violence and mistreatment. Another vignette consisted of a brief referral from a kindergarten, providing minimal information apart from observations of a child exhibiting worrisome behavior. All three heads of agencies agreed that the vignettes were realistic, and a fair representation of the varied decisions child welfare workers faced in the field. The same ten vignettes were evaluated by participants in both Survey 1 and Survey 2. All vignettes were originally written in Norwegian. Both the original Norwegian and AI-translated English versions are available in the supplementary appendix. Survey 1 and 2 had almost no missing data (1.6 % and 0.57 % of responses respectively). Participants were requested not to discuss their evaluations or the vignette materials with one another until after the completion of the second survey</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey 1</head><p>Participants (N = 49) were first asked to provide a global care evaluation for each vignette using an integer scale from 1 to 9, where the endpoints were defined as follows: 1 = Severe neglect, and 9 = Normal care. Next, they were asked to indicate whether they believed that child welfare services should initiate an investigation. Finally, participants were asked to evaluate the potential effectiveness of child welfare interventions in improving the situation, using a scale from 1 to 9, where 1 = Not effective and 9 = Very effective. Our motivation for including the effectiveness of intervention assessment was to ensure that global care evaluations were isolated from participants' beliefs about the effectiveness of potential interventions. For example, in situations of severe neglect, we wanted respondents to clearly distinguish between their assessment of the care situation itself and their belief about whether the situation could be improved through child welfare interventions, allowing these to be captured as two separate and distinct responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey 2</head><p>In the second survey (N = 44), the global care evaluation was replaced with more detailed assessments across specific domains of concern, for example in relation to alcohol or drug misuse, poor interpersonal skills, risk of violence or sexual abuse, and parental mental health problems. For each domain, participants rated their level of concern on an integer scale from 1 (Not at all worried) to 9 (Extremely worried) as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Each domain was accompanied by a brief descriptor. For example, the domain "alcohol and drug misuse" was described as: "Concerns whether caregivers use alcohol or other substances and the extent to which this may impact the child and the caregivers' ability to provide care". Next, we calculated the average rating for each vignette across multiple domains, rounding the results to the nearest integer. Four vignettes included ratings across four domains, three vignettes had ratings across five domains, and three vignettes had ratings across three domains. The rounded mean of the ratings for each vignette was then used as a proxy for a global care assessment. Both the original Norwegian questionnaires and AI-translated English versions are available in the supplementary materials.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>We started by plotting the data for each vignette using histograms. This provided an overview of the noise represented by the varied assessments, highlighting the spread of ratings across cases. Visualizing the data in this way allowed us to identify patterns of variability and assess the extent of disagreement among raters. Next we utilized Gwet AC2 to measure inter-rater reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Gwet, 2014)</ref>. The benefits of this procedure are its robustness to missing data and its flexibility in handling various data structures. Unlike traditional measures such as Cohen's kappa or weighted kappa, which can be overly sensitive to marginal distributions, Gwet's AC2 provides more stable reliability estimates, even when the prevalence or distribution of scores varies among raters. Our data included a continuous scale ranging from 1 to 9, and Gwet's AC2 allowed us to apply different weighting schemes to account for the nature of the ratings. Specifically, we applied linear weights to model the severity of disagreements in the ratings. The ability to flexibly implement ordinal, linear, or quadratic weighting schemes ensures that the measure of reliability aligns with the conceptual importance of rater agreement within our study context. This feature is particularly valuable when the distance between ratings carries a meaningful interpretation, as it does in our scale. There are no universal interpretation standards for Gwet's AC2, as the context of decision-making is crucial. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Landis and Koch (1977)</ref> provide the following interpretation for Cohen's Kappa, a similar reliability measure: values below 0.00 indicate poor agreement, 0.00-0.20 suggest slight agreement, 0.21-0.40 fair agreement, 0.41-0.60 moderate agreement, 0.61-0.80 substantial agreement, and 0.81-1.00 indicate almost perfect agreement. Given the potentially serious consequences of child welfare decisions, which may include removal of the child from their family home, it can be argued that these services should aim for consistently high reliability rates.</p><p>To estimate the degree of level noise in our dataset, we followed the approach outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kahneman et al. (2021)</ref>. Level noise represents the variability in judgments attributable to systematic differences in the mean ratings given by individual raters, regardless of the specific vignettes being evaluated. Total noise was calculated as the average variance of ratings across vignettes, capturing the overall variability in the dataset. To compute level noise, we calculated the mean rating for each rater across all vignettes and calculated the variance of these mean ratings. This variance represents the level noise, which was expressed as a proportion of the total noise by dividing the variance of the rater means by the total noise. This procedure is equivalent to performing an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to quantify the proportion of variability attributable to raters. Rater and case effects are fixed factors, and the sum of squares associated with raters, reflect the variability in their mean judgments. This value can then be divided by the sum total of the rater sums of squares and the residual sum of squares. Both methods produced consistent estimates of the proportion of variability explained by level noise. The data and all analysis scripts for this study are available at the Open Science Framework (OSF). See https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/A9NQ2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We found that the care assessments had a substantial degree of noise, with large differences between vignettes. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, some of the vignettes are difficult to distinguish from a random selection on a nine-item scale. The average ratings, across vignettes, from experiment 1 and 2 were also similar (5.78 and 5.43 respectively). We also found that the proportion of level noise was high with 24.7% in Experiment 1 and 28.7% in Experiment 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2 Histograms of Judgements</head><p>The inter-rater reliability was .501 for Experiment 1 (95% CI [.399, .603]) and .543 for Experiment 2 (95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.466, .620]</ref>). To statistically compare the relative effectiveness of domain-specific assessments (Experiment 2) with global assessments (Experiment 1) on inter-rater reliability, we conducted a bootstrap analysis. Random sampling with replacement yielded a 95 % confidence interval of -0.05 to 0.13, indicating no significant improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Variability in child welfare decision-making is well-documented, but this study is the first to specifically quantify the extent of noisy evaluations in child welfare service assessment. There is strong justification to believe that while some variation is inevitable <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Munro, 2019)</ref> -and even beneficial in certain contexts-noisy variation represents an undesirable inconsistency that undermines the quality and fairness of decision-making. Recognizing that absolute truth is often unknowable, it is particularly important to focus on noise, which can be objectively measured and reduced. Our findings also revealed that a substantial portion of the noise stemmed from level noisethe variability in judgments driven by systematic differences in the mean ratings of individual raters, independent of the specific vignettes being evaluated. This is important because level noise is more amenable to reduction compared to stochastic, unidentified noise. To mitigate level noise, workers could compare their independent ratings with those of their peers to better understand their own rating tendencies relative to others. This strategy has been implemented in other settings such as police decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Wire et al., 2024)</ref>. Receiving comparative feedback, such as being informed that one is consistently and significantly less likely to recommend intervention or investigation than peers, serves as a clear example of how such insights could provide a strong foundation for revising assumptions and fostering productive discussions with co-workers. Conducting a noise audit is relatively straightforward, requiring only a series of independent quantitative assessments of a vignette or case file. The greater challenge lies in convincing stakeholders of the value of quantifying noise and how to manage subsequent feedback, as this necessitates systemic changes that are often difficult to implement as well as potentially challenging professional self-perceptions and indeed deciding whether the workers who are 'more lenient' or 'less lenient' are the ones who need to change <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Munro, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to noise audits, standardized procedures and assessments provide a promising approach to reducing noise. However, efforts to implement standardized practices in child welfare decision-making often encounter substantial challenges and resistance from practitioners -a response that is understandable given the importance of professional discretion in this field. However, other professions, such as psychiatry and criminal justice, have successfully implemented more standardized approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berk et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Meehan et al., 2022)</ref>. This raises the question of whether there are lessons to be learned from these fields-not necessarily about the mechanics of creating standardization, but about the cultural strategies for introducing it in ways that align with practitioners' professional values and goals. Such approaches could help practitioners view standardization not as a constraint, but as a tool to enhance their ability to achieve positive outcomes. In the field of employee selection, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Nolan &amp; Highhouse (2014)</ref> demonstrate experimentally that the need for autonomy is a driving force behind resistance against standardization, despite improving decision-making. There is an inherent imbalance in standardization efforts: noise often goes unnoticed, making its negative impact less visible, while attempts to reduce noise, such as implementing guidelines, training programs, or peer comparisons, are highly conspicuous. In many ways, this reflects the situation in social work practice, in which the harms caused by errors of nonintervention are often tragic and highly salient, compared with the more diffuse and over-looked harms caused by errors of over-intervention. As a result of this imbalance, potentially valuable interventions to improve the quality of decision-making may be erroneously rejected. Addressing the imbalance requires transparent communication about the presence and consequences of noise, alongside collaborative approaches to implementing noise-reduction strategies that respect and incorporate the perspectives of practitioners.</p><p>We did not find evidence that subdividing global decisions into sub-assessment reduces noise, which unexpected given the positive findings from other fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arkes et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yu &amp; Kuncel, 2020)</ref>. Disaggregating global, undefined decisions into clearly operationalized sub-assessments is widely considered a gold standard for noise reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Kahneman et al., 2021)</ref>. Our findings may reflect the unrefined nature of the sub-assessments. For instance, asking respondents to rate the level of concern regarding alcohol use requires them to define what constitutes concern, which may be no easier than providing a global assessment of care capacity. Despite these results, carefully breaking down and operationalizing decisions remains a prudent approach to reducing noise that remains worthy of further study. Future research should focus on refining these methods to provide decisionmakers with tools that effectively minimize noise.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates a significant amount of noise in Norwegian child welfare assessments. A substantial portion was level noise, which can be addressed through feedback and correction, while a considerable share was pattern noise, suggesting the need for standardization routines. Notably, breaking down global decisions into sub-assessments did not reduce noise, highlighting the importance of refining and operationalizing these approaches. Lastly, we want to emphasize that the results we present do not reflect the typical decision-making process within child welfare services in Norway. In practice, major decisions are made collaboratively, with a larger team thoroughly reviewing all relevant data from the case file.</p></div>		</body>
