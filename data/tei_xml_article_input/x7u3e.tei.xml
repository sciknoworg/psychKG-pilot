We examined the role of a crucial component of Theory of Mind in childhood, namely the attribution of false beliefs to other agents, in the ability to adjust risk-taking strategies during decision-making in adolescence. The analytic sample was 9575 children from the UK&apos;s Millennium Cohort Study, followed at ages 5, 7, and 14 years. The ability to attribute false beliefs was measured at ages 5 and 7 years through a vignette version of the Sally-Anne Task administered by an unfamiliar assessor in a socially demanding dyadic interaction. Risk adjustment was measured at age 14 years with the Cambridge Gambling Task. Even after controlling for a range of individual and family factors, such as sex, ethnicity, verbal ability, family income, and parental education, as well as emotional and behavioural problems, we found that social cognitive abilities in childhood are positively associated with risk adjustment in decision-making during adolescence.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Adolescence is characterised by an increase in impulsive, sensation-seeking behaviours that are accompanied by risk-taking and reduced inhibition and self-regulation <ref type="bibr">(Defoe et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Steinberg, 2004)</ref>, in turn associated with poor mental health, morbidity and mortality <ref type="bibr">(Francesconi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Luna et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Patton et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Reyna &amp; Farley, 2006)</ref>. Informed by developmental neuroscience, the Dual Systems Model <ref type="bibr">(Steinberg, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Strang et al., 2013)</ref> contends that in adolescence such an increase is normative, driven by a differ-ential in the relative maturity between subcortical brain structures (responding to reward and emotional cues) versus the prefrontal cortex, which is engaged in cognitive selfregulation <ref type="bibr">(Somerville et al., 2010)</ref>. In fact, risktaking in adolescence is seen as also serving an adaptive function by promoting independence and personal growth <ref type="bibr">(Do et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Duell &amp; Steinberg, 2021)</ref>. Therefore, the Dual Systems Model provides a compellingly simple account for the fact that, in general, risk-taking increases from late childhood to middle adolescence, and then gradually decreases again, while the selfregulatory control system continues to mature into adulthood <ref type="bibr">(Shulman et al., 2016)</ref>. However, an important aspect of decision-making under risk during adolescence is the ability to adjust decisions based on new information, which should be distinguished from overall risk-taking behaviour <ref type="bibr">(Crone &amp; Van Duijvenvoorde, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Figner et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to increased risk-taking and reduced inhibition, adolescence is also a period of increased social-affective and social-cognitive maturation. The social context is now seen as very important for understanding adolescent decision-making, not least because risky decision-making activates the same neural pathways associated with social cognition <ref type="bibr">(Rodrigo et al., 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Crone and Dahl (2012)</ref>  In this study, we test this model by exploring the long-term association between social-cognitive abilities in childhood and decisionmaking in middle adolescence (at age 14), assessed through the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) <ref type="bibr">(Robbins et al., 1994)</ref>, a neuropsychological test that measures risk-taking behaviour outside a learning context <ref type="bibr">(Cantab, 2006)</ref>. We focus on risk adjustment (RA), a measure of one's ability to adjust decisions under risk in light of new information. The focus on this measure is because it tracks flexibility in decisionmaking, as opposed to impulsive-affective aspects of decision-making that can be captured by other CGT measures. To distinguish this dimension from broader risk-taking, we compare and contrast our findings against those obtained for the overall risk-taking (RT) CGT measure.</p></div>

During childhood, humans develop a Theory of Mind (ToM) -the ability to draw inferences about the mental states of others <ref type="bibr">(Premack &amp; Woodruff, 1978)</ref>, anticipate their behaviour <ref type="bibr">(Sebanz et al., 2006)</ref>, and communicate more efficiently <ref type="bibr">(De Villiers, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dunbar, 1998)</ref>. The development of ToM has clear biological correlates <ref type="bibr">(Frith &amp; Frith, 1999)</ref>, while behavioural precursors include eye contact <ref type="bibr">(Farroni et al., 2002)</ref>, joint attention <ref type="bibr">(Tomasello, 1995)</ref>, imitation and pretendplay <ref type="bibr">(Charman et al., 2000)</ref>, among others <ref type="bibr">(Astington, 1993)</ref>. In terms of brain areas (Poulin-Dubois, 2020), the temporo-parietal junction has been associated with the attribution of beliefs to others <ref type="bibr">(Saxe &amp; Kanwisher, 2013)</ref>. This area is also associated with attention <ref type="bibr">(Abu-Akel &amp; Shamay-Tsoory, 2011)</ref>, and, crucially, with the ability to adjust attention on new stimuli <ref type="bibr">(Krall et al., 2015)</ref>. The superior temporal sulcus is another brain area that is involved in inferring mental states <ref type="bibr">(Gallagher &amp; Frith, 2003)</ref>, and which is also implicated in reorienting attention to emotions expressed on other faces <ref type="bibr">(Naru-moto et al., 2001)</ref>. Crucially, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is involved in social decision-making and risk-taking <ref type="bibr">(Clark et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fellows &amp; Farah, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Van Den Bos &amp; Güroglu, 2009)</ref>, has also been implicated in the processing of affective ToM narratives structured around false beliefs, irony and lying <ref type="bibr">(Leopold et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2006</ref>).</p><p>There are numerous measures that assess the development of <ref type="bibr">ToM (Beaudoin et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>These measures tend to view ToM as a single, well-defined construct, and have been used to address two key questions: When is ToM first established during typical development <ref type="bibr">(Happé, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Onishi &amp; Baillargeon, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scott &amp; Baillargeon, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Surian et al., 2007)</ref>?</p><p>And do difficulties in ToM imply developmental psychopathology <ref type="bibr">(Baron-Cohen et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sharp et al., 2008)</ref>?

The number of children who answered all 3 questions correctly in both sweeps was much lower than expected, and the survey team attributed this to the change of mode of the assessment (using vignettes instead of storytelling) and the delivery of the protocol (using it to build rapport) (MCS, 2020). However, in the present study, we consider the specific characteristics of the SAT -in the mode it was administered in the MCS -as an opportunity</p><p>to study a group of children who passed the test and demonstrated both (1) false belief understanding, and (2) above-average social competence skills compared to their peers in a demanding social situation. We refer to the combination of these abilities as 'superior' social cognition.</p></div>

As a result, they put forward a heuristic model that views adolescent cognitive style as affording distinct adaptive advantages in social-affective processing and social competence, that is, the ability to adjust one's goals flexibly in a changing social environment. For simplicity, we will refer to this broad theoretical framework as the Social-Motivational Flexibility Model of adolescent development.</figDesc></figure>

In addition to the belief question, children are asked two control questions: (Q2) a reality question (where is the object, really?) level attained by the end of our study period at age 14 years (note that, in the vast majority, main respondents were mothers -hence we take this measure to indicate level of 'maternal' education).Sample bias analysis was performed using unweighted descriptive statistics to identify the profile of our sample in comparison to the rest of MCS at the age 14 sweep. The volume of missing data was also identified at this stage, and</figDesc><table><row><cell>Maternal education ranges from 1 to 6, starting from no qualifications at all (value of 1) and going through several levels that are equivalent</cell><cell>and (Q3) a memory question (where did Sally put the object at the beginning?)

There are two strata in each country (England, Wales, Scot- land, and Northern Ireland): advantaged and disadvantaged. In England, there is a third, 'Eth- nic minority' stratum, which comprises English wards that had an ethnic minority indicator of at least 30% in the 1991 Census, that is, at least 30% of their total population fell into the two categories 'Black' (Black Caribbean, Black African and Black Other) or 'Asian' (Indian, Pak- istani and Bangladeshi). The 'Disadvantaged' stratum in England includes wards which were not part of the ethnic minority stratum, and which fell into the upper quartile (poorest 25% of wards) of the ward-based Child Poverty Index (CPI). Finally, the 'Advantaged' stratum includes wards which were neither a part of the ethnic minority stratum nor in the top quartile of the CPI.'Income' is another household-level covariate, given in OECD equivalised income quintiles at the age 14 sweep. It is an additional component of socio-economic status, alongside maternal education ('Mat Edu') which is also included in our analysis and was measured based on the main respondent's educationalthe survey: White, Mixed, Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi, Black or Black British, Other Ethnic group (including Chinese, or Other). Individual-level covariates included 'Sex' (male / female) as well as the cohort member's vocab- ulary knowledge ('Word Score') as assessed at the age 14 sweep. Vocabulary knowledge is an interval variable ranging from 1 to 20, and it is closely associated with verbal intelligence and cognitive ability (Levy &amp; Goldstein, 2014); in this test, a stimulus word is matched to a synonym among five multiple-choice synonyms (Sullivan et al., 2021). Finally, the main respondent's re- port of the Strengths and Difficulties Question- naire (Goodman, 1997) was included, indexing the child's emotional symptoms, peer prob- lems, conduct problems and hyperactivity at the age 14 sweep. In our analysis, we use the 'total difficulties' score of the SDQthe total errors made in the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory task from the previous survey sweep at age 11 years (Atkinson, 2015), as this was not available in the age 14 sweep.) 2.3 Analytic Strategy 2.3.1 Sample Bias &amp; Missing Values</note></figure>
