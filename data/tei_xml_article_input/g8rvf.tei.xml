				<p>Background: The belief in conspiracy theories and paranoid ideation are often treated as almost synonymous. However, there is to date no research concerning shared underlying cognitive underpinnings of CTs and paranoid ideation. One potential underlying factor could be the well-known jumping to conclusion (JTC) bias, the tendency of persons with delusions to perform hasty decisions that are sometimes based on little evidence. Furthermore, a preference for a more intuitive general thinking style, as opposed to an analytical thinking style, could be an additional underlying cognitive factor of both conspiracy theories and paranoia. Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate in a large sample of non-clinical individuals whether the JTC-bias is more pronounced in individuals who display a stronger belief in conspiracy theories and whether both are related to a more intuitive thinking preference. Methods: We assessed the data of 519 non-clinical individuals regarding their respective approval of 20 specific conspiracy theories in an online study. Further, we assessed the JTC-bias by using a computerized variant of the task (fish task). Thinking preferences were measured with the Rational-Experiential Interview. Results: Subjects who displayed the JTC-bias presented a more pronounced belief in conspiracy theories. In addition, gathering little information in the fish task before performing a decision (less draws to decision) was related to a stronger endorsement of conspiracy theories and a more intuitive thinking style (and a less analytic thinking style). Finally, a preference for intuitive thinking predicted a stronger belief in conspiracy theories in a multiple regression analysis. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the implication of a preference for an intuitive thinking style accompanied by a propensity to faster decision-making (JTC-bias) as possible cognitive underpinnings of beliefs in conspiracy theories. Furthermore, our study is the first to confirm the notion of the JTCbias as a reflection of the use of an intuitive thinking style.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1</head><p>Introduction Conspiracy theories are typically unverified and sensationalistic interpretations of events that are "selfinsulating against disconfirmation" and are "based on weak kinds of evidence" <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(1)</ref>. Beliefs in conspiracy theories are associated with the rejection of generally accepted norms, assumptions and behaviors, e.g. regarding vaccination <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>, combating climate change <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref> or political participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(4)</ref>. However, many of these theories are widely disseminated and accepted <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(5)</ref>. Despite growing research in this area, little is still known about the cognitive underpinnings of the belief in conspiracy theories. A plethora of studies indicates that the individual agreement with various specific conspiracy theories is highly intercorrelated <ref type="bibr">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7)</ref>, even if the specific conspiracy theories contradict each other. For example, people who believed that Princess Diana had been murdered were also more likely to agree that she had also faked her own death <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(8)</ref>. This tendency to presume conspiracies as the primary cause of important societal events <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9)</ref> is defined as conspiracy belief (CB). Numerous polls over the last decades found that conspiracy theories are a common phenomenon, with recent studies suggesting that 63% of the American public believed at least one political conspiracy theory and half of Americans believed at least one medical conspiracy theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">10)</ref>. The wide prevalence and acceptance of conspiracy theories in the general population suggests that CB do not necessarily indicate a mental disorder <ref type="bibr">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">12)</ref>. Nevertheless, parallels to paranoia, defined as "a tendency on the part of an individual or group toward excessive or irrational suspiciousness and distrustfulness of others" (13) are evident. As Jovan Byford <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(14)</ref> puts it: "The link between conspiracy theories and paranoia has become so strong that the two terms are now treated as almost synonymous". However, paranoia or persecutory ideation, as it is found in psychotic disorders, usually involves some form of personal and immediate threat, typically targeted on individual or closely related parties <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref>. In contrast, CB are less self-referential than paranoia, with broader groups of people or in many cases the whole world being the target of the assumed conspiracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(5)</ref>. Aside from these important differences, both phenomena imply a deep mistrust in external factors and agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">16)</ref>. In line with this contention, two studies have demonstrated an association of CB and paranoia in non-clinical samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr">18)</ref>. Paranoia is a common symptom especially of psychotic disorders and a significant feature of persecutory delusions <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>. However, it is notable that persecutory ideation is not solely a clinical phenomenon. As psychotic symptoms also commonly occur in the general population, many researchers argued that there is a continuum between everyday suspicions and clinically relevant delusions <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(23)</ref>. In line with this contention, it is estimated that up to 15% of the general population regularly experience paranoid thoughts <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>. Considering the wide prevalence of conspiracy theories and paranoid thoughts as well as the obvious parallels between both phenomena, it also seems plausible that "deficits and stressors that predispose an individual to conspiracy thinking are similar to, if less intense than, those involved in the aetiology of paranoid psychosis" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(24)</ref>. However, despite of the two promising studies mentioned above that found preliminary evidence of an association between paranoia and CB <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr">18)</ref>, to our knowledge there is no research concerning possible shared underlying cognitive mechanisms of both paranoia and CB. With respect to said "deficits […] involved in the aetiology of paranoid psychosis" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(24)</ref>, important factors in the formation and maintenance of delusions are various cognitive biases or thinking errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">26)</ref>. Possibly the most commonly studied cognitive bias is the jumping to conclusions (JTC) bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(27)</ref>, defined as the tendency of individuals to make quick decisions sometimes based on little evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(28)</ref>. There is converging meta-analytical evidence that people with psychosis tend to display a more extreme reasoning style with generally hastier decision making behavior in comparison to non-clinical controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(31)</ref>. Typically, the JTC-bias is measured with the beads task <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(27)</ref>. This task involves two jars containing two types of differently colored beads in an opposite ratio (e.g. 85% orange; 15% blue and vice versa). After the jars are presented to the subjects, they are hidden from view and subjects are consecutively presented beads from only one jar. After each round, the subjects are asked if they are able to decide from which jar the beads are drawn. A decision after one or two beads is considered as JTC-bias, while the total number of beads subjects require before deciding is called draws to decision (DTD). Given the considerable parallels between CB and paranoia mentioned above, it thus would be interesting to further assess a possible implication of the JTC-bias in CB. In general, the JTC-bias seems to reflect a broader tendency of individuals to rely on a faster, heuristic thinking style in contrast to a slower, more analytical thinking style <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(32)</ref>. These two thinking styles are postulated in several so-called dual process models of human reasoning and typically differ in several key characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(35)</ref>. The faster and relatively effortless route of reasoning is typically regarded as independent of cognitive abilities as well as working memory and relies on heuristics and intuition. The slower and effortful, analytical route relies heavily on the cognitive ability and is dependent on the working memory of the individual. A classic dual process model of human reasoning is Seymour Epstein's Cognitive-Experiential Self-Theory of Personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(33)</ref>. Epstein distinguishes between an analytic system and an experiential system, which operate independently according to their own principles. While the first, spontaneous reactions initially emanate from the experiential system, the analytic system is able to correct or suppress these intuitive (and usually hedonistic) reactions or rationalize them retroactively in a way that is beneficial for the individual's self-esteem. However, although the claim that the JTC-bias might reflect the use of the experiential system has an intuitive appeal, to our knowledge an association of both constructs has yet to be empirically established. Regarding the belief in conspiracy theories, as mentioned before, there is a broader tendency to presume conspiracies as the primary cause of important societal events <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9)</ref>. This broader tendency (defined as CB), could in turn reflect a preference for one or the other thinking style described above. As "widespread irrational beliefs often have strong intuitive appeal" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(36)</ref> and conspiracy theories tend to trigger a strong affective response (37), CB could reflect an individual's preference for the use of the intuitive thinking style. On the other hand, "[conspiracy] theorists do not see themselves as raconteurs of alluring stories, but as investigators and researchers." <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(14)</ref>, which would consequently imply a preference for a more analytical thinking style. These contradicting considerations echo in current research regarding this topic, as preliminary findings suggest that CB seems to be associated with an increased use of the experiential system, while the evidence for the relationship with the use of the analytic system remains equivocal <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">38)</ref>.</p><p>Taken together these findings provide preliminary evidence indicating that the preference for an intuitive, heuristic style of thinking is related to CB. However, in order to derive clear-cut evidence about the role of thinking styles in the formation and maintenance of CB, it is important to further scrutinize this association. Overall, we consider it most relevant to further investigate the topic of CB regarding possible cognitive underpinnings. While preliminary evidence points at a preference for an intuitive thinking style as the foundation of CB, the role of specific mechanisms of the experiential system (e.g. the JTC-bias) has not been examined before. Consequently, as the JTC-bias is commonly found in subjects suffering from delusions and even in delusion-prone individuals (29-31), we predict first, in line with the notion of shared underlying cognitive mechanisms between paranoia and CB, that persons who display a more pronounced JTC-bias hold a stronger CB (hypothesis 1a) and that less draws to decision in a computerized variant of the beads task (fish-task) are negatively correlated with CB (hypothesis 1b). Regarding the role of the two thinking styles, we first consider it important to validate theintuitively appealingidea, that the JTC-bias is a reflection of the use of the experiential system <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(32)</ref>. Thus, we hypothesized that subjects who display the JTC-bias show a stronger preference for intuitive thinking as well as an aversion to analytic thinking in comparison to subjects who show a more cautious information gathering style (hypothesis 2a) and that a preference for intuitive thinking (in contrast to analytic thinking) is associated with less draws to decision in a computerized variant of the beads task (hypothesis 2b). Third, our aim was to further elucidate the interplay of the different thinking styles and CB. Most conspiracy theories are intuitively appealing and therefore individuals who exhibit a stronger preference for an intuitive thinking style could, consequently, be more inclined to belief in said theories. As mentioned before, evidence regarding an association of analytical thinking and CB is equivocal, probably because conspiracy theorists see themselves "as investigators and researchers." <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(14)</ref>. However, considering the promising results regarding the role of the use of intuitive thinking, we hypothesized that only the preference for intuitive thinking predicts a stronger CB (hypothesis 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>Materials and methods</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Recruitment and procedure</head><p>Recruitment was accomplished via social media and a survey-sharing platform (surveycircle.com), which allows to disseminate one`s own study in return for participation in other online-studies. An additional incentive was a voluntary lottery with 15 Amazon-vouchers (20 € each). The study was described to potential participants as an investigation of the association between political attitudes and decision behavior (associations between political attitudes and CB will be reported elsewhere). All participants were first informed about the assessment and gave informed consent, then they saw a four-minute video 1 explaining the fish task described below, as misunderstanding is a common phenomenon regarding the measurement of the JTC-bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(39)</ref>. Subsequently, participants were directed to the measures described below. Finally, participants answered questions on sociodemographic data. They were then asked whether they had answered all questions conscientiously and truthfully and whether they considered their data as valid. Finally, participants received a summary of their results after the study was completed. More specifically, they received a short overview about the scientific background of the study. The local ethics committee was informed on the study and as applicable ethical standard of the German Psychological Society (DGPs) were followed, no experimental manipulation took place, participants received information on the study, provided written informed consent and anonymity was assured, the ethics committee informed the first author that a formal ethics application was not necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Subjects</head><p>Subjects were included if they had access to social media and their age was above 16. From the originally participants, 30 were excluded either because they declared their data to be invalid (n = 7) or because they were considerably faster than the other participants (z &lt; -1.96; n = 23). We also excluded one participant who declared to suffer from schizophrenia, as the tendency to jump to conclusions is influenced by the state of remission of the disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">41)</ref>. The final sample consisted of 488 participants (285 women, 198 men, 5 diverse). Their age ranged between 17 to 70 (M = 28.11; SD = 7.80) and they described themselves as predominantly welleducated (with 89% of the participants reporting to have completed at least 13 years of school education (A-level education) and politically left-leaning (with 41% declaring to vote for the German Green Party, 12% declaring to vote for the German far-left party Die LINKE and 6% declaring to vote for the democratic socialist party SPD).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Conspiracy belief</head><p>The tendency to endorse conspiracy theories, defined as conspiracy belief (CB), was measured using the classical approach of asking participants to rate several specific conspiracy theories regarding their respective approval <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(42)</ref>. The mean approval rate of said theories is then interpreted as a measure for the superordinate general CB. The different conspiracy theories derive from a previous study that examined the popularity and approval of several conspiracy theories in German-speaking countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(43)</ref>. Thirty conspiracy theories with the most pronounced approval rating were used in a pilot study <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(44)</ref> and from these 30 conspiracy theories, 20 theories with the highest discriminability were selected for the updated assessment of CB The 20 different conspiracy theories are depicted in Appendix A. Participants had to read verbal descriptions of the 20 conspiracy theories and were then asked to rate their respective approval of said theories on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (I do not agree at all) to 5 (I fully agree) or to choose "Not able to judge/ theory not known" as an answer if they did not want or were able to decide about a specific conspiracy theory. The mean approval rate of all conspiracy theories was used as measure of CB (range: 1-5). The mean approval rate of the total sample was 2.64 (SD = .77) and the final questionnaire had an excellent reliability with Cronbach's α = .</p><p>94. An overview of all the theories used in the present study and their intercorrelations can be found in Appendix A1 and B1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Analytic and intuitive reasoning</head><p>Analytic and intuitive reasoning was measured with the German version of the Rational-Experiental Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(45</ref> . The questions are answered on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely wrong) to 7 (completely true). The two subscales were confirmed factor-analytically, both in the original as well as the German version of the questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">46)</ref> The subscales of the German version feature a good reliability with Cronbach's α = .82 (Need for Cognition scale) and α = .86 (Faith in Intuition scale).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Jumping to conclusions (JTC)</head><p>The JTC-bias was measured with a modified version of the traditional beads task <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(27)</ref>. The fish task uses a more easily understandable scenario of a fisherman who fishes differently colored fish from one of two ponds <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(48)</ref>. Participants are first informed that two fish species (orange and blue fish) are located in two ponds (A and B) in reversed ratio, 60 orange and 40 blue fish in pond A and 40 orange and 60 blue fish in pond B. The subjects are furthermore made aware of being presented with fish from only one pond without knowing which pond the fish come from (prior probability of 50 percent). After each fish that is presented, the subjects are asked if they are ready to decide from which pond the fish is drawn. A decision after one or two fish is considered as a JTC-bias. The sequence of fish presented is orange-orange-orange-blue-orange-orange-orange-orange-blue-orange. In the present paradigm, the posterior probability for choosing pond A after the presentation of one orange fish is 60% and for choosing pond A after the presentation of two orange fish is 69%. As an additional JTC-measure, the number of draws to decision (DTD, range: 1-10) is recorded: the number of fishes the subjects view until they decide that the fish stem from one pond.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4">Demographic form</head><p>Participants provided their demographic details, consisting of sex, age, mental disorders in the past/ present, highest educational qualification and political affiliation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Statistical analyses</head><p>Following the central limit theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(49)</ref>, independent variables in samples of n &gt; 30 can be viewed as sufficiently normally distributed. Thus, as all groups consisted of more than 30 participants, we assumed normal distribution of the variables. The assumed group difference regarding CB between participants who showed the JTC-bias (indicated by a decision after one or two fishes fished in the fish task) and those who did not (hypothesis 1a) was analyzed by performing an independent-sample t-test, if the assumption of homoscedasticity was met, verified by the Levene's test. In case of heteroscedasticity, degrees of freedom were adjusted accordingly. Possible group differences regarding the two thinking styles (indicated by the Faith in Intuition score and the Need for Cognition score) between participants who showed the JTC-bias (indicated by a decision after one or two fishes fished in the fish task) and those who did not (hypothesis 2a) were also analyzed by performing two independent-sample t-tests, as both thinking styles are theoretically independent. Furthermore, we examined the association between draws to decision in the fish task and CB (hypothesis 1b) as well as both thinking styles (indicated by the Faith in Intuition score and the Need for Cognition score, hypothesis 2b) by using Pearson's two-tailed correlations. Finally, a multiple regression analysis was performed using the SPSS-Enter method in order to test if a preference for intuitive thinking predicts CB (hypothesis 3). We included the preference of both an intuitive and an analytical thinking style (indicated by the Faith in Intuition score and Need for Cognition score respectively) as predictors and CB (mean score) as criterion. The required assumptions (independence of errors and absence of multicollinearity) were tested by calculating the Durbin-Watson statistic as well as the variance inflation factor.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>The present study yielded some interesting results. Participants who displayed the jumping to conclusions (JTC) bias were more likely to endorse conspiracy theories than subjects who did not jump to conclusions, thus presented a stronger generalized conspiracy belief (CB). In addition, subjects who required more draws to decision (DTD) in the fish-task presented a less pronounced CB. Moreover, less DTD correlated significantly with a preference for a more intuitive thinking style (indicated by the Faith in Intuition score) and, in line with this, subjects who displayed the JTC-bias showed a significantly stronger preference for an intuitive thinking style than subjects who did not jump to conclusions. The opposite pattern of results was found in case of the preference for an analytical thinking style (indicated by the Need for Cognition score). Finally, only a preference for intuitive thinking (in contrast to a preference for analytical thinking) predicted CB. First and foremost, we were especially interested in the question of whether the conceptual similarities between CB and paranoia <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(16)</ref> are predicated on the same psychological mechanisms. In this regard, the correlation between DTD and CB as well as the significantly higher CB in subjects who displayed the JTC-bias strongly suggests that this may be the case. On the other hand, recent meta-analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">31</ref>) and a large scale study <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(50)</ref>, did not find a statistically significant association between the presence of a JTC-bias and delusion severity, although patients with psychotic disorders and delusions presented a more pronounced JTC-bias in comparison to controls. While the correlation between DTD in the fish task and CB was of small effect size (r = -.16), we found a medium effect size (Cohen's d = .53) regarding the group differences between subjects who jumped to conclusions and those who did not. This implies that, while there is a rather small general association between decision-making behavior and CB, especially those subjects with an extreme reasoning style (a decision after two or less fish in the fish task) differ considerably from the rest of the sample regarding their overall CB. Consequently, our findings provide strong evidence for an implication of cognitive mechanisms (in this case, the JTC-bias) in CB that are typically linked to paranoia or delusional ideation <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>. Moreover, to our knowledge, our study is the first to present empirical evidence for an association of the JTC-bias and a preference for the use of a more intuitive thinking, as indicated by the correlation of DTD and the Faith in Intuition score as well as the significantly higher Faith in Intuition score in subjects who displayed the JTC-bias in the fish task. This is in line with the theoretical integration of <ref type="bibr">Ward and Garety (32)</ref> who proposed that the JTC-bias might be an aspect of a broader tendency of an over-reliance on faster, heuristic reasoning processes. Consequently, the opposite pattern of results was found in case of a preference for analytical thinking. However, as our study is to our knowledge the first to show an association between the preference for an intuitive thinking style and the JTC-bias, our findings should be regarded as preliminary and require careful pre-registered replication in different samples and with different measures of JTC. Furthermore, we set out to provide further evidence for the relevance and importance of a preference for a more intuitive thinking style regarding the formation of CB. In fact, results of the regression analysis indicate that a preference for intuitive thinking predicts the degree of CB, with a moderate effect size of R 2 = .14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(51)</ref>. Simply said, a greater trust in one's own intuition (in conjunction with a propensity to jump to conclusions) leads to a faster acceptance of the "simple yet satisfying narratives" (52) which are found in many conspiracy theories. Additionally, conspiracy theories tend to trigger a stronger affective response, which in turn makes them more likely to appeal to persons who prefer an intuitive thinking style <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(37)</ref>. This finding is in line with prior results indicating a close association of both constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">38)</ref>. In contrast to the relatively "simple […] narratives" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(52)</ref> found in many conspiracy theories, it may require considerable more cognitive effort (which would, on the other hand, require a preference for analytic thinking) or it might be virtually impossible to retrace the impact of a complex network of individual agents, each pursuing their own agenda <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(53)</ref>. As a consequence, people with a preference for intuitive thinking might tend to heuristically conflate these agents and thus assume that only a small group of individuals "is pulling the strings" (54) behind actions that could be perceived as coordinated. Interestingly, although many conspiracies theories might be factually incorrect, according to <ref type="bibr">Grewal (54)</ref>, this heuristic reasoning (thus, intuitive thinking) could be beneficial by holding at least some predictive power:</p><p>"For example, the most parsimonious way to understand financial decision making in the Eurozone might be to treat it as if it were run by and for the benefit of the Continent's richest private banks. With this assumption, one could have predicted a number of otherwise surprising events, from the use of public funds to bail out heavily indebted private banks to the extra-legal expansion of authority in the European Central Bank to ease pressure on the Euro to the replacement of several elected national governments by "technocrats" willing to place entire countries under what one might have imagined would prove an untenable austerity." From this perspective, CB can be seen as "a cultural practice that attempts to map, in narrative form, the trajectories and effects of power " (55) and could furthermore serve "as trip wires, early warning systems [which] alert the vulnerable to coming threats, violations of ground rules, and the abuse of power" <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(56)</ref>. In a nutshell, conspiracy theorizing as a consequence of intuitive thinking could in some way be advantageous for individuals as the society, even if the specific theories themselves might be factually incorrect. Of course, considering the harm and danger to minorities and the obstacles which they impose on the search for underlying reasons and liable actors, such benign assessments of CB should be taken with a grain of salt. Regarding the association of CB and analytic thinking, our results are in line with another study that did not find a significant association of both constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(38)</ref>. Since many authors count CB to other "stigmatized knowledge" (57) like esoteric or superstitious ideas, it may seem counter-intuitive that, on the other side, a preference for analytical thinking does not predict a less pronounced CB (as analytical thinking correlates negatively for example with religious or paranormal beliefs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(58)</ref>. Surprisingly, interventions aiming at promoting analytic thinking were successful in reducing CB <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(37)</ref>. Consequently, these contrasting findings warrant an explanation. As Jovan Byford puts it: "Conspiracy theorists do not see themselves as raconteurs of alluring stories, but as investigators and researchers." <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(14)</ref>. As mentioned above, conspiracy theories are per definition "epistemically self-insulating against disconfirmation" (1) and strong analytic reasoning skills might even be used to generate ideologyconsistent interpretations of evidence that are inconsistent with personal beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(36)</ref>. Consequently, a preference for analytic thinking may not detract from or, in some cases, could actually benefit the maintenance of CB <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(38)</ref>. Future studies could therefore scrutinize the role of possible moderators (e.g. ideology or political beliefs) of the association of analytic thinking and CB. Another possible explanation concerns the measurement of both thinking styles: As the Rational Experiential Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(46)</ref> and its German version <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(45)</ref> used in the present study are both selfassessments, they could measure rather the self-perception of the participants than the actual thinking preferences the participants use more often in their daily life. In this regard, subjects that present a pronounced CB might see themselves "as investigators and researchers." <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(14)</ref> and therefore report a stronger preference for analytical thinking, while actually thinking rather intuitively. Consequently, future research could be improved by incorporating other, more objective measures of intuitive and analytic thinking, such as the Cognitive Reflection Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(59)</ref> or experimental paradigms that require participants to use either a more intuitive or analytical thinking style. However, despite the lack of clarity regarding the individual's actual use of the two styles of thinking, there is now in either case growing evidence that a greater faith in one's own intuition goes hand in hand with a stronger belief in conspiracy theories. As to possible clinical implications of our findings, we would like to point out again that believing in conspiracy theories per se is not a mental disorder <ref type="bibr">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">12)</ref> and as described above, it might even be, in some cases, beneficial for an individual or a society as a whole. Real political conspiracies, such as the Iran Contra Affair or the Watergate Scandal <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(14)</ref> recurred throughout history and it would not have been possible to uncover them without a certain degree of mistrust of official institutions and narratives. On the other hand, CB is accompanied by a wide range of negative medical or societal effects such as a reduced willingness to vaccinate (2) or to combat climate change (3) and decreased political participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(4)</ref>. Another dramatic example would be the notion of a Jewish conspiracy with the intention of world domination, which ultimately led to the Holocaust and the death of over 6 million Jews <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">60)</ref>. Consequently, interventions aimed at reducing CB have increasingly come into the focus of conspiracy theory research. However, sociopolitical approaches like the idea of banning conspiracy theories or "cognitively infiltrating" groups of conspiracy theorists <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref> are hardly feasible and could even be counterproductive <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">61)</ref>. In contrast, psychological interventions like priming <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(37)</ref> or inoculation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(62)</ref> showed preliminary, but promising results in reducing CB. With regard to the results of the present study, especially the high propensity to display the JTC-bias in individuals who present a pronounced CB could be the basis for new interventions aiming at reducing CB, as there are already well-established approaches that proved successful in reducing the tendency to jump to conclusions, like the Metacognitive Training <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(63)</ref> or Cognitive Behavior therapy for psychosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(64)</ref>. For example, these approaches use psychoeducational elements as well as practical exercises to educate about reasoning biases and to reduce their occurrence. Consequently, future studies will have to examine whether said approaches might also be successful in reducing CB. If this is the case, elements of those approaches could be incorporated for example in large-scale informational campaigns or, on a smaller level, educational programs to increase media literacy. The present study has some notable features. First, based on a large sample of non-clinical individuals, our study is the first to provide empirical evidence for the notion that the JTC-bias might reflect a preference for intuitive thinking. Second, we were able to shed some light on the possible underpinnings of CB by highlighting that CB is most likely based upon similar cognitive mechanisms as paranoid ideation or delusions, in this case the JTC-bias. Accordingly, CB is predicted by a preference for intuitive thinking. In interpreting the findings of our study, some limitations should be considered. First, our study was conducted as an online study. As none of assessments was performed face-to-face, subjects were not able to ask for additional information in case of difficulties of understanding. As miscomprehension is a common problem regarding JTC-tasks such as the beads task or the fish task (39), we tried to address this problem by creating a four-minute-long video with the purpose of explaining the fish task in an easily understandable manner. However, watching the video was not obligatory and we did not check for possible misunderstandings of the task. Additionally, the online survey included a lottery. We cannot rule out the possibility that some subjects only took part for the purpose of participation in the lottery and did not answer carefully. We tried to minimize this risk by asking the subjects after the experimental procedure if they considered their data to be valid and whether we could use their data. Referring to this, we emphasized that the answer would not affect the participation in the lottery. While only seven participants advised us against using their data, possibly some subjects may not have answered this question truthfully. Another limitation of our study should be addressed by future research: although experimental manipulation is not imperative to claim causality (in this case, assuming that a preference for intuitive thinking predicts CB (65)), future research could involve experimental paradigms in order to gain stronger evidence of the assumed causality of the constructs. Additionally, despite the advantages of online research (e.g. economy and a stronger feeling of anonymity (66)), our results should be verified in a traditional face-to-face setting. Furthermore, future studies are well-advised to pre-register their hypotheses and analyses, as studies that are not preregistered tend to overestimate effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(67)</ref>. Finally, building on our promising results, future studies concerned with CB could scrutinize the role of other parameters involved in the formation and maintenance of paranoid ideation (e.g. belief flexibility or affective states, e.g. loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(25)</ref>). In conclusion, we were able to shed some light on the cognitive underpinnings of conspiracy beliefs. More specifically, the results of the present study indicate that a preference for an intuitive thinking style, accompanied by a propensity to jump to conclusions, might be an important factor in the formation of conspiracy beliefs. In a nutshell, although conspiracy beliefs reflect by no means a mental disorder, they is most likely associated with the same cognitive processes as paranoid ideation or delusions.</p><p>NP and SM contributed to conception and design of the study, NP organized the data analysis and performed the statistical analysis.
