			<abstract>
				<p>In democracies, surveys play a key role in policy decision-making. That immigrants and people living in socially disadvantaged areas are especially unlikely to participate in surveys might, therefore, lead to their opinions not being considered to the same extent as those of others. However, the mechanisms for nonresponse among these groups are relatively unknown, even though they currently make up a significant proportion of the population in many Western societies. In this manuscript, the mechanism of nonresponse is explored through an exploratory and a confirmatory phase. In the exploratory phase, nine focus group interviews were conducted, and two novel and eight existing hypotheses on what causes nonresponse were generated. In the confirmation phase, one of the novel hypotheses was assessed and found not to be supported: increased internal political efficacy did not increase response propensities among immigrants, persons living in socially impoverished areas, or the general population. Researchers are encouraged to assess the remaining generated hypotheses.</p>

Fewer completed surveys increase the risk of biased point estimates, correlations, and generalizability of findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abraham, Maitland, and Bianchi 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Couper and de Leeuw 2015)</ref>. Weaker generalizability leads to misperceptions about reality and/or public opinion, and consequently, to poorly informed policy decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Groves 2006)</ref>.</p><p>In previous studies, immigrants and individuals living in socially disadvantaged areas (areas characterized by widespread organized crime, distrust in the authorities, and low willingness to collaborate with law enforcement) have been identified as especially unlikely to participate in surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Shaghaghi, Bhopal, and Sheikk 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">van Wees et al. 2019</ref>).</p><p>Furthermore, a meta-analysis of survey data in Sweden found that immigrants and young adults were among the least likely to complete mixed-mode questionnaires and that-despite controlling for several individual demographic attributes-people living in socially impoverished areas were also less likely to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lundmark and Backström, 2023)</ref>. It seems likely that sharing several of such demographic attributes may exacerbate the likelihood of not participating in surveys even further.</p><p>The nonresponse of such groups may be even more worrisome for survey research given the recent rapid growth of the population having such characteristics in Western countries. For example, the population of Sweden went from 11.8% of the inhabitants being foreign-born in 2000 to 20% foreign-born in 2021 (Statistics Sweden 2022). Increasing the response propensity among such groups may, therefore, be particularly effective in halting the increasing nonresponse bias found in Western societies.</p><p>However, to date, suggestions of the potential causes of the low response propensities among immigrants and groups in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods have remained relatively idle. Only a few studies have focused on conceiving potential mechanisms behind the lower response propensity among these groups, suggesting a need for a resurgence of new ideas for mechanisms of response propensities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bates 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Vahabi et al. 2015)</ref>. Specifically, calls have been made for hypotheses-generating research where respondents "introspect" over their unwillingness to complete surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Singer 2011)</ref>. Allowing respondents to discuss their reasons for not participating in surveys may provide fertile ground for the generation of hypotheses of the mechanisms behind response propensities among the general public, and among harder-to-reach groups specifically.</p><p>To remedy the stagnation of hypotheses generation of the mechanisms behind response propensities among immigrants and individuals living in socially disadvantaged areas, this manuscript presents the results of nine focus group interviews. These interviews resulted in the generation of ten hypotheses, two of which were novel in the published literature. Based on the findings of the focus group interviews, a second study testing one of the novel hypotheses was administered to a probability sample of socially disadvantaged and not socially disadvantaged areas in Sweden.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposed Explanations for Survey Nonresponse among Immigrants and Socially</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disadvantaged Areas</head><p>The declining response propensities of surveys in the decades prior and after the new millennia led to a growing body of literature that focused on factors associated with survey nonresponse. However, such research has tended to be descriptive rather than explanatory, with a strong focus on how socio-demographic factors relate to survey nonresponse. In such descriptive inquiries, educational attainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Keeter et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">van Wees et al. 2019</ref>) and age <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bates 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Shaghaghi et al. 2011</ref>) stand out as one of the strongest predictors of nonresponse. However, three other demographic groups have also been identified as particularly unlikely to participate in surveys: ethnic minorities, immigrants, and inhabitants of economically/socially disadvantaged areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bates 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bates et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Couper and de Leeuw 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lundmark and Backström, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Shaghaghi et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">van Wees et al. 2019)</ref>.</p><p>That immigrant background is negatively related to response propensity may be of particular importance for European and North American countries, which all saw high rates of immigration between the 1990s and 2020s. In Sweden, in addition to doubling the proportion of the foreign-born population between 2000 and 2021, many Swedes were in 2021 identified as living in socially disadvantaged areas, making up a total of 5% of the entire population.</p><p>This creates a setup for a double curse of fostering low response propensity as areas identified as disadvantaged hold a population overrepresented by individuals with an immigrant background (Statistics Sweden 2018).</p><p>Some mechanisms of nonresponse in such groups have been suggested. For example, distrust of public institutions has been considered an explanatory factor of low response propensities among immigrants and individuals living in disadvantaged neighborhoods <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Couper and de Leeuw 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Vahabi et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nápoles-Springer et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Yancey, Ortega, and Kumanyika 2006)</ref>. A lack of social integration has also been proposed as a leading influence for nonresponse, perhaps leading to a fear of mistreatment, and exploitation of the data provided <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abraham et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bates 2017)</ref>. For instance, research has identified that such individuals were concerned with data being collected to benefit the personal careers of researchers rather than being for the good of the community or that data would be collected to portray the surveyed community unfavorably <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Yancey et al. 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the studies on distrust as a mechanism of nonresponse have been conducted among the U.S. Black population. Therefore, the lack of trust found in previous studies may partly be explained by the U.S.'s history of slavery and racial discrimination <ref type="bibr">(Nápelos-Springer et al. 2004)</ref>. It remains unclear to what extent distrust as a mechanism for nonresponse can be generalized to other countries and minority groups.</p><p>Furthermore, economically disadvantaged people and people who fear confrontation with legal authorities have been found less likely to participate in surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abraham et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bates and Mulry 2011)</ref>. However, to the best of our knowledge, it has not yet been studied whether immigrants and inhabitants of disadvantaged areas tend to be overrepresented in the groups who fear confrontation with legal authorities. Research from the U.S. has found that being an ethnic minority, such as having a Black African/American or Hispanic background, lower education, and unemployment rates tended to coincide with fear of confrontation and with living in more disadvantaged areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bates and Mulry 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, it may be likely that disadvantaged areas and immigrants in non-U.S. contexts show similar patterns of participation in surveys. Lastly, a wide range of studies have identified language barriers as a crucial explanation for nonresponse among immigrants (e.g.,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bates 2017; Brick and Williams 2013).</head><p>A theory of survey response suggests that a respondent needs to believe that the benefits of completing a questionnaire will outweigh the costs of completing it <ref type="bibr">(Dillman et al., 2014, p. 25)</ref>. To increase the perceived benefit, theories such as the leverage-saliency theory of survey response (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Groves et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Groves and Heeringa 2006)</ref> suggest that any survey request hold several attributes (e.g., the topic of the questions, design of the questionnaire, the sender of the request, what data will be used for). Furthermore, the relevance of these attributes is thought to vary for groups of respondents, and highlighting some attributes may increase response propensity for some while decreasing it for others. To that end, tailoring the survey request for different groups of respondents <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dillman et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dillman, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lynn, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tourangeau et al., 2017)</ref> as well as tailoring refusal conversion attempts toward the hard-to-reach groups has been suggested (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Stoop 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stoop et al., 2010, chapter 7)</ref>. A tailored request can entail offering different groups of respondents varying amounts of monetary incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Singer and Ye 2013)</ref>, asking questions that hard-to-reach groups will find interesting (see Singer 2011), targeting the survey invite to the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Christensen et al., 2019)</ref>, targeting the reminder to the group <ref type="bibr">(Stoop et al., 2010, chapter 7)</ref>, or offering a respondent's preferred mode for completing the interview (see de Leeuw 2018 for an overview). However, to tailor the survey attributes to increase response propensities, survey researchers need to acquire a good understanding of which survey attributes are important for the different groups of respondents and how these attributes should be used for nudging them toward survey participation.</p><p>Exploring nonresponse among immigrants and individuals living in socially impoverished areas should increase the ability of future survey researchers to successfully tailor survey requests optimizing response propensities of hard-to-reach groups. Furthermore, assessing the generalizability of the mechanisms behind nonresponse uncovered among hardto-reach subgroups in North America to European contexts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abraham et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bates 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Couper and de Leeuw 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Vahabi et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nápoles-Springer et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Yancey, Ortega, and Kumanyika 2006)</ref>, and undertaking a theory-generating approach on the causes of nonresponse of hard-to-reach subgroups in Europe, may provide insights on how to combat nonresponse bias in surveys. The present manuscript attempts to shed light on nonresponse through respondents' introspection of their nonresponse behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory Phase: Focus Group Interviews</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>To generate hypotheses of nonresponse among immigrants and inhabitants of socially disadvantaged areas, nine focus groups were conducted in February 2020. Focus groups have been found especially apt for understanding behavior and perceptions of specific groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ekström 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Morgan and Krueger 1993)</ref>, as well as for generating new ideas and developing hypotheses of such behavior or perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Breen 2006)</ref>. Compared to individual interviews and other group interviews, focus group interviews encourage interaction between participants rather than between the participants and the moderator. Encouraging interaction is thought to allow the participants less aware of their perceptions and behavior to, by contrasting and comparing their thoughts to those expressed by other participants, also become able to elicit their own perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Morgan and Krueger 1993)</ref>. The group interaction in focus groups is also suggested as fitting when interviewing individuals belonging to groups with limited power, influence, and language skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barron et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Morgan and Krueger 1993)</ref>. In addition, compared to individual in-depth interviews focusing on a specific individual's experiences, focus groups may be appropriate when a breadth of generated hypotheses is sought rather than an understanding of a specific individual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Crabtree et al., 1993)</ref>. Given that the purpose was to generate hypotheses from the experiences, behavior, and perceptions of survey participation among disadvantaged and minority groups, focus groups were deemed more appropriate than in-depth individual interviews.</p><p>The recruitment and the interviews were conducted in Biskopsgården, a residential area in Gothenburg, Sweden, identified by the Swedish Police as extremely socially disadvantaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Polisen 2021)</ref>. To be identified as a socially disadvantaged area by the Swedish police, the area had to have a high crime rate with widespread organized crime and where inhabitants showed great distrust in the police. At the time of the interviews, 60% of Biskopsgården's residents were immigrants (Göteborgs Stad 2022). Biskopsgården was chosen as the venue for recruitment to increase the chances of finding individuals residing in socially impoverished areas and who were immigrants (i.e., socio-demographic factors linked to nonresponse). Immigrants were defined as individuals not born in Sweden and who have since taken up residence in Sweden. Recruiting individuals who had one or both of these demographic attributes increased the chances of finding individuals who were likely especially hard-to-reach in surveys but still recruitable for focus group interviews. In addition, before being recruited, participants were asked if they typically agreed to answer surveys to which most answered no. All participants knew what a survey was, which should facilitate a fruitful discussion, but may limit the hypothesis generation to individuals who have at least some knowledge of surveys. To increase the likelihood of theoretical saturation, we allowed individuals who possessed just one or both of the demographic attributes to be recruited.</p><p>The interviews centered around reasons for nonresponse and self-experienced low willingness to participate in surveys. Each interview consisted of three to six individuals.</p><p>Participants in three of the nine focus groups were recruited via the Swedish national language education course Swedish for Immigrants (SFI) in Biskopsgården. SFI is a voluntary language course offered by the Swedish state and for which all recent immigrants from non-Nordic countries are invited to participate (provided they have a Swedish social security number). In the language course, participants are taught basic Swedish at a level of making it through everyday life in Sweden. Participants enrolled at SFI come from a diverse set of immigrant backgrounds and many have only an elementary education from other countries. The other six focus group participants were recruited at the cultural center/library or in the main square of Biskopsgården. Across all nine focus groups, only 24% had studied at a college or university.</p><p>All interviews were conducted in a room at the library/cultural center and were conducted in Swedish, using a semi-structured interview guide designed to tap the perceptions and experiences of surveys. All participants were sufficiently proficient in Swedish to approximate fluent conversation. The full transcripts, the exit questionnaire, and the interview guide can be found at osf.io/8nfcd/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>The nine focus groups comprised 33 participants with a majority of young, loweducated, and immigrant participants (for exact demographic composition, see Supplementary Online Materials, SOM, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref>). Within each group, there was homogeneity in terms of age, language skills, and being an immigrant or not. Homogeneity within groups is preferable for establishing hypotheses-generating interaction and dynamics (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Grønkjaer et al. 2011)</ref>. Our recruitment was not aimed specifically toward young adults.</p><p>However. given that young adults have been identified as likely nonrespondents (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lundmark &amp; Backström, 2023)</ref>, interviewing young adults should have increased the likelihood of having recruited low response propensity participants, and doing so allowed us to identify several hypotheses relating to young immigrants and young individuals living in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>First, participants were welcomed, the intended focus group process was explained, were informed that their participation was voluntary and anonymous, and that the interviews would be audio recorded but that the recording would be deleted after transcription.</p><p>Participants were also informed they could exit the interview at any time and would be compensated regardless of completing the interview or not. The interviews lasted 20 to 40 minutes and were transcribed in as much detail as possible to provide a text that was true to the original. Minor changes (grammatical corrections and minor clarifications) were made in cases where it was considered necessary to facilitate reading.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>The interviews were analyzed following <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Braun and Clarke's (2006)</ref> step-by-step guide to thematic analysis, a method for identifying, analyzing, and reporting themes within data. At the final step of the thematic analysis, vivid quotes/dialogues were selected to represent each theme and were included in the results section. Each step of the thematic analysis is detailed in SOM, section S1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of the Themes</head><p>The analysis resulted in a thematic map with three main themes with a total of eight subthemes (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Quotes supporting each of the themes can be found in SOM, section S2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Theme 1: Perceptions of Societal Factors</head><p>A main theme that participants elaborated on was how societal factors may explain why they choose not to participate in surveys. Within this theme, two subthemes were identified. Subtheme 1.1. Opportunity to Exert Influence -Responsiveness by Society. The most prominent subtheme, appearing in each interview, was the need for an opportunity to exert influence and responsiveness by society. Arguments within this theme were often long and developed, and participants frequently returned to this subtheme during the interview. In particular, the participants projected a strong willingness to influence issues in their own residential area. However, they also expressed that they believed their possibilities to influence things were limited and that those asking them questions were likely not going to listen to their individual beliefs or suggestions anyway. Participants described this lack of responsiveness and the limited opportunities to influence as key reasons for not participating in surveys. whether it was possible to trust people and organizations, and that this distrust caused them to not participate in surveys or when government officials approached them. Participants who said they trusted people in general or that they trusted most authorities expressed that trust may be important for them and others when deciding to complete a survey. Similarly, if they felt aversion or disliked the sender of the survey, they said they would not answer. Several of the youngest participants mentioned that they would be unlikely to respond to a survey by the police because of their deep aversion toward the police in their neighborhood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Theme 2: Characteristics of the survey</head><p>In the second main theme, different characteristics of the survey were identified as influencing response propensity across four subthemes. Subtheme 2.1. Financial Incentives. Participants often discussed the importance of direct rewards-such as money or gift cards-for participating in surveys. However, not all focus group participants felt that incentives were a prerequisite for participation. For instance, one participant expressed that the opportunity to influence policy was a stronger mechanism for participation than financial incentives. Subtheme 2.2. Method and Recruitment Strategy. Moreover, participants tended to discuss the pros and cons of different survey modes. Whereas some participants argued they would be more likely to participate if receiving a paper-and-pencil questionnaire, othersoften younger participants-said they preferred online questionnaires. Participants also exuded positivity toward face-to-face interviews, and none had anything negative to say about that mode. Furthermore, participants elaborated on how innovative recruitment strategies would increase their response propensity, such as asking them to participate while queuing at the migration agency. Under this subtheme, many participants mentioned that it could be off-putting if the survey looked formal and that simple language would be beneficial, especially for immigrants. Whereas many participants agreed that less formal language would encourage participation, others expressed wanting more color, figures, slogans, and pictures. Moreover, participants discussed different ways to frame the survey. For example, emphasizing that the participant was important and valuable and that their opinions would affect the outcome of the study would increase survey participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main theme 3: Individual-Level Factors</head><p>Finally, participants elaborated on individual-level factors they thought might influence the likelihood of participating in surveys across two subthemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Survey Self-Efficacy, Interest, and Engagement. Several participants believed</head><p>that their ability to formulate their thoughts into opinions was a hurdle for participation (which we in the suggested hypotheses below define as low survey self-efficacy). They expressed that they did not want to cause problems for the interviewer by not knowing how to appropriately fill out questionnaires or develop their thoughts into opinions. Furthermore, interest and engagement in the topics being asked about were also mentioned as factors for participation.</p><p>Subtheme 3.2. Language Skills. Participants also expressed that Swedish language skills were important to get them to participate in surveys and that translating questionnaires would have increased their response propensity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses Generated</head><p>To guide future research, the mechanisms identified in the exploratory phase were translated into suggested hypotheses presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and discussed below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Language skills and understanding of questionnaires.</head><p>Note. The hypotheses were generated through focus group interviews with immigrants and young adults living in socially disadvantaged areas.</p><p>H1 suggests that perceiving oneself as not able to influence and understand policy may decrease response propensities. Such internalized perception of the ability to influence is called internal political efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balch 1974)</ref>. The participants expressed desires to influence issues but expressed limits to their potential of doing so. They argued this limit was a reason for their non-participation in surveys. Research has identified that a decreasing willingness to bear social responsibility (e.g., voter turnout) was related to declining response rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brick and Tourangeau 2017)</ref>, and internal political efficacy has, in turn, been found to be related to voting behavior (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Balch 1974)</ref>. However, to the authors' knowledge, the hypothesis that leveraging internal political efficacy may increase response propensities among hard-to-reach groups has not been proposed previously.</p><p>H2 posits that increasing generalized trust and trust in the authorities may increase response propensities. Several focus groups suggested that distrust toward other people and the authorities was a reason for their non-participation. The decline in societal trust has been identified as a likely cause for the declining response rates in the U.S. and Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Couper and de Leeuw 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Shaghaghi et al. 2011)</ref>. Finding ways to increase generalized and institutional trust, at least temporarily, may persuade low-trusting respondents to participate in surveys.</p><p>H3 suggests that incentives may increase response propensities, especially among young adults, immigrants, and people living in socially disadvantaged areas. Several studies have found that incentives increase response propensities <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Singer and Ye 2013)</ref>. H3 suggests that incentives may be of increased importance for raising response propensities among these hard-to-reach subgroups and survey requests may be fruitfully tailored to offer incentives identified as relevant for the subgroups with low response propensities.</p><p>H4 posits that response propensity may be increased by administering surveys online among younger respondents while administering mail surveys to older respondents. This hypothesis fits the theory of a tailored survey design <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dillman et al., 2014)</ref> suggesting that the survey mode be tailored to the mode the respondent prefers (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sakshaug et al. 2019)</ref> or offer multiple modes concurrently <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Olson et al 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> for an overview, see de Leeuw 2018).</p><p>H5 suggests that response propensities may be increased by offering face-to-face interviews over other modes, especially among immigrants. Previous research has found that allowing reluctant respondents to be interviewed face-to-face interview can increase a respondent sample's resemblance to the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Klausch et al 2015)</ref> and that immigrants seem especially helped by in-person interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kappelhof 2015)</ref>. Face-to-face interviews may allow immigrants the chance to ask clarifying questions, which was mentioned as important by several of the immigrant focus group participants, and surveys may be optimized by tailoring the mode to be face-to-face for this group.</p><p>H6 suggests that shorter surveys may increase response propensities among young adults and immigrants. Short surveys have been found to increase response propensities in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Japec et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Singer 2011</ref>) but may be especially important when interviewing immigrants given that several focus group participants disclosed unfamiliarity with evaluating their attitudes toward their new home country.</p><p>H7 suggests that using less formal language in surveys may increase response propensities, especially with the subgroups in the focus groups. Ensuring that survey invitations and questions remain jargon-free and use easy-to-understand language is perhaps the first thing survey methodologists are taught (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dillman et al. 2014</ref>), and appears likely extra important for surveys administered to young adults and immigrants.</p><p>H8 suggests that interest in the topic may increase response propensities in general and among low-response propensity groups in particular. This is in line with theories that the topic of the survey can be tailored to increase response propensities (see Singer 2011) and identifying topics of interest for hard-to-reach groups may allow for optimized tailored designs.</p><p>H9 suggests that increased survey self-efficacy may increase response propensities.</p><p>Survey self-efficacy has, to the authors' knowledge, not been defined before and we, therefore, define it as an individual's perceived capacity to successfully fill out a questionnaire or answer questions in a survey interview setting. In general, self-efficacy within a certain domain is inferred through self-esteem, previous performances and anxiety toward the task, support from others and society, and the successful completion of the task by peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Luzzo et al. 1999)</ref>. Research has found self-efficacy in specific domains to be highly predictive of whether an individual decides to attempt the completion of a task within that domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Witte 1992)</ref>. Hence, increasing respondents' survey self-efficacy may increase response propensity, especially among immigrants and those living in socially disadvantaged areas where such efficacy may be lower. To the authors' knowledge, the role of survey selfefficacy for response propensity has not been suggested before. H10 suggests that the translation of surveys is likely to generate higher response propensities. This hypothesis has frequently been suggested in the survey methodology literature on surveying immigrants (Bates 2017; Couper and de Leeuw 2015) and tailoring the information in survey requests and the interview may be a fruitful way to optimize response propensities for immigrants especially, even among immigrants who are proficient in the main language of the country in which the survey is administered (as the participants in the focus group interviews were).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirmation Phase: Survey Experiment</head><p>In the confirmation phase, a survey experiment was administered to assess the first hypothesis generated; That response propensity may be increased when informing respondents that their participation might enable them to exert an influence over policies (i.e., internal political efficacy). This hypothesis was assessed since it captured the subtheme that was prominent across all nine focus group interviews. To assess the hypothesis, a random sample of respondents was randomly assigned to get an invitation to participate in a survey that either included a paragraph on how their participation may influence a policy (treatment group) or not (control group). The procedure, hypotheses, methods, and analytical strategies were preregistered and can be found at osf.io/uxywr.</p><p>The survey was administered in September 2020 in collaboration with the Police Department in Trollhättan, Sweden. Given that some participants in the focus groups expressed negative opinions specifically about the police, assessing the hypothesis may seem problematic. However, collaborating with the police offered a unique opportunity to stress the fact that answers may actually influence a real-life policy without the use of deception:</p><p>Every year, the local police ask the inhabitants what tasks they want the police to prioritize in the upcoming year. This is called a "citizen promise," and all local police departments in Sweden must generate one such promise each year in collaboration with the municipalities and the inhabitants. The police must base this promise on the results of a survey administered to the public as well as on the input from the local police and municipal civil servants. Hence, explaining to the sampled persons how their participation would inform policy was indeed true in our case. Swedish Tax Authority estimated that about 198,000 individuals (1.9% of the total population) were registered at the wrong address in 2018 of which 68,000 were estimated to no longer live in Sweden. Using the registry for sampling should, therefore, be unlikely to skew the results of the study due to undercoverage of immigrants or individuals living in socially impoverished areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Sampled persons were invited by mail to complete an online questionnaire. The letter of invitation was placed in an envelope (the outside of the envelope had the Swedish Police and the survey organization's logo). In the invitation, all sampled persons read that they had been invited to complete a survey about their feelings of safety and the upcoming citizen promise. The sampled persons were instructed how to access the online questionnaire (either through a URL or by scanning a unique quick response (QR) code printed at the bottom of the invitation) and that the survey would take about 10 minutes to complete.</p><p>In the middle of the frontpage of the invitation, half of the sampled persons were randomly assigned to read a boxed paragraph telling them that, previously, very few people from their area had participated in the citizen promise development and that by completing the questionnaire they would have a better opportunity to influence the policy. The other half of the sampled persons did not see that paragraph. Section S3 in the SOM details the versions of the invitations. Twenty-four days after being invited, a reminder was mailed, and the identical manipulation was administered to the same individuals once more. No other interventions or efforts to raise response rates were administered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation Criteria and Measures</head><p>The hypothesis was assessed by estimating the intervention's impact on response rate 1 (RR1) (AAPOR, 2016), nonresponse bias (R-indicators) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Schouten, Cobben, and Bethlehem 2009)</ref>, and measurement error (item nonresponse, length of responses to openended questions, and non-differentiation) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Oscarsson and Arkhede 2019)</ref>. For the estimations and coding of the measures, see SOM, section S4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response Propensity</head><p>In contrast to the expected, sampled persons were not more likely to answer the survey when reading that they had the chance to influence a policy (M = 30.77%, SE = 0.02, N = 397) than when not reading this (M = 33.50%, SE = 0.02, N = 403) (b = 0.03, SE = 0.03, p = .41, d = 0.06). Furthermore, the effect that reading about the chance to influence a policy was not moderated by whether the sampled persons lived in a socially disadvantaged area (b = -0.09, SE = 0.07, p = .15, d = 0.10) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1)</ref>. The effect was also not moderated by whether the sampled person was an immigrant or not (b = -0.05, SE = 0.07, p = .46, d = 0.05) (see SOM, <ref type="table">Table S3</ref>). Immigrants were here defined as individuals not born in Sweden who had a Swedish social security number and were currently registered as living in Sweden. A nonpreregistered alternative logistic regression did not change any of these findings (see <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>). Note. Data from the survey experiment of the confirmation phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nonresponse Bias</head><p>In contrast to the expected, the nonresponse bias was greater, with non-overlapping confidence intervals (CIs), when sampled persons read that they had the chance to influence a policy (R-indicator = .72, SE = .05, N = 397, 95% CI[.68, .76]) than when they did not read about that chance (R-indicator = .85, SE = .05, N = 403, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.80, .90]</ref>). This increase in nonresponse bias was due to immigrants being slightly less likely to complete the survey if they read about the opportunity to exert influence (bnot born in Sweden = -0.81, SE = 0.25, p &lt; .01) than when they did not (bnot born in Sweden = -0.38, SE = 0.23, p = .10) (see <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>). In addition, participants aged 40-49 years old were slightly more likely than those 16-24 years old to complete the questionnaire when being told about exerting an influence (b40-49 = 1.69, SE = 0.43, p &lt; .001) than when not (b40-49 = 0.62, SE = 0.41, p = .13).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Error</head><p>Sampled persons reading that they had the chance to influence a policy were not more likely to answer more questions (M = 94.94%, SE = 0.01, N = 144) than when not reading that (M = 94.53%, SE = 0.02, N = 131) (b = 0.00, SE = 0.02, p = .83). This effect was not moderated by living in a socially disadvantaged area (b = 0.02, SE = 0.04, p = .63), nor by immigrant status (b = 0.06, SE = 0.04, p =.11) (see <ref type="table">Table S6</ref>). However, reading about influencing policy made respondents type statistically significantly fewer characters (M = 281.68, SE = 22.48, N = 138) than not reading about influencing policy (M = 370.33, SE = 40.10, N = 123) (b = -88.65, SE = 44.72, p = 0.05). But an exploratory analysis revealed that this finding was driven entirely by 30 outliers (typing three standard deviations more characters than the sample average) and excluding those revealed that no difference was found between the treatment and control group (b = -15.71, SE = 20.12, p = .436). The effect on the number of characters typed was not moderated by living in a socially disadvantaged area (b = -54.85, SE = 41.43, p = 0.19), nor by immigrant status (b = -46.90, SE = 43.30, p = .28) (see <ref type="table">Table S7</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this manuscript, an exploratory and a confirmatory phase were used to generate and assess hypotheses for nonresponse and response propensities to surveys in general and among immigrants and socially disadvantaged areas in particular. The exploratory phase produced several different hypotheses for mechanisms driving non-response among immigrants, young adults, and people living in socially disadvantaged areas. Many of the generated hypotheses have already been proposed in survey research, but our findings allude to their added importance when studying hard-to-reach groups like immigrants and people living in socially disadvantaged areas. However, two of the hypotheses generated appear completely novel to survey methodology: internal political efficacy (the perceived ability to influence policy) and survey self-efficacy (the perceived ability to answer surveys) may play a particularly important role for these groups. Perhaps hard-to-reach groups are opting not to participate because they believe they will do poorly in describing their attitudes and behaviors. If so, such respondents may inaccurately believe that non-participation is the most altruistic act and poses the best way to help the researcher or survey sender. Furthermore, even if they believe in their ability to answer the survey, a lack of internal political efficacy may persuade them to not participate since their attitudes and beliefs will not be listened to anyway.</p><p>In the confirmation phase, we did not find support for that attempting to increase internal political efficacy increased response propensities. We posit four explanations for this lack of support: (1) The sample was not large enough to detect small response propensity changes and a posthoc power analysis indicated that 2,175 individuals would have been needed for our observed effect size to be statistically significant with 80% power. <ref type="formula">2</ref> whether trust in the institutions or organizations influences respondents' trust that participation will influence real-life policy. Or (4) the hypothesis generated in the focus group simply did not generalize to a population outside the interviews.</p><p>Lastly, we want to encourage other social scientists to assess the hypotheses generated here. Evaluating the proposed mechanisms behind response propensities will be crucial for developing the tools needed to stem the rising tide of nonresponse bias in surveys and among hard-to-reach populations. </p></div>

Description of Thematic Analysis</head><p>In the first step of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Braun and Clarke's (2006)</ref> step-by-step guide to thematic analysis, the moderator and the project leader read the transcripts several times and shared reflections and initial ideas on the interviews. In the second step, keywords and sentences describing the essence of the data were coded by the moderator. Importantly, in the present analysis, the entire dataset was coded to avoid the risk of missing out on aspects that might be relevant. In the third step, themes were identified by analyzing the codes and checking whether codes belonged to overarching themes. This step resulted in a list of several candidate themes. In the fourth step, the candidate themes were reviewed. A few themes were identified as too broad or too complex and had to be separated into more distinct themes, whereas a few other themes were merged as they were not mutually exclusive. In the fifth step, definitions for each theme were generated by reading and rereading all the data belonging to each theme.</p><p>Thereafter, an intercoder reliability test was conducted by an external coder with experience in conducting focus groups but without experience in survey methodology (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Wibeck, 2010)</ref>. Ten percent of the material was randomly selected and then categorized under the themes based on the definitions of each theme. The test had an agreement rate of 72.7%. The majority of the errors were related to subthemes 2.3. and 2.4. The description of these subthemes was clarified to resolve the discrepancies between the two coders. At the final step of the thematic analysis, vivid quotes/dialogues were selected to represent each theme and presented in the results section of the hypothesis generation phase in the main text.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Theme 1: Perceptions of Societal Factors</head><p>One of the main themes that participants elaborated on centered on societal factors explaining why people choose not to participate in surveys. Within this theme, two subthemes were identified: (1) Opportunity to exert an influenceresponsiveness by society;</p><p>and (2) Trust and attitude toward the sender. The most prominent subtheme, central to the majority of the focus groups, was the need for an opportunity to exert influence and responsiveness by society. Arguments within this theme were often long and developed, and participants frequently returned to this subtheme during the interview. In particular, the focus groups projected a strong willingness to influence issues in their own residential area:</p><p>Focus group 1.</p><p>-So if we sit down and talk about a youth club … maybe we're participating in an interview to express that we want a youth club; then we'll get something out of participating if it's realized. And it's like that, you want to fight for something … -Yeah.</p><p>-You want something in the end. Something to work for, and that we get something out of in the end.</p><p>Yet many participants expressed that they thought their possibilities to influence things were usually limited and that there was a lack of responsiveness from the decisionmakers. Participants described this lack of responsiveness and the limited opportunities to influence as a key reason for not participating in surveys: Many participants said they would be more likely to respond if they perceived the sender's organization to be credible and trustworthy: Focus group 5.</p><p>-If the questionnaire is from the police, I don't think anyone would like to participate.</p><p>-Moderator: No?</p><p>-No, and not if it is from the social administration. But like this, from the university … I don't have any problems with that.</p><p>-It's like, "Help me, help you." You help us, and we help you with your study so … for example, your boss or your teacher or whoever it is … I mean it gets better for you and better for us. However, not all focus groups felt that incentives were a prerequisite for participation.</p><p>For instance, one participant expressed that the opportunity to influence policy was a stronger mechanism for participation than financial incentives: argued they would be more likely to participate if receiving a paper-and-pencil questionnaire, others said paper questionnaires were the least appealing for them and preferred online questionnaires. Some participants mentioned the positive aspects of face-to-face interviews, and hardly anyone had anything negative to say about such interviews. For brevity of presentation, the opinions of different survey modes are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 3 (for detailed</ref> excerpts, see SOM, S2). Furthermore, participants elaborated on different innovative recruitment strategies that might increase the response propensity among immigrants as well as among young people:</p><p>Focus group 4.</p><p>-Moderator: Do you think something can be done to get more people to answer?</p><p>-Yes, maybe you can go to the Swedish Migration Agency. In the queue. They can answer the questions.</p><p>-Or go to SFI schools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Focus group 5.</head><p>Starting with mail questionnaires, some perceived these to be an inefficient way of recruiting participants and felt that they were too demanding:</p><p>-Do you mean that you send these out by mail?</p><p>-Moderator: Yes.</p><p>-Who would … I mean … who would sit down voluntarily … -But not only that … do you have to return it as well?</p><p>-Moderator: <ref type="bibr">Yes. -No, no, wait, wait, wait.</ref> -Yes, it's a lot of work. "What 17/18-year-old is going to sit down and check the mail?" Online questionnaire "Young people are more likely to answer online surveys than mail surveys." "Not reliable: I don't want them to see me online." Face-to-face interview "You might feel more comfortable if you see the person." "Easy to ask follow-up questions and get help if you don't understand." N/A Phone interview N/A "You don't see the person." Note: Quotes from the nine focus groups. N/A = not applicable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Focus group 9.</head><p>On the other hand, some participants said that they preferred mail questionnaires over online questionnaires, as they thought that mail questionnaires were more secure and provided an easier overview of the questionnaire:</p><p>-Moderator: And here we have two letters that are sent out to get people to join online surveys.</p><p>-I've received this.</p><p>-Moderator: Have you been asked to join an online survey?</p><p>-Yes.</p><p>-Moderator: Did you join?</p><p>-No, I refused.</p><p>-Moderator: What made you decide not to join?</p><p>-I didn't want them to see me online.</p><p>-Moderator: So, you thought that it wasn't that safe because it was online?</p><p>-Exactly.</p><p>-Moderator: Would you, for example, trust a mail questionnaire more?</p><p>-Yes.</p><p>-Because in today's society, you can do 1,000 different things online. That's why it might not be reliable. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Focus group 2.</head><p>Another benefit of personal interviews that was raised during the interviews was that it was easier to ask follow-up questions if you did not understand the question:</p><p>-I don't remember which company it was, or what it was about. But anyway, I looked through it. I didn't understand that much, but I tried a bit. But then I finally got tired so I threw it out. interesting. Under this subtheme, many participants mentioned that it could be off-putting if the survey looked formal and that simple language would be beneficial, especially for immigrants:</p><p>Focus group 1. Moreover, participants discussed different ways to frame or "sell" the survey. For example, emphasizing that the participant was important and valuable and that their opinions would affect the outcome of the study would increase survey participation: Focus group 7.</p><p>-And, like I said, I think it should be clearly described how this will affect me.   -Then it's more interesting to answer.  Furthermore, the focus groups expressed that Swedish language skills and understanding the survey were important to get them to participate in surveys:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main theme 3: Individual-Level Factors</head><p>Focus group 6.</p><p>-I received questionnaires from the housing company. Sometimes, at the end of the year, they ask questions like "Is everything alright?" But I don't answer.</p><p>-Moderator: You don't answer?</p><p>-Sometimes they send questionnaires, for instance, the doctor. They ask if I'm sick or if there are any other problems. But it's in difficult Swedish. I don't understand much.</p><p>-Difficult words.</p><p>-There might be three pages. We aren't able to understand three pages. It takes a long time to translate.</p><p>Many participants thought that translating questionnaires might increase survey participation:</p><p>Focus group 1.</p><p>-Yes, but do the questionnaire in several languages, and stuff. As we said before. It helps a lot, I think.</p><p>-And then you would involve different ethnicities in the questionnaires.</p><p>Because Sweden consists of lots of different ethnicities, and stuff, and it would be good to get everyone's view. People come from different places, so they also have experiences about things like, different politics. And they can also compare, so they will give you even more opinions. Or make you get more out of it.</p></div>

Subtheme 2.1. Financial Incentives. Participants discussed the importance of direct rewards-such as money or gift cards-for participating in surveys: Focus group 8. -… as I said, incentives. That you get some kind of reward. Because I mean, usually … if we're talking about adolescents, there might be questions that they aren't that interested or involved in: Compared to adults who work and have children and a car and …, you know?

Another central feature of this subtheme was that most participants appeared to prefer face-to-face interviews over other modes. The personal contact with the interviewer in faceto-face interviews seemed to be key: -I also think it's about what attitude you have as an interviewer. How you approach people. It might be much more convenient when you introduce yourself and tell where you come from. Who you are and what kind of questionnaire it is. Compared to answering a phone call. Then you don't see the person. You might be more comfortable if you see the person.</figDesc></figure>

It takes a long time to look it up. So, if you're at the center and they ask the same questions, then you can at least get help.Subtheme 2.3. Design of the Questionnaire. The participants discussed technical aspects of the survey that they said influenced their likelihood of responding. These included the amount of information in the questionnaire, the length of the survey, and the design of the survey questions (e.g., open-ended questions vs. fixed response options). One prominent view was that a lengthy survey would negatively affect willingness to participate. Focus group 2. -Look at how many pages this is [referring to a questionnaire from the SOM Institute]. -It's like a national university aptitude test. -Look at this! I can be honest: You would look at this. You'd open it. Then you'd see all this, and you'd just throw it out. -Moderator: You don't think that people would even look at the questions? -Well, you read the first sentence and then: "Okay, there are just questions like that." -Ten percent of people may read the whole thing. -If they are retired. -Yeah, exactly. Another aspect of this theme was the design of the questions. Some participants said they preferred being offered response options over being asked open-ended questions: Focus group 1. -I like this! It's checking-off-questions. -Yes! -It's really nice because it's fun to make a check, haha! Because if I see a lot of text I think: "I don't have the energy for this." -Or, like: "What does this mean?" And then you're supposed to write this much [participant demonstrates how much with her hands]. If I have to sit down and write, you probably won't get detailed answers. I would probably just write two words and then just: "Never mind, I can't cope." But to answer this, you have to read and think a little. Subtheme 2.4. Framing and Style of the Survey. The participants discussed how the style of the text in a survey and the visual aspects affected their first impression of the survey: For instance, it could make the survey look important, serious, boring, difficult, or</figDesc></figure>

In similarity to other studies on response propensity interventions (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Oscarsson and Arkhede, 2019)</ref>, the impact of the manipulation on measurement error wasassessed by estimating item nonresponse, length of responses to open-ended questions, and non-differentiation (straight-lining). Percentage of Questions Answered. The percentage of questions answered was estimated by calculating the proportion of questions a participant did not answer out of the total number of questions in the questionnaire (the questionnaire included no filter questions or skip logic, so everyone was eligible to answer all questions). All participants who started the questionnaire and answered at least one question were included in the measure. Participants who did not answer a single question were coded as missing. Characters Typed in Open-Ended Questions. The number of characters written in the open-ended questions was estimated for each participant as one of the data quality measurements. All participants who saw an open-ended question were included in the analyses; participants who saw an open-ended question but did not type any characters were coded as 0.</figDesc></figure>
