			<abstract>
				<p>Every day we engage in activities that require collaboration and assistance from others. Social interactions with children are distinct because they frequently result in partners contributing different amounts of effort. This study investigates the decision-making processes underpinning joint actions; specifically, whether children and adults estimate they will have to invest different amounts of effort when engaging in joint tasks compared to doing the same task by themselves. In 4 Experiments, children and adults estimated the weight of objects when they anticipated that they would be lifted alone and when they thought they would have help. Children and adults estimated the weight of 3 clear baskets carrying different weights (light, medium, and heavy). The estimated weight of objects varied for adults and children depending on whether they thought they would lift alone or together. Children reliably perceived objects as lighter when they expected help from their parent compared to lifting them alone or with the help of a sibling. Parents, in turn, estimated objects would be heavier when they were helping their child. Overall, results suggest that we analyze the costs and benefits of helping another person and the social bond we have with them before engaging in joint actions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Many activities we engage in every day require collaboration and assistance from others. An oftencited example is getting help to move a large object that cannot be lifted without help, such as moving a large table to the patio when hosting a barbeque. Joint activities of this kind are defined by a common goal that is attainable only through cooperative interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. These interactions require different skills:</p><p>predicting what others can and will do, adjusting one's behavior to complement the other person's, and coordinating actions over time. A different kind of joint activities are those that people choose to do jointly but could be accomplished alone, such as setting up the table to eat. Most times, engaging others serves to expedite the attainment of a joint goal; other times, it could hinder or delay its attainment. This happens when one of the participants has to invest more energy than they would need to obtain the same result by themselves. For instance, when a mom teaches her children how to carry a tray to the table without dropping the food. Social interactions with children are distinct in that they frequently result in partners contributing rather different amounts of effort. For child-adult interactions to succeed, the adult partner has two available strategies: she can contribute the same amount of effort required to do the task by herself or take into account the imbalance between her own and the child's action capabilities in predicting how much effort to invest in attaining the joint goal. This study investigates the mechanisms that underpin the decisions to participate in joint actions and how they are shaped by the social context of the task.</p><p>Specifically, the manuscript explores whether children and adults estimate that they will have to invest different amounts of effort when engaging in joint tasks or when doing the same task by themselves and whether these estimations are affected by the social relationship between partners.</p><p>The decision to participate or not in a joint action depends on an intuitive cost-benefit analysis.</p><p>When deciding between action alternatives, we weigh the potential rewards of each alternative against anticipated costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . These decisions can be modulated by our energetic levels, preferences, the potential risks associated, or moral considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> . This process has been explained as depending on the use of "Naïve Utility Models" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. These models assume that when inferring goal attribution agents arrive at decisions by quantifying, comparing, and maximizing their subjective utilities. This involves assessing the disparity between the costs they accumulate and the rewards they gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. In terms of costs, we incur various kinds of coordination costs. For instance, when carrying the food tray with a child, an adult will incur temporal and spatial coordination costs that are not present when carrying the tray alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> . The costs can also be observed in the effort that our co-agent will invest in doing a task together. Research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref> has shown that the motivation to remain engaged in joint actions and to resist tempting alternative options and distractions is governed by an implicit sense of commitment which is modulated by the amount of effort that one's partner has invested in the joint action. But despite this, adults consistently prioritize joint efficiency over individual efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> . Engaging in cooperation carries with it significant benefits: affiliation and reputation enhancement, bolstering one's social status, fostering expectations of future reciprocation, receiving assistance, and demonstrating commitment to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> . In terms of investment of effort, perceiving the partner's effort may elicit a sense of commitment to a cooperative activity, thereby boosting the willingness to reciprocate by contributing more time and effort as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> .</p><p>Few studies have investigated how children develop an understanding of joint tasks based on intuitive cost and benefits analysis. Some studies have found that children's cost-benefit analysis is necessary for prosocial behaviors, such as helping others <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> or sharing objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> . Infants and children prefer to interact with individuals who share ingroup characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> and their decisions to engage in a joint action are influenced by the partner's identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>. By age five, children's ability to reason about the costs and rewards associated with other people's goals implies that they tend to assume that individuals strive to maximize their utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> . When an agent does not appear to maximize their actual utilities, children tend to infer that the agent might have been unaware of their costs or rewards. This finding implies that by the age of four, children already possess an understanding that individuals aim to maximize the utilities they anticipate obtaining, rather than the actual utilities they ultimately receive <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> . Sommerville et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> showed that when 18-month-old infants participated in a helping task that consisted of carrying either a heavy or light block across a room to help an experimenter, the helping behavior was diminished when the anticipated physical costs were high. High-cost helping was greater under conditions of increased motivational benefits. Similarly, a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> assessed whether infants apply expectations of efficiency to collaborative interactions between multiple agents. 14-month-olds familiarized with computer animations of agents performing collaborative actions looked longer at test events that violated expectations of collective efficiency. Taken together, these findings suggest that intuitive cost-benefit analysis might be underpinned by children and adults anticipating each other's contribution to the task; however, it is not clear that in tasks that require investing physical effort, children intuitively expect their partners to make a maximalist contribution or one that is contingent on the amount of effort the child can contribute. The latter would require that partners perceive each other's action capabilities.</p><p>Perception of action capabilities is contingent on the visual system providing a representation of the world that takes into account not only the perceiver's physical capabilities and social influences but also those of other agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref> . Perception is shaped by various factors including the morphology and physiology of an individual's body, as well as, the surrounding physical and social environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> .</p><p>Several studies have found that adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> and children <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> have access to other people's action capabilities and might use this information in deciding whether they need help in accomplishing an individual goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref> . Similarly, the availability of social resources can lead to changes in how we perceive the world: hills appear steeper to participants standing alone than when a friend stands next to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> , boxes are perceived as lighter when participants anticipate lifting them together with a healthy partner compared to a partner wearing a cast or when lifting them alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> , and the distance to carry a box changes depending on whether people anticipate they will have help <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> . The social component that shapes perception is according to some authors the default mode of functioning for the perceptual system <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> . Social Baseline Theory (SBT) provides a framework to speculate on how the processing of social and physical information might lead to an integrated representation of the world and the agents acting within it <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref> . According to this theory, cost-benefit analysis, and estimation of the effort to invest in a task would be modulated by social factors. The implication is that, for instance, perception of the physical properties of objects in the world changes depending on whether the person watching the hill next to you or offering help moving a box is a friend or a stranger.</p><p>The goal of the current study was twofold: 1) to investigate if adults and children make cost-benefit estimations of the effort each partner can invest when they anticipate engaging in a joint action and 2) whether children's and adult's estimations are affected by the social context of the task (i.e., receiving help from a family member or a stranger). Doerrfeld and colleagues' <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> weight-lifting task was adapted to ensure children's ability to provide weight estimations. This paradigm was chosen given the familiarity of children and adults with carrying objects alone and oftentimes together.</p><p>Children have an understanding of the notion of weight from infancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref> and use visual properties (i.e., material composition of objects) to make judgments about the likely weight of an object <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref> . In preschool, children can differentiate between objects of different weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref> and oftentimes use behavioral confirmation, such as lifting them, to confirm their estimations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref> . By age 5, they can for the most part understand that the weight properties of an object can cause changes on other objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref> , and by age 9 have acquired conceptual knowledge that allows them to differentiate between the concepts of weight and density <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref> . Along with this development, children acquire around age 6 the ability to attribute formal units of measurement to the weight of objects and understand the relationship between the size of a unit and the number of units needed to measure the mass of an object <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42]</ref> . Doerrfeld and colleagues' <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> weight-lifting task was also adapted to use a method of standard by which the children and adults were given an object of smaller weight and asked to use it as a ruler to estimate the weight of larger objects (i.e., 'how many of these do you think it weights?"). This allowed for visual information, as well as, haptic kinetic interaction with the material to be used in their estimations <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Four Experiments were designed to test how children <ref type="bibr">(6-12 years)</ref> and adults estimate the weight of objects when they anticipate that they will be lifted alone and when they think they will have help.</p><p>Children and adults estimated the weight of 3 clear baskets carrying different weights (light, medium, and heavy) in two moments: before and after lifting them. The difference in weight estimated before and after lifting was compared for groups of adults who anticipated lifting the baskets alone or with the help of </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>In Experiment 1, we tested whether the paradigm adapted for this study would yield comparable effects to those found in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> . The goal was to find whether participants underestimated the weight of objects when they thought they were going to lift them together. We used a paradigm that consisted of assessing the weight of an object relative to a standard. This methodology allowed us to prevent differences in familiarity with the metric system to bias estimations and provided a paradigm that could be used with children as well as adults. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head><p>At the beginning of the study, participants stood 2 meters from the stimuli facing it, while an experimenter stood behind the stimuli. The stimuli consisted of 3 transparent baskets of the same size and were of light (1 kg), medium (2 kg), or heavy (3 kg) weight and were covered with a thick fabric. The baskets contained small white stones used commonly as cat litter so that the differences in weight were visually apparent, as these stones are light but voluminous. Also, we consider this material because even young children could lift them by themselves. Participants were given a transparent plastic bag weighing 250 grams (standard) and told that they would have to estimate the weight of different objects using the weight of the bag as a reference. A second experimenter stood next to the participants and provided instructions during the study. All responses were given verbally, and participants held the plastic bag in their hands throughout the experimental session. The first experimenter lifted the cover from each of the objects in random order and recorded the participant's responses. Before uncovering each of the baskets the second experimenter repeated the following instructions: "You will lift that basket together, how many of these bags does it weigh?" Afterward, participants were asked to lift alone without help each of the baskets in the same randomized order they were uncovered. First, they lifted a basket and upon putting it down provided an estimation of its weight; the process was then repeated for the second estimation before moving on to the second basket. During the weigh estimations the experimenter retrieved the standard from the participant and held it in their hands. Instructions were: "How many of these bags does the basket weigh?" At the end of the study general feedback in terms of how right they were on their estimations was provided. The study lasted approximately 10 to 15 minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>First, we calculated the ratio between the estimations provided and the actual weight of each basket. This was done separately for estimations provided before and after lifting. Secondly, we subtracted the value obtained for the before ratios from the after ratios. This yields a measurement of how much participants either under or overestimated the weight of each basket before lifting them relative to how heavy they thought they were when they lifted them. In general, participants underestimated the weight of all three baskets: light (-10.85%), medium (-14.80%), and heavy (-20.17%) weight. T-test comparisons showed that the differential ratios obtained were significantly different from 0 for the medium, t <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(39)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In general terms, results showed that this paradigm is well suited for the purposes of this study (i.e., adult-child task). The fact that in general underestimations were small could be attributed to the fact that the baskets appeared quite light and easy to lift. Because estimations were made relative to a standard, participants had some information about the weight of the material contained in the baskets. The adapted paradigm seems well-suited for the purposes of this study. It is possible that using a different methodology or heavier objects with larger differences between them might have yielded larger differences; however, such modifications would be harder to implement for children who have less strength than adults.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>In this experiment, three groups of children (one for each social condition) estimated the weight of plastic baskets before and after lifting them. Depending on the group, they provided estimations of weight before lifting thinking that they would lift the baskets by themselves or with the help of another known or unknown person. All children were then asked lift each basket by themselves and to provide an estimation of its weight. The difference in estimation ratios provided before and estimation ratios provided after provided a measure of the changes in the estimated amount of effort it would require to lift the baskets. We predicted that children in the groups that expected to lift the baskets with the help of another person would underestimate the weight of the baskets (i.e., expect them to be lighter) compared with children that expected no help. In addition, we expected the underestimation would be larger for children who thought they would lift with the help of a parent compared to children who thought they were going to lift with the help of an experimenter. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head><p>The procedures and materials used were similar to those followed in Experiment 1. The main difference was the instructions children in each group were given for the before-lifting estimates. These were: for children in the alone group "How many of these bags do that basket weigh?", for children in the experimenter group "You will lift that basket with me, how many of these bags does it weight?", and for children in the parent group "You will lift that basket with your mom/dad, how many of these bags does it weight?" In the parent group, as in Experiment 1, the experimenter stood to the left and the parent to the right of the child. After-lifting instructions were identical for all three groups. At the end of the study general feedback in terms of how right they were on their estimations was provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Differential ratios were calculated following the same procedure as in Experiment 1. For the 3 groups and in all weight conditions results showed that children underestimated the weight of the object before lifting it. Children who expected to lift alone were quite accurate; they judged the light basket as -3.02% lighter, the middle basket as -4.74% lighter, and the heavy basket as -5.60% lighter than they actually were. Children who expected to lift with help from the experimenter judged the light basket as -11.42% lighter, the middle basket as -17,03% lighter, and the heavy basket as -16.81% lighter than they actually were. Finally, children that expected to lift with a parent judged the light basket as -6.90% lighter, the middle basket as -15.09% lighter, and the heavy basket as -14.66% lighter than they actually were.</p><p>Mixed ANOVA with group (alone vs. experimenter vs. parent) and basket weight (light, medium, and heavy) as main factors was conducted on the values obtained. Results showed a main effect for weight,  <ref type="bibr">15, p=.035, d=0.56</ref>. No differences were found in the comparison between the experimenter and the parent group. Finally, linear regression analyses showed that age was not a significant predictor for the estimates provided for the three weights. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>These results support our prediction that children would underestimate the weight of the object when they thought they would lift them with the help of an adult; however, we did not find that this underestimation increased for children who thought the help would come from a parent. This suggests that familiarity with the person that provides the help does not affect the intended effort children estimate they would have to invest to carry out the joint lifting action. These results do not rule out, however, that the intended effort a person estimates they have to invest in joint actions might be affected by social or familiar factors, only that children do expect to invest less effort when the help comes from an adult. In Experiment 3, we investigated this question by comparing the estimations provided by pairs of siblings and pairs of children who didn't know each other before the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3</head><p>In this experiment, we were interested in investigating whether children's estimations would change depending on whether they thought they would lift the baskets with the help of a sibling or a child they did not previously know. We expected that the familiarity between siblings would affect their estimations, biasing them to either larger or smaller underestimations compared to children who did not know each other. The direction of the difference between groups was predicated on the notion that children could expect more help from a close in-group co-actor, which would lead them to estimate less effort would have to be invested in the joint task, or, alternatively, that children would expect to invest more effort to help an in-group co-actor compared to children interacting with out-group co-actors. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head><p>The procedures and materials used were the same as those in Experiment 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Children underestimated the weight of the baskets before lifting them. However, the amount of underestimation depended on the relationship between participants. Siblings produced smaller underestimations compared to children that did not know each other (Siblings: light basket as -8.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>These results suggest that the familiar relationship between children affects how much effort they anticipate they will have to invest in a joint action. Siblings did not anticipate having to invest less effort when lifting along with a brother or sister. For the most part, they behaved similarly to children that were expecting to lift by themselves as in Experiment 2. This indicates that familiar relations shape the children's perceptions of how much they would have to invest and how much help they would obtain from others when engaging in a joint action with a sibling. In Experiment 4, we extended the notion that identity fusion might shape how individuals perceive the intended effort required by a joint task by asking parentchild dyads to both provide estimations of the weights of the baskets and obtained estimations from both partners in the interaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 4</head><p>To further explore the relationship between familiar relationships and estimations of intended effort, we asked children and their parents to provide an estimate of the weight of three baskets before and after lifting them. Based on the results of Experiment 2, we expected children to underestimate the weight of the baskets when they thought they would have help from a known adult. Based on the results of Experiment 3, we expected that the familiar relationship between participants would affect their estimates;</p><p>we predicted that parents would anticipate they would invest all the effort necessary for the lifting, and the before and after estimates would not be significantly different from each other. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Children underestimated the weight contained in the 3 baskets: the light basket as -10.00% lighter, the middle basket as -17.08% lighter, and the heavy basket as -27.15% lighter. Parents, however, overestimated the weight of the three baskets: the light basket as 4.17% lighter, the middle basket as 6.25% lighter, and the heavy basket as 5.01% lighter. Mixed ANOVA with perceiver (child vs. parent) and basket weight (light, medium, and heavy) showed a significant interaction between perceiver and basket weight, F(1,58)=4.37, p=.041. Pairwise comparisons indicated that parents' and children's estimations were significantly different from each other for the medium, t(58)=3.08,p=003, d=2.72, and heavy, t(58)=4. <ref type="bibr">38, p&lt;000, d=1.11, baskets.</ref> Parents' estimations were not significantly different from 0 for either of the 3 baskets; Children, as in previous Experiments, significantly underestimated the weight of the medium, t(29)=3.72, p=001, d=.96, and heavy, t(29)=5.91, p&lt;000, d=1.52, baskets. Also, as in previous Experiments, no effects were found for the light basket. Regression analyses showed that the age of the perceiver was not a significant predictor of the estimations they produced, but their identity (parent vs. child) was (β=-4.31), r 2 (57)=.254, F(2, 57) =9.68, p&lt;.000. Opposite effect of what would be expected if social power was a factor.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>A surprising result was found in this experiment: parents tended to overestimate the weight of the baskets. This outcome contrasts with the results of Experiment 1, where adults receiving assistance from other adults tended to underestimate the weight of the baskets. These findings align with expectations that social information plays a role in planning joint actions. The results of this experiment suggest that our perception and effort in joint actions can be influenced not only by the distribution of risks within a social group but also by the deeper benefits of trust, familiarity, and interdependence that come with close relational partnerships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Overall, the results of this study showed that children and adults make cost-benefit estimations when they anticipate that they will receive help, but also when they anticipate who will be providing such help. Experiment 1 found that participants significantly underestimated the weight of the three baskets when they thought they would lift them with the help of another person. The same pattern was found when children had to estimate the weight of objects anticipating that they would lift them either alone, with an experimenter, or with one of their parents (Experiment 2). The different effort investment was more pronounced when children had to estimate the weight of objects anticipating that they would lift them alone or with the help of a sibling (Experiment 3). Finally, an unexpected result was found when groups of children and parents had to estimate the weight of objects anticipating that they would lift them together (Experiment 4): parents overestimated the weight of baskets meaning that they had to invest greater levels of effort to carry that joint task. Taken together, findings suggest that by school age, children seem to understand that joint action does not require the same degree of effort or cost from all participants in the interaction.</p><p>These findings have several implications for our understanding of the cost-benefit analysis that we intuitively perform when we engage in joint actions. On the one hand, results support the notion that the investment of energy in a joint task is intrinsically a cost-benefit evaluation in terms of the potential rewards of each alternative against anticipated costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . In the first Experiment, results showed that the participants significantly underestimated the weight of the three baskets when they thought they would lift them with the help of another person. This finding shows that we consistently recalibrate our action capabilities when we are doing something with another person. In this case, receiving help from the other eases the physical burden resulting in a benefit from participating in a joint action. However, contrary to our expectations, the underestimations were not significantly different for the three baskets. The lack of effect for the light basket can be explained by the fact that all three baskets, at first glance, seemed quite light and easy to lift and that participants could have used prior knowledge about the weight of the material contained in the baskets. Further studies could replicate this paradigm by changing the material contained in the objects to provide stronger evidence.</p><p>On the other hand, results support the notion that the estimations of effort investment are affected by the social relationship between co-agents. In experiment 2, children in all groups and in all conditions underestimated the weight of the object before lifting it. This is consistent with Social Baseline Theory (SBT) framework; being close to social resources regulates our propensity to invest physical effort. SBT states that our species is embedded in a social context where others share resources and help or contribute to successfully achieve certain goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> . Results from Experiment 2 are coherent with this hypothesis; it aligns with the expectation that children possess a heightened perception of individuals who actively engage with them and are readily available to provide assistance. Children who expected to lift with the help of an experimenter or with the help of the parents significantly underestimated the weights, in the same way that the adults did in Experiment 1.</p><p>SBT also proposes that the resources to be invested are modulated by the type of relationship between people <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44]</ref> . This suggests that although the effort to invest when we do things together considers the effort that the other person can invest, this does not change when there is a bond between the co-actors. Our results show the opposite pattern; the effect of social closeness was not observed in this task. There were no significant differences in the underestimations provided by the group expecting help from an experimenter and the group expecting help from a parent. This suggests that the mere presence of an adult might change children's cost-benefit analyses regardless of their social bond with the adult.</p><p>Children anticipate that adults will always invest as much effort as necessary regardless of whether they have a bond with them.</p><p>Estimations did not show developmental trend effects. Children who expected to lift the basket by themselves were quite accurate, which confirms the viability of the paradigm for children aged 6 onwards. Results of Experiment showed that children underestimated the weight of the baskets before lifting them when they thought they were going to lift with a sibling. This finding is consistent with the idea that children's estimations are affected by familiarity. Children might be tuned to the action capabilities of those close to them. Also, social closeness and familiarity between children influence how much effort they anticipate they will have to invest in a joint action. These findings provide further support to the notion that social resources shape the perception of the physical world, and that the energy cost can be shared between both action agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> . Carrying out these actions together with a family member generates a visceral feeling of unity with the other that leads to more cooperation and understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref> . Siblings are willing to invest the resources necessary to lift the whole load, regardless of their age or the difference in age between them. However, studies that test similar abilities in children estimating for adults they have different degrees of familiarity with could provide critical information toward our understanding of the development of social affordances. Moreover, an important question for future research is whether different anthropometric differences between coagents were an intervening factor in the performance of the joint task. In other words, social interactions could be constrained by the child's ability to map their body to the adult or sibling co-actor.</p><p>The fourth and final Experiment was conducted to further explore the relationship between familiar relationships and estimations of intended effort. The most interesting result was that the parents overestimated the weight of the baskets. This result is contrary to that of Experiment 1 in which adults receiving help of another adult underestimated the weight of the baskets. These results are in line with what would be expected if social information is considered in planning joint actions. SBT describes at least two reasons for regulating perception and effort by social proximity: 1) risk distribution, and 2) energy cost. Risk distribution refers to the statistical distribution of environmental risks among individuals within a group <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref> . Proximity to a family conspecific has deeper benefits than those associated with simple risk sharing, especially when that family conspecific is a relational partner (romantic partner, family member, etc.). This is because energy conservation is no longer just a function of risk sharing, but also of trust, familiarity, joint attention, and interdependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> . In humans especially, degrees of familiarity frequently coincide with degrees of interdependence, and interdependent others often engage in behaviors that have significant benefits to one's well-being. For example, a relational partner can be counted on to share goals and care for children <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref> , help when sick or injured, contribute to surveillance of possible threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref> , and share resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref> .</p><p>In conclusion, our findings indicate that when we think about doing something in interaction with others, we not only plan our actions differently to adapt to the other person's, but we also perceive the properties of objects and surfaces in the environment differently. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that intervene in the decisions to participate in joint actions. Plus, with our results, we aim to extend the findings of previous studies that showed how people regulate the amount of effort they invest in a task depending on the effort they their partner is investing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> . Strachan and Török <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref> found that participants are aware of the effort invested by themselves and their partners in a joint task and tend to prioritize the efficiency of a joint task over the efficiency of their individual actions.</p><p>Asymmetry or inequality in the individual contributions to a joint action do not appear to be considered when distributing joint tasks. Similar interpretations could be applied to our results; children may prioritize the efficiency of the joint task (e.g., we can lift this basket) but parents and siblings may prioritize the efficiency of their individual actions (e.g., I can carry the whole load by myself). However, follow-up studies that measure differences in intended and actual effort invested in joint and individual tasks are necessary to further disentangle this question.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>another adult (Experiment 1), groups of children who anticipated lifting the baskets alone or with the help of an experimenter or a parent (Experiment 2), groups of children who anticipated lifting the baskets alone or with the help of a sibling (Experiment 3), and groups of parents and their children who anticipated lifting the baskets together (Experiment 4).</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_8"><head>Findings</head><label></label><figDesc>suggest that from an early age, children understand the mechanisms that precede the decision to participate in a joint action and they can differentiate between their own and another person's future invested effort. This suggests that children at this age know the future benefits when asking adults for help when sharing a load. This result is in line with infant studies (e.g. 35) which indicate that from 8 months children recognize the limits of the boundaries of their action capabilities and can request help from an adult. However, findings of studies that have investigated how children develop an understanding of joint tasks [4,16,17] have not provided a clear picture of whether children understand the consequences in terms of physical effort of engaging in joint actions. Based on our results, children naturally expect their partners to either make a maximal contribution, giving their best effort, or to contribute in a way that is proportional or contingent on the amount of effort the child themselves can put forth. These intuitive expectations reflect a fundamental understanding of fairness and reciprocity in cooperative interactions, even at a young age.</figDesc></figure>
