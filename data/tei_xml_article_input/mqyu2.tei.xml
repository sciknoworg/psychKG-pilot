			<abstract>
				<p>Humans live in a fundamentally social world. The behavior and judgments from friends, colleagues, television hosts and social media feeds drive our purchase decisions, induce lifestyle changes, and determine voting preferences. People tend to be more sensitive to social information when they are unsure about their own beliefs, and assign more weight to social information when its source is highly confident. However, little is known about the relative impact of the confidence of self and others on social information use, and how they jointly shape social transmission. Here we show with two incentivized decision-making experiments that the confidence of others had a substantially larger impact on social information use than people&apos;s own confidence. In tasks involving perceptual decisions (experiment 1; N=203) and US election predictions (experiment 2; N=213), participants could adjust their initial judgments upon observing judgments of others and were rewarded for accuracy. Adjustments were most strongly impacted by the confidence of others, particularly when participants&apos; own confidence was low. Furthermore, confidence also affected adjustment heuristics: confident others prompted participants to compromise more often, rather than to stick with their initial judgments. Our results highlight how giving more weight on the confidence of others can be a double-edged sword: it can accelerate learning when confidence is related to accuracy, but it also leaves people vulnerable to sources who confidently share misinformation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Humans are constantly exposed to the behavior and opinions of others. Such social information can help individuals adjust to new social circumstances and improve the accuracy of their decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Social information is often accompanied by a certain degree of confidence: TV anchors and politicians take assertive postures, consultants are rarely unsure when offering advice, and social media feeds abound in opinionated comments. Research suggests that the impact of a statement critically depends on the confidence of its source <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Confident witnesses are more likely to accurately identify suspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, and medical teams can efficiently converge on a correct diagnosis when an experienced doctor is confident about their assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. However, when high confidence is unsupported by facts -as often in those holding dogmatic or extreme views <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>, misleading information may readily spread, exacerbating polarization, threatening the adoption of medical advice, and potentially swaying election outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</p><p>It is therefore crucial to understand when and how individuals use confidence (their own and that of others) to update their beliefs. Typically, people do not blindly follow others, but instead adaptively weigh social information against their own knowledge and beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. This weighting process can be aided by cues that speak directly to the value of social information, and people tend to prioritise sources with expertise, prestige, or success <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. However, in many real-word scenarios, individuals cannot observe cues about performance (of others nor themselves). In those cases, expressed or experienced confidence can serve as an indirect cue that guides how individuals weigh social information.</p><p>Here, confidence is defined as the subjective beliefs in the accuracy of an opinion or a judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>. Individuals can access their confidence in their own judgments through introspection. Ample empirical evidence indicates that when unconfident, people tend to search more for social information, and rely more heavily on social information in making decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. The reliability of social information may be gauged from the confidence expressed by its source, based on verbal or non-verbal expressions (e.g., stating "I'm sure"). Both confidence of self and others are associated with activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), where they are integrated in the valuation of options <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. Although in everyday life, the confidence of self and others simultaneously shape social information use, experimental studies have hitherto only examined their effects in isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. It therefore remains unclear what is the relative impact of the confidence of self and others in integrating social information, and how the two interact to update individuals' beliefs.</p><p>We address these issues in three steps. First, we experimentally examine the relative impact of individuals' own confidence and that of others in integrating social information. Given that people generally prioritise their own information over that of others (i.e. egocentric discounting; (28)), one might expect that people will also focus mostly on their own confidence when confronted with social information. Alternatively, people might respond more strongly to the confidence of others than to their own confidence. Confidence cues are often prominent in everyday communication, and in those cases exposure to confident others may shift people's attention from their own (implicit) state of confidence to the (explicit) confidence of the other. Second, we investigate how the confidence of self and others interact. We expected the impact of others' confidence to be particularly pronounced when individuals' own confidence is low. Conversely, when confident, individuals should be more likely to simply ignore social information regardless of the confidence associated with it. Third, we delineate how the confidence of self and others influences individuals' heuristics of responding to social information, shaping the likelihood that they copy social information, stick with their own beliefs, or make a compromise between them. Understanding these heuristics is of crucial importance as they drive belief dynamics in groups and the spread of behaviors across social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>.</p><p>We present the results of two pre-registered, incentivized experiments. Participants had to make judgments in an abstract estimation task (experiment 1) and in a naturalistic task in which they had to predict the results of the 2020 US elections (experiment 2). They could revise their estimates after observing the judgment and confidence of another participant, but did not receive any feedback throughout the task. The experiments are similar in structure, with the second task eliciting predictions about a current topic of global relevance (the 2020 US election), thus providing a more stringent test for validity of the effects of confidence on social influence.</p><p>The two experiments consistently show that the confidence of others had a substantially larger impact on social information use than the confidence of self. Furthermore, the effect of others' confidence was particularly pronounced when participants' own confidence was low, even though confidence and accuracy were not correlated in our experiment. Finally, when others' confidence was high, participants were less likely to stick with their own judgment and were more likely to compromise towards social information. Our study provides convergent evidence that, for good or ill, confident sources are heeded more, especially by those who are not confident themselves. We conclude that accounting for this bias can help individuals and groups make effective decisions, and prevent people from spreading misinformation by projecting high confidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>General setup. Both experiments involve decision making tasks in which participants made numerical estimates and were rewarded for accuracy. In experiment 1, they estimated the number of animals shown in an image <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1A)</ref>. In experiment 2, they predicted the proportion of Democrats and Republican voters (out of 100) by state for the 2020 US presidential elections ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>; Methods for details). After providing a first estimate and their confidence rating, participants observed the estimate of another participant (a 'peer') and the peer's confidence rating. Then, they provided a second estimate. We measure social information use (s) as the relative adjustment from first to second estimates (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> for formal definition). . Participants first observe an image with animals on them for 6 seconds, provide their first estimate of their number ( 1 , grey rectangle) and rate their confidence in their estimate on a 1-10 scale. On the next screen, participants observe the estimate of a peer ( , red square), the peer's confidence (highlighted on the scale), and their own first estimate ( 1 , white rectangle). Then they provide a second estimate ( 2 , grey rectangle). B. A round of the election prediction task (experiment 2). For a US state, participants predict the proportion of Democratic and Republican votes (out of 100; 1 ), and rate their confidence as 'Low' or 'High'. On the next screen, they observe the prediction of a peer ( ) and their confidence, and make a second prediction ( 2 ). In both experiments we measure social information use (s) as the relative adjustment from first to second judgments =</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( 2 − 1 ) ( − 1 )</formula><p>. When personal and social information are weighted equally, = 0.5. In addition to measuring adjustments in each round, we considered three heuristics: stay (ignore social information; = 0), compromise (move towards social information, 0 &lt; &lt; 1) and copy (adopt social information, = 1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>. For an overview of basic results, see SI §2.</p><p>To avoid deception, peer judgments presented to participants were selected from a previously collected pool of data in which different participants completed the same incentivised tasks without social information. In the main experiment, we selected social information to systematically vary the confidence of the observed peer, creating an equal number of rounds with low and high peer confidence (Methods). Combinations of 'Low' (L) and 'High' (H) confidence resulted in 4 experimental conditions -LL, LH, HL, HH (where letters refer to own confidence and peer confidence, respectively). Our setup isolates the effects of confidence ratings on social information use, excluding effects of participants' knowledge of their peers' relative performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>, differential access to evidence (3), or interdependence of payoffs with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>. Furthermore, participants only received feedback about their accuracy after completing all trials of the task, to minimize any learning about their own performance and the possible value of social information. Experiment 1. Participants completed 20 rounds of a validated judgment task <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> in which they were briefly shown images, and had to estimate the number of animals displayed in them <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1A)</ref>. To manipulate participants' own confidence, the image was partly covered in half of the rounds (Methods). Confidence ratings (1-10) were not incentivised, and as pre-registered, they entered the analyses as Low if &lt;4 and High if &gt;6 (Methods).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2.</head><p>Participants completed 20 rounds of a novel, naturalistic prediction task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1B)</ref>. In each round, they were asked to predict the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election for one state (see <ref type="table">Table S1for</ref> full list). Confidence ratings ('Low' or 'High') were incentivized by telling participants that rounds in which they expressed high confidence would be twice more likely to be selected for payment than rounds with low confidence.</p><p>People prioritize personal over social information. Overall, participants revised their judgments in the direction of social information by .37 in experiment 1, and by .30 in experiment 2. This magnitude of adjustments is comparable to studies using similar designs (first estimate, then revise; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>). In both experiments, participants' average adjustments rarely exceeded .50. This result is indicative of the widely documented phenomenon of egocentric discounting, in which people assign more weight to their own beliefs than to social information <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>.</p><p>Social information use is more strongly impacted by peer confidence than by own confidence. In both experiments, adjustments varied substantially with experimental conditions ( <ref type="figure">Fig</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2A</ref>). Notably, the effect of peer confidence was about twice as large as the effect of participants' own confidence. This suggests that people' s social information use is influenced more by others' confidence than by their own confidence.  <ref type="table">Table S2</ref> &amp; S3 for full model specification and robustness checks).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individuals respond the most to peer confidence when their confidence is low.</head><p>Participants' own confidence and the confidence of the peer credibly interacted with each other (experiment 1: b = -.07, C.I. = (-.11, -.04); experiment 2: b = -.03, 95 % C.I. = (-.06, -.00); <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2A</ref>). In both experiments, the impact of peer confidence on social information was most pronounced when participants' own confidence was low. This indicates that the internal state of individuals -i.e., being more or less confident -may suppress or enhance responses to peer confidence in integrating social information.</p><p>Peer confidence drives the use of heuristics. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows the distribution of heuristics participants used in individual rounds, broken down by experiment and conditions. Overall, 'compromise' was most frequent (experiment 1: 72%, experiment 2 60% of cases), followed by 'stay' (19% and 30%), while 'copy' was rare (9%, and 8%, with most instances of 'copy' belonging to a small subgroup, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure S1</ref>). Across conditions, the majority of compromising cases were (0&lt;s&lt;0.5; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>, light green), implying that participants discounted social information relative to their own estimate. Notably, the largest proportion of rounds in which is either s = .5 or s &gt;.5 is observed in the LH condition. The relative frequency of the adjustment strategies markedly varied by condition. In both experiments, 'stay' was credibly more likely in the LL, HL and HH conditions than in the LH condition. Compromising followed a complementary pattern: participants were equally likely to compromise in the LL, HL and HH conditions, and credibly more likely to do so in the LH condition. The frequency of 'copy' did not credibly vary between conditions (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S4</ref> &amp; S5 for the detailed statistics). Overall, these results indicate that people are most likely to change their mind and make a compromise when their own confidence is low and the confidence of their social source is high. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this paper we examined how social information use is shaped by the concerted action of individuals' own confidence and the confidence of others. Our experiments provide convergent behavioral evidence for three phenomena. First, social information use is impacted more by others' confidence than by their own confidence. Second, the effect of others' confidence is particularly strong when people's own confidence is low. Third, highly confident others are more likely to induce individuals to compromise.</p><p>In both our experiments, and consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>, participants assigned more weight to their own estimates than to those of others (mean s &lt; 0.5; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2A,B</ref>). It is therefore surprising that social information use was impacted more strongly by the confidence of others than by their own. This result might stem from the fact that -as in many real-life situations -peer confidence was salient and explicitly communicated, while participants' own confidence was only implicitly available. Given that salient features tend to be prioritised in decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>, the confidence of others might have particularly strong effects on social information use. Those seeking to increase their influence can take advantage of this asymmetry by strategically projecting high confidence. Such behavior can be particularly dangerous in online environments, where individuals typically take little time to process information and often use contextual cues (e.g. number of likes, retweets) to evaluate its quality (37) while confidence is not always a reliable cue. Raising awareness about saliency effects can help individuals effectively weigh the value of information. In practice, this means 1) using confidence cues only when they reliably predict accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>, and 2) counter the saliency effect by shifting attention from confidence of others to own confidence. Although participants' confidence in their own judgments had relatively modest effects on social information use, it did modulate the impact of the confidence of others <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig.  2C</ref>). That is, when participants were confident, they tended to make their second judgments with little regard to the judgments of others, and little sensitivity to others' confidence. This might reflect participants being 'cognitive misers' (39) saving effort by ignoring social information when it is not needed. This behavior is consistent with observations that high confidence is associated with reduced search for social information <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. Our result shows that confidence-based social transmission depends on the interplay between confidence of learners and confidence of sources, and suggests that individuals' own uncertainty reflects their willingness to invest effort to acquire or process social information.</p><p>Confidence of others, but not their own confidence, produced pronounced effects on heuristics <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3)</ref>. When other's confidence was high, people were less likely to stay with their initial beliefs and more willing to compromise between their beliefs and social information. Adjusting towards the opinion of confident others can improve group decisions (41), but it will do so only if confidence reliably predicts accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. Our results suggest that, in the absence of feedback about individual performance, people maintain the default assumption that others' confidence is well calibrated to their accuracy. In addition, when groups have to solve problems that require coordination (e.g. designing policies to curb carbon emissions or to reduce covid-19 infections), efficiently reaching an agreement becomes key. In these scenarios, compromising can foster consensus-building <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>, and our results suggest that confident individuals may accelerate this process by prompting their peers to change their minds.</p><p>Our work is not without limitations. First, during the experiment, participants did not receive any feedback on their own performance or that of others. They could therefore not learn how accurate their estimates were. This mimics decision situations that usually lack objective information about the accuracy of beliefs, e.g., in courtrooms (43), on stock exchanges (4, 44), or on social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>. However, future studies may assess if the observed disproportionate influence of confident peers holds when people can learn how good they are at a given task (e.g., through recognition by colleagues or using feedback from fact checking sources (e.g. https://www.factcheck.org/, https://www.politifact.com/)). If people had evidence that they perform better than their peers, they may use less social information -or ignore it altogether. Second, it would be of theoretical interest to compare the impact of confidence cues to other cues that shape social information use <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46)</ref>. For example, in a recent study where people could choose amongst different types of social cues, they mostly opted for decisions of experts over decisions of prestigious peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>. It remains an open question whether people would pay less attention to others' confidence when they could learn about their success or social status <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Finally, social information use might be shaped by the interaction of confidence with other social cues, like expertise. For example, would unconfident experts be followed less than confident laymen?</p><p>Our findings contribute to literature on social learning by extending the research on how people weigh social information. Specifically, we find that while one's own confidence impacts social transmission, people value the confidence of others more strongly, taking it as a reliable signal. Our findings highlight two important considerations for everyday decision-making. First, the implicit belief in the validity of confidence signals may be justified in cooperative environments, where learners and sources share common goals (e.g., a hiring committee trying to select the best applicant), but leaves individuals vulnerable to those who falsely project confidence (e.g. social media influencers trying to sell sponsored products; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr">48)</ref>. Second, effective use of confidence as a signal of reliability assumes that our own, but also other's confidence is well calibrated and communicated. This is especially important for the communication of information on complex issues, such as climate change, where experts may be more reluctant to express full confidence on a given solution whereas those with a superficial understanding may be convinced of their positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(49)</ref>. Thus, when individuals are uncertain and are tempted to use social information from confident others, they should carefully consider their source's interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>, and factcheck the validity of their source's claims.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>General procedures. Both experimental designs were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (experiment 1: https://osf.io/wbpd7/; experiment 2: https://osf.io/ar4kx/ ). Deviations from the pre-registered analysis can be found in the Supplementary Text. Participants were recruited online through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants were selected only amongst USA residents with a history of at least 95% approved tasks. Procedures were approved by the local Ethics Review Board (case number 2020-DP-12605).</p><p>Analyses. All the analyses were performed using the statistical software R (R Core Team, 2021), in the IDE RStudio (RStudio Team, 2021). Data cleaning and wrangling were supported by the tidyverse package (50), while Bayesian regression models were fitted using brms <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(51)</ref>. As pre-registered, and consistent with previous studies using similar paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>, statistical models fitted to s only included rounds in which second judgments were a weighted average of own first judgments and social information (that is, 0 ≤ ≤ 1), which were the large majority of rounds (95% in experiment 1, 90% in experiment 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>Participants. 203 participants (mean age = 37.87, s.d = 10.85, range = 22 -74, 34.5% female) were recruited for study 1. They were compensated with a fixed fee of $2.00, plus an additional bonus up to $1.00 (average =$0.52, SD = $0.20) depending on their performance, for a total expected payment of ~ $2.50 (~$10.00/hr). The bonus was calculated by randomly selecting one of the 20 rounds, and evaluating participants' performance for that specific round (for each animal their estimate was off, we subtracted $0.05 from their bonus of $1.00, the bonus could not become negative). This setup incentivized participants to invest an equal amount of effort in each round and avoided income effects.</p><p>Task Design. The experiment consisted of a short (15 minutes) decision-making task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1A)</ref>. In each of the 20 rounds, participants saw for 6 seconds an image containing a number of animals (between 50 and 100). The image was either fully revealed (complete information condition) or partially revealed (uncertain condition). The aim of this first manipulation was to vary participants' baseline subjective confidence in their own estimate. After the image had disappeared, participants were asked to give an estimate of the correct number of animals by using a slider, and to rate their confidence in their estimate on a scale from 1 ('Not confident at all') to 10 ('Extremely confident'). Participants subsequently observed the estimate of a previous participant (a 'peer'), who saw the same stimulus for the same amount of time, and had the same task of estimating the number of animals on it. On the same screen, participants observed the peer's confidence rating, expressed on the same scale as the one that participants used. This information (estimate and confidence rating) was collected in an earlier iteration of the experiment, where N = 62 participants played the solo condition and after that reported their confidence ratings. Thus, all the social information displayed was real. From this pool of pre-recorded data, we selected in each round the estimate of a peer that was closest to the target value X'. We defined X' such that it always pointed in the direction of the true value. Specifically, we defined X'= E1 • (1+/-Δ), where E1 is the participants initial estimate, where Δ=0.2 if E1 was lower than the true value, and Δ=-0.2, if E1 was higher than the true value <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. If E1 was equal to the true value, either value of Δ was chosen with equal probability. Δ was selected to leave participants enough room to adjust and controlling for distance effects that might influence adjustments <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>.</p><p>For a peer estimate to be selected as social information, we applied one additional criterion: it had to be associated with a confidence rating that matched the experimental treatment of the current round. The ratings were distributed on a scale from 1 (Not confident at all) to 10 (Extremely confident). Three experimental treatments were derived from these ratings: low peer confidence (ratings between 1 and 4), medium peer confidence (ratings between 5 and 6) and high peer confidence (ratings between 7 and 10). These cut-off points were chosen to create a separation between the two treatments of interest, namely low peer confidence and high peer confidence (see preregistered design).</p><p>Over the 20 rounds, participants saw social information reflecting low confidence (between 1 and 4) in 8 rounds, social information reflecting high confidence (between 7 and 10) in 8 rounds, and social information reflecting medium confidence (between 5 and 6) in 4 rounds. We used the medium confidence rounds as 'filler' rounds, i.e. rounds that made the experiment more realistic from the participants' point of view, by including more values from the confidence scale, but which were excluded from some of the analyses. Δ was kept constant at 0.2 in 'filler' rounds as well. For this reason, we included fewer medium confidence rounds.</p><p>In experiment 1, as pre-registered, confidence ratings of peers were grouped by categories (Low: 1-4; Medium: 5-6; High: 7-10 on a 10-point scale), and filler rounds in which confidence was 'Medium' were excluded from the analysis (alternative analyses in which confidence is treated as continuous variable produce qualitatively identical results; see <ref type="table">Table S6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>Participants. 213 participants (mean age = 38.84, s.d = 11.70, range = 20 -71, 45.54% female) were recruited for study 2. Data was collected during the week prior to the 2020 US presidential election (October 26th-29th 2020). Compensation consisted of a fixed fee of $1.70, plus an additional bonus up to $2.00 (average =$0.94, SD = $0.60) depending on the performance, for a total expected payment of ~ $2.70 (~$12.00/hr). The bonus was calculated by randomly selecting two out of the 20 rounds, and evaluating participants' predictions for those rounds. For each selected round, for each vote their prediction was off, we subtracted $0.05 from their bonus; the bonus for a round could not become negative. In this way, we incentivized participants to invest an equal amount of effort in each round and avoided income effects. Bonuses were paid out once the final election results could be estimated with a 1% margin of error.</p><p>Task design. The experiment consisted in a short (15 -20 minutes) prediction task. Participants had to predict the election outcome for a sample of 20 USA states (see <ref type="table">Table S1</ref> for a complete list). Participants played 20 rounds, and in each they had to predict the percentage of votes for Democrats and Republican for one State. The question was phrased as follows: "out of 100 voters from [state name], how many will vote Democrat or Republican?" First, participants completed a 'solo condition', in which they were prompted to provide a first prediction by using a slider, and rated their confidence in it by clicking on one of two buttons, 'low' or 'high'. Participants then moved to the social information part of the experiment, where they could see: 1) the prediction of a previous participant in the experiment for that same state 2) the confidence rating of the same peer for that round ('low' or 'high'; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>).</p><p>This information (estimate and confidence rating) was drawn from a previous sample of N = 100 participants who completed the same task without social information. As in experiment 1, the target social information X' was defined X'= E1 • (1+/-Δ), where E1 is the participants initial estimate. Differently from experiment 1, Δ was not constant, but ranged between .10 -.19. Such range still gave participants enough room to adjust, and allowed to preserve a realistic and varied range of stimuli. The final distribution of target values (e.g. how many rounds had a target at 10 pp., 12.pp away, etc.) was identical for each participant. Finally, to enhance believability, in the two remaining (filler) rounds, social information was either very close or very far from the participant's first prediction.</p></div>

Including these additional predictors in the model did not affect the main findings on confidence <ref type="table">(Table S3</ref>).</p></div>

This choice was made to make the interpretation of the models with the multiple control variables simpler. However, in the main text we only focused on the role of confidence, and we thus can interpret the more fine-grained model (i.e. including the interaction) more precisely. States were selected to ensure a balance between predicted winners (10 predicted Democrats and 10 predicted Republicans) and uncertainty of the outcome (High or Low), according to polls prediction made by the specialized website http://fivethirtyeight.com. Predictions were consulted in the month before the election (October 2020).</p></div>			</div>
