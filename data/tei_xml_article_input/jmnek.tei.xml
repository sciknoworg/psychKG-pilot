			<abstract>
				<p>Cognitive distancing is a therapeutic technique commonly used in psychological treatment of various mental health disorders, but its computational mechanisms remain unknown. To determine the effects of cognitive distancing on computational learning mechanisms, we use an online reward decision-making task, combined with reinforcement learning modelling in 935 participants, 49.1% of whom were trained to regulate their emotional response to task performance feedback. Those participants practicing cognitive distancing showed heightened learning from negative events as well as an increased integration of previous choice values. These differences seemed to represent an evolving shift in strategy by the distancing participants during the task, from exploiting optimal choices earlier in the task (as indicated by greater inverse temperature parameters), to a late-stage increase in learning from negative outcomes (represented as higher loss learning rates). Our findings suggest adaptive changes in computational learning mechanisms underpin the clinical utility of cognitive distancing in psychological therapy.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Main</head><p>Why do those cliffs of shadowy tint appear More sweet than all the landscape smiling near?-'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view, And robes the mountain in its azure hue.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> , dialectical behaviour therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . These strategies enable targeting of emotion regulation difficulties, which occur across mood, substance use, eating, and personality disorders, but improve following effective psychological treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> and may also predict treatment response <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thomas Campbell</head><p>Despite decades of research on the psychological and neural bases of emotion regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , the specific mechanisms of skills such as cognitive distancing remain unknown. Standard psychological measures cannot distinguish effects of cognitive distancing on subcomponents of motivated behaviour, such as reward sensitivity and learn-ing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , nor determine whether distancing from the immediate situation is adaptive over time. This limits our understanding of why cognitive distancing is therapeutically beneficial.</p><p>Unlike standard measures, theory-driven models from the field of computational psychiatry <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> could enable us to decouple the effects of cognitive distancing on subcomponents of motivated behaviour such as reward sensitivity and learning, potentially elucidating their specific therapeutic mechanisms as they evolve over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</p><p>One major proposed mechanism-of-action of pharmacological treatments for psychiatric disorders is through changing reinforcement learning, which appears compromised in numerous psychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . For example, in depression, meta-analyses have found evidence for lowto-moderate reinforcement learning decrements <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , perhaps due to reward insensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , with converging evidence that antidepressant administration in healthy participants improves reward learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . Similar computational approaches have helped elucidate the mechanisms of pharmacological treatments of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , and bipolar disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . However, there is substantial betweenstudy heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> : individual studies variously report heightened sensitivity to punishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , feedback across valences <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , and no difference in reinforcement learning between depressed patients and controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . One explanation for this is that general disturbances in reinforcement learning transcend diagnostic boundaries: recent work has found that differences in goal-directed control <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> and aversive learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> map onto transdiagnostic symptom dimensions better than diagnoses. This suggests that a dimensional approach may better describe the nature of reinforcement learning in psychiatric disorders and their treatment, echoing calls from the clinical psychological literature for transdiagnostic treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</p><p>Given that emotion regulation strategies alter reward processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , cognitive distancing may also affect reward learning transdiagnostically. Recent work indicates that CBT affects reward learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , altering how patients assign value to actions, and the extent to which these are updated by different environmental signals. These representations, formalised in a reinforcement learning framework as expected values (EVs) and prediction errors (PEs) respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , have been consistently linked to heterogeneous dopamine signals of midbrain origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . In line with this, neuroimaging studies have suggested that cognitive distancing ("adopt[ing] the position of a neutral observer" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> ) during learning tasks may affect midbrain representations of EVs and PEs, decreasing striatal responses to reward anticipation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> via prefrontal cortex modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . However, the computational underpinnings of these representations -for example, whether cognitive distancing affects the extent to which PEs are used to update EVs (learning rate) or the extent to which differences in EVs between options determine choices (inverse temperature) -are not known.</p><p>Here we test whether and how cognitive distancing alters reinforcement learning, using a probabilistic selection task (PST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> combined with an established computational model to decompose components of participant behaviour.</p><p>By recruiting a large online sample (n = 995) broadly representative of the UK population, we hoped to measure effects of cognitive distancing on reinforcement learning, and quantify associations between reinforcement learning and datadriven transdiagnostic symptom dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . Our study methods and analyses were preregistered on OSF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Results</head><p>Nine hundred and ninety-five participants completed a learning task (PST <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1C</ref>) alongside a psychiatric questionnaire question battery used to predict scores on three transdiagnostic factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1B,D)</ref>. Crucially, half the participants (n = 497) were randomised to a cognitive distancing manipulation where they were instructed to 'take a step back' in response to feedback during training trials. Qlearning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> with single or dual learning rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> were included in the model space. These models assume that EVs of the stimuli in each pair are updated in response to feedback; higher learning rate parameter values (α) indicate increased sensitivity of choices to recent feedback (single learning rate), or in dual learning rate models, differential sensitivity to positive or negative feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> (reward or loss learning rate; α reward or α loss ). Each model also included an inverse temperature parameter (β), which captures the extent to which differences in EVs determine choices between symbols.</p><p>Models were fit to training choices alone, and to training plus test phase choices in a hierarchical Bayesian manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , separately in distanced and non-distanced participants (see <ref type="bibr">Methods 4.2)</ref>. As the test phase lacked feedback, in line with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , results from training-plus-test models were interpreted as the parameter values at the end of training, fit to test phase choices. The effect on learning parameters of the distancing manipulation, and of increases in each transdiagnostic factor score, was then quantified using Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) adjusting for age, sex, and digit span. Percentage difference between the numbers in each age/sex group (excluding n = 5 non-binary individuals) reporting a diagnosed psychiatric disorder, compared to the targeted numbers calculated from UK population data based on 1,000 participants (2011 Census 35 and the 2014 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 36 ). B. Multi-target lasso regression with five-fold cross-validation was used to predict the three transdiagnostic dimension factor scores from different subsets of the 209 questions in the original dataset (Gillan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , study 2). 78 questions were found to predict the factor scores with high predictive accuracy. C. The probabilistic selection task (PST) in the present study consisted of six blocks of sixty trials (training phase) where participants were instructed to choose between Hiragana characters presented as three pairs (AB, CD, EF; twenty of each per block), and given feedback ('Correct!' or 'Incorrect.'). One character in each of the pairs was consistently more likely to be correct (reward probabilities of 0.8/0.2, 0.7/0.3, and 0.6/0.4 for A/B, C/D, and E/F respectively. 497 participants (49.9%) were randomised to a self-distancing intervention, and additionally received a prompt to "Distance yourself. . . " with the fixation cross at the start of each training trial. The training phase was followed by a sixty-trial test phase without feedback where the twelve other possible character combinations were added (i.e., four of each of the fifteen pairs). All participants saw the same six characters, but the pairs themselves were randomised for each participant, and the order of the pairs was counterbalanced across trials. One of three affect questions was asked after each trial, with unlimited time to answer. D. Comparison between the factor score distributions for the n = 935 non-excluded participants in the present study (darker colours), and those previously obtained by Gillan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> in n = 1413 participants (lighter colours). Inset plots show the predictive validity of the subset of 78 questions in predicting these scores in the original dataset.</p></div>

We recruited a sample that closely resembled the UK population in terms of age, sex, and history of a diagnosed psychiatric disorder (Table 1; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1A</ref>).

We found that group differences in loss learning rates emerged as the task progressed (with 95% HDIs for its multiplier between groups including 0 for all fits to fewer than all six blocks; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3E</ref>). In contrast, there was strong evidence that distanced participants had consistently higher inverse temperature parameter values throughout training, with all 95% HDIs excluding 0 except for the final fit to all six blocks, and some evidence that they had 10.9% lower positive learning rates over the first three training blocks (estimated multiplier for α reward = 0.89; 95% HDI = (0.81, 0.98); <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3E</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Online study</head><p>The protocol for the online study consisted of four components: a demographic questionnaire; the probabilistic selection task; a test of working memory (digit span); and a psychiatric questionnaire question battery. The tasks were written in JavaScript using the jsPsych library 55 (v6.2.0), and the study was hosted on a departmental server running Just Another Tool for Online Studies (JATOS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> (v3.3.1).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Probabilistic selection task</head><p>The PST in the present study was broadly similar to its original conceptualisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , with minor adaptations, and consisted of a training and test phase ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1C</ref>).</p><p>Before the start of the task, instructions were presented in written form as well as in an explanatory video that was optional to watch. To ensure that participants understood the task, they had to pass a multiple-choice quiz preceding the experiment. This consisted of six statements of which three were correct. While participants had an unlimited number of attempts, they could only move on to the task once all statements were marked correctly. Note that this quiz was only implemented after data from 100 participants had already been collected, meaning that these participants did not have to pass a quiz to start the experiment (see also 4.1.8).</p><p>The training phase consisted of six blocks of sixty trials.</p><p>On each trial, participants were presented with one of three pairs of Japanese Hiragana characters, and were instructed to choose the left or right character via key press ('F' or 'J' key respectively). They were told that while there is no absolute right answer, some characters are more likely to result in a win, so they should try to pick the symbol they think is more likely to be correct. Participants received feedback after each trial ("Correct!" or "Incorrect."), and correct answers were rewarded with 25 points; if no choice was made within 4000ms, the trial ended. participants were instructed to still choose the character that "feels correct" in every trial, no feedback was given, though affect questions were still asked after each trial to maintain the pace of the training blocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4">Digit span task</head><p>To control for working memory differences, a visual digit span task (adapted from here 58 ) was administered following the PST. Participants were instructed to memorize sequences of numbers presented one at a time (1000ms per digit). After completing a practice trial (three numbers), the task began with a single digit, and sequences were extended by one digit when correctly reported. The task ended when two sequences of same length could not be reported, or if a sequence length of twenty-five digits was correctly recalled.</p></div>

The concept of cognitive distancing was introduced in a short video, which explained to participants that they should told to try to "take a step back" from their immediate emotional reactions to positive or negative feedback, perhaps by thinking of themselves as an external observer, viewing the events from a distance.</p><p>The video had to be watched to proceed to the task, with the following written instructions provided if the participant had issues loading the video.</p><p>"When you're doing the task, you might feel various emotions -for example, irritation, engagement, or happiness. But throughout the task, we would like you to practice a mental strategy called self-distancing.</p><p>Self-distancing is the ability to take mental 'step back' from your immediate reactions to events, and view these events from a broader, calmer, and less emotional perspective.</p><p>One way of practising this is to imagine yourself as an external observer, watching yourself perform the task from a distance, and seeing the results of each of your decisions in the task.</p><p>You'll still learn which symbols win you more points than others, and you should still try to win as many points as possible. But whenever you feel irritated, happy, or any other emotion, even if it feels minor, try to distance yourself from your immediate reaction, by taking a step back from how you are feeling. We understand that this will be tricky, and so if you are unable to distance yourself from your emotional reaction on a particular trial, that is completely fine! Simply honestly report how you're feeling when we ask, and then try again to distance yourself next time."</p><p>After the instructions, distanced participants began the PST as detailed above. The task itself was identical to that taken by non-distanced participants, except that they received an additional reminder to "Distance yourself. . .

We also included two task-based exclusion criteria: a digit span of 0 (n = 5), or &gt; 95% preference for a single key (which no one met). Lastly, based on recent recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> , two harder catch questions were included in the questionnaires (e.g., "In the past week, I</p><p>would (have) avoided. . . Eating mouldy food"; expected answer 'Usually'), in addition to two standard catch questions (e.g., "Please answer 'Strongly Agree' to this question."). Participants were excluded if they got one of the standard questions wrong (n = 16), or both harder questions wrong (n = 20). In total, 60 participants of the 995 met at least one of these criteria and were excluded from all analyses ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>

Instead, we had initially opted to exclude poor performers through an accuracy criterion (≥60% correct on the AB pair). However, after running the first batch of 100 participants, we found that over 35% had been excluded, largely due to the accuracy criterion. We consulted with experts in the field who had run similar studies online via Twitter who advised us that excluding based on accuracy may unfairly bias our sample as mental health symptoms are commonly associated with cognitive changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> that could affect accuracy and suggested that we remove this exclusion criterion and replace it with the task-based exclusion criteria we used for all subsequent participants. In addition, as aforementioned, we were advised to add a multiple-choice quiz on the task instructions, which had to be answered correctly to begin the task.</p></div>

An exception was the negative association between the anxiety/depression factor score and the inverse temperature parameter β (from the dual learning rate model fit to training alone), such that unit increases in this score were associated with lower β values, indicating lower sensitivity to value differences between symbols in those scoring higher on this transdiagnostic symptom dimension (</figDesc></figure>

Linear mixed effects models were used to relate average affect ratings per block to group, block, and their interaction (adjusting for age, sex, and digit span). All affect ratings decreased over time, but there was a block-bydistancing interaction for happiness and engagement (but not confidence): both happiness and engagement declined less per block in distanced participants than non-distanced participants, by an estimated 0.44 and 0.41 points (out of 100)</figDesc></figure>

Cognitive distancing facilitates integration and subsequent exploitation of previously-reinforced choices (via increased inverse temperature parameters); and, with time or practice, adaptively enhances the ability to update decisions following negative feedback (emerging increased loss learning rates). Cognitive distancing is an antecedent-focused means of emotional regulation 39 which can reduce distress 40 and depressed thoughts 41 via disengagement from intense emotions in favour of a more experiential perspective.

Notably, a reduction in inverse temperature in patients with major depressive disorder has been found in previous studies using similar tasks and computational models 12,47 . Though our symptom-behaviour associations did not replicate this, our results indicate that cognitive dis- tancing interventions may improve depressive symptoms by increasing exploitation of rewarding outcomes. This is a key hypothesis emerging from our results. Distanced participants adaptively altered reward and loss learning throughout the task, possibly adjusting to changing task dynamics. Initially, higher inverse tempera- tures compared to non-distanced participants suggest they more quickly developed preferences for certain symbols. However, deterministic preferences may not be the best strategy for the entire task: initial impressions can be wrong, especially for the harder-to-distinguish stimuli. Notably, to- wards the end of the task, distanced participants became more sensitive to negative feedback, and showed weaker ev- idence for inverse temperature differences. At this stage, losses may be more informative: assuming preferences are largely correct for the easier pairs, negative feedbackpreferences by exploring more, distanced participants may be able to discern values of harder-to-distinguish pairs more accurately by the end of training, enabling better perfor- mance when subsequently tested on these pairs.A higher loss learning rate seems therapeutically coun- terintuitive, given</note></figure>
