			<abstract>
				<p>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) poses a significant burden for individuals and society. It compromises quality of life, disrupts productivity, and strains social relationships. Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning play an important role in psychopathology, yet the independent and joint contributions of these forms of emotional learning to depressed mood are not well understood. In particular, studies of Pavlovian conditioning and Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) in MDD are few. Studying PIT in MDD may improve our understanding of how emotional learning influences depressive symptoms that is more reflective of how Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning operate in the real world. In this review, we first provide a narrative summary of past research investigating emotional learning in MDD, including computational modeling approaches. Based on these findings, we then build on an existing theoretical framework characterizing emotional learning and decision making in depression by incorporating the potential influence of Pavlovian conditioned cues on instrumental behaviour in individuals experiencing depressed mood. Specifically, we propose that, in MDD, adaptive instrumental behaviours are interrupted by the exaggerated inhibitory influence of aversive Pavlovian cues and insufficiently invigorated by appetitive Pavlovian cues. We conclude with recommendations for future research investigating emotional learning in MDD.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioural Theories of Depression</head><p>A number of behavioural theories of depression emerged following seminal work of <ref type="bibr">Ferster and Skinner (1957)</ref> who formally proposed that the likelihood of a behaviour being carried out will be more or less likely depending on whether the behaviour was previously rewarded or punished, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Clark &amp; Beck, 1999)</ref>. Early behavioural theories of depression emphasized that adaptive behaviours can be reduced significantly in the absence of (1) behaviours resulting in positive experiences that motivate the repetition of those behaviours (i.e., positive reinforcement) and (2) behaviours resulting in successful avoidance of negative experiences (producing a feeling of relief) that also motivate the repetition of those behaviours (i.e., negative reinforcement). When behaviours appear to no longer result in reinforcement, this loss of positive and negative reinforcers can produce an overgeneralized loss of interest and pleasure and a tendency towards helplessness, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Clark &amp; Beck, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Gotlib &amp; Hammen, 1992)</ref>. Some of the most well-known behavioural theories of depression are those introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ferster (1973)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Costello (1972)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Lewinsohn (1974)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Seligman (1975)</ref>, as summarized below. These theories are presented to help provide context for recent research on emotional learning in MDD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ferster (1973): Reduced Frequency of (Reinforced) Behaviour</head><p>In his conceptualization of depression, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ferster (1973)</ref> proposed that the defining feature of the condition is the reduced frequency of adaptive behaviours resulting from a lack of positively reinforced behaviours and/or an excess of punished behaviours. For example, insufficient positive reinforcement may lead to reduced engagement in enjoyable activities like meaningful social interactions and excessive punishment may result in reduced engagement in adaptive avoidance or escape behaviours such as actively preventing or resolving interpersonal Draft version 1, 21/10/20. This paper has not been peer reviewed. Please do not copy or cite without author's permission.</p><p>conflict. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ferster (1973)</ref> noted that individuals with depression tend to perform indirect actions that are unlikely to alter or prevent an undesirable situation even though they are motivated by it (e.g., unconstructive complaints, demands that are unrealistic or not feasible), and less often perform direct actions which effectively address (e.g., reduce or terminate) undesirable circumstances. The performance of indirect actions and paucity of direct actions proposed to characterize depression may be explained by excessive punishment preventing direct actions and insufficient reinforcement of direct actions to guide and motivate adaptive behaviour. For example, an individual requesting their partner to go to the movies, attend a party with friends, go for a walk, or do some other activity are examples of direct actions performed to bring about positive experiences. If these requests are repeatedly denied (a lack of positive reinforcement), the individual interested in engaging in these activities may begin to perform indirect actions, such as complaining that their life is boring or that they are always cooped up at home. The goal is the same for these actions, but indirect actions are proposed to be more common for people who are depressed. Unfortunately, indirect actions are often even less likely to result in positive reinforcement, thereby failing to increase the positive reinforcement needed to alleviate depressed mood. Thus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ferster's (1973)</ref> theory suggests the critical role of emotional learning (changes in behaviour resulting from reward and punishment) in depression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lewinsohn (1974): Reduced Effectiveness of Positive Reinforcers</head><p>Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ferster's (1973)</ref> theory, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Lewinsohn (1974)</ref> proposed that individuals with depression experience a lack of response-contingent reinforcement that leads to the extinction of positively reinforced behaviours. He theorized that depression was determined by (1) the availability of positive reinforcers (e.g., few opportunities to see friends, no access to recreational activities, few contacts with superiors at work who praise work accomplishments)</p><p>Draft version 1, 21/10/20. This paper has not been peer reviewed. Please do not copy or cite without author's permission.</p><p>and aversive experiences (e.g., chronic pain, frequent disdain from a partner), (2) the adequacy/effectiveness of instrumental behaviours to promote positive reinforcement or reduce/eliminate aversive experiences (e.g., poor social skills or problem solving), and/or (3) the number/frequency of positive reinforcers and aversive events (e.g., multiple losses such as a job, partner, home, etc.; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Clark &amp; Beck, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Lewinsohn, 1974)</ref>. Thus, if opportunities to engage in positively reinforcing behaviours are limited and/or there is a preponderance of aversive events, individuals are unlikely to experience the kind of reinforcement that can promote healthy approach and avoidance/escape behaviours and prevent unhealthy ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Trew, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, reinforcement may not occur if an individual does not have the skills (or believes they do not have the skills) needed to facilitate the behaviour required to bring about reward or avoid punishment. In this case, aversive experiences may be more likely as a consequence of the individual being ineffective at facilitating desirable outcomes and preventing negative ones.</p><p>Lastly, if the number and frequency of positive reinforcers are low and/or the number and frequency of aversive events are high, frequency of active behaviour in general is reduced, and the negative consequences that result from inaction are increased. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Lewinsohn (1974)</ref>, these patterns of behaviour and environmental conditions are central contributors to the depressed state. Again, this early behavioural theory of depression proposes that rewarding and aversive consequences of behaviour, and the changes in behaviour they cause, can lead to and perpetuate depressed mood, as further explored in recent research of emotional leaning in MDD discussed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Costello (1972): Disrupted Chain of Behaviour</head><p>Costello (1972) sought to explain why the loss of one reinforcer (e.g., a close companion)</p><p>would lead to a loss of interest in a variety of reinforcers (e.g., food and sex). He proposed that Draft version 1, 21/10/20. This paper has not been peer reviewed. Please do not copy or cite without author's permission.</p><p>depression results from a disruption in a chain of behaviour, whereby a break in a chain of reinforced behaviours can reduce all of the behaviours in that chain. For example, for someone who routinely prepares coffee in the morning to enjoy with a partner, the loss of that partner may not only result in the cessation of that ritual, but it may also cause a disruption in the motivation for the individual to get out of bed. This example depicts how the disruption of a component of the chain of behaviours can disrupt other components of the chain explaining certain depressive behaviours. Although disrupted behavioural chaining was central to <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Costello's (1972)</ref> theory, he also emphasized using concepts from Pavlovian conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Pavlov &amp; Gantt, 1928)</ref> that an unconditioned stimulus (US, a stimulus that is intrinsically painful or pleasurable), is increased in attractiveness or aversiveness by a conditioned stimulus (CS, an otherwise neutral stimulus that has come to be associated with pain or pleasure) that is presented before it. Thus, Costello's behavioural theory of depression also points to a role of Pavlovian conditioned stimuli in reduced positively reinforced behaviour in depression as we propose below in the MELD framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Seligman (1975): Learned Helplessness</head><p>The learned helplessness model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Seligman (1975)</ref> posited that depression results from repeated uncontrollable and inescapable stressors that compromise an individual's sense of control over their life and circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Clark &amp; Beck, 1999)</ref>. Seligman distinguished two types of learned helplessness, objective and subjective. Objective helplessness refers to situations in which the probability of an aversive outcome is the same regardless of one's response, i.e., there is nothing an individual can do to prevent the aversive event. Subjective helplessness, on the other hand, refers to an individual's belief that the probability of an aversive outcome is the same regardless of the response, whether this is accurate or not. Perhaps the most well-known investigation of learned helplessness was a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Seligman and Maier (1967)</ref> Draft version 1, 21/10/20. This paper has not been peer reviewed. Please do not copy or cite without author's permission.</p><p>who tested whether already acquired Pavlovian CSs could influence later instrumental conditioning. In their experiment, subjects were first exposed to inescapable shock, and then placed in a shuttle box that would allow them to escape the shock <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Seligman &amp; Maier, 1967)</ref>.</p><p>Surprisingly, subjects that experienced inescapable shock prior to the instrumental conditioning paradigm did not learn to escape the shuttle box when given the opportunity to do so, i.e., the conditioned context prevented instrumental escape behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Seligman &amp; Maier, 1967)</ref>. This is an example of Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT), which we describe in detail in later sections of this review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emotional Learning in MDD</head><p>Until recently, relative to other diagnostic categories, MDD had received less attention in research exploring the clinical implications of altered emotional learning, particularly Pavlovian conditioning and PIT <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Nees, Heinrich, &amp; Flor, 2015)</ref>. However, research to date characterizing emotional learning in MDD suggests that both Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning are implicated in depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Craske, Meuret, Ritz, Treanor, &amp; Dour, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Dayan &amp; Huys, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Huys et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Huys et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Huys, Vogelstein, &amp; Dayan, 2009)</ref>. Furthermore, research exploring the interaction between these two types of emotional learning in the context of MDD has shed light on the complexity of emotional learning processes that may be implicated in depressive symptomology <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Huys et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Nord et al., 2018</ref>). Yet, a comprehensive review of emotional learning in MDD has not been undertaken. The following narrative review aims to address this gap by summarizing previous findings regarding Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, as well as PIT, in MDD. Notably, there is considerable heterogeneity across individuals diagnosed with MDD in terms of 'subtypes' or patterns of depressive symptoms;</p><p>Draft version 1, 21/10/20. This paper has not been peer reviewed. Please do not copy or cite without author's permission.</p><p>however, the studies reviewed here represent important groundwork toward a more fine-grained understanding of how emotional learning relates to different dimensions of depressed mood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pavlovian Conditioning</head><p>Pavlovian conditioning is thought to be an evolutionarily adaptive learning process that facilitates the encoding (the conversion of sensory input into a form that can be processed and deposited into memory) and consolidation (the crystallization of recent memories into long-term memory) of information predictive of desirable or undesirable outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Boureau &amp; Dayan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Rescorla, 1988)</ref>. It constitutes the pairing of a neutral stimulus (the CS) with a significant event (the US) to facilitate a biological response in the presence of the CS (the conditioned response; CR) that can subsequently be elicited by the CS in the absence of the US. In addition to neutral cues and contexts, vivid visual imagery of a US can also produce a CR <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berridge, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Dadds, Bovbjerg, Redd, &amp; Cutmore, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Holland, 1990)</ref>. Such learning prepares an organism for future occasions when the US may be presented, as signaled by the presence of the CS. The CR is a direct consequence of the CS that facilitates approach (for desirable outcomes) or avoidance (for undesirable outcomes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Boureau &amp; Dayan, 2011)</ref>. That is, it allows us to use cues to predict and approach or avoid good or bad events, respectively.</p><p>In human research, laboratory experiments used to study Pavlovian associations typically involve the repeated presentation of a CS, such as a coloured shape, with a significant event, such as the delivery of a monetary or food reward, that elicits a reflexive motivational/emotional response (e.g., increased skin conductance response [SCR]; <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Dickinson, 2015)</ref>. Critically, Pavlovian conditioning is a passive learning process, whereby the CS and US are presented together irrespective of a participant's behaviour. If the formation of a Pavlovian association is successful, participants will demonstrate a CR to the CS after it has been paired one or more Draft version 1, 21/10/20. This paper has not been peer reviewed. Please do not copy or cite without author's permission.</p><p>times with the US, even in the absence of the US. Pavlovian conditioning paradigms typically also include a neutral stimulus that is unpaired with the US (CS-; e.g., an alternative coloured shape) as a control stimulus so that responses to these stimuli can be compared to assess the degree to which a specific Pavlovian association between the CS and US has been formed.</p><p>Several measures of Pavlovian conditioning can be derived from experimental Pavlovian conditioning tasks. Two measures commonly derived from Pavlovian conditioning tasks include the acquisition of a CR (learning the association between the CS and the US) and the maintenance or extinction of a CR once the CS no longer predicts the delivery of the US.</p><p>Measuring the acquisition (or learning) of a Pavlovian association can be used to assess how susceptible an individual is to forming passive emotional associations between neutral stimuli or contexts and significant events <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Dickinson, 2015)</ref>, whereas measuring the rate of extinction of a CR helps to indicate how resistant an individual is to the diminishing or elimination of associations between a CS and a US once the CS is no longer predictive of the US. In other words, measuring extinction helps to assess an individual's ability to update the emotional value of a neutral stimulus once it no longer signals imminent threat or reward. In the following section, we review previous Pavlovian conditioning studies of currently depressed individuals with MDD.</p></div>

There was significant heterogeneity between studies in terms of sample size, conditioning phase examined (i.e., acquisition vs. extinction), the type of US and CS used, the schedule and latency of US delivery, and the CR measured.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of Previous Studies Examining Pavlovian Conditioning in MDD</head><p>Studies of Pavlovian conditioning in MDD have employed heterogenous methods with small sample sizes and produced inconsistent findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Greer et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Jovanovic et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Kuhn et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Nissen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Otto et al., 2014)</ref>. All of these studies examined the acquisition of aversive Pavlovian associations in MDD, one examined the extinction of these associations, and none examined appetitive Pavlovian conditioning. The absence of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning studies in MDD is surprising given that abnormal processing of reward in MDD is well-established <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bylsma, Morris, &amp; Rottenberg, 2008)</ref>. Thus, perhaps most notably, future studies are needed to examine appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in MDD. Several instrumental conditioning studies included in this review as well as studies of reward sensitivity indicate that individuals with MDD show altered processing of appetitive stimuli; therefore, it appears reasonable to expect that appetitive Pavlovian conditioning could be an additional marker for MDD <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bylsma et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Henriques &amp; Davidson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Pizzagalli, Iosifescu, Hallett, Ratner, &amp; Fava, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Vrieze et al., 2013)</ref>. Furthermore, the heterogeneity across studies may be attributable in part to the diverse presentations of mood and related psychological symptoms (e.g., anxiety) across individuals with MDD, and a dimensional approach to Draft version 1, 21/10/20.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary Summary: Pavlovian Conditioning in MDD</head><p>In sum, of the five previous studies identified that examined Pavlovian conditioning in MDD, all of which focused on aversive (as opposed to appetitive) conditioning, most included small samples, and findings for the acquisition and extinction of aversive Pavlovian associations were inconsistent. More studies are needed to clarify the nature of aversive and, most notably, appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in individuals with MDD. In the next section, we review instrumental conditioning studies in MDD, followed by a review of studies examining PIT in MDD. To bring these findings together, we then propose our framework used to characterize the dynamics of emotional learning in MDD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instrumental Conditioning</head><p>Instrumental conditioning occurs when an organism is more or less likely to engage in a particular behaviour depending on the consequence <ref type="formula">(</ref> press a lever to receive food or escape a chamber to avoid shock <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Fanselow &amp; Poulos, 2005)</ref>. In human studies, instrumental conditioning is typically operationalized using tasks that require Draft version 1, 21/10/20. This paper has not been peer reviewed.

Note that most instrumental conditioning paradigms studies involve decision-making (making a choice between different options). This makes it difficult to differentiate associative learning processes between action and outcome involved in instrumental conditioning from decision-making or choosing between better and worse options. Most paradigms used to assess instrumental conditioning can be described as probabilistic reinforcement learning tasks. These tasks are often designed as discrimination or gambling tasks, as described below.</p><p>Probabilistic reinforcement learning discrimination tasks are typically memory or perception tasks that require participants to make correct judgments about stimuli according to some criteria, such as whether a word appeared on a previous word list (in a recognition memory task; <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Henriques &amp; Davidson, 2000)</ref> or which of two stimuli was presented on the screen after a very brief presentation (in a stimulus discrimination task; <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Pizzagalli et al., 2008)</ref>. In these tasks, feedback is typically provided regarding correct or incorrect judgments and may be accompanied by varying magnitudes and frequencies of rewards or punishments <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Lynn &amp; Barrett, 2014)</ref>. The basic assumption that informs the interpretation of participants' performance on these tasks is that their responses will be biased towards choices that maximize the size and frequency of rewards and minimize the size and frequency of non-reward or punishments <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Frank &amp; Claus, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Probabilistic reinforcement learning tasks may also be designed as gambling paradigms involving the presentation of a set of cards or options from which participants must make choices based on the different likelihood of receiving a reward and/or avoiding punishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Schönberg, Daw, Joel, &amp; O'Doherty, 2007)</ref>. Learning typically occurs through trial-and-error, whereby participants learn to make choices that increase the likelihood of reward and decrease the Draft version 1, 21/10/20.

Probabilistic reinforcement learning tasks may also measure reversal learning by incorporating 'rule reversals' that require participants to detect when advantageous and disadvantageous response probabilities are reversed and to adjust their strategy accordingly (i.e., select the newly advantageous option and avoid the newly disadvantageous option). In the following sections, we review the methodological characteristics, results, and potential limitations of previous studies employing probabilistic reinforcement learning tasks in MDD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of Previous Studies Examining Instrumental Conditioning in MDD</head><p>Studies that examined instrumental conditioning in MDD using rewards and punishments employed secondary, rather than primary, reinforcers (i.e., money). In other words, the rewards and punishments employed in these studies were stimuli previously associated with one or more primary reinforcers. Therefore, future studies that employ primary (i.e., food or shock) rewards and punishments are needed to understand more comprehensively how individuals with MDD alter their behaviour in response to rewarding and punishing experiences. Furthermore, a limitation of the gambling tasks employed in these studies is that it is difficult to distinguish between participants' responses to rewards versus punishments. Thus, the finding across these studies that participants were less likely to make advantageous choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cella et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Must et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Steele et al., 2007)</ref> could be due to a reduced ability to learn from reward, punishment, or both. Separate gambling paradigms or phases within paradigms that distinguish behavioural responses to rewards and punishments could help address this issue.</p></div>

First, individuals with MDD may be less effective at using reinforcement history (both reward and punishment) to maximize advantageous choices and minimizes disadvantageous ones than nondepressed individuals on gambling tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cella et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Mukherjee et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Murphy et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Must et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Taylor Tavares et al., 2008)</ref>, including after a reversal in probabilistic contingencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cella et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Mukherjee et al., 2020)</ref>, and misleading negative feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Murphy et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Taylor Tavares et al., 2008)</ref>. The findings presented here also suggest that individuals with MDD do not develop response biases toward more frequently reinforced stimuli when required to discriminate based on visual perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Pizzagalli et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Vrieze et al., 2013)</ref> and verbal memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Henriques &amp; Davidson, 2000)</ref> in discrimination tasks.

Computational models allow for the operationalization of formal parameters indicating aspects of cognition that are not apparent from behavioural responses but are latently operating and contributing to behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Kriegeskorte &amp; Douglas, 2018)</ref>. They also allow for the testing of competing models of the degree to which they predict behaviour in different populations. Common models of reinforcement learning include the traditional Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Dombrovski et al., 2010)</ref>, temporal difference (TD) models, and Q-learning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Huys et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Mukherjee et al., 2020)</ref>. Examples of parameters representing latent aspects of cognition in these models include positive and negative prediction error (PE), reward and punishment learning rate and sensitivity, exploitation/exploration, memory, and delayed discounting of reward/punishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chase et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Dombrovski et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Huys et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Mukherjee et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Most computational models incorporate a PE parameter representing the degree to which unexpected rewards generate a PE. Over time the cue-reward contingency is learned, after which the cue will elicit an expected value signal, or an expectation of the consequence (reward or punishment) of a given choice based on previous reinforcement. In the RW model, learning ceases after knowledge of the cue-reward contingency is acquired and, consequently, there is no PE after the contingency is learned. In TD models, however, a PE is produced whenever the cue Draft version 1, 21/10/20. This paper has not been peer reviewed.

Here, the magnitude of the PE reflects the expected magnitude of the predicted reward. In Q-learning models, a reward sensitivity or exploration/exploitation parameter is included to account for individual differences in these aspects of cognition distinct from learning rate, suggesting that reward sensitivity and exploration/exploitation make unique contributions to predicting behaviour that are not necessarily accounted for by learning rate. Findings from studies that employed computational models to investigate instrumental conditioning in MDD are presented below.</p><p>Chase et al. (2010) used a Q-learning model to examine reward and punishment learning rate during training and test phases of a probabilistic reinforcement learning task performed by individuals with MDD and nondepressed control participants. In the training phase of the task, participants selected one letter from one of three stimulus pairs (AB, CD, EF), each with a varying probability of being correct, and feedback ('correct' or 'incorrect') was provided (no reward or punishment) from which participants were expected to learn and select which letter was 'correct' most often. This was followed by a test phase in which participants completed the same task without feedback. Parameters in their model included positive and negative learning rate parameters (indicating efficiency of using PEs to update the expected value of a certain choice during future trials) and an exploration-exploitation parameter (indicating a participant's tendency to choose the option with the highest expected payoff or choose an option for which the payoff is not yet known). The learning rate parameters are included in the Q-learning model where the Q-value, representing the associative strength of the just-selected stimulus to a particular outcome, is updated as a function of whether the outcome was positive or negative, the learning rate, and the PE (outcomeexpected outcome for that trial).

The authors found that MDD participants showed a reduced learning rate for both correct and incorrect feedback (i.e., for positive and negative PEs) in the reinforcement learning training phase but not in the test phase of their experiment. Furthermore, they found that poorer reward and punishment learning rate in the training phase was associated with greater anhedonia in all study participants (including MDD and control participants).</p><p>A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Dombrovski et al. (2010)</ref> that used a modified RW model to examine parameters influencing reinforcement learning, using a probabilistic reversal learning task in suicide attempters, suicide ideators, nonsuicidal depressed elderly, and nondepressed comparison subjects. Consistent with the traditional RW model, they calculated the optimal expected values of choosing stimulus 1 or stimulus 2 based on a prior (the previously expected outcome) and a PE (the difference between the experienced outcome and the prior). Their model also included learning rate parameters for rewards and punishments and a memory parameter. Learning rate parameters captured the impacts of positive (reward) and negative (punishment) PE on the previous trial (t -1) on the participant's subsequent choice (t), whereas the memory parameter reflected the effect of reward and punishment history on all previous trials on choice (low memory results in rapid switches of choice in response to reward/punishment on the last trial).</p><p>The authors found that participants with MDD tended to exhibit a (marginally) lower punishment learning rate than control participants but reward learning rate did not differ between groups.</p><p>These findings suggest that trial choices that resulted in negative (but not positive) PEs had a blunted influence on stimulus choice in the subsequent trial in MDD participants.</p><p>In a behavioural meta-analytic study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Huys et al.

During the task, participants were required to discriminate between two visual stimuli and select the stimulus most likely to result in a rewarding outcome.</p><p>The parameters of interest included (1) reward sensitivity and (2) a learning rate parameter that incorporated reward and punishment. This study revealed that the reward sensitivity parameter predicted altered behaviour in MDD more than learning rate and the authors therefore concluded that MDD is associated with blunted appetitive learning resulting from a reduced primary sensitivity to rewards as opposed to reduced reward learning rates.</p><p>Mukherjee et al. (2020) employed a Q-learning computational model to examine performance on two probabilistic reversal learning tasks in MDD and nondepressed control participants, including one task incorporating only reward/no reward feedback and another task incorporating only punishment/no punishment feedback. Parameters of interest in their models for both tasks were value sensitivity and learning rates. Their results showed that MDD participants had slower reward and punishment learning rates, lower punishment value sensitivity, and marginally lower reward value sensitivity than control participants. Notably, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Mukherjee et al.

Nonetheless, there was some consensus that individuals with MDD had lower reward and punishment sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Huys et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Mukherjee et al., 2020)</ref> and learning rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chase et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Dombrovski et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Mukherjee et al., 2020)</ref> than nondepressed control participants.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer</head><p>PIT refers to a process by which Pavlovian CSs can invigorate or suppress instrumental behaviour. Appetitive and aversive PIT effects are differentiated such that appetitive PIT occurs when an appetitive CS invigorates instrumental approach or inhibits instrumental withdrawal <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cartoni, Balleine, &amp; Baldassarre, 2016)</ref> and aversive PIT takes place when an aversive CS inhibits instrumental approach or invigorates instrumental withdrawal <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Huys et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Appetitive and aversive PIT can also be described as the influences of appetitive and aversive expectations on behaviour, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Geurts, Huys, Den Ouden, &amp; Cools, 2013)</ref>.

Specific and general PIT are two putative subtypes of PIT. Specific PIT refers to situations in which both the Pavlovian and instrumental associations are formed with the exact same outcome (e.g., delivery of a shock) and the presence of the CS is found to alter (invigorate or suppress) instrumental behaviour associated with that specific outcome. For example, the presence of a CS previously paired with shock would be expected to invigorate instrumental avoidance behaviour intended to escape a shock. General PIT refers to situations in which the general motivational properties of a CS invigorates or suppresses instrumental behaviour even though the CS is different from the instrumental reinforcer/punishment, for example if the presence of a CS previously paired with Draft version 1, 21/10/20.

Action-specificity in the context of PIT refers to the tendency for appetitive CSs to selectively invigorate active approach behaviours and aversive CSs to selectively invigorate active withdrawal behaviours. In the instrumental approach training phase of Huys and colleagues' (2016) PIT paradigm, participants learned to collect or not collect mushrooms according to the actions' associated consequences. Specifically, participants learned to (1) click on mushrooms for which (a) clicking frequently resulted in reward and infrequently resulted in punishment and (b) not clicking frequently resulted in punishment/infrequently resulted in reward ('go' to obtain reward/avoid punishment) or (2) refrain from clicking on mushrooms for which (a) not clicking was frequently rewarded/infrequently punished and (b) clicking was frequently punished/infrequently rewarded ('no-go' to obtain reward/avoid punishment). In the instrumental withdrawal training phase of their paradigm, participants learned to discard or keep mushrooms depending on reinforcement. This involved clicking on an empty box opposite mushrooms to discard ('go' to obtain reward/avoid punishment) and withhold clicking on the empty box to keep the mushroom ('no-go' to obtain reward/avoid punishment).

Notably, the authors found that greater action-specificity in the control group (i.e., an appetitive CS boosts active approach and inhibits active withdrawal; an aversive CS boosts active withdrawal and inhibits active approach) was driven more by PIT effects during approach than withdrawal <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Huys et al., 2016)</ref>. One explanation for this distinction could be that 'go' (i.e., active) responses are more likely in the face of potential rewards (signaled by appetitive CSs) and 'no-go' responses are more likely in the face of potential punishments (signaled by aversive CSs). This may have resulted in stronger PIT effects when active responses were associated with appetitive CSs and passive responses were associated with aversive CSs and weaker PIT effects when an active response was required in the presence of an aversive CS and passive response in the presence of an appetitive CS, contrary to pre-potent Pavlovian biases to produce a motor response in the presence of an appetitive stimulus and withhold a motor response in the presence of an aversive stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Crockett et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Dayan et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Guitart-Masip et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Guitart-Masip et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Unlike the pattern of results observed in control participants, PIT was not action specific in participants with MDD <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Huys et al., 2016)</ref>.

The authors found that the Pavlovian bias to produce a button press for rewards and withdraw a button press for punishments did not differ between MDD and control participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Moutoussis et al., 2018)</ref>.

Examining the pattern of responding within either of these phases may have produced similar results, whereby a 'go' response is more likely for previously rewarded stimulus (whether 'clicking on' to collect or 'clicking away' to discard) and a 'no-go' response is more likely for a previously punished stimulus (whether 'not clicking on'</p><p>to not collect or 'not clicking away' to keep). However, these analyses were not completed.</p><p>Thus, it may be that while individuals with MDD show a similar Pavlovian bias to nondepressed individuals in their motor responding during instrumental tasks ('go' to win and 'no-go' to avoid punishment), they do not show the same patterns of Pavlovian bias for newly formed stimulusoutcome associations and/or more complex instrumental actions.</p><p>In a recent study of aversive PIT by <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Nord et al.

However, during the aversive PIT task, MDD patients performed significantly fewer active approach responses ('click' to obtain) and significantly more active withdrawal responses ('click' to discard) when Pavlovian CSs predicted both small and large losses.

However, additional studies examining pre-potent Pavlovian influences on instrumental behaviour in MDD are clearly needed.

To help reconcile the existing research of emotional learning in MDD, we propose the following framework to capture the nuanced interactions of Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning and how they may operate in MDD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effort tolerance versus estimated effort cost</head><p>If an effective instrumental action suitable to the context (as indicated by Pavlovian CSs that predict a successful outcome) is recalled, the next phase of the MELD framework includes competition between effort tolerance and estimated effort cost. Here, an individual's willingness to expend effort towards a particular outcome is pitted against the perceived effort required for the selected action <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Treadway et al., 2012)</ref>. In MDD, willingness to expend effort is expected to be low, whereas estimated effort cost is expected to be exaggerated (Cléry-Melin et Draft version 1, 21/10/20.

However, if effort tolerance is greater than or equal to estimated effort cost, the action to obtain or avoid a pleasant or unpleasant outcome, respectively, will be carried out. An individual with MDD exploring options in a food court would be expected to estimate that patiently waiting for food will require an abundant amount of effort and their willingness to wait patiently may be low. If their willingness to wait patiently is less than the effort (or energy) required to do so, they are unlikely to wait in line. Alternately, if an individual with MDD does not estimate that waiting in a line will require much effort, their willingness to wait may be sufficient for them to do so.</p></div>

Updating of priors involves changes in (1) estimations of the pleasantness or unpleasantness of outcomes, (2) stimulusoutcome associations (i.e., Pavlovian conditioning), and (3) action-outcome associations (i.e., instrumental conditioning). Regarding the updating of priors for the pleasantness or unpleasantness of outcomes, stronger encoding and consolidation of positive and negative experiences will facilitate later recall of that experience for the purpose of estimating outcome value through cognitive desire/aversion, whereas weaker encoding and consolidation of positive and negative experiences will result in lower estimated outcome value. In MDD, increased punishment sensitivity and decreased reward sensitivity, as well as rumination of negative experiences that promotes consolidation of these memories, would be expected to promote recall Draft version 1, 21/10/20.

The individual with MDD at the food court may have ruminated considerably in the past while waiting in line ups and not at all about the pleasant experience of enjoying the result of that action, i.e., delicious food. Therefore, this individual may easily recall how unpleasant it is to wait in a line and only vaguely recall the pleasantness of a meal (updating priors regarding how much each experience was 'liked' or 'disliked').</p><p>Outcome sensitivity would also be expected to bias the updating of priors for the recall of past actions and their outcomes, where associations between actions and consequent failure may be more likely to be strongly encoded and consolidated in MDD, leading to failed instrumental actions being recalled as occurring more frequently in general and more easily when the failed instrumental action occurred recently (affecting estimations of reinforcement history).</p><p>Individuals with MDD have been shown to have greater sensitivity to negative feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Ruchsow et al., 2006)</ref>, which is consistent with findings from the instrumental conditioning studies reviewed above that individuals with MDD are more likely to guide their actions based on recent negative feedback as opposed to the overall reinforcement history <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Murphy et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Tavares et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Lastly, outcome sensitivity would influence the updating of priors for Pavlovian CSs, including conditioned associations between environmental stimuli and (1) their outcomes alone (affecting future motivational salience of these stimuli) and (2) stimuli and a representation of the action alone or a representation of both the action and its outcome (affecting future action selection; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Dayan &amp; Berridge, 2014)</ref>, which in MDD would likely entail enhanced encoding and consolidation of cues in the environment that predict failure and blunted encoding and Draft version 1, 21/10/20.

For example, if an individual with MDD attempts to engage a colleague at work in casual conversation and is told by the colleague that it is not a good time, they may attend to the person's body language and facial expression and these cues may be associated with a failure to connect with co-workers, even if these cues do not predict failure to engage with co-workers in the future.</p><p>To summarize, the updating of priors in the MELD framework involves updating future estimations of how pleasant or unpleasant an outcome is, the estimated reinforcement history for that particular action, and the environmental cues and context that predict that outcome. Each of these updates are influenced by outcome sensitivity, where greater sensitivity to negative outcomes in MDD may facilitate the updating of priors for disliking negative outcomes, actions that produce negative outcomes, and Pavlovian CSs that predict negative outcomes.</p><p>Alternatively, in MDD, less sensitivity to positive outcomes would inhibit updating of priors for liking positive outcomes, actions that lead to positive outcomes, and Pavlovian CSs that predict those outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Representation of PIT in the MELD framework</head><p>In our framework, we propose two ways altered PIT may be a barrier to obtaining positive reinforcement for individuals with MDD. The first is exaggerated influence of aversive and blunted influence of appetitive Pavlovian CSs on motivational salience. Enhanced aversive salience would be expected to increase the value of undesirable instrumental outcomes and lower the value of desirable instrumental outcomes. We further propose that blunted appetitive salience would result in limited influence of appetitive Pavlovian CSs on the value of both desirable and undesirable outcomes. The second way PIT is proposed to operate in MDD according to our Draft version 1, 21/10/20. This paper has not been peer reviewed.

Therefore, consistent with current conceptualizations of PIT <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balleine &amp; Ostlund, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Dorfman &amp; Gershman, 2019)</ref>, we propose that individuals with MDD are disadvantaged in terms of the general motivating properties of Pavlovian CSs on instrumental actions and their influence on action selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparing frameworks</head><p>The ACDM framework, which characterizes unique alterations in decision-making in anxiety and depression, was influential in the formulation of the MELD framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bishop &amp; Gagne, 2018)</ref>. Although our framework is applied only to MDD here, many aspects of our framework overlap with those included in the ACDM framework applied to depression. The primary psychological components of the ACDM framework, including the value of instrumental outcomes, the probability that an outcome will be obtained following various actions, and the estimation of effort required for particular actions, are broadly reflected in the MELD (instrumental outcome value, action selection, and effort tolerance versus estimated effort cost, respectively). Another important component of the ACDM framework applied to depressed mood is the suggestion that depressed individuals may have a reduced ability to recall actions that were associated with a desirable outcome, a feature that is also included in our framework.</p><p>What distinguishes the two frameworks is our incorporation of additional cognitive processes that may contribute to instrumental actions in MDD, most notably the influences of Pavlovian CSs on instrumental behaviour. Our framework also complements estimated effort cost with the concept of effort tolerance, reflecting the amount of effort an individual is willing to produce to Draft version 1, 21/10/20. This paper has not been peer reviewed. Please do not copy or cite without author's permission.</p><p>obtain the desired outcome. Here we separate the estimation of effort required from willingness to expend effort because both may affect whether an individual (successfully or unsuccessfully) exerts effort towards a desired outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chong et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chong et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Cléry-Melin et al., 2011)</ref>. Thus, while these two frameworks are complementary, the MELD framework aims to provide broader account of emotional learning in MDD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future directions</head><p>The proposed framework, developed to aid in the characterization of emotional learning in MDD, offers a simplified account of how Pavlovian cues may influence instrumental behaviour. It does not address how the acquisition and extinction of Pavlovian associations may interact with instrumental behaviours in MDD. Due to the inconsistent findings in past studies examining aversive Pavlovian conditioning in MDD and paucity of studies investigating appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in MDD, further investigation is needed to address this gap.</p><p>Furthermore, while an abundance of research has investigated incentive salience and its clinical importance for problems like addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2016)</ref>, research and theory regarding aversive or fear salience is lacking despite its probable relevance to mental health conditions like MDD. Aversive Pavlovian influence over instrumental conditioning is proposed in our framework to play a critical role in maladaptive instrumental behaviours in MDD. A promising future direction for research on motivational salience and its clinical application would be the conceptualization and investigation of aversive salience and the role it may play in MDD. PIT is a paradigm that may be well-suited to such research, especially when primary aversive stimuli and socially relevant aversive stimuli are used as the US for Pavlovian training phases of PIT paradigms.</p><p>Draft version 1, 21/10/20. This paper has not been peer reviewed. Please do not copy or cite without author's permission.</p><p>A notable omission from this article is the potential role of PIT in the propensity for, and onset of, MDD. Although research to date has not investigated this topic, we speculate that attentional and memory biases would facilitate exaggerated aversive Pavlovian control and blunted appetitive Pavlovian control over behaviours for individuals susceptible to depression.</p><p>As a consequence, individuals who are susceptible to depression would be expected to experience fewer positively reinforcing experiences overall, leading to bouts of depression.</p><p>Longitudinal studies examining how performance on PIT tasks relates to depression risk and the onset of MDD are needed to explore these hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Emotional learning is considered to be an evolutionarily adaptive psychological process required for reflexively responding to anticipated significant events and performing actions that can promote desirable experiences and prevent or escape undesirable ones. Individual differences in emotional learning, including Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning and interactions between the two, can inform the emotional processes that contribute to and maintain MDD as well as potential treatments. Since, in real-world contexts, Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning are always under mutual influence, examining PIT in the context of depression is important for acquiring a more complete picture of the pattern of cognitive processes that contribute to and maintain depressive symptomology. To date, research on these topics is relatively limited considering the central role that behavioural theories of depression (which rely heavily on emotional learning principles) have played in understanding and treating MDD.</p><p>Further investigating MDD using emotional learning paradigms is essential for advancing our understanding of MDD from a behavioural perspective.

Furthermore, the MELD framework suggests that, for individuals who are depressed, actions intended to bring about desirable consequences are not invigorated by aspects of the environment that have previously signaled a concurrent or subsequent positive outcome (where nondepressed individuals would experience invigoration of such actions). The assumptions of the MELD framework are informed by emotional learning studies in currently depressed individuals who have been diagnosed with MDD. Before reviewing this research, however, we will provide a brief overview of behavioural theories of depression focused on the role of positive and negative reinforcement (as opposed to cognitive theories that emphasize the roles of negative thoughts and beliefs in depression) that set the stage for recent research investigating emotional learning in MDD.</figDesc></figure>

Reinforcement entails the presentation of a rewarding outcome (positive reinforcement) or the removal of an aversive outcome (negative reinforcement) as a consequence of behaviour, in turn making the behaviour more likely in the future. Punishment involves the presentation of an aversive consequence (positive punishment) or the removal of a rewarding consequence (negative punishment) as a result of behaviour. Subsequently, an organism becomes less likely to engage in that behaviour.
