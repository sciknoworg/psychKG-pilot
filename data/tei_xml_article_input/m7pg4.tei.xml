			<abstract>
				<p>Some of the most influential modern theories of risky monetary decision-making assume that choices result from stable, trait-like preferences, invariant to contextual influences such as recent events. Recent research has challenged this assumption, demonstrating that even when values and probabilities are explicit and known, decisions under risk are contextually sensitive, affected by recent events on multiple timescales, including immediate (previous monetary outcomes), neighborhood (recently encountered values), and global (cumulative earnings relative to dynamic expectations) events. Such temporal context-dependencies are perplexing, because relying on recent events at any timescale is inconsistent with the assumed goal of risky monetary decision-making: to maximize payoff. Identifying this suboptimal behavioral pattern raises the possibility it can be mitigated using behavioral change strategies. We tested whether the effects of temporal context in risk-taking can be attenuated with an intentional cognitive strategy. 124 participants completed two rounds of a contextually structured gambling task with trial-by-trial feedback, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and working memory capacity tasks. Participants were randomly assigned to complete each gambling round with a strategy either emphasizing a natural, uncontrolled decision-making approach or directly instructing participants to ignore context. Instructions to ignore context influenced temporal context effects on the immediate timescale but did not change those on the neighborhood or global timescales. The strategy was not uniformly effective for all individuals. The cognitive strategy eliminated (and even reversed) contextual effects on the immediate timescale for individuals with moderate and high habitual use of reappraisal. However, the cognitive strategy paradoxically strengthened contextual effects on the immediate timescale for individuals with low habitual use of reappraisal. The selective effects of strategic control on contextual influence indicates both intriguing possibilities and limits on the ability to optimize human decision-making, and suggests that people do not simply maximize local utility, but rather that even simple risky decision-making may be fundamentally goal-dependent.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The study of risky decision-making has undergone major shifts over recent decades with a growing appreciation for the roles of affect, cognitive biases and heuristics, individual differences, and biological and cognitive limitations of the human brain. Early influential theories of risky decision-making, such as Expected Utility Theory (EUT) assumed that risky decisions are a result of stable, trait-like preferences, invariant to contextual influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . That actual observed choices violated such assumptions and were in fact contextually sensitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> led to one of the most critical insights in risky decision-making, that risk-taking is reference-dependent (Prospect Theory) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . Precisely how contextual influences contribute to the formation of reference points and their updating over time was not addressed by Prospect Theory, but it has become increasingly evident that recent events (e.g. previous outcomes) occurring over multiple timescales influence risky choice behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref> . That observed behavior does not match theories based on rational assumptions of local value maximization raises the possibility that choice behavior could be more optimal if contextual influences were eliminated or attenuated. One route to doing so could be intentional strategic control of decisionmaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref> . Whether such strategies could change or interact with contextual dependencies in risky decision-making is unclear. Here, we test whether the use of an intentional cognitive strategy during risky decision-making could mitigate specific components of temporal context-dependence in risk-taking behavior and potential sources of individual variability in those strategic effects (e.g., in habitual emotion regulation and/or working memory capacity).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiple Timescales of Temporal Context Effects in Risky Decision-Making</head><p>Risky decision-making is sensitive to recent events occurring on the order of seconds to several minutes that can be characterized by at least three distinct timescales: immediate, neighborhood, and global.</p><p>At the immediate timescale (a few seconds), several studies providing trial-by-trial feedback have demonstrated that outcomes on the previous trial influence how individuals evaluate and act on subsequent risky choices. This research indicates that the current option values and probabilities as well as previous outcomes are important to risky choice behavior. In a recent set of studies, we found that risk-taking decreased following large positive previous outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> and replicated this effect in a subsequent novel dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> .That risk-taking decreased following large previous outcomes is consistent with some previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> but at odds with others showing increased risk-taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17</ref> following large gains. Such inconsistencies in the literature may be the result of differences in how outcomes are realized across tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> and integrated with potential future outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17</ref> . Characterizing the effect of previous outcomes is further complicated given that many studies involving trial-by-trial feedback do not examine the effect of previous outcome on risk-taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30]</ref> . While differences in experimental approaches may influence the directionality of previous outcome effects across studies, the replication of previous outcome effects within any given paradigm establishes that risky decision-making is sensitive to events occurring on the immediate timescale.</p><p>At the neighborhood timescale (tens of seconds to minutes), changes in both valuation and risky choice behavior occur following shifts in context defined by several consecutive trials with a shared value such as high-value trials versus low-value trials. Contextual effects at the neighborhood timescale have been observed for the valuation of snack items <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31</ref> and risky gambles <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref> , and recently extended to risky choice behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> . In prior work, we examined how risk-taking changed throughout a gambling task with a novel choice set that created and shifted context by making several consecutive trials share the same expected value, followed by shifts up and down to a new context, or set of trials with a new shared value <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> . Risk-taking increased following a positive shift (i.e. to a higher value) and quickly returned to baseline, but did not change following a negative shift <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> . These results demonstrate that risky choice behavior is sensitive to recent value history occurring over tens of seconds to minutes. Brief changes in risk-taking behavior following abrupt shifts in context suggest that the neighborhood effects in risk-taking may reflect a simple surprise or Pavlovian approach mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32</ref> .</p><p>Studies investigating global effects (on the scale of tens of minutes) in risk-taking suggest that overall resource levels (e.g. earnings) and their evolution may be closely related to the original idea of the reference point. Experiments that have used cumulative earnings to capture the effects of the global timescale in real-world and laboratory risky decision-making settings report both increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> and decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> in risk-taking as earnings rise. One potential explanation for this inconsistency is that the effect of cumulative earnings may be best understood in comparison to a subjective, unobserved estimate of expected earnings <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">33</ref> . We recently demonstrated that risk-taking increased when earnings were higher than expected and decreased when earnings were lower than expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> consistent with a putative dynamic reference point. That individuals behaved differently at the same level of earnings depending on how those earnings compared to their expectations suggests that both earnings and expectations are critical to understanding global context effects in risky decision-making. There are at least two factors that complicate the current understanding of how cumulative earnings influence risky choice behavior. First, most studies do not pay participants cumulative earnings, but rather the outcome of a randomly selected trial to actively discourage earnings or "wealth" effects" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[40]</ref> . Whether such payout structures prevent effects of cumulative earnings is unclear because these studies do not examine these effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[40]</ref> . We have previously identified effects of cumulative earnings in a novel dataset using a payout structure to discourage wealth effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> raising the possibility that individuals use earnings (implicitly or explicitly) to guide their risky choice behavior regardless of task design or payout structures. Second, because earnings generally increase over the duration of the task in most studies, it is difficult to dissociate earnings from the effect of time or other correlates of time (e.g. fatigue, practice, etc). Only one study, to our knowledge, successfully dissociated earnings from time by using a "room" manipulation to create different contexts and demonstrated that individuals tracked earnings within but not across contexts, indicating that the effect of earnings on risk-taking is distinct from time and other correlates 11 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Why and How is There Context-Dependence in Risk-Taking?</head><p>The temporal context effects at all three timescales described above occur in settings that are not inherently dynamic (e.g. outcomes are independent trial-by-trial, participants are paid a subset of outcomes and not cumulative earnings). This is perplexing because reliance on recent events may be suboptimal according to common utility maximization frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . For example, basing a decision on a previous outcome that is unrelated and does not influence the current outcome is inconsistent with the assumed task goal, potentially leading to lower payoffs. Uncovering the mechanism(s) supporting temporal context in risk is central to understanding why and how such effects occur and whether context-dependence is a general and adaptive feature of cognition. One clue as to why people behave suboptimally like this may be the observation that similar patterns of temporal context effects are present across multiple domains of cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[48]</ref> and affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[53]</ref> . This suggests that relying on recent events may somehow be a general and potentially adaptive feature of cognition and affect.</p><p>One compelling explanation for why and how risk-taking is context-dependent even when such behavior appears suboptimal is that individuals have goals other than, or in addition to, the assumed goal of maximizing payoffs. There is a growing consensus that multiple goals help shape value-based decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[56]</ref> suggesting that many factors may contribute to individuals' goals in risky decision-making settings (e.g. minimizing effort, maximizing efficiency). One potential mechanism for temporal context in risk may be the desire to maintain equilibrium between a current state and goal state, for example, to decrease the distance between the current and desired resource level <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">57</ref> . This account is consistent with foraging behavior observed in some non-human species (i.e. energy-budget rule) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">58</ref> and may explain both the immediate and global timescale effects. For example, consider an individual with an overall earnings goal. Following a large positive outcome (which decreases the distance between the current and desired earnings goal), risk-taking decreases. Following a small or negative previous outcome (which increases the distance between the current and desired earnings goal) risktaking may increase to make up for the previous small or loss outcome ("break-even" effect) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17</ref> . However, once the current earnings have reached or exceed the overall earnings goal, the effect of recent outcomes on risk-taking may disappear or lead to more risk-taking following large previous outcomes ("house-money" effect) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17</ref> . It is unclear precisely which goals individuals have, how they change or update, and how these goals influence risky choice behavior, but accounting for goals is central to understanding how and why temporal context effects occur in risk. Other possible mechanisms driving context-dependent risk-taking could include valuation mechanisms that are inherently relative <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[63]</ref> (See Supplemental Materials for further discussion of these mechanisms).</p><p>The neighborhood timescale effect in risk-taking behavior, in contrast to the immediate and global timescales, may be best accounted for by a simple surprise mechanism or a Pavlovian response to sudden, large shifts in the environment where individuals approach values that appear better, and avoid values that appear worse, relative to those in the recent past <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32</ref> . This would suggest that the mechanism supporting the neighborhood timescale effect in risk may be distinct from the immediate and global timescales.</p><p>Of course, the mechanisms underlying contextual dependence in risk-taking may also be more complex than described here with temporal context effects in risky monetary decision-making potentially being supported by some combination of these and/or other potential mechanisms (see Supplementary Materials).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Strategies and Risky Decision-making</head><p>Studies that have successfully changed risky choice behavior use cognitive reappraisal-like strategies that target the information that individuals attend to and the way individuals think about their current situation and choice prospects <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19</ref> . For example, individuals took more risks and exhibited less loss aversion following instructions to consider each risky choice as one of many (e.g. "you win some, you lose some") relative to treating each risky choice as the only one that mattered <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19</ref> . Importantly, cognitive reappraisal is one of many emotion regulation strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">64</ref> and more experience with reappraisal has been linked to strategy success <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">65</ref> .</p><p>One way that cognitive strategies may change risky decision-making is, in part, by influencing attention. For example, training individuals to direct their attention to positive features of a food item increased the craving and willingness-to-pay for, and the probability of choosing the food item <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">66</ref> . These results are consistent with the broader literature demonstrating a potentially causal role of attention in value-based decisionmaking, outside of its role in reappraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[70]</ref> . In risky decision-making settings, where temporal context is a fundamental component of choice, it may also be the case that mitigating individuals' attention to recent events changes the extent to which choices reflect the past and that this effect may depend on the extent that an event is explicit or consciously accessible and/or an individuals' experience with reappraisal-like strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of Cognitive Control in Strategies</head><p>Cognitive control describes the ability to simultaneously hold a goal in mind while flexibly maintaining and updating thoughts and actions in pursuit of the goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">71</ref> . Because control is critical to many areas of cognition including memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">72</ref> , attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">73</ref> , valuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">54</ref> , and strategic emotion regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">74</ref> , it is likely that cognitive control is also critical to strategy use in risky decision-making. That temporal context effects appear at odds with the risky decision-making task goal raises the possibility that relying on past experiences is a default feature of risky choice behavior and overcoming such a response may require cognitive control. Because goals are inherent to value-based decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">55</ref> , cognitive strategy use may also require goal adjustment, as observed in recent research <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">75</ref> . This suggests that cognitive control is broadly relevant to decision-making, and may especially be so in contexts in which goals and strategies are explicitly present and/or manipulated features <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">54</ref> .</p><p>The extent to which an individual can successfully deploy control may depend on factors that determine their capacity (e.g. working memory capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">77</ref> and/or motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[80]</ref> to engage cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">82</ref> ). Working memory refers to the shortterm active maintenance, manipulation, and retrieval of relevant information <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">83</ref> , and is critical to the exertion of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">77</ref> , and thus may be linked to the impact of cognitive strategies on behavior. For example, in decision-making, working memory capacity may improve the ability to actively maintain a goal (e.g. instructions for engaging a cognitive strategy), thereby shaping the processes that do and do not affect choice. Separately from capacity, an individual's level of motivation may also affect strategy use, consistent with research establishing that motivation directly contributes to the successful use of cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">79</ref> . The consequences of exerting cognitive control are thus multiplydeterminedin any given situation, factors like capacity and/or motivation may be critical moderators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The current study</head><p>We combined a temporally structured risky monetary decision-making task with a cognitive strategy to test whether changing the way individuals think about context mitigates the effects of recent events at the immediate, neighborhood, and global timescales. The cognitive strategy instructed individuals to ignore contextual influences and was contrasted with a condition in which participants responded naturally (following procedures from research on emotion regulation, e.g. "regulate" vs "look").</p><p>We hypothesized that the cognitive strategy would differentially affect the three timescales of temporal context in risky monetary decision-making, in part, because of the varying degrees of explicitness of each timescale in the gambling task. Outcomes (immediate timescale) were displayed to participants on each trial. Shifts in value (neighborhood timescale) were not explicitly displayed to participants beyond simply occurring throughout the task. Relative earnings (i.e., earnings compared to expectations at the global timescale) were also not explicitly shown to participants at any point in the task but were the accumulation of outcomes over the task. Because outcomes were explicitly available to participants, we hypothesized that the cognitive strategy would reduce or eliminate context effects at the immediate timescale (negative effect of past outcome on risk-taking) and that this effect would extend to the global timescale (reducing the effect of earnings relatives to expectations on risk-taking). Due to the implicit nature of shifts and the potential relationship to underlying, less attentional mechanisms (e.g. Pavlovian response <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32</ref> or surprise <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">84</ref> ), we expected no change in context effects at the neighborhood timescale (shift effect) as a function of cognitive strategy.</p><p>As the engagement of the cognitive strategy reasonably required the deployment of control, we hypothesized that successfully ignoring context when instructed would be related to individual differences in working memory capacity and reported motivation. Furthermore, because the strategy was very similar to emotion regulation-style strategies, we additionally hypothesized that successful regulation would be related to the habitual deployment of similar strategies to regulate emotions, as measured by the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Reappraisal subscale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We tested whether an intentional cognitive strategy reduced context effects in risky decision-making and whether such changes were related to emotion regulation and cognitive control. 124 participants completed two independent rounds of a classic gambling task. We implemented a choice set with intentional temporal structure that allowed us to examine temporal context effects in risky decision-making at three timescales: immediate, neighborhood and global. In each of the two rounds of the gambling task, participants were randomly assigned to receive instructions to either implement a cognitive strategy or act naturally, resulting in four groups (natural-natural, natural-strategy, strategy-natural, strategy-strategy). The cognitive strategy instructed participants to ignore contextual influences (see Supplementary Materials for full text). Following the decision-making task, participants completed two working memory tasks to assess cognitive capacity (Operation Span and Symmetry Span Tasks) <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">85</ref> and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">86</ref> to assess participants' habitual use of cognitive strategies. We leveraged generalized linear modeling of choices to test whether the use of a cognitive strategy mitigated temporal context effects in risky choice behavior, and the extent to which these changes were related to individual differences in working memory capacity and emotion regulation. We show that cognitive strategy effects on temporal context in risk are limited to the immediate timescale (previous outcome) and depend on an individuals' experience with cognitive reappraisal. These novel findings demonstrate that changing the way people think about their past selectively changes the extent to which their choices reflect the past.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective experiences and cognitive processing were similar across conditions</head><p>We initially tested whether participants' subjective experiences significantly varied as a function of condition. Because the strategy asked participants to approach choices in a way that differed from what they would ordinarily do and the natural condition instructed them to behave as normal, it was possible that the strategy instructions were more difficult to implement throughout the gambling task and required additional cognitive processing relative to instructions to act naturally. We examined differences in participants' experience of the two conditions in terms of self-reports and reaction times. Similar self-reports and reaction times in the strategy and natural condition would suggest that any effects of strategy on risky choice were not the result of potential confounds like cognitive load.</p><p>Linear mixed effect models of ratings of participants' reported experience indicated no significant effects of condition (strategy vs. act natural; main effect or interaction with round) on experienced difficulty (easy 1, to difficult 100; natural M = 30.95, SD = 22.18; strategy M = 34.18, SD = 26.37) or the frequency with which participants were able to follow the instructions (not at all 1, to all the time 100; natural M = 75.17, SD = 18.71; strategy M = 75.06, SD = 19.90, p's &gt; .08; see Supplementary Materials). These results indicate that participants' reported experiences in the two conditions were not meaningfully different.</p><p>Next, we tested whether the strategy required more cognitive processing relative to naturally approaching risky choices by examining reaction times across the two conditions. Slower RTs when following strategy instructions relative to natural instructions would suggest that ignoring context required additional cognitive resources. For these analyses, we excluded trials with RTs faster than 500ms (a total of 21 trials were removed across 124 participants). Linear mixed effects models of reaction time indicated that contrary to predictions, reaction times were faster in the strategy condition compared to the act natural condition (but only in round 1; mean RTact naturalmean RTstrategy = 0.04s). Thus, if anything, participants may have found the strategy to be marginally easier to execute. See supplementary materials for full model results and additional discussion.</p><p>Overall, subjective reports of instruction difficulty and frequency along with reaction time indicate that the implementation of instructions was similar across conditions. Any potential effects of strategy on risk-taking behavior are therefore likely reflective of the strategy's effects on the processes underlying risky decision-making, and not due to potential confounds such as cognitive load.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived independence of gambling task rounds</head><p>We tested whether participants' reports of perceived gambling round independence varied as a function of participants' experience of condition and order (natural-natural, natural-strategy, strategy-natural, strategy-strategy). A one-way ANOVA revealed no statistically significant difference in perceived round independence between the four groups (F(3,120) = 2.088, p = .11) and moderately high overall ratings of independence (M = 4.99(1.55), median = 5, range = 1-7 from not independent to totally independent). These results indicate that the task instructions and manipulations (e.g. different colors to delineate rounds) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> were successful regardless of participants' experience of strategy type and order.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual difference measures</head><p>For analyses examining the effect of the strategy on risk-taking as mediated by individual difference terms (reported motivation, working memory capacity, habitual use of cognitive reappraisal, and habitual use of suppression), we first performed baseline analyses on these variables. Broadly consistent with prior research and expectations, participants reported high motivation (M = 5.17, SD = 1.12, range = 2-7 on a scale from 1-7, low to high motivation) during the experiment and demonstrated a wide range of scores for composite span (M = .57, SD = .22 , range = .06-1, with higher values indicating greater working memory capacity). Participant scores for habitual use of cognitive reappraisal (M = 4.95, SD = .91, range = 2.3-7, with higher values indicating greater use of reappraisal) and expressive suppression (M = 3.72, SD = 1.37, range = 1-6.75, with higher values indicating greater use of suppression) were consistent with samples from large-scale, international studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">88</ref> . Correlational tests revealed only a significant relationship between suppression and motivation, indicating that people who more often habitually suppress emotions were less motivated during the task (r(120) = -.22, p = .01). All other relationships were not significant (p's &gt; 0.4; See Supplemental Materials <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>). In general, these individual-level measures appear to be capturing different cognitive processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strategic effects on temporal context in risk depend on habitual emotion regulation</head><p>Initial analyses replicated the three timescales of temporal context on risky choice behavior as previously identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> (see supplementary materials for these results and discussion). To examine the effect of the strategy on risk-taking, temporal context dependence, and potential mediation, we then added the main effect of condition (strategy vs. act natural) and interacted the strategy's effects with each of the four covariates (model 1). We examined the results of this model to identify the covariate with the most explanatory power for the subsequent in-depth analyses. This approach was chosen (as opposed to interacting all four covariates, two strategies, and three timescales of temporal context in a single model) to protect against over-fitting. We tested whether the effect of condition on risk varied as a function of working memory capacity, motivation, and habitual use of emotion regulation strategies by adding interactions between the condition regressor and each of the four covariates (e.g., condition x motivation; model 1). For these analyses, we scaled both emotion regulation variables to span zero (-1 = low habitual use of reappraisal or suppression; +1 = high habitual use of reappraisal or suppression). Regression coefficients revealed that the overall effect of condition on risk-taking was weakly related to individuals' habitual use of cognitive reappraisal (strategy x ERQ reappraisal  = -.08(.04), p = .05) but did not appear to change as a function of working memory capacity ( = -.04(.07), p = .55), motivation ( = -.11(.1), p = .28), or habitual use of expressive suppression ( = -.02(.02), p = .51; Additional variations of this model are reported in the Supplemental Materials). That the overall effect of condition on risk-taking was not related to working memory capacity or motivation was consistent with results that implementing the strategy instructions to ignore context was not significantly more difficult and did not require more cognitive processing than the act natural condition.</p><p>Because habitual use of cognitive reappraisal had the strongest influence on condition, we tested whether this relationship extended to more specific effects on temporal context in risk. In model 2 we included an interaction between condition, habitual reappraisal and each contextual variable (e.g. condition x reappraisal x outcomet-1) and removed the covariates for motivation, working memory capacity and expressive suppression (see Supplemental Materials for additional analyses and discussion of these covariates). Regression estimates replicated the temporal context effects (outcomet-1  = -.23(.05), p = 2.03x10 <ref type="bibr">-5</ref> , signed shiftt  = .43(.21), p = .04, earningst-1  = 1.17(.28), p = 2.6x10 -5 and linear expectationst-1  = -.8(.23), p = .0004).</p><p>Crucially, condition, in concert with reappraisal, appeared to only influence the immediate timescale (condition x reappraisal x outcomet-1  = .52(.15), p = .0006).</p><p>There were no interactions between condition and habitual reappraisal use on either of the other two timescales (condition x reappraisal x signed shiftt  = .6(.55), p = .27, condition x reappraisal x earningst-1  = .15(.75), p = .84, condition x reappraisal x linear expectationst  = -.2(.63), p = .75). Finally, reappraisal had independent effects on condition overall ( = -.19(.09), p = .03) and on the previous outcome effect ( = .32(.15), p = .03; See Supplemental Materials for full regression results for all models).</p><p>The three-way interaction between condition, habitual reappraisal, and previous outcome indicates that when instructed to ignore context, the negative effect of past outcome was stronger for individuals with low habitual use of reappraisal but for those with high habitual use of reappraisal, the effect of past outcome reversed (i.e. more risktaking as outcomes increased).</p><p>In an exploratory analysis (model 3), we unpacked the three-way interaction between condition, reappraisal, and previous outcomes, and allowed for possible nonlinearities in the effect of reappraisal. We created two dummy variables for individuals in the top and bottom tertiles of reappraisal scores (coded as high reappraisers = +1; others = 0 and in a separate variable, low reappraisers = +1 and others = 0). Moderate reappraisers were accounted for by the overlap of individuals not accounted for by either the high and low reappraisal variables and their behavior is represented by baseline model estimates. We included separate interactions between the two reappraisal variables, condition and previous outcome amount (e.g. condition x high reappraisers x outcomet-1) and removed the continuous reappraisal variable and interactions between reappraisal, condition and the neighborhood and global timescales (i.e. shift, earnings and expectations from model 2). Regression estimates revealed that, as expected, past outcome had a negative main effect on risk-taking ( = -.19(.08), p = .02) and this baseline effect did not significantly differ across reappraisal groups (outcomet-1 x low reappraisers  = .008(.11), p = .94; outcomet-1 x high reappraisers  = .12(.17), p = .49), indicating that the past outcome effect was consistent across groups when individuals were acting naturally. The direct effect of condition on risk-taking was significant for low reappraisers (condition x low reappraisers  = .1(.05), p = .03) but not for high reappraisers (condition x high reappraisers  = -.07(.07), p = .29), suggestive of some differences in baseline, condition-independent behavior. Crucially, the effect of the strategy on the previous outcome effect differed by reappraisal group. Condition interacted with previous outcome for moderate habitual reappraisers (condition x outcomet-1  = .29(.11), p = .006), an effect which was no different for high habitual reappraisers (condition x outcomet-1 x high reappraisers  = -.03(.18), p = .86 ; See <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> for effect sizes and Supplemental Materials for the full regression results, which are consistent with model 2) where the strategy reversed the negative effect of past outcome on risk-taking (i.e. more risk-taking as previous outcomes increased). However, the effect of strategy on the outcome effect was blunted in low reappraisers (condition x outcomet-1 x low reappraisers  = -.35(.13), p = .007). These results indicate that across all levels of reappraisal use, the effect of past outcome is negative when individuals approach choices naturally, as found previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> . When instructed to ignore context, the negative effect of past outcome reverses for moderate and high reappraisers but gets stronger (more negative) for low reappraisers. While different in their habitual use of cognitive reappraisal, both high and moderate reappraisers appear to successfully engage the strategy and reverse the immediate timescale (past outcomes) effect on risk to a similar degree. For these individuals, the increase in risktaking with strategy use is accounted for by the strategic effect on the immediate timescale (more risk-taking as past outcomes increased). For low reappraisers, however, strategy use intensified the immediate timescale effect on risk-taking resulting in even less risk-taking as previous outcomes increased while non-specifically increasing risk-taking overall. These opposing strategic effects on risk-taking for low habitual reappraisers suggest that for individuals who fall below a threshold of habitual use of reappraisal, engaging a reappraisal-like strategy paradoxically exacerbates the targeted behavior (temporal context effects) but influences other, nonspecific, aspects of risk-taking.</p><p>All analysis scripts can be accessed at https://github.com/sokolhessnerlab/rcs/tree/main/analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Here, we demonstrated that the use of an intentional cognitive strategy selectively changed temporal context effects in risky monetary decision-making. Evaluating risky choice options in isolation of contextual factors reversed the effect of context only on the immediate timescale (previous outcomes), an effect that depended on an individual's experience with controlling their thoughts.</p><p>Our cognitive strategy was intended to shift individuals' thoughts and feelings toward features of each choice option (i.e., their monetary values and probabilities) and away from contextual factors. We hypothesized that the strategy would reduce or eliminate the influence of context on risk-taking at the immediate (previous outcome) and global (relative earnings) timescales but not the neighborhood (shift) timescale. Our results partially confirmed our hypotheses as the cognitive strategy reversed the immediate timescale effect on risk-taking but did not change context effects at the neighborhood and global timescales.</p><p>That the effect of strategy on temporal context was limited to the immediate timescale suggests that only the most explicit aspects of temporal context (e.g. previous outcomes are explicitly displayed on each trial, whereas shifts and relative earnings were not) are accessible to cognitive strategies. Interestingly, the current strategy appeared to alter how individuals processed previous outcomes instead of eliminating the effect of outcomes on subsequent choices. That is, while the strategy instructed participants to ignore context, those for whom the strategy was effective appear to have instead flipped the influence of events at the immediate timescale. Such resistance to intentional reappraisal would align with the view that temporal context effects, especially when more implicit, might be deeply ingrained features of economic behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">89</ref> . An alternative possibility is that while the current cognitive strategy did not change the influence of neighborhood and global timescales of temporal context on risk-taking, a different cognitive strategy could. The current strategy instructed participants to broadly ignore contextual factors (i.e. did not explicitly point out each timescale) whereas a strategy that explicitly highlights each timescale of temporal context may bring those specific contextual effects to individuals' attention and therefore make them accessible to regulation. While attention is critical to value-based decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">90</ref> , our results suggest that aspects of temporal context effects that fall outside of attentional awareness (e.g. the neighborhood shift effect) may still impact choice behavior. It is currently debated whether other types of contextual effects in value-based decisionmaking (e.g. distractor effect) reflect context-specific processing (e.g. relative value encoding) or changes in attentional processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">91</ref> . Our results suggest that it may be both.</p><p>We predicted that the strength of the strategic effect on temporal context in risk would be related to increased working memory capacity, motivation, and/or more experience with cognitive reappraisal. We found that habitual use of cognitive reappraisal, but not capacity or motivation, was related to the impact of strategy use on temporal context effects. When instructed to approach choices naturally, risk-taking decreased as past outcomes increased for all individuals equally, as expected. When instructed to ignore context, the negative effect of past outcome reversed for moderate and high reappraisers but was paradoxically stronger (more negative) for low reappraisers. These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that cognitive strategy use does not uniformly change decision-making for everyone <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18</ref> , is more successful for individuals with strong habitual use of reappraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">65</ref> , and may backfire for individuals with low habitual reappraisal use <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">92</ref> . That both moderate and high reappraisers demonstrated similar strategic effects despite different levels of experience with reappraisal suggests that there may be a potential threshold of reappraisal experience above which individuals can successfully engage a reappraisal-like strategy. These results also indicate that for low reappraisers, engaging a cognitive strategy was not simply ineffective, but had other, unintended effects on strategy implementation. Future research should measure strategy type and success on a more frequent timescale (e.g. trial-by-trial) to understand how individuals may adjust strategy use over time to achieve a certain goal.</p><p>That the strategic effect on temporal context was related to emotion regulation use implies that temporal context effects, in part, may be driven by an affective mechanism. One compelling possibility is that the strategy changed the affective experience of receiving outcomes which is consistent with previous studies showing that reappraisal-like strategies change choice behavior by changing emotional experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">94</ref> . If so, then cognitive reappraisal-like strategies targeting temporal contextual effects in risk may work by changing how individuals experience recent events and integrate that experience with subsequent choices. If the strategic effect on temporal context is driven by a change in affective experience, then the relationship between reappraisal and individual differences in affective experiences may also be helpful for understanding how temporal context manifests in risk-taking. For example, because reappraisal use is also related to fewer symptoms of psychopathology including depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">95</ref> , there may be a relationship between clinically-significant ways in which people think and feel about past experiences (including in negative ways in e.g. depression) and temporal context effects in decision-making.</p><p>We did not observe relationships between strategy effects and motivation or working memory capacity. While the current dataset was powered to detect such effects, one possible reason for these null effects is that the strategy did not specifically target motivational or cognitive control processes that would have taxed working memory. For example, the strategy instructions changed the way individuals approached the gambling task but did not explicitly change participants' overall goals or introduce new factors to evaluate, consider, or keep in mind. Such strategy elements may have required stronger engagement of working memory and thus resulted in a dependence on working memory capacity and/or motivational differences. Future research should examine whether the influence of strategies that explicitly change goals (e.g. minimize effort, maximize efficiency) and motivational factors (e.g. compensation) may relate to individual differences in working memory capacity and motivation. A limitation of the current study is that participants were asked to rate their overall motivation in the study (e.g. "How motivated were you today?"). Asking a more specific question about motivation and strategy implementation (e.g. "How motivated were you to follow strategy instructions?") and more frequently (e.g. every 2-3 trials) will be critical to understanding potential relationships between motivation and cognitive strategy use.</p><p>We used generalized linear modeling to replicate the three timescales of temporal context effects in risk-taking. Because other decision-making processes (e.g. risk-aversion) are nonlinear <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , developing a nonlinear computational framework to account for all three timescales of temporal context in risk-taking is an important future direction. Previous studies have made progress on this by modifying Prospect Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> to demonstrate how previous rewards (i.e. the immediate timescale) shift specific risky decision-making processes (risk aversion, loss aversion, choice consistency, and decision bias) over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> . A model that accounts for all three timescales has yet to be developed but could address many important questions. First, we assumed linearly increasing expectations, but given that many risky decision-making processes are nonlinear, it is likely that expectations may also adjust non-linearly (e.g. piece-wise linear, concave or convex) over time and that the rate at which expectations update may differ across individuals. One approach to modeling expectations was recently proposed by Expected Subjective Value Theory 96 which defines expectations as an average of reward history weighted by a forgetting rate (the extent to which recent versus later rewards influence expectations, similar to a learning rate in reinforcement learning) <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">97</ref> . While ESVT does not account for how expectations may relate to goals or resource levels, it is a step toward understanding nonlinearities and individual variability in the formation and progression of expectations over time. An alternative approach for understanding how expectations form and evolve would be to explicitly ask participants (instead of inferring) about their expectations throughout the task. Second, whether each timescale of temporal context acts directly on value-dependent (e.g. risk aversion, loss aversion) and/or value-independent (e.g. choice consistency, decision bias) processes of risk-taking is unclear. Previous research has demonstrated that the immediate timescale (previous outcomes) changes both value-dependent (lossaversion) and value-independent processes (choice consistency and decision-bias) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> but that the global timescale may only change value-independent (decision-bias) processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> . Therefore, it is reasonable that the neighborhood (shift) timescale may also selectively influence specific risky decision-making processes and such influences could be informative of underlying mechanisms. For example, if the neighborhood timescale effect (increased risk-taking as shift values become increasingly positive) is a Pavlovian-like approach-avoidance response to novel changes in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32</ref> , then we may expect shifts to influence choice (or action-specific) processes such as decision-bias, but not valuation processes (e.g. risk aversion or loss aversion). Whereas if the neighborhood timescale is the result of relative valuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[62]</ref> , then we would expect shifts to influence value-dependent processes of risky decision-making such as loss aversion and risk-aversion. The extent to which each timescale influences specific processes of risk-taking would also be indicative of possible relationships between each timescale. For example, in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> as well as supplementary results in the current study, we found evidence that the immediate and global timescales may interact (although this effect is inconsistent across studies with outcomes interacting with just earnings or both earnings and expectations). The degree to which the immediate and global timescales act on similar decision-making processes would reveal more about their potentially distinct and overlapping mechanisms.</p><p>These results extend the effects of cognitive strategy on risky decision-making to temporal context effects. Altering thoughts and attention to recent events selectively changed the ways that choices reflect the past. Risky monetary decision-making is contextually sensitive and resistant to efforts to eliminate such effects, even when it appears at odds with the assumed goal of reward maximization. If people are straightforward value maximizing agents, then choices should only reflect values and probabilities of current choice options. The consistent and strong evidence that individuals are not simply maximizing their payoff on each trial suggests that risky decision-making may be goal-directed in ways that are currently under-appreciated. For example, it is possible that goals are contextualized and evolve over time. We show here that in risky decision-making, individuals track their overall performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> relative to some expected reward or resource level (i.e. expectation) and behave differently when the current state is better or worse than expected. This pattern of behavior parallels insights from foraging literature where animals calculate an expected reward rate of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">98</ref> . Re-evaluating the assumption that individuals approach risky choices in a strictly reward maximizing manner opens up the possibility for a much deeper understanding of the processes underlying risky decision-making and their relationship to similar concepts in other domains such as memory (e.g. event segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">99</ref> ) and reinforcement learning (e.g. states <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">100 )</ref> Our findings converge with the growing consensus that context-dependence is a deeply ingrained and shared feature of human economic behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">102</ref> . The influence of context in human risky decision-making can be partially altered, but not eliminated, suggesting that context is here to stay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>134 undergraduate participants were recruited from the University of Denver's SONA system. Ten participants were excluded (a priori exclusion criteria described below in Risky Decision-Making Data Quality) resulting in a total of 124 participants or 31 participants per group (80 female, 40 male, 1 trans male, 2 gender nonconforming, 1 other; mean(sd) age: 19.24(1.78) years, median age: 19 years, range: 18-32 years; additional demographic information reported in <ref type="table">Table S1</ref> in the Supplemental Materials). The sample size was based on the combination of a set of power analyses, previous studies, and feasibility and constraints of the current study. We performed a priori statistical power analyses using the "pwr" package 103 in R version 4.1.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">104</ref> to estimate the effect size of the current sample size. For each power analysis described, the probability of type 1 error was  = .05 and power was set to 80% (or 1type 2 error probability). The current sample size is sufficient to detect a moderate effect with both a two-sample t-test (d = .5, e.g. examining whether the effect of past outcome significantly differed between participants who start in the strategy group (n=62) relative to participants who start in the control group (n=62)) and with a one-way ANOVA (d = .3, where n=31 per group, e.g., whether the change in the effect of past outcome on risktaking from round 1 to round 2 of the gambling task significantly differed across the four groups). This sample size is also sufficient to detect a small effect size (r = .25) with analyses correlating individual differences on the collected measures (e.g. examining potential correlations between individual differences in working memory and emotion regulation (n=124)). These analyses are conservative as our dataset consists of repeated-measures risky choice data (see below for details, but in brief, 131 choices per participant for each of two task rounds, or 32,488 choices total) and our analytic approach leverages generalized linear mixed effects models which pool data across all participants to identify both group-and subject-level effects. The sample size exceeds that of previous studies with a similar study design <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">30</ref> . Participants received course credit for their participation in addition to the monetary outcome on one randomly selected trial from a single round of the gambling task. This study was approved by the University of Denver's Institutional Review Board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risky Decision-making Task</head><p>Participants completed the risky gambling task twice within a single session in a fully-instructed laboratory setting, producing informed, incentive-compatible, and robust repeated measures and within-subject choice data. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions prior to each round of the task: natural condition ("act natural") and strategy condition ("ignore context"), resulting in four possible groups: natural-natural, natural-strategy, strategy-natural, and strategy-strategy. This design controls for possible confounds such as effects due to fatigue, practice, and/or learning.</p><p>We collected 32,414 choices across all participants and conditions after accounting for missed trials (74 total missed trials across 124 participants; median number of missed trials across both rounds = 0) and the exclusions (see Risky Decision-Making Data Quality, below).</p><p>A single round of the gambling task consisted of 131 choices between a risky gamble (with equiprobable outcomes of a positive amount between $0 and $60 or $0 if selected) and a guaranteed alternative (between $0 and $30 if selected; see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). The task was programmed using Python 3.9.12 and PsychoPy3 2022.2.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">105</ref> in Spyder version 5.2.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">106</ref> . On each trial, choice options were displayed for 4s. Participants could respond at any time within the 4s window, but after 2s, a cue would appear that indicated that participants had 2s seconds remaining to respond. Immediately after participants responded, there was a brief interstimulus interval (.5s) and then the outcome was displayed for 1s. Prior to starting the next trial, there was a variable (1.5-6.5s) intertrial interval (ITI). Any remaining time from the 4s response window was added to the ITI to control the timing of the task on a trial-by-trial basis, ensuring a constant task duration for all participants. The decision-making task was programmed using Python 3.9.12 and PsychoPy3 2022.2.5 105 in Spyder version 5.2.2 106 and the task scripts can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/sokolhessnerlab/rcs. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Risky monetary decision-making task structure. Every trial featured a risky gamble option with two possible outcomes, each received with 50% probability if the gamble was selected, and a safe, or guaranteed option received with 100% probability if selected. Feedback was shown on each trial prior to the next choice appearing on the screen. Any remaining time during the response window (i.e. 4s-RT) was added to the ITI on a trial-by-trial basis to control the task timing. The outline of the screen and the progress bar were green (as shown) or purple (see Supplemental Materials) to delineate the two rounds of the risky decision-making task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risky Decision-making Data Quality</head><p>We assessed risky choice data quality for each participant based on five criteria. The first was that the proportion of missed trials in the decision-making task could not exceed 10% (or more than 13 missed trials per round). This ensured the presence of enough data within each group. Second, risky choice behavior needed to reflect the risky gain and guaranteed alternative values on each trial determined by individual-level generalized linear models using the "lme4" package 107 in R version 4.2.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">108</ref> , ensuring that all participants made choices driven by value. Third, the probability of gambling could not fall outside of the range of .05 and .95. In other words, participants selected the gamble on at least 5% of the trials and no more than 95%. Choices from participants who fall outside of those bounds have limited variability and restrict our ability to test how changes in risk-taking behavior can be accounted for by recent events. Fourth, participants must have correctly answered 70% of the "attention check" trials that occurred throughout each round of the risky decision-making task to ensure that participants were paying attention throughout the task. There were two types of attention-check trials. The first consisted of a large risky gamble amount (&gt;$35) and a guaranteed alternative of $0, in which case all participants should have accepted the gamble (assuming they positively value money). The second type of attention-check trial consisted of a guaranteed alternative amount with an expected value that is at least double the expected value of the risky gain amount. For example, consider a trial with a risky gamble amount of $10 and a guaranteed alternative of $20. As the guaranteed option was both higher in numerical value and probability, all participants should select the guaranteed alternative on this trial (and others like it), if participants positively value money. Last, average response times must have been 1s or greater, to ensure that all participants were processing and considering the monetary values on each trial before arriving at a decision.</p><p>Of the 134 participants, 8 were excluded from the analysis for failing 2 or more of these criteria and 2 additional participants were excluded based on self-reporting in the post-task questionnaire that their choices did not reflect task factors (e.g. pressing both response buttons simultaneously).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monetary Choice Set</head><p>We designed the monetary choice set to have intentional temporal structure to capture changes in risk-taking at three timescales, as identified in prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> . The main difference from prior research was that the task was shortened to accommodate the need for two independent rounds of decision-making in this study.</p><p>First, at the immediate timescale, we examined how risk-taking changes following each outcome, an effect identified in two previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> . Outcomes varied across trials due to the choice option value creation process (see below).</p><p>Second, to detect changes in risk-taking at the neighborhood timescale, we created and changed context with the use of 13 "runs", each consisting of either 5 or 16 trials that shared a mean expected value. Possible mean expected values were $5, $15, and $25, creating low-, medium-, and high-value contexts. Following each run was a positive or negative shift to the next run's mean expected value. Possible shifts in mean expected value were -$20 -$10, +$10, +$20. Each round consisted of four runs at each of three levels ($5, $15, $25), pseudorandomly ordered so that each level shifted to each other level two times (e.g. there were two $5-to-$15 shifts). As there was no shift into the first run, a thirteenth run was appended with an identical mean expected value as the first. Finally, of the four runs at each mean value, two were short (5 trials) and two were long (16 trials). Thus, each participant experienced the same number of low-, medium-, and high-value contexts, positive and negative shifts, and run lengths per round. On a given trial, the mean expected value of the risky gain and guaranteed alternative was equal to mean expected value of the given run +/-$.50 to create noise. For example, if the mean expected value of a given run was $5, then the mean expected value of the risky gain and guaranteed alternative on any given trial within that run was between $4.50 and $5.50. In the low-value contexts, possible risky gain options were $0-$20 and guaranteed alternatives were $0-$10. In the medium-value contexts, possible risky gain options were $20-$40 and guaranteed alternatives were $10-$20. In the high-value contexts, possible risky gain options were $40-$60 and guaranteed alternatives were $20-$30. By creating context over multiple trials, we could examine how risk-taking changed at the neighborhood timescale.</p><p>Third, we measured changes in risk-taking at the global, or task-level, timescale with cumulative earnings relative to expectations. This variable is not an inherent feature of our task as cumulative earnings were not displayed to participants at any point during the task and participants were paid the outcome of one randomly selected trial. However, recent findings using a similar choice set structure found that risk-taking changed as a function of cumulative earnings relative to expectations regardless of whether such information was explicitly displayed <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> . In selecting option values at any given level of context, we sought to balance two competing needs: to accurately infer risk attitudes for the expected average individual, and to still retain the ability to identify a wide range of risk attitudes. To accomplish these goals of accuracy and breadth, at each level of expected value (i.e. low-, medium-, and high-value contexts), the combinations of risky gain and guaranteed alternative values were more frequently sampled where the risky gain values were roughly double the guaranteed alternatives and less frequently sampled when one option was much better (or worse) than the other option. This type of sampling ensured that the choice set captured a wide range of risk attitudes from very risk seeking to very risk averse while emphasizing choices near the anticipated indifference points for an average individual (who is close to risk neutrality). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref> shows an example choice set, plotted by value with the risky gain and guaranteed alternative combinations, and by time to illustrate the choice structure over the task. To ensure that the current choice set could accurately measure risky decision-making variables of interest, we performed two parameter recovery exercises which we report and discuss in the Supplemental Materials. represented by a given line, they would be most likely to select the risky option for points above and to the left of that line, while they would likely choose the safe option for points below and to the right of the line. The top line represents a participant who is very risk-averse and the bottom line represents a participant who is very risk-seeking. (b) Mean expected values of the risky gamble and safe options across the duration of the task using the same choice set as shown in (a).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Strategy and Natural Instructions</head><p>The strategy and natural conditions in this study differed only by the task instructions. At the beginning of the experimental session, participants were informed that they would complete the task twice and received general task instructions similar to previous studies using this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> . To ensure that participants understood how and when to input their choice responses, participants completed a short task-instructions quiz and five practice trials in the presence of the experimenter. Prior to the start of each round of the gambling task, participants viewed the condition-specific instructions and were given the option to re-read the instructions as many times as needed until they were prepared to provide a verbal summary of the condition-specific instructions to the experimenter.</p><p>In the strategy condition, participants were told to evaluate the risky gamble and safe options in isolation from any context. Instructions informed participants that 1) in previous studies, individuals' decisions between the gamble and guaranteed alternative were influenced by recent events, 2) such influences are inconsistent with the overall goal of the task, to maximize monetary payoff, and that this goal should remain consistent throughout the task, and 3) during the task, participants should focus on the prospects of the current trial and not on events from previous trials (see Supplemental Materials for the full instruction text).</p><p>In the natural condition, participants were told that they should evaluate and decide between the risky gamble and safe options as they would naturally. Natural instructions matched the strategy instructions as closely as possible, informing participants that 1) in previous studies, individuals' decisions reflected multiple factors, 2) participants should use their own goals to guide their choices, and 3) during the task, participants should rely on any information, thoughts or feelings that come naturally to decide between the two options (see Supplemental Materials for full instruction text).</p><p>Participants who switched conditions (natural-strategy, strategy-natural) were told to forget about the instructions in the previous round and to implement the new instructions (see Supplemental Materials). Participants who repeated the same condition in round 2 read a shortened, reminder version of the same instructions as round 1 (see Supplemental Materials).</p><p>To delineate the two rounds of the task, each round contained a different color (green or purple) outline around the experiment screen and progress bar, similar to approaches taken in other, related studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> .</p><p>At the end of the first round, the message "Round 1 complete" appeared on the screen along with the outcome of the randomly selected trial from round 1. Participants were reminded that the randomly selected outcome in the first round of the task would be one of two outcomes randomly selected for payment at the end of the study. Participants then rated the difficulty of following the instructions in the first round and the frequency in which they followed the instructions (continuous scale from 0-100). Prior to starting the second round of the gambling task, the experimenter returned to the room and reminded them that the second round of the task was completely independent from the first and to treat the second round as a fresh start. At the end of the second round of the task, the randomly selected trial from that round and corresponding outcome was displayed on the screen and participants rated the difficulty and frequency of following the instructions in the second round. Then one of the two outcomes was randomly selected for payment. In a previous study using a similar payment structure, individuals did not appear to track earnings across round of the same task, but rather treated each round as distinct <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Working Memory Tasks</head><p>After the risky decision-making tasks, participants completed well-established complex span tasks, the operation span (OSpan) task and the symmetry span (SymSpan) task <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">85</ref> to measure individual differences in working memory capacity. Prior research has established that these two complex span tasks provide a reasonable balance between practical considerations of task length (forecasted to take 31 minutes to complete) and statistical power in accurately resolving participants' complex span (identifying 78.5% of the variance that would have been identified with effectively unlimited time and number of complex span tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">85</ref> ). In both tasks, participants recalled items (e.g. letters) while solving distractor problems. For the OSpan task, participants were asked to retain and then recall a series of letters after completing simple math problems for a total of 5 trials. The set sizes, or the number of letter-math pairs on a given trial, ranged from 3 to 7, the order of which were random for each participant. For example, on a trial with a set size of 4, participants were presented with four letters, one at a time, and would complete simple math problems between each of the four letters. After all four letters had been presented and four math problems completed, participants would have to recall the four letters, in order <ref type="figure">(Figure 4a</ref>). For the SymSpan task, participants were asked to retain and then recall the location of a series of red squares after completing judgments about whether a stimulus was symmetrical from left-to-right for a total of 4 trials. The set sizes, or the number of location-symmetry pairs on a given trial ranged from 2 to 5, the order of which was random for each participant. For example, on a trial with a set size of 4, participants were presented with four red squares, one at a time in a different location in a 4-by-4 square matrix and would make judgments about whether a stimulus was symmetrical between each of the red squares. At the end of each trial, participants were asked to recall the locations of the red squares ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4b)</ref>. In both tasks, scores were calculated by summing the correctly recalled items (i.e. letters or location of red squares) from the items in which all elements were recalled in the correct order, following prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">85</ref> . Participants first completed 4 practice trials with the memory items only (i.e. letters or location of red squares),15 distractor task-only practices (i.e. math or symmetry problems), and three combined practice trials, including both the memory and distractor items. The memory tasks were programmed using Python 3.9.12 and PsychoPy3 2022.2.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">105</ref> in Spyder version 5.2.2 106 and the task scripts can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/sokolhessnerlab/rcs. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Examples of the Operation Span (a) and the Symmetry Span (b) tasks. In both tasks, participants recalled a series of memory items while solving distractor problems. In the operation span, a series of 3-7 letters is displayed with each letter separated by a simple math problem and a suggested solution. In the symmetry span, a series of 2-5 red squares in a 4x4 matrix were displayed with each red square image separated by a symmetry judgement. Participants received feedback after each recall on both the number of memory items correctly recalled and the number of errors made on the distractor problems. This task was adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">85</ref> and programmed using PsychoPy3 2022.2.5 105 in Spyder version 5.2.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">106</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Working Memory Task Data Quality</head><p>Similar to previous research using complex span tasks 109 participants were included in the analysis if their overall accuracy on the math problems (OSpan) and symmetry ratings (SymSpan) were 85% or higher. This criterion is to ensure that participants were not trading off accuracy between solving the math (and symmetry) problems and remembering the letters (and red squares). Of the 124 participants, 9 did not pass the scoring criteria for the OSpan task and 14 did not pass the scoring criteria for the SymSpan task. Two additional participants did not complete either of the complex span tasks due to task difficulty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaires</head><p>After participants completed the two rounds of the gambling task and the working memory tasks, they completed a post-task questionnaire to assess their subjective experiences throughout the task including their overall motivation and the extent to which the two rounds of the task felt independent.</p><p>Participants also completed the 10-item Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) 86 to assess individual differences in the habitual use of cognitive reappraisal and suppression. Because the cognitive strategy in this study involved taking a new perspective which is most consistent with a cognitive reappraisal (relative to suppression) strategy, we primarily focused on the questionnaire's subscale measuring the habitual use of cognitive reappraisal. We used responses from the ERQ to examine individual differences in the extent to which temporal context effects were mitigated with the cognitive strategy and the subjective ratings of difficulty and frequency of following strategy instructions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaires Data Quality</head><p>Of the 124 participants, only two did not respond to all 10 questions on the ERQ and are subsequently excluded from analyses involving ERQ. All other questionnaires were completed by all 124 participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis: Logistic regression models</head><p>To examine whether the effects of recent events on risky choice behavior were mitigated in the strategy condition relative to the control condition, we fit generalized linear regression models to the risky binary choice data (coded as 0 = safe choice, 1 = risky choice) with a logit link function, using the "lme4" package 107 in R version 4.2.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">108</ref> . Due to the structure of our decision-making task in which all trials within a single run share a similar mean expected value, monetary values were correlated from one trial to the next. Such collinearity across trials prevented us from using both trial-level and previous trial regressors in the same regression. Instead, we took a conservative two-step approach in which we first estimated the extent to which trial-level events (e.g. risky gain amountt, where t represents current trial) accounted for risk-taking behavior (choicet) and including a random intercept for each participant. In the second step, we examined whether temporal context effects on risky choice changed as a function of condition by holding the parameter estimates for the effects of trial-level regressors constant at their previously estimated values while adding new regressors (e.g. outcomet-1) whose coefficients we then estimated (this approach is conceptually identical to running a second set of regressions on the residuals of the first). This procedure allows the new regressors to attempt to account for variance not explained by current trial-level factors and was executed with the "offset" argument in the "glmer" function <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">107</ref> . Dummy variables (coded as 1 when present and -1 when not) were used to measure categorical variables including gambling task round and condition, while covariates including complex span, ERQ, and condition difficulty and frequency ratings were directly included. All dummy variables and covariates were estimated as fixed effects.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Choice set structure.
