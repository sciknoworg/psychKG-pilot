			<abstract>
				<p>The COVID-19 pandemic required the deployment of crisis management teams (CMTs) on an unprecedented scale. Due to their high level of responsibility and wide-ranging decisionmaking authority, the enduring resilience and health of CMT members is essential-yet, during pandemics they are permanently challenged. We tested six hypotheses based on the Job Demands-Resources model with 219 CMT members. In our preregistered analyses, we found most of the expected associations: Between demands and strain, moderated by leisure time resources, between resources and work engagement, as well as between strain and engagement and outcome measures such as evaluations of CMT members&apos; performance and quitting intention. Furthermore, we explore how the pandemic has changed from experts&apos; perspectives, describe lessons learned, and derive practical recommendations and suggestions for future research. Particularly, promoting specific resources should allow CMTs to buffer negative effects of unavoidable demands, and promote the long-term viability of these key crisis management entities.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In response to the massive strain of COVID-19 for societies, initial descriptive analyses and qualitative interviews had been conducted with crisis management teams (CMTs; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fasth et al.;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Klinger et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Thielsch et al., 2021)</ref>, revealing quite specific demands, such as continuously high workload or personal affectedness (e.g., because friends and family might become infected), but also certain resources that were helpful for CMT members. However, such analyses mainly focus on the first months after the pandemic had started. Two years later, the pandemic is still virulent, and infection levels are higher than ever before. Further problems have emerged such as "corona fatigue" and protests of antivaccinationists.</p><p>In this study, we address implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for CMTs after two years of continuous work. Using the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model as a framework (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2017)</ref>, we examine specific strains and resources of CMT members, validating and extending earlier qualitative findings with quantitative data. As general objective, we seek to derive conclusions on how operational readiness of CMTs can be maintained in longer-lasting crises, and which interventions might be helpful. This paper contains three main contributions: First, we successfully apply the JD-R framework to pandemic crisis management. We examine the impact of pandemic demands and strain on CMT members' reactions, such as their satisfaction with their performance and their quitting intention, and consider mitigating effects of various resources. Second, we describe how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed from the perspective of CMT members and what differences emerged in later phases compared to the initial phase and the pandemic in general. Thereby, we add a quantitative investigation to the so far mainly qualitative assessments of CMT work. Finally, we complement the quantitative analyses with exploratory data on lessons learned, yielding valuable practical implications for the training and management of CMTs. While the COVID-19 pandemic might be currently seen as rather untypical situation, crises with higher temporal and spatial impact are more likely in the future, not only due to pandemics but also due increasingly dramatic consequences of climate change (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Schulman, 2022)</ref> and political and economic disruptions (e.g., the Russian attack on Ukraine in 2022).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Crisis Management Teams</head><p>Crisis management teams (CMTs) are multi-professional teams deployed to address the multiple challenges arising from major crises, including coordination, prevention, mitigation and response strategies. They deal with complex, highly dynamic, and often nontransparent situations that pose substantial risks to humans and the environment. CMTs are installed in organizations or at different levels of public administration (e.g., municipal, district, state or federal) and are given decision-making power to execute policy directives and safety measures. In doing so, CMT members need to interact with several groups and stakeholders (e.g., citizens, executing agencies, other CMTs, higher-level authorities) and must communicate and enforce decisions. To optimally deal with crises, CMTs are composed of members with heterogeneous experience, hierarchy/status, knowledge and backgrounds; members may be from administration and law, emergency response and medical care, logistics and supply management or press and public relations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heath, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>CMT work can be highly demanding due to time pressure and situation complexity, which can cause difficulties in communication, decision-making, and team processes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McConnell &amp; Drennan, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Weisaeth et al., 2002)</ref>. Consequently, conflict is often inevitable, leading to high psychological demands and stressful experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(McMaster &amp; Baber, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Weisaeth et al., 2002)</ref>. Usually, CMTs are deployed for only short periods until a crisis event (e.g., a storm, heavy rain, or wildfire) subsides and local units (rescue services, fire departments, local administration) no longer need higher-level control. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has required deployments of CMTs for over two years, with alternating acute and less-acute phases. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic came with new threats for which routines were lacking. CMT members themselves were affected by the threat and the countermeasures, such as physical distancing. Spatial expansion of the threat required coordination with diverse stakeholders and led to competition for scarce resources, such as medical supplies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Klinger et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Schulman, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Thielsch et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Studies with other frontline workers, like medical staff, suggest that working during a pandemic posed serious threats to mental and physical health (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Luo et al., 2020)</ref>. As CMTs are typically the central hubs of crisis management, compiling and evaluating information, coordinating measures, and anticipating future developments, management desperately suffers when CMT members perform poorly or leave the team due to strain. To examine how CMTs can ensure long-term operational readiness by maintaining healthy and motivated members, we applied the JD-R (Job Demands-Resources) framework to the CMT context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Job Demand Resource Model and Long-term Crises</head><p>The JD-R is an established model from occupational health research that emphasizes the importance of resources to counterbalance high demands. It has been successfully applied in various contexts (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Schaufeli &amp; Taris, 2014)</ref> and represents a suitable guiding framework for CMTs. According to the JD-R, demands cause health impairment. Demands require effort, which, in turn, exhausts energy reserves and leads to burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Demerouti et al., 2001</ref>). The COVID-19 pandemic has added further demands to CMTs' already stressful work: uncertainty about the pandemic's development, contact restrictions, and unprecedented workloads <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Schulman, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Thielsch et al., 2021)</ref>. We assume that the high work intensity over a long period is especially damaging, particularly since CMT members are usually neither familiar with this duration from previous missions nor have they been trained for it.</p><p>Studies with healthcare workers have shown that fighting the COVID-19 pandemic occupies them extensively and hinders them from separating work and private life, leading to stress and exhaustion <ref type="bibr">(Barello et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rapp et al., 2021)</ref>. Members of COVID-19 CMTs should have similar experiences. The long duration and volatility of the pandemic phases have made it difficult to distinguish times in which CMT work must be all-encompassing and times in which CMT work does not dominate every aspect of life. Although first responders and healthcare workers seemed to be more resilient than other occupational groups at the beginning of the pandemic, job stress and emotional exhaustion increased due to various factors and personnel characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Newman et al., 2022)</ref>. Thus, we suspect that the pandemic conditions require ongoing efforts of CMT members to compensate for the high demands. Along with the JD-R, we hypothesize: H1: The higher the experienced demands, the higher the subjective strain in terms of exhaustion scores reported.</p><p>The JD-R proposes that job resources buffer the health-impairing effect of demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2017)</ref>. For CMTs, job resources include a robust structure that functions also under adverse conditions and help CMTs to cope with unexpected demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hayes et al., 2021)</ref>. Further, high team cohesion protects against emotional demands in highrisk environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Tuckey &amp; Hayward, 2011)</ref>. In addition, COVID-19 CMT members have reported that personal resources (e.g., education, experience, time with family and friends, rest) helped to cope with demanding conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Thielsch et al., 2021)</ref>. Further, education and experience can increase CMT members ability to make sense of complex developments, leading to earlier and better reactions to demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Waller et al., 2014)</ref>. Moreover, strong social ties in the private domain can counterbalance stressful work of crisis managers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Janka et al., 2015)</ref>. Together, we expected that resources have buffering effects also in  CMTs:</p><p>H2: The relationship between demands and strain is moderated by resources, in the sense that resources reduce the influence of demands on strain.</p><p>According to the JD-R, resources also have motivating effects. They evoke increased work engagement, which positively impacts outcomes. We assume that this effect also occurs under long-term pandemic conditions. Coinciding with the job characteristics model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1976)</ref>, several resources mentioned by COVID-19 CMT members (e.g., task significance, task variety and feedback) should increase their intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Thielsch et al., 2021)</ref>. Strong team cohesion is assumed to satisfy psychological needs for relatedness, which should also contribute to CMT members' intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gagné &amp; Deci, 2005)</ref>. Strong personal resources should be motivating, as they increase CMT members' perception of being meaningful to other team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hertel et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Further, resources that enable recovery enhance the willingness to exert oneself (ten Brummelhuis &amp; Bakker, 2012). In COVID-19 CMTs, leisure time resources fulfill this function. Finally, visible success in managing the pandemic is another motivator <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Thielsch et al., 2021)</ref>. Overall, we hypothesize:</p><p>H3: The more resources CMT members experience, the higher their subjective job engagement.</p><p>Resources produce their motivating effect when a certain level of challenging demands is present, in other words, resources "become particularly useful when needed" <ref type="bibr">(Bakker &amp; Demerouti 2017, p. 275)</ref>. However, as CMTs work to de-escalate crises and reduce demands, we hypothesize that persisting demands create frustration and hamper resources' motivating potential. During the pandemic, several demands have hindered CMTs from doing their job effectively: Conflicts between politicians and experts or between central and local authorities have not been resolved <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Christensen &amp; Laegreid, 2020)</ref>; governments have not learned lessons and have repeated earlier mistakes <ref type="bibr">(Fedele &amp; Porter, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Powell, 2022)</ref>; and pandemic fatigue has emerged, making the public less willing to follow rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Haktanir et al., 2021)</ref>. We suspect that in the face of persisting demands, CMTs feel helpless and ineffective despite their resources, which weakens the resources' motivational impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4: The relationship between resources and engagement is moderated by demands, in</head><p>the sense that demands reduce the influence of resources on engagement.</p><p>Finally, we propose that similar to other emergency contexts and in crisis work in general (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gregg et al., 2022)</ref>, strain and work engagement are central variables for desirable individual outcomes. The more strained a CMT member is, the less energy he or she can mobilize to perform as required in crisis management. The concept of work engagement includes persistence in the face of difficulties, enthusiasm, and the ability to fully focus on the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schaufeli et al., 2002)</ref>. These aspects are vital in managing a crisis as complex and as threatening as the pandemic. Hence, we hypothesize:   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>To investigate our research questions and hypotheses, we conducted a preregistered (https://aspredicted.org/K8P_PWG) 1 online survey in German and English. The study procedure including a codebook with all items and instructions is depicted in the online supplement [URL will be made freely accessible after the review, can be found for review at https://www.dropbox.com/s/ky9v5a09zqbyeiv/Demands_resources_crisis_managers_Data_C ode_Codebook.zip?dl=0]. It also includes information regarding sample composition, descriptive item statistics and internal consistencies of the measurement instruments. Strain was measured with the OLBI scale, shortened from eight items to seven <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Demerouti et al., 2003)</ref>. Additionally, strain was measured using one general item from <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Thielsch et al. (2021)</ref>. Engagement and work motivation were measured with a modified nine-item short version of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Schaufeli et al., 2006)</ref>, in which we replaced one item with another item from the long version due to a better fit to the CMT context. Additionally, overall motivation was measured using a global assessment item we constructed.</p><p>Participants evaluated the outcomes of CMT work using two items on satisfaction with their own work and with work of the crisis management team from Thielsch et al.</p><p>(2021) and using four items we created on the overall assessment of their own performance, the overall performance of the CMT, the overall capability of the CMT, and their intention to quit the CMT. Of these four items, the first three were assessed with a six-point scale (1 = "very good," 2 = "good," 3 = "satisfactory," 4 = "adequate," 5 = "poor," 6 = "unsatisfactory"), while the fourth was assessed on a seven-point Likert scale (1 = "never" to 7 = "always").</p><p>In addition, lessons learned were assessed with an adapted seven-item scale based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Thielsch and Hadzihalilovic (2020)</ref> and one additional open question on best practices.</p><p>Further, effective behaviors of CMTs were assessed with 12 items based on the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Thielsch et al. (2021)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outbreak</head><p>We asked CMT members to weight experienced demands and resources during their work ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). The following aspects received the highest ratings in their category.</p><p>Demands: Among the three general characteristics of the situation that were queried, unpredictability of further developments stood out (M = 4.32, SD = 1.77). From the four problems with stakeholders, counterproductive behavior by higher-level authorities and agencies was rated most demanding (M = 3.98, SD = 2.08). Regarding personal workload, double burdens due to additional duties besides the CMT were particularly demanding (M = 5.06, SD = 1.81). Resources: Among seven queried job resources, trustful and professional teamwork received the highest rating (M = 5.55, SD = 1.34), and within the category of leisure time resources, support from family and friends was most important (M = 5.19, SD = 1.59). Further, participants stated that a sense of responsibility was the most relevant personal resource (M = 5.85, SD = 1.15). 2 2 Exploratively conducted one-way ANOVAs indicated significant mean differences among both the categories of demands and resources. For demands, two-sided post hoc t-tests revealed that problems inside the CMT were rated as significantly less impactful than personal demands (t(416.76) = 7.00, p &lt; .001, d = 0.67), general characteristics of the situation (t(427.57) = 6.69, p &lt; .001, d = 0.64), and problems with stakeholders (t(434.91) = 4.41, p &lt; .001, d = 0.42). On the other hand, Open questions regarding further resources and demands yielded problems with antivaccinationists as only new aspect. Note. A seven-point Likert scale was used (1 = "not at all" to 7 = "very much"). N = 214-219.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis Testing</head><p>To test hypotheses H1-H4, we computed two multiple regression analyses in which overall demands, overall resources, and their interaction term were considered as predictors of strain and work engagement, respectively. In line with H1, overall demands were positively associated with strain (β = 0.99, p = .010, f 2 = .55). Mixed findings occurred with respect to H2. Overall, resources did not moderate this relationship (β = -0.07, p = .374, f 2 &lt; .01). Yet, a separate analysis of each category of resources (instead of the overall measure) indicated a significant moderation effect of leisure time resources (β = -0.13, p = .015, f 2 = .03), confirming H2 for this category. Further, analyses confirmed H3, showing that overall resources were positively related to work engagement (β = 0.53, p = .049, f 2 = .36). In personal resources were weighted significantly higher than leisure time resources (t(382.39) = 3.67, p &lt; .001, d = 0.35).</p><p>contrast, H4 had to be rejected because overall demands did not moderate this relationship (β = 0.05, p = .453, f 2 &lt; .01), nor did the single categories of demands.</p><p>Finally, H5 and H6 were tested with further multiple regressions, with strain and work engagement considered as predictors. Work engagement was positively associated with participants' satisfaction with their performance (β = 0.39, p &lt; .001, f 2 = .34) and selfassessed grade for their performance (β = 0.25, p &lt; .001, f 2 = .11), and negatively related to quit intention (β = -0.18, p = .002, f 2 = .05). These findings fully support H5. In line with H6, strain was negatively related to satisfaction with participants' performance (β = -.17, p &lt; .001, f 2 = .18) and positively related to quit intention (β = 0.41, p &lt; .001, f 2 = .38). Contrary to H6, it was not related to the self-assessed grade for participants' performance (β = 0.08, p = .086, f 2 = .04).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CMT Members' Perception of the Pandemic Situation</head><p>Early in the pandemic, the seven-day incidence (new COVID-19 cases in the last seven days per 100,000 people) in Germany/Western Europe rarely exceeded 45. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> At the time of the study, the seven-day incidence in the respondents' CMT jurisdiction was more than 20 times higher (M = 962.62, SD = 564.06). CMT members indicated how they perceived the pandemic in terms of (1) the pandemic in general and <ref type="formula">2</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managing Pandemics -Lessons Learned</head><p>We also asked CMT members to summarize their work experiences by rating the effectiveness of different work behaviors and by evaluating their learning experiences <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table   2</ref>). These results confirm previous findings on the importance of structured CMT work, good communication, and problem-solving skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Thielsch et al., 2021)</ref>. Further, similar to the beginning of the pandemic, CMT members reported valuable learning experiences that can be transferred to other crisis situations. Regarding best practices, qualitative analyses revealed that important factors for effective CMT work include the use of work structuring tools (e.g.,</p><p>to-do-lists, Eisenhauer matrix) and digital applications (e.g., video conferencing software), the ability to make decisions quickly, and high team spirit <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table C2</ref> in the online supplement). Note. A seven-point Likert scale was used (1="not at all" to 7="very much" for effectiveness and 1="do not agree at all" to 7="totally agree" for learning). N = 205-209. No significant differences appeared in the learning experiences between persons with and without CMT training regarding perceived competence acquisition and expected transferability, but differences were found in the global assessment: Persons without CMT training stated that they had learned significantly more (M = 5.71 vs. 5.27, t(200.63) = -2.32, p = 0.022, d = .32).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study investigated how COVID-19 CMT members successfully accomplished their work after an untypically long period of deployment. CMTs' persistent adverse work environment underlines the need for a detailed understanding of their members' health and motivation. Thus, we applied the JD-R framework on the CMT context. As expected, a high level of demands was related to high strain (H1). This emphasizes the health-impairing effect of demands and corresponds with research on other professions whose members worked on the frontline against the pandemic (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Luo et al., 2020)</ref>. According to our hypothesis, leisure time resources buffered the effect of demands (H2), but job resources and personal resources did not. This partly contradicts research emphasizing the buffering effect of job resources like cohesion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tuckey &amp; Hayward, 2011)</ref>. The conservation of resources theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hobfoll et al., 2018)</ref> implies that the availability of time for leisure activities becomes especially important when free time is scarce. Thus, leisure time is likely important as this is the case for CMTs, with extra burdens and unpredictable developments. This rationale also matches our assumption that a lack of separation between work and private life is particularly stressful (see <ref type="bibr">Barello et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rapp et al., 2021</ref> The results demonstrate that the JD-R model fits the CMT context and that health and motivation, the two aspects we used to operationalize operational readiness, are relevant to successful CMT work. We propose that balancing high but still acceptable demands and strong resources is required for long-term operational readiness. Two approaches can achieve such a balance: Reducing demands that hinder CMTs' work and creating a high level of resources (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hannah et al., 2009)</ref>. As new demands emerged during the pandemic that were beyond the scope of even top-performing CMTs, building strong resources is critical.</p><p>Importantly, the process of creating resources can be started before a crisis (e.g., by training enough personnel, preparing shift plans, doing team building). Yet, the process of reducing demands is more reactive, as it depends strongly on the actual demands that arise.</p><p>In sum, the situation for CMTs after two years of pandemic entails positive and negative aspects: For the positive, CMTs seem to have found viable ways to deal with the exceptional situation. Despite the Omicron variant, which caused the highest numbers of infections so far, scientific and experiential knowledge made it easier to find adequate</p><p>responses. An indicator that CMTs have adjusted to the situation is that CMT-internal problems were rated least relevant compared to other demands. Here, our findings again confirm that structured work processes, transparent communication, and effective problemsolving behavior were seen as important for successful CMT work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Uitdewilligen &amp; Waller, 2018</ref>).</p><p>On the negative side, workload and strain were reported to similar levels as in spring 2020, and CMTs were still facing the same problems (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Thielsch et al., 2021)</ref>. This could have several reasons: First, the pandemic is still highly dynamic. Future development is unclear, which creates uncertainty. Second, our demographic data shows that about half of the respondents had not received any CMT training. After two years, this should be better.</p><p>Further, the high reported learning experiences are partly rooted in this deficit <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>.</p><p>Third, societal and political responses to the pandemic were creating new difficulties: The population is less willing to comply with measures, governments and authorities continuously issue new, sometimes contradictory regulations, and too little has been learned from past mistakes (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hakantir et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Powell, 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>According to our findings, public authorities or private organizations who appoint CMTs should strive to establish a favorable work environment, characterized by few demands that interfere with work and strong resources. We recommend first identifying possible needs for action, using as orientation the demands and resources described in this study. Additionally, as a resource's value depends on individual preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Halbesleben et al., 2014)</ref>, CMT members should be included in this process; they should be asked what they need to do their work properly. Authorities and organizations should furthermore ensure highquality CMT training for all who will potentially be on a CMT. Such training is essential <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(McConnell &amp; Drennan, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Thielsch et al., 2021)</ref> and imparts problem-solving skills (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Uitdewilligen &amp; Waller, 2018)</ref>, which helps CMTs reduce demands on their own during operations. Simultaneously, other efficient project management techniques can be employed, such as clearly defining strategic goals, coherently prioritizing tasks and effectively structuring meetings. Innovative approaches can help to deal with high demands, such as using digital tools or agile methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Koch &amp; Schermuly, 2021)</ref> and core findings of team science, especially for promoting team resilience and team well-being (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Traylor et al., 2020</ref>).</p><p>Further, authorities, organizations and CMT leaders should enable CMT members to take breaks and pursue leisure activities. Our results suggest that resources like good team cohesion cannot compensate for insufficient leisure time. Hence, teams need a well-structured shift system with redundancies in all positions, which requires a large group of trained personnel. However, from our experience, CMT members may not seek out breaks. Thus, CMT leaders should strongly encourage breaks and be good role models themselves. CMT leaders must emphasize that through this promotion of resources, members can buffer the negative effects of the situational demands themselves. Several additional specific suggestions for CMT work are described in our qualitative precursor study (see <ref type="bibr">Thielsch et al., 2021, pp. 175 to 180)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, as the worldwide costs of the COVID-19 pandemic are estimated to be in the trillions of dollars, due to premature mortalities and economic damages (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barai &amp; Dhar, 2021)</ref>, even seemingly small measures in crisis management can strongly help mitigate these burdens and reduce the loss of life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research</head><p>Our results must be interpreted against the background of some limitations, which also reveal opportunities for future research: First, generalizability of the findings might be restricted as the sample came primarily from German-speaking countries and surrounding European countries, which are comparatively rich with large healthcare systems. Replication studies in other areas would be interesting (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gregg et al., 2022)</ref>. Second, no central directory exists for all deployed COVID-19 CMTs and their characteristics (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Klinger et al., 2022)</ref>, and CMTs were rarely set up in small and medium-sized enterprises <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fasth et al., 2022)</ref>. Thus, it is difficult to estimate how representative our sample was for the whole population. We can only assume that our broad targeting of respondents provided a valid data basis, future studies should verify this.</p><p>Third, our study was cross-sectional, which makes it difficult to identify causal effects and effective interventions. Future experimental or longitudinal studies should be conducted based on our findings and could test, for example, which resource-building interventions are particularly valuable. Finally, it could be promising to illuminate the work of CMTs from a 360° perspective, capturing not only the views of the actors themselves but also the views of higher-level (political) authorities and the various individuals/organizations affected by the CMTs' actions. Additionally, although methodologically costly, the processes and outcomes of the current study should be examined at the team level of entire CMTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gregg et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>With an unpredictable virus, emerging conflicts, and a seemingly never-ending crisis,</p><p>CMT work during the COVID-19 pandemic is highly demanding. However, CMTs are not defenseless against these conditions: Their performance can be maintained by resources like collegial cohesion, training, or recreational activities. Further crises with the characteristics of a pandemic (e.g., long durations, volatile dynamics, unclear legal frameworks) are to be expected, whether they are caused by wars, migration flows, or climate change. Thus, we suggest that strong CMT resources should be built up in advance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>H5:The higher the job engagement, the better the reported outcomes of CMT work.

Of the 219 CMT members included in the analyses, 74% were male and 26% were female; average age was 45.14 years (SD = 10.91, Min = 20, Max = 66). The sample included CMT members from various deployment levels with different roles within the crisis team; 33% had leadership positions and 54% completed a CMT training (see online supplement). At the time of the survey, individuals had been on a COVID-19 CMT for, on average, over 21 months (M = 21.45, SD = 5.5). Procedure. At the beginning of the study, we informed participants about the involved researchers, anonymity, data protection and processing, voluntariness, procedure and study duration. The survey included five sections: (1) a self-report of personal data (age, gender, education level) and experiences in CMT work, (2) questions about the current COVID-19 situation and current work in the COVID-19 CMT, (3) an assessment of demands, resources and successes in one's current CMT work, (4) overall evaluation and outcomes of the CMT work and (5) lessons learned regarding participants' own skill acquisition and best practices as well as helpful tools in COVID-19 CMT work. The questionnaire was online between December 14, 2021, and March 16, 2022; most participants took part from mid-January through February 2022. The median time participants spent answering all questions was 16.42 minutes (M = 19.32 min, SD = 12.98 min). Measures. Unless otherwise specified, participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement with each item of the following questionnaires on seven-point Likert scales. Based on the results of Thielsch et al. (2021), we created 28 items to measure four categories of demands (general characteristics of the situation, problems within the CMT, problems with stakeholders, personal workload) and three categories of resources (job resources, leisure time resources, personal resources).</figDesc></figure>

Responses highlighted the duration and the dynamic development of the pandemic during the Omicron wave. Dynamic development was mentioned more often as a specific characteristic in winter 2022 (χ 2 (1) = 31.4, p &lt; .001, φ = .27), while less frequent responses included novelty of the threat (χ 2 (1) = 3 Based on data from Germany, France, Austria and the Netherlands between March and June 2020, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, retrieved from https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/data-daily-new-cases-covid-19-eueea-country on August 04, 202228.8, p &lt; .001, φ = .26), personal affectedness (χ 2 (1) = 17.1, p &lt; .001, φ = .20), and duration (χ 2 (1) = 8.1, p = .004, φ = .14). When directly asked for differences to the situation compared to spring 2020, participants in winter 2022 mentioned negative aspects (increasing frustration and indifference, splitting society) and positive developments (increasing digitization, improved medical care;Table C1in the online supplement). Finally, participants indicated, on average, a moderate level of strain (M = 2.82, SD = 0.95, Min = 1, Max = 5) that was comparable with 2020 (M = 2.67, SD = 0.99;<ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Thielsch et al., 2021)</ref>.</figDesc></figure>
