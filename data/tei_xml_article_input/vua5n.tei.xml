			<abstract>
				<p>Changing complex behaviours such as tax evasion may require several behavioural interventions, or nudges. We developed a tailored compound intervention approach to increase employers&apos; payroll tax compliance in Estonia&apos;s construction industry. First, we used anthropological methods to gain insights into the decision processes of employers and employees in the industry (Study 1, N=16). These insights were combined with behavioural decision-making principles to design an intervention e-mail with the aim to strengthen perceived risks and weaken descriptive norms of non-compliance as well as to strengthen collaborative and weaken adversarial construal of tax authority. The compound intervention was tested using a three-armed non-blinded randomised controlled trial (Study 2, N=4770) involving all employers whose declared wages were below 70% of the industry&apos;s average. The intervention significantly increased declared payroll taxes by 5.1% to 6.1% on average across the two treated groups over a 3-month follow-up period (p&lt; .0001) and was therefore effective. It remains unclear which constituent nudges of our compound intervention were crucial for this effect. These findings suggest that the compound intervention approach may be a feasible avenue for designing effective interventions in under-studied contexts.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Effective tax collection is key to a well-functioning state. Tax evasion is thus a major policy concern in much of OECD. In Estonia, the government is estimated to have missed out on 4.9% of its budget or 1.44% of GDP due to the shadow economy (Maksu-ja <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Tolliamet, 2017)</ref>. One promising approach to combating tax evasion involves applying nudges, or small interventions designed to leverage insights about how people behave (for an overview, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blackwell, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hallsworth, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hallsworth, List, Metcalfe, &amp; Vlaev (2017)</ref>). This approach, however, has yielded mixed results.</p><p>Most field experiments employing nudges towards tax compliance have tested the effects of nudges in either non-deterrence or deterrence approach framework. Nondeterrence nudges have targeted social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Blumenthal &amp; Christian, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Castro &amp; Scartascini, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fellner, Sausgruber, &amp; Traxler, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hallsworth et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hasseldine, Hite, James, &amp; Toumi, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">John &amp; Blume, 2018)</ref>, moral persuasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ariel, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fellner et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hasseldine et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Torgler, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wenzel, 2006)</ref>, and reciprocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Blumenthal &amp; Christian, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Castro &amp; Scartascini, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hallsworth et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hasseldine et al., 2007)</ref>. Deterrence nudges have targeted awareness of legal sanctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hasseldine et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Iyer, Reckers, &amp; Sanders, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schwartz &amp; Orleans, 1967)</ref>, and the perceived risk of getting caught or being audited <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ariel, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fellner et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gangl, Torgler, Kirchler, &amp; Hofmann, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hasseldine et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Iyer et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kleven, Knudsen, Kreiner, Pedersen, &amp; Saez, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pomeranz et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schwartz &amp; Orleans, 1967)</ref>. While some of these studies have demonstrated significant improvements in tax compliance, others have not <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hallsworth, 2014)</ref> or have found an intervention to backfire by reducing tax compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ariel, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gangl et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mendoza, Wielhouwer, &amp; Kirchler, 2017)</ref>. Therefore, policy-makers may find it difficult to design evidence-informed interventions that would increase the likelihood of tax compliance.</p><p>One reason for mixed results in previous trials may be their relatively narrow focus on targeting a single underlying psychological mechanism at a time. While such focus makes it easier to infer causes of observed effects, it may not be optimal for maximising intervention effectiveness. Each individual psychological mechanism tends to have only a small and context-dependent effect on a complex behavioural pattern such as tax compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Funder &amp; Ozer, 2019)</ref>. Meanwhile, there could be further interactions between different nudges, so that a combination of them enhances (or offsets) their individual effects. The existing evidence describing the effects of single nudges is therefore insufficient for designing interventions that seek to amplify effectiveness by combining several nudges. In addition, policy-makers need a systematic way to combine different nudges into context-sensitive effective interventions. To this end, we propose a tailored compound intervention (TCI) approach which involves combining several nudges based on an analysis of the relevant complex behaviour.</p><p>Akin to a personalised combination of medications, TCIs facilitate behavioural change by combining several active ingredients (i.e., nudges) to simultaneously target several mechanisms underlying one problematic behaviour (i.e., tax evasion). Designing tailored compound interventions involves two steps. First, a working model needs to be constructed that identifies potential intervention targets among the decisions that the target group makes, consciously or otherwise, when engaging in the problematic behaviour. Second, a compound intervention needs to be designed by selecting which of the identified targets can be addressed with a feasible combination of available nudges.</p><p>This approach does not guarantee finding the most efficient combination of "active ingredients". However, for complex behaviours and in circumstances where there is little evidence on the effectiveness of individual nudges, a theory-based TCI is a useful starting point for creating evidence-based interventions.</p><p>In the present article, we assess the feasibility of the TCI approach by applying it to increase payroll tax compliance in the construction sector in Estonia. Payroll taxeshere considered in a broad sense, covering all labour taxes and contributions either payed by the employer or withheld on behalf of the employee -are a complex and understudied aspect of tax compliance. Evidence from prior field experiments targeting the behaviour of individual taxpayers may not generalise to the behaviour of employers and companies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hallsworth, 2014)</ref>. At present, it is unclear whether nudges can affect employers' tax behaviour -out of five studies reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hallsworth (2014)</ref>, only two reported significant positive effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ortega &amp; Sanguitti, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pomeranz et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we will focus on payroll tax compliance in the construction industry which has been among the top shadow economy concern areas for tax authorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(OECD, 2012)</ref>. To apply the TCI approach for reducing payroll tax evasion, we first developed a working model of payroll tax compliance in the construction industry by combining existing literature with an anthropological study of the target group, summarised as Study 1 of this paper. We then designed a compound intervention and conducted a randomised controlled trial to assess its effectiveness, presented as Study 2 of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1: Identifying intervention targets</head><p>To establish a working model of the decision-making processes governing employer's compliance with payroll taxes in Estonia, we combined insights from the psychology of tax compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kastlunger, Lozza, Kirchler, &amp; Schabmann, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kirchler, Muelbacher, Kastlunger, &amp; Wahl, 2010)</ref> with an empirical study of representatives of the industry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Fifteen semi-structured in-depth interviews with 16 interviewees were conducted in January and February 2018. The volunteer sample was a cross-section of the population in terms of gender, age, tenure, size of company, status, and mother tongue (see Appendices A and B). The interviews were recorded and transcribed by the interviewers, assuring that the interviewees remained anonymous to the remaining research group as well as representatives of the Estonian Tax and Customs Board (TCB). The transcriptions were analysed to identify major narrative themes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006)</ref> characterising the target group's decision-making. The analysis was conducted by the corresponding author, triangulating the results with other co-authors, including the interviewers. The emerging themes were also situated with psychological models of tax compliance and nudge interventions yielding a working model of the tax compliance decision (see Appendix C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Four major themes emerged from the interviews.</p><p>1. Not paying pays off. The employers characterised tax compliance in terms of a costbenefit analysis. In order to survive the competitive market, especially that of subcontracts, employers felt forced to take up projects that have low to no profit margins.</p><p>Within this framework, evading taxes becomes a way to "save" money so long as the risk of getting caught is considered low.</p><p>2. Not paying is the norm. We found the sub-contractors deemed undeclared salaries the norm: "I don't know any company where the whole salary is paid officially" (Interviewee 5). A few respondents also thought that the shadow economy is in the decline.</p><p>3. Unfair government. Several interviewees found the government overly controlling of the entrepreneurs while allowing politicians to spend irrationally. Others had either had a negative experience with a government agency (e.g., TCB or the police) or did not think they were receiving enough public services in return (e.g., long healthcare waiting lists).</p><p>This led to a sense of unfairness: paying tax was seen as handing out money in order to employ "an army of bureaucrats" with no reciprocated benefit. 4. Red tape. Several employers suggested that considering the burdening amount of bureaucracy, some agreements and financial deals are easier done "unofficially": "Generally, there's the understanding in the construction industry that since the tax system 1 is so complicated, it's better to avoid it altogether." (Interviewee 10).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The qualitative analysis suggested that low tax compliance in the construction industry is facilitated by the hierarchical and asymmetrical power structures between the main contractors and subcontracts that undermine fair competition, and a strong sense of disappointment in the government and the public sector. Combining these themes with principles of tax compliance psychology yielded a working model of the target group's decisions processes regarding tax evasion, summarised in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Nudging construction industry towards payroll tax compliance</head><p>We selected four intervention targets out of the eight described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> for the TCI tested in Study 2. The selection was based on expert judgements of the authors, relying on existing evidence of nudging effectiveness as well as evidence collected in Study 1.</p><p>More specifically, we evaluated each element in the model presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fellner et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hasseldine et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pomeranz et al., 2013)</ref>. Similarly, descriptive norms have been suggested to improve compliance by 1.3 to 5.1 percentage points <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Del Carpio, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hallsworth et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hasseldine et al., 2007)</ref>. Finally, altering the construal of tax authority has been recommended on conceptual grounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kirchler, Hoelzl, &amp; Wahl, 2008)</ref>, although more empirical evidence is needed to estimate its effectiveness. We decided to include it since the theme strongly emerged from the data collected in Study 1.</p><p>The four remaining potential targets, by contrast, were deemed not to meet one or more of the criteria. We decided against weakening perceived benefits as we could not change the conditions in the industry that give rise to this perception. We decided against strengthening injunctive norms to avoid the risk of backfiring. Tax compliance is more common among larger companies and less common among smaller companies that depend on the larger ones for revenue. Therefore, a message highlighting the larger companies as role models may further aggravate the sense of injustice felt by the smaller companies. Finally, we also decided against reducing perceived effort or improving perceived ease of tax compliance given that these decision features were deemed not have a sufficiently large effect on payroll tax compliance behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Intervention</head><p>In collaboration with both the TCB and the interviewers, we designed two versions of an e-mail which included several manipulations addressing the four targets identified in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We chose e-mails as our medium since it is used in most communication between government agencies and citizens in Estonia while paper letters are rare. The two e-mail versions differed in the description of potential penalties, which was implicit in one and explicit in the other (see Appendix D for the translation of the e-mails together with the intervention targets). The primary target was to strengthen perceived risks: the e-mail announced new initiatives including upcoming audits to combat undeclared payroll taxes (though not strictly related to the intervention), suggested that the recipient may be selected for the audit, and implied the audit may be avoided through increased compliance. To further bolster a sense of accountability, the e-mails were addressed to the board of management, greeted them by their full names and used the company name in the body of the e-mail.</p><p>Additionally, the letters weakened the adversarial construal of the tax authority by stating that assuring fair competition is a priority for the TCB -a common concern for the entrepreneurs as well as the TCB. Furthermore, the letters strengthened the collaborative construal of the tax authority by exemplifying the investment value of payed payroll taxes. The letters stated that the overall lost revenue is about the same as the combined annual budgets of ambulance and fire services -of the two services that have enjoyed the highest levels of public trust in Estonia <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kivirähk, 2018)</ref>. Fourth, the letters weakened descriptive norms by stating that 92% of employees receive their salaries with due taxes deducted 2 . All the facts in the letters were accurate and reflected our best knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The sample included employers in the construction industry according to the Estonian Classification of Economic Activities' code. Eligibility criteria were assessed by an analyst in the TCB. We included employers who, in the period of October 2017 until March 2018, had declared payments to their employees that were lower than 70% of the average in the construction industry over the same time period. This criterion is used by TCB to calculate their risk factor for tax evasion. We excluded employers who, at the time of calculating the 70% cut-off, were audited by TCB. Among the remaining pool of employers, intervention groups' chances of being audited were the same as for the control group. Companies' meeting the eligibility criteria were pseudonymised at the TCB and sent to the corresponding author. See <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> for details.</p><p>Procedures E-mails were sent to two intervention groups. The control group did not receive an email, and thus is considered as the business as usual (BAU) group. To heighten the chances of the e-mail to be read, we sent all its recipients also the following mobile text message: "The Tax and Customs Board has sent you a message to [email address]". We were not able to determine whether the recipients read the text messages or the e-mails.</p><p>Both, the e-mails and the text messages were sent using TCB's in-house software, IRIS,  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Study profile. CONSORT 2010 flowchart. randomisation within its system, we could not run a blinded trial. Instead, the TCB provided us with a pseudonymised list of employers, which we randomly allocated to the two intervention groups and the BAU group. The randomisation of the employers (1:1:1) was done by the corresponding author using RStudio version 1.0.136 running on R version x64 3.3.1 and the package randomizeR <ref type="bibr">(Uschner, Schindler, Hilgers, &amp; Heussen, 2018</ref>).</p><p>An information phone line was set up by the TCB with a number provided in the e-mails.</p><p>The call centre personnel were aware of the trial but unaware of its contents and blinded to the randomisation. They were instructed to consult the clients as usual, without revealing the experiment, to avoid affecting recipients' behaviour. In order to test the impact of the e-mails on TCB's customer services, we ran a pilot study with 150 employers (randomised 1:1:1, more details in Appendix E). The participants of the pilot study were excluded from the main study and their data are not included in the analyses reported in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The effect of the interventions was measured using data from TCB's routine employers' monthly payroll tax declarations. We observed declared employer social insurance contributions (social tax) as well as employee social insurance contributions (unemployment, funded pension) and personal income tax withheld from gross salaries by employers -here labelled altogether as 'payroll taxes' -adjusted for the number of full time equivalent (FTE) employees. Payroll taxes declared for the month of April and May, that is prior to intervention were considered as the baseline. We investigated the effect of the intervention on payroll taxes declared for June, July and August. The TCB provided information on the following variables: number of employees, full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, declared gross salary, social tax, unemployment insurance contribution, funded pension contribution, personal income tax.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>Our main dependent variable is the amount of payroll taxes, adjusted for the number of full-time equivalent workers, though we also ran alternative models for (log) gross earnings (FTE) and obtained qualitatively similar results (available on request). To estimate the treatment effects on payroll taxes per FTE, we used the difference-indifference approach with employer-level monthly panel data. The regression model includes time and group fixed effects and the interaction terms between the groups and the intervention (either implicit (I) or explicit (E) outcomes condition):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= + + +</formula><p>where is the dependent variable reported by firm i ( = 1 … ) in group g (BAU, implicit outcomes, explicit outcomes) for month t ( = , … , ), is the group fixed effect), captures the time trend (i.e. dummies for months), is a dummy denoting whether group g has been exposed to the intervention by time t, (e-mails were sent out in May, after tax declaration), and is an error term. We sought to estimate the values of , i.e. the coefficients for firms receiving either implicit or explicit outcomes e-mail relative to BAU while controlling for the overall time trend.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Role of the funding source</head><p>While we did cooperate with the funders when designing the study -to ensure its feasibility and applicability considering the TCB standard operating procedures -the funders had no role in the data analysis, data interpretation, or write-up of this paper.</p><p>The corresponding author had full access to the pseudonymised raw data and made the final decision to submit for publication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We first confirmed that the randomisation procedure had indeed produced comparable groups -the employers included in different arms of the study were similar in terms of number of employees and FTEs (Appendix F).</p><p>Next, we estimated the linear panel data model of tax payments both with the fixedeffects (FE) and random-effects (RE) estimator. Both models were statistically highly The results of the regression analysis <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2</ref>) reveal, first of all, the lack of statistically significant differences between the intercept for the BAU group and the implicit outcomes treatment group ( = 4.09, = 0.42) and the explicit outcomes group ( = 7.18, &lt; 0.16). This finding further confirms that the three arms of the study did not differ in their baseline tax reporting. Second, there was a clear time trend with the average amount of payroll taxes increasing from €15.54 (May) to €32.00 (August).</p><p>Finally, and most importantly, we found a positive and highly statistically significant effect for both e-mails ( = 11.95, = .0001; = 15.38, &lt; .0001). This amounts to an increase of 5.1% and 6.1%, respectively, compared to the average payroll taxes in the BAU group at the start of period (€233.30, see Appendix G). Although the effect is larger for the explicit outcomes e-mail, the difference between the two groups is not statistically significant based on the Wald test (p=0.26). To investigate the treatment effects month-by-month, we also estimate another version of the model interacting every month with the treatment groups ( ): = + + + <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> presents the results and demonstrates how statistically significant differences between the BAU and either treatment group emerged after the intervention. The effect was immediate with the explicit outcomes e-mail but more gradual with the implicit outcomes e-mail. Month-by-month estimates also suggest that the implicit outcomes group was slower to raise their payroll tax declarations compared to the explicit outcomes group, though the difference is not statistically significant as demonstrated by overlapping confidence intervals. Notes. Vertical lines indicate when the intervention took place; 95% CI shown</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Our findings suggest that the tailored compound intervention e-mails increased the amount of payroll tax declared by the employers compared to the condition where no communication was received from the tax authority. The letters significantly (p ≤ .0001) improved tax declarations per FTE employee, on average by 5.1-6.1% across the two intervention groups compared to not sending an e-mail (BAU). This effect is comparable to the results reported in previous studies. Additionally, we found that the implicit outcomes group was slower to raise the amounts declared as payroll taxes compared to the explicit outcomes group, though the differences were not statistically significant. It is also worth emphasising that our sample constituted population data for the target group (i.e. all construction firms reporting taxes below a certain level), meaning there was no uncertainty left in the statistical sense. Still, we have taken a conservative approach and treated the data as a random sample of an infinite population and correspondingly calculated standard errors for our estimates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In search of effective ways to apply behavioural insights to improve tax compliance, we proposed a tailored compound intervention approach and assessed its feasibility in improving payroll tax reporting in the Estonian construction industry. We developed a working model of the problematic behaviour integrating known psychological principles with qualitative evidence of the target group. We identified eight conceivable intervention targets of which we selected four for our intervention based on expert assessments of their likely malleability to nudges, feasibility for nudging through e-mail, and low likelihood of backfire.

We hope that the fieldworkinformed tailored compound intervention approach presented here can serve as a roadmap to build evidence in under-researched areas. To this end, the present study demonstrates several advantages of this approach. The study was conducted in a distinct context-employers' tax compliance in a specific country-for which very little evidence exists as to which psychological factors underlie the unwanted behaviours and which nudges would be effective in changing these factors. It was also not practically feasible to devise a large number of interventions testing various nudges separately, given the relatively small size of the target population. The TCI approach was helpful in this context, by providing a flexible way for constructing a working model of the underlying behaviour and supporting informed design of a compound intervention.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendices</head><p>Appendix A. Sample selection in Study 1</p><p>When selecting interviewees, we aimed to create a cross-section of the employers and employees in the construction industry in terms of gender, age, tenure, size of company, status, and mother tongue. According to the Estonian Association of Construction Entrepreneurs, most (94%) employers in the construction industry are micro enterprises</p><p>(1-4 employees, with an average of 2.3 employees). Therefore, most of the interviewees were from small companies. At the same time, we though it important to include some main contractors to capture the influence of power dynamics in the industry.</p><p>Although focussing on nudging employers' behaviour we also aimed to have a proportion of interviews with employees (somewhere between a fourth and a third), to introduce their perspective in salary negotiations. To represent views across Estonia, we chose to interview in Tallinn (the capital) as well as Tartu, Narva and Pärnu (other larger towns) where bigger construction projects are currently ongoing and thus several subcontractors are employed. In addition, we also interviewed people from the rural areas.</p><p>Since a third of Estonia's population is Russian speaking, we sought a similar balance among our interviewees. Finally, the construction industry is male dominated, so most (but not all) of our participants were male.</p><p>The potential participants were contacted by the interviewers, who having had conducted other research projects in the industry, had some contacts. Then a snowball method was used to find interviewees to match the criteria outlined above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B. Study 1 Interview Schedule</head><p>In semi-structured interviews, the interview schedule is not intended to be followed closely. Rather, it serves as a supporting material, a source of inspiration for the interviewer to guide the conversation. The interviewer adjusts their questions and prompts based on the participant's willingness and readiness to talk. If needed, vignettes are used (see below). The order of the questions and topics depends on the themes and ideas emerging in the conversation. In addition, the choice of which words or wording to use (whether more lay or more official) depends on the participant's own choice of words including slang they may introduce.</p><p>Background and warm-up  What are the biggest problems in the construction industry? If the conversation does not move to salaries and taxes after this question, the interviewer could tell a story in the lines of "I read in the papers that almost always, some of the salary is paid in cash" or "Kaupo Kolsar, the Head of Management Board at the Estonian Association of Construction Entrepreneurs, resigned from his position after being suspected in fraud (but he remained in the Board of Management)"</p><p> Why is the topic of taxes and salaries such an issue in the construction industry? Where does it come from and what causes it? (Rules of the game!)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Taxes</head><p> What do you think about our tax system? Is it fair/just? Why? Now that the system will be changed again: how does it seem? If that does not make the conversation flow, try: "They say that the new and complicated tax system increases the number of people who receive their salaries in cash. Why do they say so? Could it be the same in the construction industry? For which side -either the one who pays or the one who receives the salary -would it be more convenient to overlook the tax system? Who would win or lose out in </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scheming entrepreneurs</head><p>There are construction companies who win procurements because their offer is very low.</p><p>Later however, they get into financial trouble because they cannot manage to complete work in that low budget. They then change the name of the company and participate in other procurements. The timeline for work is often overrun because they lack the money to pay for subcontractors. Have you been in this situation where moneys get "stuck", so salaries are not paid or cannot be paid? Shoulder to shoulder principle I live in Latvia (or a friend of mine lives in Latvia and said, that…). we recently needed to do some repairs. We found someone who agreed to do it. When it came to buying the materials, the builder recommended me to go to a shop where an acquaintance of theirs was working. They said I should buy everything from that acquaintance since that would get me up to a 25% discount. It turned out that this acquaintance could add private purchases to a business's order and I could thus circumvent the VAT. I haven't heard of anything similar in Estonia: that a builder and a trader have an agreement whereby certain trustworthy clients' purchases are invoiced to an unknown company.</p></div>

Although we cannot estimate the effect of any particular constituent nudge within our compound intervention, contrasting the past backfiring effect with the present findings suggests that moral arguments may have a more favourable effect when they are not the dominant message, but instead are somewhat concealed within a broader message. This hypothesis could be worth investigating in future studies, especially in populations that convey adverse opinions towards the tax authority.Our study focussed on employers in the construction industry whose low declared salary (below 70% of the market average) indicated a risk for tax evasion. The present findings cannot therefore be generalised with certainty to more compliant employers in the same industry. Both larger and smaller effects are conceivable. On the one hand, our TCI might have an even larger effect on more compliant employers, if they are more sensitive to a nudge than the less compliant employers. On the other hand, our TCI might also have a smaller effect on more compliant employers due to regression to the mean-employers who already pay salaries closer to the market average may be less responsive to such an intervention.One inevitable limitation of the targeted compound intervention approach employed in this study is that it does not enable us to infer the effectiveness of each individual constituent nudge. Without future studies, we cannot conclude which proportions of the effects we observed can be attributed to strengthening perceived risk; weakening descriptive norm; or weakening adversarial and strengthening collaborative construal of tax authority. We also cannot establish that our combination of nudges were necessarily the best among all possible combinations. However, it is unlikely that researchers will ever be able to measure the effectiveness of all feasible combinations of different nudges targeting different behaviours of different target groups in different contexts.</figDesc><table /><note>Policy-makes therefore need an alternative way to design effective interventions that would leverage existing evidence about what is known to work as well as context-specific</note></figure>

Which of the public services are important to you? Ask this question rather broadly initially to understand what is considered as state support. If they cannot suggest anything specific, make specific suggestions, for example children's school, health insurance, job centres and see how they react.  To what extent do people think about occupational hazards and pension?
