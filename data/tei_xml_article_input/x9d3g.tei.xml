			<abstract>
				<p>At the end of high school, teenagers have to deal with their first life-changing decisions when deciding what to do after having graduated from school. For these decisions, adolescents need to be able to make good decisions. However, most schools have not implemented decision trainings into their curricula yet. A new intervention called &quot;KLUGentscheiden!&quot; was developed to train complex decision-making in high school students to close this gap. The intervention targets three key components of good decision making: envisioning one&apos;s objectives, identifying relevant alternatives, and comparing the identified alternatives by a weighted evaluation. We assumed that successfully training those decision-analytical steps should enhance selfperceived proactive decision-making skills. In addition, the training should also enhance selfassessed career choice self-efficacy. The intervention was evaluated in a pseudorandomized control study including 193 high school students. Compared to a control group, the intervention group significantly increased proactive decision-making skills and career-choice self-efficacy. Although different long-term evaluations are still pending, the KLUGentscheiden! intervention could provide an important tool to train complex decision-making in high-school students. In its essentials, it could also be applied to other career choices of young individuals, such as choosing majors, a final thesis, a job, or a field of work.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Everyone will face about one to two dozen so-called life-changing decisions in one's lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Keeney, 2020)</ref>. Life-changing decisions may concern, among other issues, choosing a job, serious health decisions, or long-term financial investments. Those decisions significantly impact how our lives are shaped <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Keeney, 2020)</ref>. Life-changing decisions are tough and challenging for decision-makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hammond et al., 1999)</ref>. They are complex, defined by their rare appearance, and therefore difficult to compare with experienced decision-making processes (e. g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2008)</ref>. Cognitive biases such as anchoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Strack et al., 1988</ref>), overconfidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cooper et al., 1988)</ref>, or social pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Asch, 1956</ref>) complicate a systematic analysis to make a choice. Furthermore, conflicts of the direct cost compared to long-term benefits make these choices difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>One of the first life-changing decisions for many individuals in many societies is "what to do after graduating from high school." Essentially, it is about which (further) educational path to take or which profession to pursue. This is not a single decision but numerous successive, interdependent decisions. Unfortunately, individuals in the 16-to-24 age group are often relatively poor decision-makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jacobs &amp; Klaczynski, 2002)</ref>, and their insufficiently thoughtthrough choices significantly impact their future careers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Keelin et al., 2009)</ref>. Thus, fostering better decision-making skills in this age group is particularly important.</p><p>Manifest indicators of suboptimal career choices at the age of adolescence are, for instance, drop-outs: In 2016, the average rate of breaking off an apprenticeship reached 26 percent in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(BMBF, 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, more than one-fourth of Germany's bachelor students and 17 percent of its master students at universities or technical colleges dropped out in 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Heublein et al., 2020)</ref>. Such high drop-out rates give reason to carefully invest in and examine adolescents' decision-making skills.</p><p>Schools and public organizations provide many opportunities to help students prepare for their upcoming life-changing decision. Examples include job application training, vocational orientation courses, short internships, and career fairs. Additionally, job centers or employment offices often offer vocation orientation consulting. High school students thus learn to reflect their strengths and interests, are sensitized to the importance of their upcoming life-changing decision, and are presented with an overwhelming number of alternatives. However, they rarely receive systematic training to help them proactively identify their individual objectives and determine which career alternatives best fit those objectives. In short, an organized approach to good decision-making for this first complex and life-changing decision.</p><p>One approach to handle the complexity of life-changing decisions is decision analysis.</p><p>Decision analysis is a cognitive approach that serves to support decision-makers in business and private life and enable them to make better decisions by using normative models proactively, and at the same time being aware of the limitations of human judgment and the practical problems of implementing a rational model in complex interrelations (e. g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abbas &amp; Howard, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bell et al., 1988)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision-analytical intervention</head><p>Decision-analytic approaches have not been implemented into official school curricula <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Beyth-Marom et al., 1991)</ref>. Thus, they have not been applied as a systematic way to improve high school students' decision-making skills. Introducing decision analysis to schools by offering decision-analytical training could support adolescents to shape their future more consciously and proactively. Therefore, we generated and validated a decision-analytical intervention called KLUGentscheiden! (German: smart decision making; henceforth: KLUG) that trains high school students in complex decision-making referring to their personal life-changing decision "what to do after graduating from high school". By teaching decision analysis, KLUG intends to supplement the various offers on experiencing interests and reflection on personal strengths made by schools and public organizations. KLUG supports students in making their own personal decisions. The decision-analytical methods offer the opportunity to address each individual decision-making situation and the different focal points of the students' interests.</p><p>In KLUG, the focus is always on the individual decisions the students are facing. Some students are still at the beginning of the sequence of early career decisions and are concerned with whether they want to study, do an apprenticeship or start working directly.</p><p>Others, for example, have already decided on a direction and are considering what they want to study. Others have already clarified the latter and are considering which university would be best for them to study. In its essentials, it could also be applied to other career choices of young individuals, such as choosing majors, final theses, a job, or a field of work (e. g. Siebert and von Nitzsch, 2020).</p><p>Although several research groups propose different avenues for decision-analytically approaching a complex decision, there is a common theoretical agreement on the cognitive steps of a decision-analytical process. Looking for this common understanding, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mellers and Locke (2007)</ref> have identified five interrelated steps to make good decisions: " Step A consists of two consecutive cognitive steps: framing a decision and envisioning one's objectives. Because the decision situation was already framed by the focus on the question "what to do after graduating from high school," the first part of STEP A, "framing," did not play an explicit role in the KLUG intervention. The intervention started with the second part of STEP A. The volitional components <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Heckhausen &amp; Gollwitzer, 1987)</ref> of making a choice [STEP D] and implementing it [STEP E] were not addressed in our intervention as the high school students had several months more to make their final choice, and the schools offer support in action planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Leventhal et al., 1965</ref>) by e. g. job application training. Thus, KLUG explicitly addresses three of the five components of good decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mellers &amp; Locke, 2007)</ref> setting the goals ("objectives"; Step A), identifying options ("alternatives", STEP B), and evaluating information and options ("evaluation", STEP C). It focuses on the cognitive and motivational components of decision-making.</p><p>The first component of KLUG, "objectives", covers envisioning a mature set of the essential individual objectives (e. g., <ref type="bibr">Ward Edwards, 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Raiffa, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Keeney, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hastie, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Larrick, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mellers &amp; Locke, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Siebert &amp; von Winterfeldt, 2020)</ref>. Such a set of individual decision objectives defines why the decision-maker is concerned about that particular decision. Therefore, it is necessary to be aware of one's individual preferences (R.</p><p>A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Howard, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bond et al. (2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bond et al. ( , 2010</ref> have shown that individuals experience difficulties articulating a complete set of relevant personal objectives for a concrete decision situation.</p><p>On average, study participants failed to envision over half of their personal objectives that they later acknowledged as relevant. That is why KLUG emphasizes elaborating a sound set of individual objectives, ranging e. g. from economic aspects such as education costs and earning potential to more soft criteria such as social respect or personal criteria as intrinsic motivation.</p><p>The second component of KLUG, "alternatives", discusses the ability to identify the relevant alternatives for one's decision (e. g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Goodwin &amp; Wright, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Keller &amp; Ho, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Larrick, 2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Siebert and Keeney (2015)</ref> show that individuals have severe difficulties identifying relevant alternatives in a field experiment. On average, study participants identified only 37 percent of personally relevant alternatives without help. More than half of the study participants could not identify the alternative they later rated best <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Keeney, 1992)</ref>. Studies show that prompting objectives leads to more and better decision alternatives (e. g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Butler &amp; Scherer, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Jungermann et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Siebert &amp; Keeney, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Siebert, 2016)</ref>. KLUG applies this approach.</p><p>The third component of KLUG, "evaluation", covers the weighted evaluation of the identified alternatives. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Keelin and Spetzler (1992)</ref>, one of the six components of a quality decision includes sound reasoning. Therefore, the right relation between costs, e. g. effort and money, to benefits, e. g. flexibility and gained knowledge have to be found <ref type="bibr">(e. g. Spetzler &amp; Staël Von Holstein, 1975)</ref>. In other words, trade-offs have to be made <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Keeney et al., 1979)</ref>. This process describes weighing the objectives according to their importance for the specific decision given the set of alternatives (e. g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bazerman &amp; Moore, 2009)</ref>. Therefore, it has to be assessed to what extent the alternatives contribute to achieving one's objectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enhancing proactive decision-making and career choice self-efficacy</head><p>The best way to evaluate the effectiveness of KLUG would be to track students' actual career decisions and their potential drop-out rates. However, due to practical and data privacy issues, this was not feasible within the scope of this study. Instead, KLUG trains high school students' ability to envision one's objectives (STEP A), to envision one's alternatives (STEP B), and to evaluate alternatives and to weigh objectives, and thereby make a choice (STEP C). We assumed that being aware of these cognitive tools and being able to apply them would increase students' self-perceived proactive decision-making skills and also their self-perceived career choice self-efficacy. We assessed those concepts before and after the intervention.</p><p>The construct of proactivity describes an individual's forward-looking, change-oriented, and self-initiated behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Grant &amp; Ashford, 2008)</ref>. The construct refers to an anticipatory approach to behavior rather than just reacting. Proactive decision-makers take responsibility and choose, in contrast to reactive decision-makers who adjust to a situation or wait for others to decide for them <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Siebert &amp; Kunz, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The KLUG intervention is designed to teach high school students decision-making and train them in decision-analytical skills. We anticipated that students receiving this training would perceive an improvement in their proactive decision-making skills after the intervention. This improvement would be greater than any in a control group that did not receive the intervention.</p><p>KLUG aims to prepare high school students for their upcoming career choice. Due to its focus on "What to do after graduation?", we assume a positive impact on students' self-perception of their career choice, which describes a person's personal belief in their ability to successfully navigate the career choice process <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ratschinski, 2014)</ref>. Thus, we hypothesize that participants' self-perceived career choice self-efficacy would increase compared to their preintervention perceptions (compared to a control group).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Materials and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The original sample consisted of 223 participants. Participants were excluded from further analysis if their scores in any dependent variables deviated three or more standard deviations from the mean between the first and the second time point. We assumed that participants with such high deviance in their scores did not take the self-assessment seriously. However, the hypothesized results did not change significantly when including those individuals in the analyses. This resulted in an exclusion of 30 participants. The final sample consisted of 193 students (89 females) from different classes and nationalities with a mean age of 17.1 (SD = 1.82) years. 152 participants (78 females) were included in the experimental group that received the KLUG intervention, and 41 participants (11 females) served as a control group without receiving an intervention. The intervention and control groups did not differ in terms of age (p&gt;.44) and the proportion of Germans to foreigners (p&gt;.80). However, there were significantly more females in the experimental than in the control group (t(69.6)=3.06, p&lt;.05).</p><p>For this reason, gender was entered as a covariate of no interest in all further analyses. Due to errors in the digitization of analogue data, there is missing data for career choice resilience (n=59). For this reason, 134 participants were included in the final sample to estimate training induced changes for variables measuring career choice resilience (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Data was collected at two schools from high school students who were about to finish the last year before leaving high school. One school is a public specialized secondary school (German: Staatliche Fachoberschule), and the other one is a secondary school. The specialized secondary school pseudo-randomly assigned the classes to the intervention or control group (n=163) whereas data from the secondary school exclusively served as control group (n=30) (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). To account for potential differences between schools, school was regressed out of models investigating intervention induced changes in proactive decision making. However, due to missing data for career choice resilience in the public specialized secondary school coinciding with the control group, we were not able to regress out school from models investigating intervention induced changes in those variables. However, subjects did not significantly differ in terms of gender (t(41.63)=1.607, p=0.118), age (t(63.83)=0.122, p=0.910) or proportion of Germans to foreigners (t(44.03)=0.938, p=0.279) in both schools. The local ethics committee of the Management Center Innsbruck approved the study, and written consent was obtained from the participants or the participants' legal guardians, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intervention</head><p>The main aim of the KLUG intervention is to impart basic decision-analytical knowledge and apply the corresponding cognitive techniques to the example of high school students'</p><p>personal decision "what to do after graduating from high school". It was scheduled for two school days in six lessons of 45 minutes (cf. electronic appendix; <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref>). Day 1. The first day of KLUG begins with a brief, interactive introduction by the trainer and students to create a mental entry point into the topic of career choice. Subsequently, the trainer provides basic decision-analytical knowledge on the differentiation of a decision and its outcome as inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hastie and Dawes (2010)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">McNamee and Celona (2005)</ref> and defines complex decisions in comparison to simple decisions (e. g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2008</ref>).</p><p>In the second lesson, the concept of decision framing is explained. Students learn why the decision "what to do after graduating from school" belongs to complex decisions and needs appropriate effort to be made. Students are asked to reflect on their personal vocational decision status quo. Subsequently, the theoretical KLUG framework is presented to high school students.</p><p>The third and fourth lessons are dedicated to the topic of objectives (STEP A). Students learn what decision objectives are and envision their personal list of objectives. This is done in several steps: After the concept of objectives is explained, group discussions and partner exercises are completed. According to the procedure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bond et al. (2008)</ref>, students are asked to articulate a complete and clear set of relevant personal objectives for their personal vocational decision by four tasks: (1) Thinking about what they want to do after graduating from school, students must generate as many relevant objectives as possible in a list and then put it aside. (2) Students receive a so-called master list with 30 potentially relevant objectives.</p><p>They are asked to check all objectives that are relevant to them. (3) Students match the objectives from their self-generated list with the selected objectives from the master list. <ref type="formula">4</ref>Students are asked to choose the ten most important objectives of the objectives they selected in step 2. This method is applied to underline the challenge of envisioning one's objectives for a complex decision and supporting the students in ending up with a distinct and, if possible, complete set of individual objectives.</p><p>The fifth and sixth lessons are dedicated to the topic of decision alternatives (STEP B). In the beginning, the definition of alternatives is given, and the difference between reactive and proactive decision-making (e. g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Siebert &amp; Kunz, 2016)</ref> is discussed. According to the concept of proactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Keeney, 2020)</ref>, the lecture on objectives precedes the lecture on alternatives, as using objectives to identify relevant alternatives increases the likelihood that the decisionmaker effectively achieves their desired objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Siebert &amp; Keeney, 2015)</ref>. By the end of another partner exercise and internet research, students have identified a comprehensive set of potential alternatives fitting their objectives. As homework, students are asked to reflect on their personal objectives and alternatives with people they know well, such as their parents or good friends. Lessons nine and ten are dedicated to the personal evaluation process. Students search the internet for the information needed to fill out a provided decision-making tool. The decisionmaking tool supports the evaluation process by breaking it down into small cognitive steps to be followed: <ref type="formula">1</ref>  <ref type="table">Table A2</ref>).</p><p>Proactive decision-making. The multi-dimensional PDMS combines aspects of 1) proactive personality traits derived from proactive personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bateman &amp; Crant, 1993)</ref> and proactive attitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Schmitz &amp; Schwarzer, 1999)</ref>, and 2) proactive cognitive skills derived from valuefocused thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Keeney, 1992)</ref> and decision quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Howard, 1988)</ref>. The PDMS allows describing individuals' self-perceived degree of proactivity on six dimensions. Two dimensions, "striving for improvement "(IMP) and "showing initiative "(INI), cover proactive personality traits, which are stable over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Siebert et al., 2021)</ref>. Four dimensions, "systematic identification of objectives" (OBJ), "systematic identification of information" (INF), "systematic identification of alternatives" (ALT), and "using a decision radar" (RAD), concern proactive cognitive skills and can be trained <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Siebert et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>KLUG addresses the dimensions OBJ and ALT: As many individuals are unaware of their objectives in decision situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bond et al., 2008)</ref>, the skill to envision one's objectives should be trained. The dimension OBJ captures the cognitive skill of envisioning a comprehensive set of relevant objectives trained in the intervention in sessions 3 and 4 (cf. electronic appendix, A1). The dimension ALT captures the cognitive skill of creating a comprehensive set of high-quality alternatives. Individuals are not aware of their alternatives in decision situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Siebert &amp; Keeney, 2015)</ref> and are trained in the intervention session 5.</p><p>Many individuals collect too little, too much, or irrelevant information in decision situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Keeney, 1992)</ref>. An example of the latter is that many individuals focus on the information that is easily accessible <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Siebert &amp; Kunz, 2016)</ref> The self-rating measure PDMS was assessed with 25 items ) using a sevenpoint Likert scale ranging from absolutely disagree (1) to absolutely agree (7). Participants can also choose the option "I don't know". The 7-point Likert scale is a reliable measure whose internal consistency, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (α), ranges from .63 to .80 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Siebert &amp; Kunz, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In a recent study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Siebert et al. (2021)</ref> analyzed the effects of decision-analytical training on individuals' decision-making proactivity for adults. In quasi-experimental field studies based on three different decision-analytical courses and two control groups, they analyzed longitudinal data on 1,013 decision makers/analysts with different experience levels in three independently developed interventions. The results reveal positive training effects on proactive cognitive skills, but they do not affect proactive personality traits. We expect similar results for adolescents and hypothesize that the KLUG intervention positively affects proactive cognitive skills but has no (significant) effect on proactive personality traits.</p><p>Career choice-self efficacy. In order to quantify potential changes in self-perceived career choice-self efficacy, we used a subscale of a general construct called career choice resilience (CCR) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ratschinski (2014)</ref> CCR comprises four constructs: career choice self-efficacy, occupational self-efficacy, self-esteem, and general resilience.</p><p>Career choice self-efficacy (CCSE) describes the belief in one's ability to influence one's process of career choice and describes the conviction of an individual of successfully making a career choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ratschinski, 2014)</ref> and was measured by five items as a short version of Fouad et al.'s Middle School Self-Efficacy scale (1997) with Cronbach's alpha (α) = .91.</p><p>Occupational self-efficacy (OSE) describes the trust in one's capability to cope with upcoming challenges and to achieve set goals in occupational situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Schiml, 2013)</ref> and was also captured by five items developed by Ratschinski (2014; α = .86).</p><p>Self-esteem (SE) was also operationalized by five positively phrased items as a short version of <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(von Collani &amp; Herzberg, 2003)</ref> self-esteem scale with Cronbach's alpha at .87. SE "refers most generally to an individual's overall positive evaluation of the self. It is composed of two distinct dimensions, competence and worth" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cast &amp; Burke, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr">, p. 1042</ref>.</p><p>General resilience (GR) was assessed using five items of the resilience scale by <ref type="bibr">Wagnild and Young (1993)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Schumacher et al. (2005)</ref> translated and validated the 25-item resilience scale to German and derived an 11-item short scale. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ratschinski (2014)</ref> applied this scale in the context of high school students and derived a reduced 5-item scale (α = .84). In this reduced scale, only items representing personal competence were considered.</p><p>Compared to the PDMS, whose sub-scales represent the components of good complex decision-making and thereby can be assigned to the separate lessons of the intervention, the subscales of CCR describe more general constructs, which are influenced by the complete intervention. Because GR, SE, and OSE reflect relatively stable constructs over time, we did not expect them to be affected by a short-term intervention. However, because KLUG intends to train high school students successfully manage complex decision-making by working through their personal upcoming career choice, we assumed that CCSE -the belief in one's personal ability to make a good career choice -is positively affected by the intervention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p>Directly before the KLUG intervention (t1), all students of the intervention group were asked to fill out a paper-pencil-based t1-survey individually but simultaneously in the classroom. The survey started with a short introduction that informed about the purpose of the survey and its estimated duration. Additionally, it contained the PDMS and the CCR scales and demographic questions. Completion notes were presented, and anonymity was ensured.</p><p>Straight after the last lesson of KLUG (t2), students were asked to fill out the paper-pencilbased t2-survey individually but simultaneously in the classroom. The t2-survey was identical to the t1-survey, except for the demographical questions.</p><p>The control groups completed the t1-and t2-survey in their classroom simultaneously as the intervention group but without receiving the KLUG intervention. All data sets of t1 and t2 were matched via individual self-generated codes students had created for both measurement time points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>To evaluate the effect of KLUG on self-assessed proactive decision-making and career choice self-efficacy, we modeled the responses from the PDMS and the CCR using Linear Mixed Models (LMMs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baayen et al., 2008)</ref>. We assumed that KLUG should specifically enhance proactive cognitive skills (OBJ, ALT, INF, and RAD) but not proactive personality traits (IMP and INI). We also expected that KLUG positively affects high school students' CCSE but not their GR, SE or OSE. In contrast, we expected no significant change in neither CCSE nor proactive cognitive skills in the control group over time.</p><p>All constructs mentioned above served as dependent variables of interest (fixed effects) that were predicted by a categorical group variable (binary: intervention vs. control group), a time variable (before vs. after the intervention) as well as their interaction term. Given the hypotheses, we predicted a significant group x time interaction (cf. 2) for proactive cognitive skills and CCSE. Proactive cognitive skills were computed from the mean value of the individual items for each sub-scale: OBJ, ALT, INF, and RAD. Proactive personality traits were composed of the mean values from the individual items for each sub-scale: IMP and INI. We modeled all subjects as random intercept effects to account for interindividual variance.</p><p>Additionally, we included gender as an additional covariate of no interest in all models because both groups significantly differed in their distribution of males and females. For proactive decision making, we additionally entered school as covariate of no interest (see</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method section -Participants).</head><p>All analyses were conducted using R (version 3.6.2; R Core Team, 2014) and the lme4 package (version 1.1-21; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bates et al., 2014)</ref>. All dependent variables were modeled assuming a Gaussian error distribution with the default identity link function. Visual inspection of residual plots did not reveal obvious deviations from normality and homoscedasticity for the respective LMMs. P-values for the hypothesized group x time interaction for all models were obtained via likelihood ratio tests. Here, we tested the full model <ref type="table">(see table 2</ref>) against a baseline model that was identical to the full model but did not include the group x time interaction term. All other p-values were obtained via the lmerTest-toolbox (version 3.1-1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kuznetsova et al., 2017)</ref> in R, and the threshold of significance was set to p &lt; .05. Degrees of freedom were estimated using the Satterthwaite approximation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kuznetsova et al., 2017</ref>).</p><p>The study was not preregistered.

There was also no main effect for time (p&gt;.62). Importantly, however, there was a significant group x time interaction, suggesting that the experimental group assessed their proactive cognitive skills higher than the control group after being compared to before the intervention (Chi²(1) = 10.65, p&lt;.01). There was no main effect for gender <ref type="bibr">(p&gt;.48)</ref> or school (p&gt;.10) (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 1</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>).</p><p>Proactive personality traits. There was no overall main effect for group, suggesting that both groups did not assess their proactive personality traits differently on average (p&gt;.49). No evidence was found that participants assessed their traits significantly higher over time (p&lt;.59). Furthermore, there was no group x time interaction (p&gt;.39).

There was no main effect for time (p&gt;.28), but the main effect for gender indicates that female participants rated their career choice self-efficacy higher than male ones (t(145.07) = 2.05, p&lt;.05). Furthermore, there was a significant group x time interaction, indicating that the increase in career choice self-efficacy was higher for the intervention group over time compared to the control group (Chi²(1) = 6.15, p&lt;.05) (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>).</p><p>Occupational self-efficacy (OSE).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Effective decision-analytical interventions for high school students are still scarce but of high importance given the individual and societal consequences of poor career choices.</p><p>Therefore, we developed and evaluated an intervention called KLUG for this target group to improve their cognitive decision-making skills. The intervention trains high school students' decision-analytical competencies by focusing on three out of five steps to make good decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mellers &amp; Locke, 2007)</ref>. Specifically, the participants are trained to identify relevant objectives, identify alternatives, and compare alternatives based on individual objectives.</p><p>We hypothesized that the intervention should increase the self-perceived quality of high school students' decision-making skills as measured via the Proactive Decision Making Scale (PDMS) (J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Siebert &amp; Kunz, 2016)</ref> and improve student's perceived competence in making a better career choice as measured by a career choice resilience scale designed by Ratschinski (2014) According to our hypotheses, the effect of KLUG was highly specific. Both self-assessed proactive decision-making skills and career choice-based self-efficacy increased as a function of the intervention. In contrast, more stable decision-making properties such as proactive decision-making traits (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Siebert &amp; Kunz, 2016)</ref>, self-esteem, general resilience, and vocational self-efficacy did not change.</p><p>Those results are in line with other studies for rather intensive trainings in decision-making like <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Siebert et al. (2021)</ref>, who found a training-related effect on proactive decision-making skills or curricular programs lasting several months like the effectiveness study of the GOFER course in decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Mann et al., 1988)</ref> which showed significant changes in high school students' self-esteem and self-reported decision habits and the evaluation of a decision-focused curriculum of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Jacobson et al. (2012)</ref> which showed improvement of decision-making competence measured by the A-DMC of Bruine de Bruin et al. <ref type="bibr">(2007)</ref>. Hence, our study provides further evidence that cognitive decision-making skills can be trained.</p><p>However, despite those first promising results, certain limitations of this study need to be addressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>One limitation is related to the nature of the control group. The classes were not fully randomly assigned to the control or intervention group because the school decided on the group assignment due to internal school constraints. However, because the participants were tested in a realistic school setting, this limiting factor cannot be fully controlled <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Shadish, 2002)</ref>. Furthermore, the control group was passive in the sense that they did not receive any treatment. Consequently, self-assessed improvements in proactive decision-making skills and perceived career choice self-efficacy could eventually result from higher attention the treatment groups perceived <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bell &amp; Battjes, 1985)</ref>. Future research should consider an active control group where the participants receive some form of intervention, but without actually training cognitive decision skills. One possibility would be for the control group to play get-to-know-you games with the same trainers as the treatment group and generally talk about the upcoming career choice.</p><p>Another limitation of our study is related to the chosen measurement scales, which were all self-assessments. Those scales can be biased either consciously due to impression management by drawing a positive picture of oneself <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Goffman, 1963)</ref> or unconsciously due to overestimating one's own abilities <ref type="bibr">(Paulhus, 1986, p. 144)</ref>. Hence, what we assessed is less the change of the actual cognitive decision-making skill but rather the student's perception of this change. For this reason, self-assessments should be additionally validated with another type of assessment. One option is to consider acquiring peer assessment where students assess other students. Siebert and colleagues showed recently that self-assessments and peer assessments of PDM are positively correlated for adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Siebert et al., 2021)</ref>. However, gathering high-quality peer assessments of adolescents might be challenging and may not be as reliable as required. Alternatively, students' cognitive decision-making skills could be assessed by their teachers who know the students well or by a performance test (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Oeser, 2016)</ref>. Finally, the most objective measure of cognitive decision-making skills is to assess the student's actual career choices. This implies tracking the student for at least three years after having graduated from school to see how their career choice turn out, e. g., in terms of the absence of drop-outs. However, this kind of longitudinal assessment was also beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>In this context, it needs to be mentioned that we cannot make any statements about the potential long-term effects of this intervention. That is to say, between the t1-and the t2testing, there were just two school days. Hence, to demonstrate that the decision-analytical training effects persist in high school students, future research should examine the stability of those effects after a more extended period. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Siebert et al. (2021)</ref> analyzed the effect of different decision-making interventions in adults before and after the course and a year later. Results indicate that the training effect on proactive decision-making skills was still present after a year. Furthermore, we were not able to control for school to investigate intervention-based changes for career choice resilience and therefore cannot exclude the possibility that the observed changes in CCSE are due to differences between the two schools.</p><p>However, because we found no evidence that both schools differed in terms of age, gender or proportion of Germans to foreigners and there was no effect of school on proactive decision making, we believe it is unlikely that the observed changes in CCSE are due to differences between the two schools.</p><p>In this context, it would be interesting to investigate whether the training of decision-making competence shows general transfer effects. So, the question would be whether decisionanalytically trained students can apply their analytical decision-making competencies to a new decision situation that is not related to future career choices, such as deciding on a health care treatment plan, a place to live, a car to buy, or on a particular financial investment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The KLUG intervention is one of the first studies to develop and evaluate decision-analytic training for high school students to target future career choices. The results suggest that high school students benefit from this intervention measured by the self-perceived quality of their decision-making skills using the Proactive Decision Making Scale (PDMS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Siebert &amp; Kunz, 2016)</ref> and their perceived competence in making better career choices using the career choice resilience scale of <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ratschinski (2014)</ref>. However, further research is necessary to evaluate the intervention's long-term benefit. We hope these first results are helpful for teachers, schools, or NGOs aiming to teach adolescents how to make better decisions by adding this intervention to their high school curricula. Note.
