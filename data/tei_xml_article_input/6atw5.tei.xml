				<p>Across a wide range of domains, experts make probabilistic judgments under conditions of uncertainty to support decision-making. These judgments are often conveyed using linguistic expressions (e.g., x is likely). Seeking to foster shared understanding of these expressions between senders and receivers, the US intelligence community implemented a communication standard that prescribes a set of probability terms and assigns each term an equivalent numerical probability range. Wintle et al. (2019) tested whether access to the standard improves shared understanding and also explored the efficacy of various enhanced presentation formats. Notably, they found that embedding numeric equivalents in text (e.g., x is likely [55-80%]) substantially outperformed the status quo approach in terms of the percentage overlap between participants&apos; interpretations of linguistic probabilities (defined in terms of the numeric range equivalents they provided for each term) and the numeric ranges in the standard. These results have important prescriptive implications, yet Wintle et al.&apos;s percentage overlap measure of agreement may be viewed as unfairly punitive since it penalizes individuals for being more precise than the stipulated guidelines even when the individuals&apos; interpretations fall perfectly within the stipulated ranges. Arguably, within-range precision is a positive attribute. Accordingly, we reanalyzed Wintle et al.&apos;s data using an alternative measure of percentage overlap that does not penalize in-range precision. Predictably, we find that percentage overlap is elevated across conditions. More importantly, the effects of presentation format and probability level are highly consistent with the original study. By removing further ambiguity, these findings buttress the claim that the methods currently used by intelligence This is a preprint currently under review at PLOS ONE.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Across a variety of domains, experts make probabilistic judgments under conditions of uncertainty to support decision-making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Murphy &amp; Winkler, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Morgan, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moxley et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Budescu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burgman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ho et al., 2015)</ref>. For instance, clinicians estimate the likelihood of certain treatment outcomes, meteorologists predict the weather, and intelligence analysts forecast geopolitical developments. Depending on the context, uncertainty may stem from the sense that critical information is missing or inconsistent with other pieces of information, doubts about the accuracy or completeness of one's causal model, awareness of the possibility of benign misinformation or malign deception, and even aversion to the risk of being proven wrong. In order to fulfill the decision-support function, expert assessors must not only be able to estimate their uncertainty to arrive at sound judgments, they must also effectively communicate those probabilistic judgments to their respective audiences. Without effective communication, even an accurate and timely judgment could potentially misinform the end-user.</p><p>Often, experts (and the professional or organizational bodies they may represent) communicate probabilistic judgments using linguistic expressions such as likely or very likely for probability levels that convey "more likely than not"; conversely, experts use terms such as unlikely or very unlikely to convey probability levels "less likely than not." Political pundits, for example, are prone to using such language in their forecasts without specifying what the linguistic probabilities mean to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Tetlock &amp; Gardner, 2015)</ref>. Although the free use of such language is still tolerated in some intelligence communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barnes, 2016)</ref>, others have implemented communication schemes aimed at fostering shared meaning between senders and receivers.</p><p>In the US, for instance, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence promulgated a communication standard under Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203 that prescribes a set of probability terms and assigns each term an equivalent numerical probability range (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). In practice, intelligence consumers are expected to reference a translation table to ensure that their interpretations of linguistic probabilities align with the prescribed meanings.</p><p>NATO and the UK intelligence community follow the same basic approach, although the precise set of terms and numerical ranges assigned differ <ref type="bibr">(Dhami &amp; Mandel, forthcoming;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Friedman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Irwin &amp; Mandel, 2020)</ref>. Numerically bounded linguistic probability (NBLP) schemes are used in many other domains as well. For instance, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) uses this approach to communicate probabilistic assessments about global climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Mastrandrea et al., 2011)</ref> and the European Commission recommends a similar system for communicating the risk of drug side effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Webster et al., 2017)</ref>. NBLP schemes have also been proposed for use in extreme event attribution reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lewis et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Linguistic probability expressions and numeric range equivalents in US Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203. Note: ICD 203 provides two sets of linguistic probability expressions that are treated synonymously. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wintle et al. (2019)</ref>, participants were only shown terms from the first column and their numeric equivalents.</p></div>

Notably, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Budescu et al. (2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Budescu et al. ( , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budescu et al.

(2019)</ref> examined the efficacy of the US intelligence community guideline shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Aside from noteworthy differences between the two NBLP schemes (e.g., some numeric ranges overlap in the IPCC standard but are mutually exclusive in ICD 203), Wintle et al. compared the effect of four presentation formats (described in the next section) on the percentage of overlap between participants' interpretations of linguistic probabilities (defined in terms of the numeric range equivalents they provided for each term) and the numeric ranges in ICD 203. Compared to a control condition, they found that percentage overlap (i.e., a measure of compliance) significantly improved only in the hybrid condition in which numeric range equivalents were shown next to the linguistic probability phrase in text. <ref type="bibr">Wintle et al.'s (2019)</ref> findings are important because they strongly generalize the findings of <ref type="bibr">Budescu et al.'s (2009</ref><ref type="bibr">Budescu et al.'s ( , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">Budescu et al.'s ( , 2014</ref> studies from the domain of climate science to that of intelligence analysis. Given that the intelligence community, like many areas of government, is often slow to implement pan-organizational reform and to leverage relevant behavioral science <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dhami et al., 2015;</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">PO = {[min(U e , U s ) -max(L e , L s )]/[max(U e , U s ) -min(L e , L s )]} * 100,</formula><p>where L e , B e (used subsequently), and U e refer to the participant's elicited lower-bound, best, and upper-bound estimates for a term in a particular statement, respectively, and the subscripts e and s refer to elicited and stipulated, respectively. This measure penalizes individuals who provide compliant "in-range" interpretations that are more precise than the stipulated numeric ranges, or what Benjamin and Budescu (2018) described as nested intervals.</p><p>For instance, given that the stipulated range for likely is 55-80%, a participant interpreting likely does not penalize compliant participants for being more precise than the stipulated guidelines.</p><p>Given that our measure of percentage overlap was less punitive, we expected to see an elevation of compliance overall. We further hypothesized that the relative differences between presentation formats would remain unchanged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head><p>Most of the relevant materials and methods are reported in full detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wintle et al. (2019)</ref>.</p><p>For ease of reference, we summarize key aspects of their experiment and then detail the procedures we used for re-analyzing their data. Wintle et al. recruited 924 adult participants from a pool of 4,122 people who had expressed interest in a larger research project. The experiment was administered online via Qualtrics. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four presentation conditions: Table, Tooltip, Brackets, or Control. In the <ref type="table">Table condition,</ref> participants could click on a link, opening a separate tab/window containing the ICD 203 NBLP scheme. In the Tooltip condition, participants could position their cursor over the probability term appearing in a statement, revealing the term's numeric equivalent. In the Brackets condition, numeric range equivalents were embedded in text alongside verbal probability expressions (e.g., "likely [55-80%]"). The brackets condition is identical to what we earlier referred to as the hybrid format. In the Control condition, participants received no guidance on the stipulated numeric equivalents of each probability expression (i.e., they were not shown the ICD 203 guideline in any form).</p><p>Across presentation conditions, participants were shown eight statements presented in random order that were extracted from US intelligence reports. Each statement contained one of four probability terms (very unlikely, unlikely, likely, very likely) drawn from ICD 203 (e.g., "ISIS is unlikely to announce that it is ending its self-declared caliphate…"). Each probability term was presented twice, each time in a different statement. In our subsequent analyses, we average results over these two instantiations for each term, as the specific statements are not of theoretical interest. After reviewing a statement, participants were asked, "What do you think the authors mean by [probability term]?" Using a 101-point percentage-chance slider scale ranging from 0 (No chance) to 100 (Certain), participants gave their minimum, best, and maximum numerical probability equivalents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Data and other supporting files associated with out re-analysis are available at https://osf.io/v9q82/.</p><p>We treated missing data differently than <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wintle et al. (2019)</ref>. Where participants provided maximum estimates for the terms unlikely and/or very unlikely but were missing minimum estimates, Wintle et al. recoded the missing values as 0. This procedure was based on the assumption that these participants had intended to input 0 but did not realize that they had to move the slider from its default position (this procedure is not described in the original article, but is outlined in their code: https://osf.io/cp5rq/). Although this explanation is plausible, there is in fact no way to ascertain the extent to which this reason accounts for those missing cases. Accordingly, we adopted the more conservative procedure of treating all missing cases as missing.</p><p>Our data-handling procedures also differed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wintle et al. (2019)</ref> in another respect.</p><p>In cases where participants violated the "logical" constraint L e &lt; B e &lt; U e , Wintle et al.</p><p>rearranged their responses to conform to that inequality. </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">PO = {1 -[max(U e -U s , 0) + max(L s -L e , 0)]/(U e -L e )} * 100</formula><p>This measure of PO is asymmetric, representing the proportion of the participant's interval that overlaps with the stipulated interval. Note that if spread was equal to 0 (i.e., L e = U e ), which occurred in 95 cases, PO was equal to 100% if the value of the bounds was within the stipulated range and it was equal to 0% if the value of the bounds was outside the stipulated range.</p><p>To facilitate comparison with <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Budescu et al. (2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Budescu et al. ( , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budescu et al. ( , 2014</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wintle et al. (2019)</ref> also analyzed the proportion of participants' best estimates falling within the stipulated ranges. To minimize the effect of outliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Tukey, 1962)</ref> and ensure consistency with earlier studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Budescu et al., 2009)</ref>, we Winsorized best estimates to focus on the central 90 percent of the distribution within each of the 32 cells defined by the 4 (probability term) × 2 (intelligence statement) × 4 (presentation format) design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Missing data</head><p>There was a maximum of 7,392 responses to each of the three questions (i.e., minimum, best, and maximum estimates) in the experiment; namely, 924 participants each of whom were asked to assess eight statements. Overall, 13.26% (2,941/22,176) of responses were missing. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> shows the percentage of missing responses by estimate, probability term, and presentation format. Each of the three types of estimates was independent of presentation format, all p &gt; .2. In contrast, each of the three types of estimates was not independent of probability term. Chi-square test values (with df = 3 and N = 7,392) for minimum, best, and maximum estimates are 115.09, 12.42, and 14.02, respectively, all p &lt; .01. The pattern of missing responses for estimates of minimum and maximum values across probability term was comparable. In both cases, there was a greater percentage of missing data for the low probability terms unlikely and very unlikely than for the high probability terms likely and very likely. We note that although the result for minimum values is consistent with <ref type="bibr">Wintle et al.'s</ref> assumption that missing data reflected a failure to adjust the slider in order to set it to zero, this would not explain why the same pattern of missing data was observed for the estimates of maximum value. The effect of probability term on missing responses for best estimates, however, showed a different pattern in which the term likely had a higher percentage of missing responses. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compliance as percentage overlap</head><p>We conducted a mixed (Presentation Format × Probability Term) analysis of variance (ANOVA) on percentage overlap. The effect of probability term was significant, F(3, 472) = 25.07, p &lt; .001, η p 2 = .137. There was also a significant effect of presentation format, F(3, 474) = 41.30, p &lt; .001, η p 2 = .207. However, the interaction effect was not significant, F(9, 1422) = 1.08, p = .37, η p 2 = .007. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 3 and 4</ref> show the mean percentage overlap as a function of presentation format and probability level, respectively, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> plots percentage overlap by these factors. As <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows, all pairwise comparisons between levels of presentation format were significant with the exception of the comparison between the <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table and Tooltip</ref> conditions. As <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows, all pairwise comparisons among levels of probability term were significant with the exception of the comparison between the likely and very likely. Replicating <ref type="bibr">Wintle et al.'s (2019)</ref> findings, overlap was markedly worse for the phrase unlikely. Overall, the asymmetric measure of percentage overlap was less punitive than the symmetric measure used by <ref type="bibr">Wintle et al.</ref>, but it revealed a highly consistent pattern of results regarding the effects of the independent variables (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>). <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compliance as percentage of in-range best estimates</head><p>We ran a mixed (Presentation Format × Probability Term) ANOVA on the percentage of compliant best estimates; namely, best estimates that fell within the ranges specified in ICD 203. The effect of probability term on the percentage of compliant best estimates was significant, F(3, 638) = 49.51, p &lt; .001, η p 2 = .189. There was also a significant effect of presentation format, F(3, 640) = 25.76, p &lt; .001, η p 2 = .108. However, the interaction effect was not significant, F(9, 1920) = 1.03, p = .41, η p 2 = .005. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 5 and 6</ref> show the mean percentage of compliant best estimates as a function of presentation format and probability level, respectively, and <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> plots the percentage of compliant best estimates by these factors. As <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> shows, the pairwise differences perfectly paralleled those obtained on the PO measure of compliance; namely, all conditions significantly differed except for the conditions. The pairwise differences between levels of probability term showed some discrepancies with those reported for the PO measure. Once again, compliance was poorest for the phrase unlikely (see <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>). However, compliance was significantly better for the term very likely than for the remaining terms. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows how our results closely parallel those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wintle et al. (2019)</ref>. This is to be expected given that our analyses differ mainly in terms of the data exclusion rules we applied and also the fact that we Winsorized the data. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>.

We further believe that defenders of the status quo within the intelligence community might draw upon this characteristic and dismiss the validity of the research on that basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>95% confidence interval</head><p>Indeed, the in-range precision that Wintle et al.'s PO measure scores as non-overlap might be regarded as a beneficial attribute given that receivers are often willing to trade accuracy for informativeness in the form of greater precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Yaniv &amp; Foster, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, 1997</ref>. The measure that we used instead is not susceptible to the same critique. Although our asymmetric measure of percentage overlap does not reward precision within the numeric probability bounds stipulated in ICD 203, it does not penalize it either.</p><p>Our reanalysis resulted in an elevated percentage overlap across conditions. This is to be expected given that our measure is less punitive than <ref type="bibr">Wintle et al.'s (2019)</ref> measure. However, critically, the effect of presentation format and probability level was highly consistent with that reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wintle et al. (2019)</ref>. We found that the <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table and Tooltip methods outperformed</ref> the control condition, and these methods were outperformed by the Brackets method. This ordering suggests that the more numeric representations are present at the time of interpretation, the more faithfully the sender's interpretation is decoded. These results further suggest that the methods intelligence organizations currently use, which are closest to the <ref type="table">Table condition</ref> in the present research, are unlikely to effectively sync the meaning of uncertainty expressions assigned by intelligence producers and inferred by intelligence consumers, such as policymakers who must rely on uncertain estimates to support critical decision-making about national security matters <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Friedman, 2019)</ref>. Even by our less punitive measurement standards, percentage overlap was about 60% in the <ref type="table">Table condition, a mere 9%</ref> above the control condition, which would represent the intelligence community's approach prior to the adoption of the ICD 203 standard. Similarly, if we compare the <ref type="table">Table condition to</ref> the control group in terms of the compliance of participants' best estimates, there is only a small increase from approximately 60% to 67%.</p><p>By comparison, the improvement in communication fidelity between the current intelligence community method and the enhanced method of including stipulated numeric probability ranges directly in assessments was far more substantial by both compliance metrics.</p><p>This is consistent with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Budescu et al. (2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Budescu et al. ( , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budescu et al. ( , 2014</ref>. Although these findings suggest that use of bracketed numeric ranges in estimates would improve communication fidelity, we urge caution in our recommending this strategy. One potential problem with the hybrid approach is that end-users might interpret numeric ranges as credible intervals on the substantive assessment given in an intelligence report. For example, imagine an intelligence analyst states, "It is likely [55%-80%] that the Blanks will attack our country in the next week."</p><p>According to the hybrid method, the range given is meant to clarify what the term likely means, in general-namely, as outlined in ICD 203. However, it is plausible that end-users would interpret the range to represent the credible interval the analyst assigned to the specific event, "the Blanks will attack our country in the next week." However, the analyst might have had in mind a different credible interval. Indeed, the analyst's credible interval might span more than one of the stipulated ranges. For instance, if pressed for a credible interval, the analyst might have assigned a range of 75%-85%. This range spans the stipulated ranges associated with the terms likely and very likely. Some analysts with such a range in mind might use the more extreme term (i.e., very likely), but perhaps more often than not they would choose the less extreme term. At least, this is suggested by work showing substantial underconfidence in analysts' probabilistic judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mandel &amp; Barnes, 2014</ref>. An alternative approach would be to report only the numeric probability ranges (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Dhami &amp; Mandel, forthcoming;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Friedman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Irwin &amp; Mandel, 2019)</ref>. If so, the ranges could unambiguously refer to the analyst's credible interval. To the best of our knowledge, no research has yet compared the effectiveness of a purely numerical format with the ones examined here. This could be a promising direction for future research with implications for public policy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>as 60 -</head><label>60</label><figDesc>75% would have a PO = 60% instead of 100% (i.e.,PO = {[min(75,   55)]/[max(75, 80) -min(60, 55)]} * 100 = 60). However, such precision can (legitimately, we argue) be seen as a positive communication attribute. Penalizing in-range precision where the receiver's interpreted range is a fully nested set of the stipulated range may also distort the intended use of the NBLP scheme under examination. That is, when an intelligence analyst selects a term such as likely, it only means that the analyst's credible interval falls within the stipulated range (55-80%), not necessarily that it equals the full range. Accordingly, we reanalyzed the data from Wintle et al. using an alternative measure of percentage overlap that</figDesc></figure>
