			<abstract>
				<p>The distinction between intention and foresight is critical for law and morality. For example, a military officer deciding to bomb a target while foreseeing civilian casualties raises questions about whether these deaths were intended or merely foreseen. This study aimed to disentangle the neural correlates of intention and foresight using a novel paradigm. Twenty-five participants completed a task inspired by the game Frogger, where hitting objects could be desirable (earning points) or inconsequential. Outcomes varied by likelihood (high vs. low) and actuality (hit vs. miss), resulting in a 2×2×2 design: intention (present/absent) × outcome (hit/miss) × expectedness (expected/unexpected). Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed that feedbackrelated negativity (FRN) amplitude was larger when participants intended to hit objects, while the P3 potential increased for unexpected outcomes. However, neither signal exclusively reflected intention or foresight; the FRN also indexed expectedness, and the P3 reflected intention. To address this overlap, we used effect-matched spatial (EMS) filtering, which identified a widespread brain activity pattern that may better dissociate intention from foresight. These 2 findings enhance our understanding of the neural processes underlying complex decisionmaking, with potential applications in ethical and legal frameworks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Imagine that a military officer is faced with a difficult decision: they must choose whether to bomb an enemy target at the cost of killing innocent civilians in the process. In this scenario, the officer may foresee civilian casualties as a possible consequence of their action without actually intending to kill civilians-that is, they might not take the casualties as a reason for the action <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Yaffe, 2022)</ref>. Alternatively, they might have a terrorist's aim. That is, they might see there being two reasons to drop the bombs: it will destroy the enemy target, and, as a bonus, it will kill civilians and thereby terrorize the enemy. This hypothetical moral dilemma is a paradigmatic illustration of what is often called "the doctrine of double-effect". The doctrine posits that it is sometimes morally permissible to cause harm so long as the harm is merely a foreseen side-effect of bringing about some greater good, rather than intended as a means to an end <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(McIntyre, 2018)</ref>. Importantly, the doctrine presupposes that, in the case of moral decisions, the distinction between intention and foresight is real, in the sense that one truly can foresee an outcome of one's own action without intending it. Due to this assumption, the doctrine of double effect has been controversial in religion <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Reed, 2012)</ref>, philosophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Woodward, 2001</ref>), medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Quill et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sulmasy &amp; Pellegrino, 1999)</ref>, and the law <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Price, 1997)</ref>. Opponents of the doctrine view it as inappropriate to excuse someone for causing harm that they foresaw on the grounds that it was unintended. It seems to many to be empty for the military office to say, "Although I knew I would, I didn't mean to kill the civilians; it was just an unfortunate side-effect of what I meant to do, which was to destroy the enemy target." In American criminal law, the distinction between intention and foresight is often relevant for determining a defendant's degree of culpability. Whether a defendant caused harm intentionally rather than knowingly (i.e., while foreseeing the harm but not intending it) can drastically alter the degree of liability, and so the sentence. In some states, in fact, a murderer can be subject to the death penalty only if they intended the victim's death.</p><p>Given the potential life-and-death implications of the distinction between intention and foresight, it is crucial to probe its legitimacy. Critically, the difference between intention and foresight depends on the agent's mental state. Assuming that where there is a different mental state there is also a different brain state, a claim to foresee a harm that is not intended is true only if there is a difference in the brain state of those who foresee and those who intend. Here, we make that assumption, and investigate whether brain-based evidence supports the thought that intention and foresight are distinct.</p><p>Intention and foresight are complex, high-level concepts which are difficult to directly study neuroscientifically. However, they are closely linked to simpler concepts which are easier to study.</p><p>For instance, intention is closely associated with error-monitoring. Imagine you intend to hit a ball on a tennis court. If you miss, you naturally perceive this as an error. In contrast, if you casually swing your racket while walking to a bench and narrowly miss a leaf drifting on the wind, you would not feel you have made an error because hitting the leaf was never your intention. Similarly, foresight is connected to the experience of surprise. When you flip a light switch, you anticipate that it will turn on the light. If the light fails to turn on, the discrepancy between expectation and outcome triggers a sense of surprise.</p><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method commonly used in neuroscience to study deliberate actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Maoz et al., 2019)</ref>, errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fu et al., 2023)</ref>, and surprise <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Król &amp; El-Deredy, 2015</ref>). During EEG, sensitive electrodes are attached to the scalp and track minute changes in cortical electric fields. To our knowledge, no EEG studies have attempted to determine how culpable mental states map on to different patterns of neural activation (though, for an fMRI study, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Vilares et al., 2017)</ref>. In this study, we attempted to accomplish this by implementing EEGbased event-related potential (ERP) analysis of the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P3 wave. ERP analysis involves averaging EEG data time-locked to a specific event of interest, typically across individual participant's trials and then across all participants' trials, to identify common patterns related to specific characteristics of the cognitive process of interest.</p><p>The FRN is thought to be akin to an "error detection" signal, as it is elicited after receiving external negative feedback, indicating that action that was just performed was incorrect <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fu et al., 2023)</ref>. It is most prominently recorded above the frontocentral regions of the brain, approximately 200-350 ms after feedback presentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Xu et al., 2021)</ref>. It is typically calculated as the difference in EEG potentials associated with observing an erroneous outcome and a successful outcome.</p><p>The FRN has been shown to follow feedback indicating inaccuracy in time-estimation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Miltner et al., 1997)</ref> and monetary penalty or lack of monetary reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hajcak et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Isheqlou et al., 2023</ref>). Because we established above that errors indirectly reflect intentions, we speculated that the FRN may serve as a proxy for intention.</p><p>The other ERP of interest is the P3, found in the central and precentral regions of the brain. It typically occurs between 250 and 800 ms after feedback presentation, depending on task characteristics, and is triggered by processing an unexpected, noticeable, attention-demanding, or otherwise relevant stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Picton, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Polich, 2007)</ref>. The P3 potential holds great promise in areas such as concealed information detection, since stimuli the individual is familiar with are more likely to elicit the P3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rosenfeld, 2020)</ref>. Importantly for our study, the P3 was found to be related to the processing of unexpected stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Król &amp; El-Deredy, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that the P3 may serve as a proxy for foresight, since, as we argued above, there is a link between foresight and feeling surprised.</p><p>Interestingly, several studies provide support for the connection of both the P3 and FRN with both foresight and intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hassall et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Paul et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schaefer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wu &amp; Zhou, 2009)</ref>. However, these studies implemented some form of a guessing or gambling task, where participants had no actual control over the outcome of each trial. So, the participants did not actively intend the outcome, but rather passively hoped to produce it. Put differently, by guessing or gambling, the participants might not form an intention, but rather just another kind of expectation. In contrast, many actions that humans typically execute-and, importantly, the actions that are of moral and legal importance-involve outcomes over which they have some degree of control. To our knowledge, no study has implemented a paradigm that allows participants to control (at least to some extent) the outcome of the task in order to examine the effects of intention and foresight with regards to both the P3 and the FRN (though the FRN alone was analyzed in such a task; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Holroyd et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, our study seeks to address this gap by investigating how the P3 and FRN components correspond to foresight and intention, respectively, when participants exert some degree of control over trial outcomes. Our goal is to generalize these findings and apply them to the double effect debate, examining whether intention and foresight are associated with distinct neural correlates. Specifically, we hypothesize that foresight selectively modulates the P3, while intention selectively modulates the FRN. This framework is summarized in the following four hypotheses:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1:</head><p>The P3 amplitude is unaffected by intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2:</head><p>The P3 amplitude varies with foresight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3:</head><p>The FRN amplitude varies with intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4:</head><p>The FRN amplitude is unaffected by foresight.</p><p>However, as detailed later in this paper, our findings contradict hypotheses H1 and H4. The results indicated that both the P3 and FRN are influenced by both foresight and intention, even in tasks where participants control the outcomes of their actions. Consequently, we conducted exploratory analyses beyond the original hypotheses to examine whether any other spatiotemporal brain activity patterns could more effectively differentiate between these two mental states. From these analyses, we identified one spatiotemporal pattern that appears to specifically reflect some aspects of foresight but not intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Participants</head><p>A total of 25 undergraduate students at Chapman University were recruited to participate in this study in exchange for course credit (11 males, 14 females; ages 18 to 21; 3 left-handed, 22 right-handed). All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision except for three participants, who all nonetheless said they could see the computer screen and graphics presented on it clearly. Nine participants were excluded from the analyses, either for being in an inadequate state (visibly sleepy or sick, N=1), for adopting an inappropriate strategy (rushing through the experiment or indicating that they misunderstood the experimental task, N=2), for low quality of the EEG recording (artifacts from electrodermal activity, high noise, N=2), or a combination of these criteria (N=4). Thus, the final sample consisted of 16 participants (14 right-handed, 9 females, ages 18 to 21). All procedures and results reported henceforth apply to these 16 participants only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Procedure</head><p>Participants were seated about 140 cm away from a computer screen, which was 30 by 53 cm, with 1920×1080 resolution and 144 Hz refresh rate. Participants started the experiment by answering questions about their gender, age, handedness, and eyesight, while the EEG was set up. Afterwards, the experimenters read the instructions to the participants (see Supplementary material 1 for the exact wording). To check for comprehension, the participants then repeated the instructions in their own words back to the experimenters. If participants did not understand the instructions, the experimenters reviewed the instructions with them. Once it was apparent that the participants understood the task, they began a practice block of 20 trials. After completing the practice block, the participants began the main task.</p><p>The task, inspired by the game "Frogger" (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>), consisted of 300 trials arranged in 12 blocks of 25 trials each, with optional breaks between the blocks. The task was designed to elicit intention and foresight in varying combinations, such that the combinations could be used to disentangle their effects on the EEG activity. The goal of the task was to move the frog from a moat at the bottom of the screen (designated by a blue stripe) to a moat at the top of the screen (designated by another blue stripe), where the frog could join a baby frog. When the frog reached the top moat the participant earned 10 points, indicated visually with a "+10" icon. The frog always reached the other side of the moat, so participants always gained at least 10 points per trial.</p><p>In addition, moving objects (either dragonflies or bubbles, see <ref type="bibr">Fig. 1a,</ref><ref type="bibr">b vs. c,</ref><ref type="bibr">d</ref>) traversed the screen from left to right or from right to left (direction selected randomly for each trial with 50% probability) in a straight line just below the top moat. Participants pressed the spacebar to make the frog start hopping across the screen. The first hop occurred immediately after the spacebar press. The frog then autonomously hopped three more times (for a total of four hops) to reach the top moat. The second and the third hop were delayed by a duration jittered between 100 to 500 ms per hop. The jitter was implemented to prevent participants from being able to perfectly time the frog's hops, as doing so would drastically reduce the number of unexpected outcomes needed for our analysis. After the third hop, the frog reached the point where it either collided with the moving object or not. The final hop occurred 500 ms after the third hop, to provide enough time for the participant to notice whether the moving object was hit. Participants were told that after the spacebar press, the frog might have "a mind of its own about how fast it will move" (see  The stimuli presented to the participant at the beginning of each trial included a large frog, which the participant launched towards the small frog, one or three objects traversing rightward or leftward across the screen, and a white fixation cross. Panels (a) and (b) depict the intended trials, in which the participant scored points for hitting the object (dragonfly)-and therefore intended to hit it. Conversely, panels (c) and (d) depict the nonintended trials, which did not yield any points upon hitting the object (bubble). Hence, in the non-intended trials, the participant should not form a specific intention to hit the object traversing the screen. In addition, panels (a) and (c) depict trials where hitting the object was unlikely-only one object on the screen-while panels (b) and (d) depict the trials where hitting an object was likely-three objects on the screen.</p><p>Once the frog reached the potential collision point-marked by a fixation cross-the flying objects stopped moving, so the participants could see if the frog hit the moving object.</p><p>Successfully hitting the object was indicated by the object disappearing, accompanied by the appearance of a "+10" icon (indicating 10 extra points) for a dragonfly or "+0" icon (indicating 0 extra points) for a bubble. Missing the object was indicated by none of the objects disappearing and no extra text appearing on screen. This hit/miss feedback lasted for 500 ms. After that, the frog made one final hop to join the baby frog.</p><p>In this experiment, we worked with four independent variables: intention to hit, likelihood of hitting, outcome of the trial (hit/miss), and expectedness of the outcome.</p><p>Intention. Each trial was randomly assigned as an intended or non-intended trial with 50% probability. Non-intended trials included bubbles as the moving objects, yielding no extra points when hit ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1c and 1d</ref>). The rest of the trials were intended trials, with dragonflies as the moving objects, yielding 10 extra points when hit. The 10 extra points were designed to motivate the participants to time their button presses to maximize the likelihood of hitting the dragonfly <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1a</ref> and 1b).</p><p>Likelihood. Additionally, each trial was randomly assigned as a likely or unlikely trial with 50% probability. Likely trials had three objects moving across the screen at any time ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1b and   1d</ref>), making it probable that one of the objects would get hit. The rest of the trials were unlikely trials-with only one object moving across the screen at a time ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a and 1c</ref>). It should be noted that the likelihood of hitting the moving object also partially depended on when the participant pressed the spacebar. However, some level of uncertainty was introduced by the temporal jitter in the timing of the second and the third hop. In previous pilot sessions, the participants' hit rate was approximately 45% for the likely trials and 20% for the unlikely trials. Thus, the hit rates did not differ enough between the likely and unlikely trials, and the participants additionally found hitting the frog too difficult in the likely condition. Hence, in the experimental sessions, we introduced a manipulation of the time-jittered hops of the frog-in 50% of the likely trials only-to make the participants hit the target regardless of when they pressed the spacebar. Following this manipulation, participants' hit rate was approximately 80% in the likely trials (and remained 20% in the unlikely trials). Hence, the manipulation created a rough symmetry between the likely and unlikely trials. The participants were not informed of this intervention.</p><p>Outcome. The outcome of each trial was either hit-when the participant hit the moving object-or miss-when the participant did not hit the moving object.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expectedness. The trial's outcome was expected if it aligned with what the participant</head><p>would have expected-i.e., if hitting the target was likely and the participant hit it or if hitting the target was unlikely and the participant missed it. Conversely, the trial's outcome was unexpected when hitting the target was likely and the participant missed or when hitting the target was unlikely and the participant hit it. Note that we use the variable likelihood in the behavioral analyses (Section 3.1) and the variable expectedness in the EEG analyses (Section 3.2). We do so because in the behavioral analyses, we investigate participants' behavior before the button press, hence independent of what the trial outcome will be, while in the EEG analyses we study the EEG response to the trial outcome. Importantly, analyzing the main effect of expectedness is equivalent to analyzing the interaction effect of likelihood and outcome. Therefore, the derivation of the variable expectedness does not change the results.</p><p>On average across participants, the 300 trials in the main task took 26 minutes and 11 seconds (SD = 4 minutes and 40 seconds) to complete. After the participants completed the task, they filled out a post-experimental survey. This survey asked for demographic information (sex, age, handedness, political leaning; political leaning was not analyzed due to limited sample size) and inquired about task strategies. The task strategy questions were used to exclude the participants who did not understand the task-i.e. they reported that they intended to hit bubbles more than flies (2 participants; see Participants section) or that they perceived that a hit was more likely when just one object was on the screen compared to three (2 participants; see Participants section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Electrophysiological Recordings</head><p>We recorded EEG using a 64-channel electrode cap using the BioSemi ActiveTwo System. The sampling rate was 2048 Hz. Electrodes were positioned in accordance with the 10-10 system and the BioSemi's CMS and DRL electrodes were placed in between PO3 and POz and between POz and PO4, respectively. The electrode offset for all electrodes was kept under 30 mV during the EEG setup. We additionally recorded EOG to monitor eye movements. EOG leads were placed 1 cm laterally from the outer canthus of each eye as well as above and below the middle of the right eye.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">EEG pre-processing</head><p>The EEG/EOG file was pre-processed using the MNE library v1.7.0 (https://mne.tools/) in Python v3.10.12. The data were downsampled to 1000 Hz and band-pass filtered between 0.1 and 50 Hz using the MNE's default Raw.filter() method (FIR, one-pass, zero-phase, non-causal filter with the length of 33,001 samples). Manual visual inspection of the whole recording identified between 1 and 16 noisy electrodes per participant (5.8±4.3 mean±SD). These electrodes' signal was interpolated using the MNE's Raw.interpolate_bads() method, based on the spherical spline approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Perrin et al., 1989)</ref>. The FCz and CPz electrodes, used in the main amplitude analyses (see below), were never identified as excessively noisy. The data were subsequently rereferenced to the average over all electrodes, and independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to identify and remove artifacts associated with eye movements and blinks.</p><p>Finally, the data were segmented into 300 epochs per participant (one per trial). Epochs were temporally locked to when the frog reached the potential collision position with one of the bubbles or dragonflies (T=0, the white fixation cross in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Each epoch spanned from 1000 ms before T=0 to 1000 ms after T=0. Epochs were baseline corrected by the last 500 ms before T=0. Epochs with voltage ranges &gt; 100 µV were automatically excluded (24.8 epochs, 8.3%, per participant on average, SD = 13.4). The remaining epochs were visually inspected by three examiners, who additionally removed 18.3 epochs, 6.1%, per participant on average (SD = 8.1).</p><p>The final data consisted of 257.0 epochs per participant on average (SD = 15.4), with a grand total of 4112 epochs across all participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Statistical analysis</head><p>To calculate the ERP amplitudes, we averaged the EEG data across all epochs into one waveform for each participant and condition. The P3 amplitude was extracted as the mean voltage of each averaged waveform in the interval 300-500 ms after T=0. For the FRN, there are at least three analysis approaches: (1) as a difference wave contrasting the hit and miss trials in a time window (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Xu et al., 2021)</ref>, (2) as the mean amplitude of the EEG signal in a time window (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wu &amp; Zhou, 2009)</ref>, or (3) as a peak-to-peak difference between the P2 and N2 components (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schaefer et al., 2016)</ref>. For our main analysis, we chose to adopt approach 1-operationalizing the FRN as a hit-miss difference for the purpose of the hypothesis testing. In Supplementary material 2, we also present results of the FRN analysis based on approach 2, using the mean amplitude of the EEG signal instead of a difference wave.</p><p>For statistical analyses, we used EEG recordings averaged across all trials within the respective condition in each respective participant's session. We extracted the P3 amplitude from the CPz electrode, since the P3 typically reaches its highest amplitude in the centroparietal region <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Picton, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Polich, 2007)</ref>. To confirm this assumption, we visually inspected the grand averaged sequential topoplot depicting the neural activation following T=0 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2a</ref>). As expected, the positive deflection forming after the 300 ms after T=0 indeed peaks in the centroparietal area. . Panel (a) shows raw data averaged across all participants and all trials, regardless of the condition. Panel (b) shows the difference in EEG amplitudes between the hit and miss trials, in order to clearly demonstrate where the FRN arises. The orange and blue frames point to the time windows from which the P3 and the FRN amplitudes, respectively, were extracted.</p><p>For the FRN (and the analysis in Supplementary material 2), we extracted the amplitudes from the FCz electrode. This electrode was selected because the FRN has the largest amplitude in the frontocentral regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Xu et al., 2021)</ref>. We verified the FRN localization by visually inspecting the sequential topoplot showing the difference in EEG amplitude between hit and miss trials, time-locked to T=0 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2b</ref>). As expected, the largest difference between the hit and miss trials in the time window 200-300 ms formed in the frontocentral region.</p><p>Behavioral analyses of hit rates (i.e., how often the participant hit the flying object) and waiting times (i.e., how long the participant waited before pressing the spacebar to launch the frog) were performed on all trials of all participants. The behavioral analyses reported here were performed on the full set of 300 trials per participant. Excluding a trial from the later EEG analysis due to EEG artifacts did not lead to exclusion of that trial from the behavioral analyses. For waiting times, data transformation was necessary. As is typical for this measure in self-paced tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Schurger et al., 2012)</ref>, we found a positively skewed waiting time distribution <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3b)</ref>. Therefore, for the purposes of our analyses, we calculated the mean waiting time for each participant as well as for each combination of participant and experimental condition. Based on the central limit theorem, we originally assumed that these mean waiting times would be normally distributed.</p><p>However, upon visual inspection, we determined that they clearly were not. Therefore, we reported descriptive statistics using medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) and applied a natural logarithm transformation to mean waiting times ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3c)</ref> for the subsequent ANOVA.</p><p>The extracted P3 amplitude was analyzed using three-way (intention × expectedness × outcome) repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs). The FRN amplitude was analyzed using two-way (intention × expectedness) repeated-measures ANOVA (outcome cannot be analyzed because the FRN is itself a difference wave between the hit and miss trials). Behavioral data (hit rates and waiting times, i.e., time between the trial start and the button press) were analyzed using two-way (intention × likelihood) repeated-measures ANOVAs. All ANOVA analyses included the interaction terms. Significant interaction effects were further explored with post-hoc tests using the Holm method, corrected for a family of 6 for two-way interactions and a family of 28 for three-way interactions.</p><p>For the comparisons where we expected no effect we also performed the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure to check for evidence of no effect in post-hoc comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lakens, 2017)</ref>. To our knowledge, the TOST procedure has not been validated for a complex repeatedmeasures ANOVA with interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Campbell &amp; Lakens, 2021)</ref>. Therefore, we performed the TOST procedure on the individual variable pairs of interest instead. We define equivalence as d &gt; -0.2 ⋀ d &lt; 0.2 (with Cohen's d = 0.2 corresponding to small effect size). In other words, a significant equivalence test would indicate evidence that the observed effect is negligible (i.e., smaller than d = 0.2). TOST results were not corrected for multiple comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Exploratory analysis using EMS filtering</head><p>Given the ambiguous results of the ERP analysis (see Section 3.2), we conducted an exploratory analysis to identify the brain region and time window that could potentially distinguish between surprise (as a proxy for foresight) and error (as a proxy for intention). For this purpose, we applied a method called effect-matched spatial (EMS) filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Schurger et al., 2013)</ref>. This method identifies spatiotemporal patterns that best differentiate between specific conditions by determining which electrodes and time points contribute most to the effect of interest. That is, for each timepoint in an epoch, EMS generates a spatial filter that assigns weights to each electrode, reflecting their contribution to the difference between the two conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Schurger et al., 2013)</ref>. In the version of EMS used here, the method takes two three-dimensional matrices-representing participants, timepoints, and electrodes for each condition-as input. It produces two outputs: (1) a two-dimensional matrix of timepoints and electrodes, containing the weights of the spatial filters (one filter per timepoint), and (2) two two-dimensional matrices of participants and timepoints, containing the weighted averages derived from applying the spatial filters to the input data (so-called surrogate time courses, one per condition).</p><p>For this analysis, we used trimmed epochs of averaged data, ranging from T=0 to 1000 ms later. Note that although trimmed, the epochs remained baselined by the last 500 ms before T=0. For each condition, we organized the data into a three-dimensional data matrix: 16 valid participants by 1001 timepoints by 64 electrodes.</p><p>Because we aimed to find spatiotemporal patterns corresponding to the difference between the effect of foresight and the effect of intention, we first calculated the following difference waves. For foresight, the matrix of data from trials with expected outcome was subtracted from the matrix from trials with unexpected outcome:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ℎ = −</formula><p>The electrodes and timepoints where such a difference is large indicate the spatiotemporal pattern of processing surprise (and by extension foresight); we will therefore call the result of this procedure the foresight matrix.</p><p>On the other hand, our proxy for intention is the assumption that the difference between processing hit and miss will be larger for the intended target than the non-intended target.</p><p>Therefore, for intention, we performed double subtraction. First, we subtracted the intended-miss matrix from the intended-hit matrix (creating what we call the intended_diff matrix).</p><p>Correspondingly, we subtracted the non-intended-miss matrix from the non-intended-hit matrix (creating the non-intended_diff matrix). For simplicity, this first subtraction can be understood as analogous to the hit minus miss subtraction traditionally performed to analyze the FRN (see Section 2.5). Then, we subtracted the non-intended_diff matrix from the intended_diff matrix, creating the final intention matrix:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= ( ℎ − ) − ( − ℎ − − )</formula><p>The intention matrix indicates the "differences in differences" in hits and misses between the trials with intended versus non-intended targets. The electrodes and timepoints where such differences in differences are large indicate the spatiotemporal pattern of processing intention.</p><p>We adjusted the data to address two methodological issues so that the foresight and intention matrices could be compared using the EMS filtering method. The first issue is that the foresight matrix is constructed by a single subtraction, but the intention matrix is constructed by a double subtraction. Because every subtraction of two distributions increases the variance of the resulting distribution, the intention matrix had larger variance than the foresight matrix. To address this issue, we rescaled the data fed into the EMS filtering algorithm using the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">, , = , , − ̅ , , + ̅ ,</formula><p>where n is the participant index, t is the timepoint index, and c is the channel index. Note that the mean ( ̅ , ) and standard deviation ( , ) are calculated for each participant and each timepoint, i.e., across channels. Therefore, ̅ , = ∑ =1 , , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">, = √ ∑ ( , , − ̅ , ) 2 =1 −1</formula><p>, where C denotes the total number of channels (C = 64).</p><p>The second methodological issue is that the direction of the subtraction to construct the foresight and intention matrices is arbitrary. For example, to arrive at the foresight matrix, there is no specific reason to subtract unexpected from expected data and not expected from unexpected data. To address this problem, we squared the differences, hence removing the polarity of EEG deflections from consideration. (Note that this only applies to the unexpected minus expected and intended minus non-intended data. The hit minus miss differences calculated in the first step of the intention matrix construction remained signed.) This step has the convenient added benefit of making the EMS filtering method ignore instances where apparent EEG deflections occur in both intention and foresight patterns-at the same time relative to T=0 and on the same electrodebut with the opposite polarity. In other words, squaring the matrices ensures that the effectmatched differences are only identified at the timepoint and electrode where intention causes an EEG deflection while foresight EEG remains flat, or vice versa.</p><p>We used the EMS class from the decoding subpackage in the MNE toolbox (https://mne.tools/stable/auto_examples/decoding/ems_filtering.html) to calculate a set of 1001 EMS filters (one filter per timepoint) based on the squared and rescaled foresight and intention matrices, with stratified 5-fold cross-validation. These filters serve two functions: (1) they show the amount that each electrode at each timepoint contributes to the difference between foresight and intention, and (2) they can be used as weights for calculating weighted average across electrodes to obtain a single time course of EEG data per participant per condition (such time courses are referred to as surrogate time courses or surrogate trials, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schurger et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Subsequently, we used a paired two-tailed cluster-corrected permutation test (10,000 permutations, max step = 1, threshold p-value = 0.05) to identify the time periods in which the surrogate time courses significantly differ.</p></div>

We also found a slight increase in hit rate in the intended condition (47.14%) relative to the non-intended condition (44.42%), which was expected because the participants should, by design, be more careful when attempting to hit a dragonfly compared to a bubble (F(1,15) = 6.413, p = 0.023, η²p = 0.299).

Therefore, we did not find evidence that the intended and non-intended conditions were equivalent. On the contrary, we found a significant main effect of intention (F(1,15) = 18.622, p &lt; 0.001, η²p = 0.554), showing a larger P3 amplitude in the intended trials (9.55 μV) than in the nonintended trials (6.09 μV) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 4a)</ref>.

The intended-hit condition produced a larger P3 amplitude (11.57 μV) than all other conditions (all pHolm &lt; 0.002).

Finally, missing a dragonfly (intended-miss trials) produced a larger P3 amplitude (7.52 μV) than missing a bubble (nonintended-miss trials) (4.84 μV) (pHolm = 0.004).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Exploratory EMS filtering results</head><p>Because we did not find the hypothesized double dissociation in the P3 and FRN, we used an exploratory approach to identify which electrodes at which times are the most likely to dissociate between foresight and intention, at least at the level of single dissociation.

We used a cluster-corrected permutation test to determine the time windows where these surrogate time courses significantly differ. We found a time window of significant difference, between 0.323 and 0.376 s after the presentation of the trial outcome, where the foresight pattern exhibited significantly larger deflection than the intention pattern, t(15) = -1.857, p = 0.005 (see the highlighted area in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 9</ref>). Temporal evolution of the spatial filter in this time window suggests that the difference is potentially due to foresightrelated deflection in the centro-frontocentral, lateral and frontopolar prefrontal areas and intentionrelated activity in the parietal and occipital cortex <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Fig. 10</ref>).  represents the importance of that scalp region in the given time window for the difference between foresight and intention.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Disentangling neural correlates of intention and foresight</head><p>In this study, we set out to test whether the P3 and the FRN EEG components can be used as indices of foresight and intention, respectively, in a task where foresight and intention can be teased apart. More specifically, we focused on situations where an action leads to an outcome that can be either foreseen or unforeseen as well as intended or not intended, while the participant maintains some control over the outcome. Knowing the correlates of intention and foresight in such situations would be beneficial for future attempts to empirically inform the philosophical debate on the doctrine of double effect, which hinges on the distinction between intention and foresight.</p><p>In our design, the participants engaged in a simple video game, where they controlled a frog that could either hit or miss a target. Hitting the target could be intended or non-intended, i.e., inconsequential, and the outcome could be expected or unexpected. Our hypotheses were that the P3 reflects foresight (or expectedness) of an outcome and that the FRN reflects the intention to bring about the outcome. Our results supported both of these hypotheses. We found that the P3 amplitude was reliably larger in trials when the participant observed an unexpected outcome compared to expected outcome <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 4b</ref>). We also found that the FRN amplitude was larger in the trials where the participants intended to hit the target compared to when they did not (or at least intended less, see Limitations) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figs. 7a)</ref>.</p><p>However, the P3 and FRN were not exclusively related to foresight and intention, respectively. In other words-and in line with some previous studies with similar designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hassall et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Paul et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schaefer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wu &amp; Zhou, 2009)</ref>-the P3 and FRN seem to reflect both intention and foresight (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Walsh &amp; Anderson, 2012)</ref>. Hence, our results did not suggest that the P3 and FRN can be used to dissociate foresight from intention.</p><p>Because we did not find the sought-after dissociation between the P3 and FRN and foresight and intention, respectively, we used an exploratory method based on effect-matched spatial (EMS) filtering (Sections 2.6 and 3.3). The purpose of this analysis was to discover a spatiotemporal pattern of brain activity which would dissociate between foresight and intention, if such a pattern exists in the data. The analysis yielded a pattern of EEG activity occurring approximately between 320 and 380 ms after the outcome presentation. This pattern showed strong foresight-related activity in the centro-frontocentral and frontopolar and lateral prefrontal areas and a weaker but consistent pattern of intention-related activity in the parietal and occipital areas <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">(Fig. 9b</ref>).</p><p>Further research is needed to confirm this pattern. However, the finding generally aligns with the literature. For example, it is expected that a spatiotemporal pattern spanning frontocentral and prefrontal regions would be related to the expectedness of a stimulus. Frontocentral regions are commonly linked to the feeling of surprise in the P3-related literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wessel &amp; Huber, 2019)</ref> and frontopolar regions were shown to be engaged in prediction error monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boorman et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boorman et al., , 2011</ref> or uncertainty processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Badre et al., 2012)</ref> in decision-making tasks. Conversely, parietal activity commonly appears in the literature in relation to intention to move <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aflalo et al., 2022)</ref>, especially in decisions about what choice to make <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Zapparoli et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Zapparoli et al., , 2018</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, our EMS approach also suggests that occipital activity is apparently related to intention. This is an unexpected finding, as the occipital cortex is usually not implicated in intention processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dominik et al., 2024)</ref>. It is possible that occipital activity is in this case related to the visual difference between the intended target (dragonfly) vs. the non-intended target (bubble).</p><p>Further research is needed to address this potential confound. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Implications for the doctrine of double effect</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Other findings related to the P3 and FRN</head><p>Our design allowed us to make further observations regarding the P3 and FRN which go beyond our hypothesis related to the doctrine of double effect. For the P3, we found that besides reflecting foresight, its amplitude was also significantly larger when observing an intended outcome compared to unintended outcome <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 4a)</ref> as well as when observing a target being hit compared to a miss <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 4c)</ref>, especially if hitting the target was intended <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 5a</ref>). Looking for a common denominator of the conditions in which the P3 is the largest-that is, following an intended but unexpected target hit <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 6</ref>)-provides a potential explanation. Arguably, the common feature of these trials is their task-relevant requirement of conscious effort, and-most importantly-their general attentional salience.</p><p>The effect of attention on the P3 has been often suggested before <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Picton, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Polich, 2007)</ref>, and it appears to be the default assumption in more recent applied research <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Knott et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Smart et al., 2014)</ref>. It is possible that attention acts as a confound in our study, enhancing the P3 amplitude in trials that are more task-relevant and attention-attracting. However, our results are unlikely to be exclusively attributable to attention because hitting an intended target (hence receiving points) is arguably similarly salient to missing an intended target (hence losing points), yet these two conditions significantly differed in their P3 amplitude. This suggests that the P3 must additionally reflect at least the valence of the outcome, which was also previously suggested in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wu &amp; Zhou, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>As for the FRN, as hypothesized, we observed that its amplitude indeed reflected the difference in processing the hit and miss trials ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S1c in Supplementary material 2)</ref> and that the size of the difference was modulated by intention <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figs. 7a)</ref>. As stated above, this serves as compelling evidence that the FRN reflects participant's intention. However, similarly to the P3, we found that the FRN was not exclusively associated with intention. Specifically, we found that the FRN amplitude was also influenced by expectedness, where unexpected outcomes generally produced a larger FRN amplitude <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figs. 7b)</ref>. Accordingly, the largest FRN amplitude typically occurred in trials with an intended target and unexpected outcome <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figs. 7c)</ref>.</p><p>This finding leads to the question as to why the FRN seems to be related to the expectation of an action's outcome. It is unclear whether this effect can be attributed to attention as with the P3 because-unlike the P3-the FRN is not commonly associated with attention. A potential explanation can be found in the reinforcement-learning literature. In this context, the FRN is commonly interpreted as a reflection of the prediction error <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burnside et al., 2019)</ref>, in particular a negative prediction error-i.e., when the outcome is worse than expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hajcak et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Isheqlou et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Miltner et al., 1997)</ref>. However-contrary to this classical interpretationsome evidence suggests that the FRN reflects absolute prediction error rather than signed prediction error <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hauser et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sambrook &amp; Goslin, 2015)</ref>. In other words, the FRN is not necessarily an indicator of perceived error in the sense of a mistake, but rather a perceived error with regard to the prediction of the outcome, hence leading to our observation of a larger FRN in the unexpected condition compared to the expected condition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 7b)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Limitations</head><p>This study has two notable limitations. Firstly, our behavioral results suggest that our experimental design was not completely effective in creating the distinction between the intended and non-intended conditions. In our design, we assumed that when hitting a target yielded extra points to the participant (the dragonfly target), the participant would intend to hit the target.</p><p>Conversely, if hitting the target did not yield any points (the bubble target), the participant would be indifferent about hitting it; thus, the participant would have no intention in relation to the target whatsoever (i.e., neither intend to hit it or miss it). However, our results suggest that even in the non-intended conditions, the participants occasionally intended to hit the target. One piece of evidence in favor of this interpretation is that the FRN was present regardless of whether the target was a dragonfly or a bubble <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 7a)</ref>. This could imply that the participants processed missing a target as an error (or hitting it as a success) in both conditions. Moreover, in both the intended condition as well as the non-intended condition, the participants' waiting times were longer in the trials where hitting the target was unlikely compared to likely (see Section 3.1.2).</p><p>This suggests that the participants were at least occasionally aiming to hit the bubbles too, since they took longer to launch the frog if only one bubble was traversing the screen compared to when three bubbles were presented. This might be because the participants only competed for arbitrary points, which translated into no tangible rewards, like monetary payout. Conversely, as there was a skill element in hitting the dragonfly, participants may have used the bubbles to hone their skills at hitting dragonflies. Nevertheless, even if the participants sometimes meant to hit the bubbles, they did so with less effort and less consideration for the outcome than in the dragonfly conditions,</p><p>given that waiting times were longer and the FRN amplitude was larger in the intended (dragonfly) trials than in the non-intended (bubble) trials.</p><p>The second limitation inherent to our study pertains to the analyses of the P3 and the FRN. Namely, the close temporal proximity of the FRN and the P3 EEG components may lead to some cross contamination . For example, a largely positive P3 component in the intended condition might also cause the preceding N2 component (on which the FRN is based)</p><p>in the intended condition to be more positive compared to the non-intended condition. We addressed this issue with two features of our analysis. First, we analyzed the FRN instead of the raw N2. Because the FRN is a differential potential acquired as a difference of hit and miss trials, while the P3 is a raw ERP, it is much less likely that they would cross contaminate. Second, we extracted the P3 and the FRN from different electrodes where each ERP had the largest overall amplitude-CPz for the P3 and FCz for the FRN <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2)</ref>. This way, the risk of contamination is lower than if the two ERPs were extracted from the same electrode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Future directions</head><p>Future studies should focus at least on the following two directions. First, it is important to find a task where the behavior better reflects the potential distinction between foresight and intention. One idea is to focus on moral decisions, as these reflect the types of decisions in which intention and foresight are of particular philosophical and legal interest. Given that the open question in the double effect doctrine is whether, given that a person foresees a specific outcome, there is a neural difference between a situation where they also intend that outcome or not, the experimental design can be simplified considerably by manipulating only the presence of intentions, without varying foresight. For the second direction, it would be critical to focus on teasing apart the neural signatures of foresight and intention more specifically. Such a distinction could be sought beyond EEG, using other methods, such as fMRI. In particular, if opting for the simplified design where only intention varies across conditions, machine learning classifiers might be developed to tease apart the neural signature when intention is present and when it is absent. <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>: The grand-averaged EEG waveforms from the FCz electrode compared by the individual conditions (waveform plots to the left) and the corresponding mean N2 amplitude comparison (bar plots to the right). The shaded areas along the EEG traces indicate 95% confidence bands. The areas bound by the dotted vertical lines in the waveform panels (0.2-0.3 s) represent the windows from which the average N2 amplitude was calculated for the purposes of statistical analysis. The bar plots to the right show the differences in the mean amplitude of the N2 waveform with 95% confidence intervals; * indicates p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, and *** p &lt; 0.001. Note that since our analysis is based on a within-subject design, the differences in means and the confidence intervals shown in the bar plots may not accurately represent statistical significance.</p><p>We further found a significant interaction effect of outcome and intention on the N2 amplitude (F(1,15) = 10.902, p = 0.005, η²p = 0.421) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S2a)</ref>; this result is identical to the main effect of intention in the FRN-based ANOVA, where the outcome variable is incorporated by defining the FRN as the difference between hit and miss trials. As expected, with regard to the N2 amplitude, both hit conditions (intended-hit, 7.48 μV, and non-intended-hit, 4.83 μV) differed from both miss conditions (intended-miss, 1.52 μV, and non-intended-miss, 1.53 μV) (all pHolm &lt; 0.004). Interestingly, this interaction seems to be driven by the differences in the neural signature of hit trials, rather than miss trials. This is because the N2 amplitude in the hit trials significantly differed between the intended and non-intended conditions (pHolm = 0.006), while the N2 amplitude in the miss trials did not (pHolm = 0.995). We exploratorily applied the TOST procedure to seek evidence for absence of difference between the conditions intended-miss and non-intendedmiss. We did not find evidence for an effect smaller than d = 0.2 (d &gt; -0.2: t(15) = 0.794, p = 0.220; d &lt; 0.2: t(15) = -0.806, p = 0.216). However, exploratorily shifting the Cohen's d criterion to 0.5 (the lower end of the "moderate effect" range) yielded significant results (d &gt; -0.5: t(15) = 1.994, p = 0.032; d &lt; 0.5: t(15) = -2.006, p = 0.032). Therefore, if a difference between the intendedmiss and non-intended-miss conditions exists, we obtained suggestive evidence that its effect size is at most "small" (d &lt; 0.5). Although not conclusive, this finding is interesting because it shows that our hypothesized effect of intention on the FRN might not be driven by differences in the negative-outcome-related EEG negativity, but rather by the positive-outcome-related EEG positivity (see the N2 discussion section below). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S2</ref>: The grand-averaged EEG waveforms from the FCz electrode compared by the two-way interactions (waveform plots to the left) and the corresponding mean N2 amplitude comparisons (bar plots to the right). Differences are not shown for post-hoc comparisons whose omnibus test yielded a non-significant result. For detailed explanation, see the caption for <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>.</p><p>We further found that the N2 amplitude is significantly related to the interaction between expectedness and outcome (F(1,15) = 32.478, p &lt; 0.001, η²p = 0.684) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S2b)</ref>; this result is identical to the main effect of expectedness in the FRN-based ANOVA, where the outcome variable is incorporated by defining the FRN as the difference between hit and miss trials.</p><p>Specifically, we found that the difference between the hit and the miss trials in the unexpected condition (7.83 μV and 0.76 μV, respectively; pHolm &lt; 0.001) is clearly larger than the hit-miss difference in the expected condition (4.48 μV and 2.29 μV, respectively; pHolm = 0.003). This corresponds with the finding suggesting that the FRN reflects expectedness, reported in Section 3.2.2. However, unlike in the case of intention, the relationship between the FRN and expectedness is unlikely to be caused solely by the N2 positivity. That is because the difference between the expected-miss trials (2.29 μV) and the unexpected-miss trials (0.76 μV) was also significant (pHolm = 0.004), as was the difference between the expected-hit trials (4.48 μV) and the unexpected-hit trials (7.83 μV) (pHolm &lt; 0.001). The remaining two pairwise comparisons related to this interaction were also significant, showing that the expected-hit trials (4.48 μV) also differed from the unexpected-miss trials (0.76 μV) (pHolm &lt; 0.001) and, vice versa, the unexpected-hit trials (4.48 μV) differed from the expected-miss trials (2.29 μV) (pHolm &lt; 0.001).</p><p>The effect of the interaction between intention and expectedness on the N2 amplitude was not significant, although it was trending towards significance (F(1,15) = 4.357, p = 0.054, η²p = 0.225) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S2c</ref>). Nevertheless, we did not expect to find a significant effect, since the FRN effects are only predicted in the context of outcome.</p><p>Finally, we found a significant three-way interaction effect of intention, expectedness and outcome on the N2 amplitude (F(1,15) = 12.512, p = 0.003, η²p = 0.455) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. S3</ref>); this result is identical to the interaction effect of intention and expectation in the FRN-based ANOVA, where the outcome variable is incorporated by defining the FRN as the difference between hit and miss trials. The post-hoc results provide further insights into the interaction effect of intention and expectedness on the FRN <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1c</ref>) reported in Section 3.2.2. Note that because these post-hoc analyses involve adjustment for a family of 28 tests, the risk of the type-II error (β) is increased compared to the other post-hoc tests reported in this paper, where we only adjust for families of six. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S3</ref>: The mean N2 amplitude comparisons across all conditions with 95% confidence intervals. The bar plots show the differences in the mean amplitude of the N2 waveform with 95% confidence intervals; * indicates p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, and *** p &lt; 0.001.</p><p>Hit-miss differences. By the definition of the FRN, we expected the N2 amplitude in the hit trials in all conditions to differ from the corresponding miss trials. We found a difference between the hit and the miss condition in all trials with unexpected outcomes: between unexpected-intended-hit and unexpected-intended-miss trials (9.84 μV vs. 0.53 μV, pHolm &lt; 0.001) and between unexpected-non-intended-hit and unexpected-non-intended-miss trials (5.81 μV vs. 0.99 μV, pHolm = 0.016). We also found a significant difference between the expectedintended-hit and the expected-intended-miss trials (5.12 μV vs. 2.52 μV, pHolm = 0.045).</p><p>However, interestingly, we did not find a significant difference between the expected-nonintended-hit and the expected-non-intended-miss trials (3.84 μV vs. 2.06 μV, pHolm = 0.137).</p><p>Nevertheless, it should be noted that this unexpectedly inconclusive result might be caused by the strict family-wise p-value correction, since puncorrected = 0.014. To check for evidence for no effect, we applied an exploratory TOST procedure. We did not find evidence of equivalence between the expected-non-intended-hit and the expected-non-intended-miss trials (d &gt; -0.2: t(15) = 4.290, p &lt; 0.001; d &lt; 0.2: t(15) = 2.690, p = 0.992), in line with the notion that the inconclusive result might be due to the family-wise correction.</p><p>Intended-non-intended differences. We found a significant difference between the intended and the corresponding non-intended conditions in the unexpected-hit trials (9.84 μV vs.</p><p>5.81 μV, pHolm = 0.035). The difference was not significant in the unexpected-miss (0.53 μV vs.</p><p>0.99 μV, pHolm = 0.550), expected-hit (5.12 μV vs. 3.84 μV, pHolm = 0.493), and expected-miss trials (2.52 μV vs. 2.06 μV, pHolm = 1.000). This suggests that the main effect of intention on the FRN amplitude <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1a)</ref> is driven predominantly by unexpected hits.</p><p>Expected-unexpected differences. We found a significant difference between expected and unexpected conditions in the intended-hit trials (5.12 μV vs. 9.84 μV, pHolm &lt; 0.001) and</p><p>intended-miss trials (2.52 μV vs. 0.53 μV, pholm = 0.018). We did not find a significant difference in the non-intended-hit trials (3.84 μV vs. 5.81 μV, pHolm = 0.141) and the non-intended-miss trials (2.06 μV vs. 0.99 μV, pHolm = 0.345). This suggests that the main effect of expectedness on the FRN amplitude <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1b)</ref> is driven predominantly by trials where the participant intended to hit the target.</p><p>The highest N2 amplitude. Since it appears that the N2 amplitude is influenced by the main effects of all three independent variables (intention, expectedness, and outcome), we further investigated which combinations of these factors elicits the largest N2 amplitude. We found the largest N2 amplitude in the trials where the participant unexpectedly hit an intended target (9.84 μV). The N2 amplitude in these trials significantly differed from all miss conditions (all pHolm &lt; 0.001), but also all other hit conditions (all pHolm &lt; 0.035). This finding suggests that the N2 amplitude reflects intention, expectedness, and the outcome itself, in a complex, synergistic manner.</p><p>Some significant differences were found in less theoretically interesting comparisons, where more than one condition differed. These results can be found in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. S3</ref> and <ref type="table">Table S8</ref> in</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Supplementary material 3.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary discussion</head><p>The results presented here extend our findings pertaining to the FRN (Section 3.2.2 in the main text). One interesting finding is that aside from the expected effect of outcome (i.e., the difference between the hit and miss trials; <ref type="figure">Fig. S1c</ref>), the N2 also seems to reflect intention, as well as foresight <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1a</ref> and S1b, respectively). Because these two effects are independent of the effect of outcome, the results suggest that intention and foresight influence the N2 beyond the mechanisms affecting the FRN. Although it is possible that this result reflects a property of the N2 potential itself, it is more likely that this finding is due to the contamination of the signal by the temporally adjacent, and much larger, P3 potential (see Section 5 in the main text).</p><p>The N2 results further show complex interactions of the intention and foresight variables with the hit or miss outcome ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S2a</ref> and S2b, respectively). These results reflect the finding of the main effect of intention and foresight on the FRN amplitude presented in Section 3.2.2 in the main text. However, thanks to the more granular approach used here, we found an interesting result informing another debate on the FRN-specifically, whether the FRN truly arises due to an error-related increase in negativity or due to a reward-related decrease in negativity. Several authors have advocated for the latter interpretation, calling for establishing the term rewardpositivity (also commonly referred to as RewP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Holroyd et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Proudfit, 2015</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Krigolson, 2018)</ref>. Our results seem to largely support this notion. We found that the difference in the N2 amplitude between the hit and miss trials was larger in the condition where hitting the target was intended, compared to the non-intended condition (Figs. S2a).</p><p>Importantly-as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S2a</ref> and the related post-hoc tests clearly showed-this effect is due to the difference between the positive peaks in the hit trials. We found no evidence of a difference in the negative peaks in the miss trials and, conversely, found suggestive evidence that they are equivalent.</p><p>For completeness, we also investigated whether the same is the case for expectedness.</p><p>There the results seem to be more ambiguous. The difference in the FRN amplitude between the expected and unexpected conditions was apparently due to the differences in both the hit-related positivity and the miss-related negativity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S2b)</ref>. Hence, this result does not suggest that the effect of expectedness on the N2 would be driven solely by the miss-related negativity.</p><p>Finally, we found some interesting three-way interaction effects, which further clarify these effects. For example, we found suggestive evidence that the effect of intention on the N2 amplitude only becomes statistically significant in the trials where the participant hit a target unexpectedly. Conversely, the effect of expectedness on the N2 amplitude seems to be only present in the trials where the participant intended to hit the target. Further research is needed to verify these unanticipated results and elaborate on them. However, it is noteworthy that we found these complex interaction effects in the N2 analysis and not the P3 analysis (Section 3.2.1 in the main text). This suggests that not all effects found with respect to the N2 amplitude can be explained by a simple cross contamination from the adjacent P3 potential.</p><p>Supplementary material 3: Full ANOVA results and post-hoc results for significant interactions <ref type="table">Table S1</ref> ANOVA results for the P3 amplitude      </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: The stimuli presented to the participant at the beginning of each trial included a large frog, which the participant launched towards the small</figDesc></figure>

If it were possible to empirically demonstrate that acting with intention vs. acting with foresight have distinct neural signatures, it would lend greater merit to the claim that it is possible to foresee a desired outcome without intending it, as in the doctrine of double effect. In contrast, if no such distinct neural correlates exist, this may give us reason to think that intention and foresight are not distinct mental states, making the presupposed distinction assumed by the doctrine of double effect dubious. Rejecting the doctrine would mean that a host of actions historically justified by appealing to the doctrine-for example, tactical bombing and risky medical procedures that result in death-would no longer be justified, or at least require alternate forms of justification.Our results do not definitively settle this debate. We found that, if such a dissociation exists, it is unlikely to rely on the P3 and FRN event-related potentials. However, we found suggestive evidence that information supporting such a dissociation might in fact exist in EEGbased data. Therefore, our results are in line with the notion that it is possible to foresee an outcome without intending it.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary material 1: Experimental instruction</head><p>The following instructions were verbally presented to the participant before the practice block.</p><p>"In this experiment, you will be playing a game with the goal to get the highest score possible. You will control a frog that wants to hop from one moat filled with water to another to join a little baby frog, which will earn you 10 points. You make the frog jump by pressing SPACE.</p><p>In each trial, there will also be several objects flying across the screen from left to right. The objects will either be dragonflies or bubbles. If your frog happens to hit a dragonfly on its way, you receive a bonus of additional 10 points. If your frog hits a bubble, it will not give you any extra points. Keep in mind that by pressing SPACE, you only start the frog's hops, but the frog might have a mind of its own about how fast it will move. Every time before you press SPACE, make sure that you fixate your gaze on the cross approximately in the middle of the screen. Also, remember that the number of trials you will play is limited. You can now try the game in a few practice trials. If everything is clear, you can press SPACE to start."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary material 2: N2 analysis Supplementary analysis</head><p>As stated in Section 2.5 in the main text, there exist multiple approaches to analyzing the FRN amplitude. In this supplementary material, we present the results of the FRN analysis approach based on the raw EEG component over the FCz electrode in the time window 200-300 ms after T=0, also known as the N2 potential. Because this approach does not require a subtraction of the signal in miss trials from that in hit trials, it allows for a more granular insight into the relationship between the FRN and its underlying factors, suitable for detailed auxiliary analysis. However, note that thanks to the inclusion of the interaction terms in the N2 analysis presented here, the approach presented here is in fact statistically equivalent to the approach used in the main text (see footnotes below).</p><p>The N2 amplitude was analyzed using three-way 2×2×2 (intention × expectedness × outcome) repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs), equivalent to how the P3 amplitude was analyzed in the main text. While similar to the FRN, the N2 analysis provides broader exploratory results thanks to the inclusion of the outcome variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary results</head><p>We found a significant main effect of intention (F(1,15) = 4.871, p = 0.043, η²p = 0.245), with a more positive N2 amplitude when the participant observed outcomes related to the intended target (4.50 μV) than the non-intended target (3.18 μV) <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1a)</ref>. We also found a significant main effect of expectedness (F(1,15) = 8.125, p = 0.012, η²p = 0.351), with a more positive N2 amplitude in the trials where the outcome was unexpected (4.29 μV) than when it was expected (3.39 μV) <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1b)</ref>. As predicted-by the nature of the FRN-we found a significant main effect of outcome (F(1,15) = 39.384, p &lt; 0.001, η²p = 0.724), with a more positive N2 amplitude for hits (6.15 μV) than misses (1.53 μV) <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1c)</ref>.</p></div>
