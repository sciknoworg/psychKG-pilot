			<abstract>
				<p>Context effects occur when the preference between two alternatives is affected by the presence of an extra alternative. These effects are some of the most well studied phenomena in multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision making. Recent research in this area has revealed an intriguing pattern of results. On the one hand, these effects are robust and ubiquitous. That is, they have been demonstrated in many domains and different choice settings. On the other hand, they are fragile and they disappear or even reverse under different conditions. This pattern of results has spurred debate and speculation about the cognitive mechanisms that drive these choices. The attraction effect, where the preference for an option increases in the presence of a dominated decoy, has generated the most controversy. In this registered report, we systematically vary factors that are known to be associated with the attraction effect to build a solid foundation of empirical results to aid future theory development. We find a robust attraction effect across the different conditions. The strength of this effect is modulated by the display order (e.g., decoy top, target middle, competitor bottom) and mode (numeric vs. graphical) but not display layout (by-attribute vs. by-alternative).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Decades of research in psychology, economics, marketing, and neuroscience has been dedicated to understanding context effects in multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice. The overwhelming majority of this work has focused on three specific context effects -the attraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Huber et al., 1982)</ref>, similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Tversky, 1972)</ref>, and compromise <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Simonson, 1989)</ref> effects. These effects occur when choices between two alternatives can vary based on the presence of a third alternative. The three effects are important because they violate the principles of classic economic theories of choice including simple scalability, independence of irrelevant alternatives, and regularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Roe et al., 2001)</ref>. Hence, these effects cannot be explained by standard normative models of utility where every option is evaluated independently of each other (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Farmer et al. (2017)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kruis et al. (2020)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Howes et al. (2016)</ref> for rational explanations of context effects). Therefore, researchers have looked for psychological explanations for these effects. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wollschlaeger and Diederich (2020)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Busemeyer et al. (2019)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Trueblood (2022)</ref> for a review of recent findings and computational models.</p><p>Research investigating context effects has revealed an intriguing pattern of results <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Trueblood et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al., 2021b</ref>). On the one hand, context effects, and in particular the attraction effect, seem to be robust and ubiquitous. That is, they occur across a broad variety of different domains, including perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Trueblood et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Trueblood et al., , 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Trueblood, 2015)</ref>, risky decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Farmer et al., 2017)</ref>, inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Choplin and Hummel, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Trueblood, 2012)</ref>, motor-planning decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Farmer et al., 2017)</ref>, and consumer choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dhar et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Huber et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sen, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mishra et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Ratneshwar et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Wedell and Pettibone, 1996)</ref>. In addition, research in developmental psychology and behavioral ecology has shown that the attraction effect occurs in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Zhen and Yu, 2016)</ref>, monkeys <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Parrish et al., 2015)</ref>, cats <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Scarpi, 2011)</ref>, hummingbirds <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bateson et al., 2003)</ref>, frogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Lea and Ryan, 2015)</ref>, honeybees <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Shafir et al., 2002)</ref> and even slime molds <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Latty and Beekman, 2011)</ref>. Thus, there is a sense that contextual sensitivity is a universal property of multi-alternative choice behavior. On the other hand, these effects are also fragile, in that they may disappear or even reverse under certain conditions. The pattern of findings where context effects appear, vanish or reverse have sparked a lively debate about the underlying mechanisms responsible for multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision making (see ; ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Huber et al. (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Trueblood et al. (2015)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tsetsos et al. (2015)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Cohen (2019, 2021a)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Trendl et al. (2021)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Spektor et al. (2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Spektor et al. ( , 2022</ref> for examples). Hence, understanding both the presence and absence of these effects is crucial to theory development.</p><p>Of the three effects, the attraction effect (also known as the asymmetrically dominated alternative effect or the decoy effect) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Huber et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Huber and Puto, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Simonson, 1989)</ref> has received the most attention. In the attraction effect, when choosing between two alternatives -a target and a competitor, the presence of a third decoy alternative that is similar but inferior to the target, increases choices of the target option. The attraction effect has been important both theoretically <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Huber et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dhar and Glazer, 1996)</ref> as well as in applied settings, such as policy issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Herne, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Stoffel et al., 2019)</ref> and understanding gender bias in hiring decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Keck and Tang, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Recent research investigating the attraction effect has revealed an interesting pattern of findings with it appearing, disappearing or reversing under different conditions based on the way information is displayed <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Trueblood et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cohen, 2019, 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Spektor et al., 2022)</ref>. These findings indicate that the way information is displayed, such as the mode of presentation (e.g., numeric versus visual, ; ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Trendl et al. (2021)</ref>), presentation order <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Evans et al., 2021b)</ref>, and presentation format <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chang and Liu, 2008;</ref>, influences the presence of the attraction effect.</p><p>Understanding the appearance and disappearance of the attraction effect can aid theory development and ultimately shed light on the processes that govern multi-alternative, multiattribute choice behavior. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Trueblood et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berkowitsch et al. (2014)</ref> showed that the compromise and attraction effects often co-occur while the similarity effect is negatively related to them. This pattern of correlations is now a benchmark for theories of context effects. Going forward, findings in  and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al. (2021b)</ref> showing that the attraction effect depends on presentation layout and presentation order of the options might also become benchmarks for theories of context effects. However, more empirical work is needed to establish these and other moderators of the attraction effect before they are adopted as modeling benchmarks. The present work aims to accomplish this goal.</p><p>Current models of multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision making do not make predictions about the dependence of context effects on presentation formats <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Roe et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Usher and McClelland, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bhatia, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Trueblood et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Turner et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Noguchi and Stewart, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Busemeyer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Trueblood, 2022)</ref>. These models use attribute values as inputs and describe how these values are transformed and compared to each other over time to produce a choice. They do not explain how the presentation format might affect these mechanisms.</p><p>For example, one leading model of context effects is the Multiattribute Linear Ballistic Accumulator (MLBA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Trueblood et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Evans et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Turner et al., 2018)</ref>. According to the MLBA, preference for an option is calculated as a weighted sum of pairwise comparisons between that option and the other options in the choice set. The weights (serving as a proxy for attention) on each pairwise comparison are related to the similarity of the attributes being compared, with more weight placed on options with similar attributes. When a decoy option that is similar but inferior to the target is introduced in the choice set, more weight is placed on that difference. Thus, comparisons of the target and decoy (which are favorable to the target) are weighted more when calculating preference. This leads to the target being chosen more often, resulting in the attraction effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Trueblood et al., 2014)</ref>. This model could be extended in various ways to explain the impact of presentation formats on context effects. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al. (2021b)</ref> extended the MLBA to explain how the temporal presentation of options influences the attraction effect. With regards to spatial order, the attention paid during a comparison might also be a function of the spatial proximity of different alternatives, where alternative pairs that are spatially close to each other receive more attention. However, in its original form, the MLBA makes no predictions about how attention might depend on the way the information is presented.</p><p>To understand the complex dependence of context effects on presentation formats, theorists will have to elaborate on the processes that convert information from the external displays to internal representations . One might for example theorize about attentional processes that select information from external displays. These attention processes have been identified to play a central role in decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Krajbich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Krajbich, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Noguchi and Stewart, 2018)</ref> and multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Trueblood, 2022)</ref>. This may result in modifying a model, as described above in the case of the MLBA, where alternative pairs are selected based on their spatial proximity and other visual factors. Eye tracking studies have suggested that the processes that select information from external displays are important and of theoretical interest, since they are interwoven with decision making processes such as comparison and evidence accumulation <ref type="bibr">Stewart, 2014, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Krajbich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Krajbich, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Theory building requires one to have a robust set of empirical findings that lays the groundwork for model development. As we shall see in the following section, existing literature reports conflicting empirical results regarding the impact of presentation format on the attraction effect. Past studies have also used a wide range of tasks and stimuli. For example, some studies have focused on perceptual decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Trueblood et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Spektor et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al., 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Spektor et al., 2022</ref>) as compared to preferential choice <ref type="bibr">Cohen, 2019, 2021b)</ref>. Further, some studies have shown that the attraction effect fails to replicate in certain situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Xiao et al., 2020)</ref>. This paper builds on recent studies examining the dependence of multiattribute choice on presentation format and provides a comprehensive account of how presentation mode, layout, and order impact the attraction effect, providing rich empirical results for future theory development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Presentation Format Factors</head><p>In this section, we review the different presentation factors that are known to affect the attraction effect. We have identified three important factors that are thought to affect the attraction effect -mode of presentation, presentation layout, and presentation order.  argued that the attraction effect only occurs for numerically presented stimuli. They showed that most of the previous experiments demonstrating the attraction effect used information presented in a numerical format. They found that the attraction effect failed to generalise to naturalistic stimuli that did not use numbers. For example, in one scenario, they asked participants to choose between apples and oranges shown in pictures, where the decoy option was a moldy apple or a bruised orange. In another image based choice scenario, they asked participants to choose between Tropicana orange juice and milk by targeting the Tropicana orange juice by adding a 'stop and shop orange juice' as a decoy. They also showed that graphical information, such as pie-charts, did not bring about the attraction effect. These results were further bolstered by , who independently found that images, verbal descriptions, and qualitative descriptions failed to produce the attraction effect. For example, in one scenario, participants chose between 'Coca-Cola' and 'Sprite' with either the decoy 'Cola' or 'Refreshe' respectively. In another example, participants chose between three named food dishes based on their calorie content and price. The options were 'Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad' and a 'Grilled Steak Caesar Salad' with either the decoy 'Crispy Chicken Caesar Salad' or 'Flat Iron Steak Frites' respectively. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Trendl et al. (2021)</ref> showed that the attraction effect does not occur for naturalistic stimuli, specifically choices among movies based on their title. Hence, they argued that the attraction effect is very limited and only occurs in highly stylized experiments with numerical stimuli. This is in contrast to findings that the attraction effect holds with qualitative descriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kivetz et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sen, 1998)</ref> and physical objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Simonson and Tversky, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Ratneshwar et al., 1987)</ref>. In fact, studies had shown that the attraction effect persists even when participants are asked to perform low level perceptual tasks such as judging the similarity of shapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Choplin and Hummel, 2005)</ref> or choosing rectangles with the largest area <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Trueblood et al., 2013)</ref>. All of these studies failed to replicate in  when picnickers were used as participants (except for <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Choplin and Hummel (2005)</ref> which was not tested). Since then, other studies such as  have recreated the attraction effect using bar graphs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dimara et al. (2016)</ref> have recreated it using scatter plot display formats, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al. (2021b)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Turner et al. (2018)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Farmer et al. (2017)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Trueblood et al. (2015)</ref> recreated it with perceptual stimuli similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Trueblood et al. (2013)</ref>. Taken together,  identified the 'concreteness' of representation as an important factor moderating the attraction effect. In our experiment, we use both graphical displays as in  along with numerical displays to test the importance of presentation mode (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for examples of graphical and numerical stimuli used).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1">Mode of Presentation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.2">Presentation Layout</head><p>The presentation layout of information has been shown to influence the presence of context effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chang and Liu, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cohen, 2018, 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Liu and Trueblood, 2023)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chang and Liu (2008)</ref> and  the authors showed that changing the display of options from "by-attribute" to "by-alternative" impacted context effects. The by-attribute format lists alternatives in rows and attributes in columns and facilitates easy comparison of the same attribute for different alternatives. The by-alternative format lists alternatives in columns and attributes and rows and is designed to impede comparisons between alternatives, thus different alternatives are compared more holistically rather than by their individual attributes.  showed that when the alternatives are compared in a by-attribute format, the attraction effect appears. However, when alternatives are compared in a by-alternative format, then the attraction effect disappears. Hence, by-attribute and by-alternative display formats have been identified as a strong modulator of the attraction effect .</p><p>However, other studies examining by-attribute and by-alternative formats have found conflicting results. For example, Cataldo and Cohen (2021b) used both graphical (two experiments) and numerical (three experiments) formats. We reanalyzed their data and found a complex pattern of attraction and repulsion effects (full details and results are presented in the supplementary materials). Briefly, similar to , our reanalysis found that graphical formats showed an attraction effect in the by-attribute format but a weak repulsion effect in one of their two experiments in the by-alternative format. Regarding the numerical format, in one experiment where attributes were presented along rows and alternatives along columns, we found a net null effect. In a second experiment, when alternatives were presented in rows and attributes in columns, we observed a weak attraction effect. Finally, in a third experiment, with a similar format as the second experiment, when boxes were drawn around the attributes, potentially to facilitate more attribute-wise comparison, once again, we observed a net null effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Liu and Trueblood (2023)</ref> conducted experiments where participants had to choose between tasks based on difficulty and length. They used numerical by-attribute and by-alternative formats similar to the ones in this paper. They observed a weak repulsion effect and no attraction effect in all of the formats among a large variety of manipulations. These results challenge the ideas that concreteness of representation  and numerical formats  are essential to the emergence of the attraction effect.</p><p>In our experiment, we follow  and present information in a by-alternative and by-attribute format to test the importance of presentation format. We cross this manipulation with presentation mode to examine how presentation format impacts graphical versus numerical stimuli. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for examples of by-alternative and byattribute formats used in our experiment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al. (2021b)</ref> showed that the order in which the three options, target (T), competitor (C) and decoy (D), are presented can modulate the attraction effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al. (2021b)</ref> re-analysed data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Trueblood et al. (2015)</ref> where the spatial order (i.e., the left to right placement) of the three options was varied. When all orderings were considered together, these stimuli showed a small attraction effect. However, of the 6 orders, 3 orders (CTD, DTC, and TDC, where the order of the letters corresponds to the left, middle, and right placement of options) showed a strong attraction effect, 2 orders (DCT and TCD) showed a strong repulsion effect, and 1 order (CDT) showed a null/weak attraction effect. Their conclusion was that the close proximity of the target and the decoy facilitated a series of comparisons that brought about the attraction effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.3">Presentation Order</head><p>In a reanalysis of , we also examined the impact of presentation order on attraction and repulsion effects (full results are presented in the supplementary materials). This experiment used graphical formats similar to  shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. To summarize, the impact of presentation order differed between by-attribute and by-alternative formats for graphically represented options. As mentioned above, the by-alternative format had a weak repulsion effect on average. However, this repulsion effect was only significant in two of the 6 orders -TCD and TDC. In contrast, in the by-attribute format, there was a significant attraction effect on average. However, it was strongly significant in 3 of the 6 orders (CTD, DTC and TDC) and weakly significant in the TCD order. As shown in the supplementary materials, these results change slightly when the exclusion criterion is removed.</p><p>Hence, in the by-attribute graphical formats, the attraction effect is the strongest with the same orders as those of the perceptual decision making from <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al. (2021b)</ref>. However, none of the orders show a repulsion effect. For the by-alterantive format, none of the orders showed an attraction effect. However, TCD showed a repulsion effect as in the perceptual decision making task. Intriguingly, compared to the perceptual decision making task and the by-attribute graphical display, the reversal with TDC suggests an interaction between presentation layout and presentation order.</p><p>In our experiment, we vary the order in which the options are presented to participants to test whether the presentation order continues to influence the attraction effect in all of the conditions mentioned above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Experimental Aims</head><p>Previous studies have independently examined the impact of various presentation factors on the attraction effect. As mentioned above, these studies have used a vast set of stimuli and tasks and have come to different conclusions.  and  showed that the attraction effect is weaker with graphical stimuli than with numerical stimuli. However, since then, the attraction effect has been recreated using graphical stimuli <ref type="bibr">Cohen, 2019, 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Trueblood et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Spektor et al., 2018)</ref>. It has also been reversed for numerical stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Liu and Trueblood, 2023)</ref> or found to be weaker in our re-analysis of data from Cataldo and Cohen (2021b) with numerical stimuli. There have only been a few studies <ref type="bibr">Cohen, 2019, 2021a</ref>) that examine the dependence of the attraction effect on presentation layout (by-alternative versus by-attribute). These studies show that presentation layout modulates the attraction effect in graphical displays. The influence of presentation layout on the attraction effect with numerical stimuli has been either null or weakly positive or negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Liu and Trueblood, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cataldo and Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 16, No. 5, September 2021</ref> ATTRACTION EFFECT Cohen, 2021b) (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chang and Liu (2008)</ref> for modulation of the compromise effect with numerical stimuli). The effect of changing presentation order has been shown for perceptual decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Evans et al., 2019)</ref>, but it remains unknown how order impacts numerical stimuli. In our reanalysis of Cataldo and Cohen (2021a), we showed that the impact of changing presentation order may be different for consumer decision making in different presentation formats. Hence, empirically, it is not clear which of these effects are robust. Further, as shown with our reanalysis of , presentation layout and presentation order might interact with each other. Thus, it is important to systematically vary all of these factors in a single large-scale experiment.</p><p>At this point, we reiterate the theoretical positions and predictions made by different studies.  and  predict that the attraction effect will be stronger or only occur when information is represented in numerical formats as compared to graphical formats.  hypothesized that this might be due to the fact that numerical formats are represented more concretely, making the domination of the decoy by the target clearer.  predict that the attraction effect will be stronger in by-attribute formats than by-alternative formats since this facilitates more comparisons between options. This is consistent with the idea that certain comparisons are facilitated in certain formats and that these comparisons are integral to the construction of choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Spektor et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stewart, 2014, 2018)</ref>. For presentation order, the results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al. (2021b)</ref> indicate that the attraction effect is enhanced when the decoy and the target occupy neighboring positions. This might also be due to an ease of comparison between the target and the decoy.</p><p>In order to lay the groundwork for further theory development, we need a comprehensive understanding of how different aspects of presentation format impact multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice. However, it is not clear which of these findings are robust and generalizable. Since existing theories do not naturally (without modification) predict or explain these presentation effects, we think it is important to lay a firm foundation for future theory building. That is the development of new models or extensions to existing models that can account for more complex patterns of behavior. Thus, there is a need to evaluate which of these formats facilitate the attraction effect and which ones potentially reverse it. We address this need in this paper by using a factorial design to carefully manipulate the different presentation factors that are thought to affect the size and direction of the attraction effect.</p><p>Further, the combined effects of these factors are not known. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al. (2021b)</ref> argued that the presentation order facilitates certain comparisons between options that are spatially closer to each other. Similarly  argued that byalternative and by-attribute displays facilitate certain comparisons between the alternatives and attributes. However, when both the manipulations are implemented simultaneously, it is not immediately clear what the results will be without an empirical test. Our re-analysis of  suggests that there might be interesting ways in which these factors interact with each other.</p><p>Our approach differs from the recommendation made by proponents of the crucial experimentation hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lakatos, 1974)</ref> or the strong induction hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Platt, 1964)</ref> where experiments are designed to test competing models. Instead, we systematically vary factors that are of relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almaatouq et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dubova et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Peterson et al., 2021)</ref> to multialternative, multiattribute decision making and the attraction effect more specifically. As mentioned above, the current models of multiattribute choice do not make strong predictions about how presentation formats impact decision-making. This experiment will serve as a high-powered benchmark and provide researchers with a robust set of empirical findings that will aid in future model development <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Noguchi and Stewart, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Turner et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Trueblood et al., 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Method</head><p>In our experiment, we examine the presence of the attraction effect among 6 different consumer goods (3 novel goods and 3 goods from Noguchi and Stewart (2014)) by varying the mode of presentation, presentation layout, and presentation order in which the options are displayed. We use 2 different presentation modes (numerical and graphical), 2 different presentation layouts (by-alternative and by-attribute), and 6 different presentation orders. This gives a total of 24 ternary choice conditions. The data and analysis code are available on the Open Science Framework at https://osf.io/wzct3/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Participants</head><p>We aimed to recruit a total of 2300 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk using CloudResearch in exchange for a cash payment of $0.50 per person. We include participants who were over 18 years of age and based in the United States with matching IP addresses. To maintain data quality, we only allowed individuals that had a 95% or higher HIT approval rate and were approved by Cloud Research's attention and engagement measures to participate. Using CloudResearch, we also blocked participants based on their list of suspicious geocode locations and with duplicate IP addresses. We pre-registered our manuscript after first stage acceptance on the Open Science Framework (OSF): https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/sgj3w. The experiment was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Indiana University. We only consider the data of the individuals who completed the entire experiment.</p><p>Since the goals of our experiment are exploratory, we will test the robustness of our results with and without exclusions. We apply two exclusion criteria that are often used in the literature. We included two attention checks in our experiment to exclude participants who were not attentive during the experiment. In previous experiments, for example, ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al. (2021b)</ref>, participants were excluded for failing catch trials. The panels on the left show the graphical formats and the panels on the right show the numerical formats. The top row contains examples of the by-alternative layout. The bottom row contains examples of the by-attribute layout. In each condition, Apartments A and B are the target and competitor respectively. Apartment C is the decoy option that is dominated by A but not by B.</p><p>In the same vein, we will exclude participants who chose the decoy option for more than 3 out of 12 trials since they selected an option that was dominated.</p><p>Ultimately, a total of 2293 participants completed the experiment (903 males, 1357 females, 20 non-binary/third gender, 13 preferred not to say; Age in years: M = 43.3, SD = 13.4, IQR: 33 − 53; Race: 1791 White, 218 Black or African American, 136 Asian, 74 Multiracial, 14 American Indian Or Alaska Native, 6 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 54 preferred not to say; Income: 163 Less than $15,000, 211 $15,000-$25,000, 561 $25,000-$50,000, 525 $50,000-$75,000, 494 $75,000-$120,000, 273 more than $120,000, 66 preferred not to say). As described below, there were four between-subject conditions. In the binary, by-alternative condition we had 147 participants. In the binary, by-attribute condition we had 150 participants. In the ternary, by-alternative condition we had 999 participants. In the ternary, by-attribute condition we had 997 participants. The experiment took an average of 6.8 (IQR: 4.1 − 7.6) minutes to complete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Size Calculation:</head><p>We analyze the attraction effect using the relative choice share of the target (RST) determined by the ternary choice sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berkowitsch et al., 2014)</ref>. The RST is defined as the ratio of the number of times the target has been selected to the number of times the target and the competitor have been selected: If the RST is significantly greater than 0.5, then there is evidence of an attraction effect. RST values significantly less than 0.5 provide evidence of a repulsion effect. To estimate the sample size ( ), we conducted the following power analysis. We assumed that each trial is a Bernoulli variable with an underlying probability of of selecting the target. To show evidence of the attraction effect, we need to show that the probability of selecting the target is significantly greater than 0.5 on trials where either the target or competitor was selected (that is, we exclude the trials where the decoy was selected). This is equivalent to testing whether the RST value is significantly greater than 0.5. We tested this using an exact binomial test.</p><p>Suppose that we observe that the target has been selected target out of (= target + competitor ) times. The exact binomial test will be significant if target is greater than the threshold that is given by the 97.5 ℎ percentile of the binomial distribution generated with a probability of 0.5 with repetitions. Suppose our desired power is , we would want this result to be significant with a probability of at least . We find the smallest such that the outcome is target of a binomial random variable generated with a probability with trials is greater than with a probability of . We plot these values for different probabilities of selecting the target and power in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>To select an estimate of the probability of selecting the target, we used publicly available data from  to calculate RST values. We present all of our results in the supplementary materials. As described in the following section, these stimuli used identical attribute names and values as some of the stimuli used in our experiment. The RST values were 82.0%, 80.0% and 64.4% for the stimuli considered in our experiment. However, other studies find much lower values, such as 50.4% and 55.2% in .</p><p>As shown in the Figure, the number of trials required changes drastically when the probability of selecting the target is around 0.55. At a reasonably high power of 0.95, we would require about 900 trials to detect an effect with an underlying probability of selecting the target of 0.58 after accounting for the Bonferroni correction at = 0.05/24. Since we have a total of 6 (order) x 2 (layout) x 2 (format) = 24 ternary choice conditions, we need a total of 21, 600 ternary choice trials. Since each participant does 12 trials, we obtain about 1800 participants. Participants choose the decoy option about 5% − 10% of the time . These trials will need to be removed from our RST analysis. We account for this in our estimate and obtain our estimate of 2000 participants. These calculations assume that our analyses are conducted by combining the 6 different consumer goods in our experiment. We also plan to analyze old stimuli (i.e., the three consumer goods from ) and novel stimuli separately to test for reliability and generalizability. If we consider each of the 6 goods separately, we obtain about 150 trials per condition. Thus, we will have 450 trials per condition after combining the three old consumer goods and 450 trials per condition after combining the three new consumer goods. This will allow us to detect an effect when the underlying probability of selecting the target is about 0.61 with a power of 0.95 when we separately analyze old and new consumer goods.</p><p>We conducted a power analysis using nested model comparison to test the strength of the interaction effects. Here we summarize the key results and provide the details in the supplementary materials. We quantify the effect size as the increase in the probability of selecting the target by . We see that with a power of 0.95, for the mode and layout interaction, we can observe an interaction effect of size 0.05 when all the consumer goods are analyzed together and an effect of size 0.07 when old and novel goods are analyzed separately.</p><p>For the order and mode interaction, the effect can be driven by different levels of order. The effect can be driven by a single level of order (e.g. Order DTC (decoy, target, competitor) and Numerical Mode) or by several different levels of orders interacting with the mode. In the supplementary materials, we present the results of the power analysis when there are 1, 2, and 3 possible levels of order interacting with the mode. When we combine all consumer products, with a power of 0.95, we will be able to detect an effect of size 0.09 when there is a single level of order interacting with the mode and 0.07 when two or three levels of order interact with the mode. When old and new goods are analyzed separately, with a power of 0.95, we will be able to detect an effect of size 0.11 when it is driven by one level of order interacting with the mode and an effect of size 0.08 when it is driven by two or three levels. These results are the same for the interaction between order and layout since both mode and layout have the same number of levels.</p><p>We only show the results of the three way interaction when a single level of order interacts with the other two variables. When we combine the consumer goods, with a power of 0.95, we will be able to detect an effect of size 0.16. When we analyze old and new goods separately, with a power of 0.95, we will be able to detect an effect of size 0.22.</p><p>Apart from the ternary trials mentioned above, to observe choice proportions between the target and the competitor in the absence of the decoy option, we decided to include binary choice trials. These will be presented in 2 different layouts and 2 different formats giving us 4 conditions. Since we will not analyze the binary trials based on order, we do not account for that factor in this calculation (but note that order is randomized). Since we need 900 trials per condition, we will need 3600 trials. Since each individual will do 12 trials, we obtain our estimate of 300 additional participants. This takes our total to 2300 participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Materials</head><p>We used six different consumer goods for our experiment. The consumer goods, attribute names, and attribute values are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. To construct a binary choice set, we present the two alternatives in one of two possible orders and . For a ternary choice set where the options are shown in one particular order (e.g. DTC: Decoy, Target, Competitor from left to right), there are 6 choice sets with one decoy (e.g. ) and another 6 choice sets with the other decoy (e.g. ), yielding a total of 12 ternary choice sets. For each stimuli, we generated four different question formats in a 2x2 design [mode: graphical vs numerical] x [layout: by-alternative vs by-attribute]. Examples of these different formats can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Since we were primarily interested in studying the importance of presentation format, we uniformly chose attributes that had a positive valence. That is, larger values were considered to be more desirable. As shown in the supplementary materials, three of these stimuli -paper towels, highlighters, and walking shoes and their numerical values -were identical to stimuli used in  and demonstrated strong significant attraction effects (Paper Towels: RST= 82.0%, &lt; 0.001; Highlighter: RST=80.0%, &lt; 0.001; Walking Shoes: RST=64.4%, = 0.008). In the experimental program, one of the attribute values for the walking shoes was erroneously copied from . Specifically, the comfort for should have been 58 instead of 26. Despite the error, is still dominated by but not and serves as an attraction decoy. Hence, we retain the walking shoes in our analyses but do not treat them as an old product. We note that walking shoes show a standard attraction effect when analyzed separately with an RST=61.7%, &lt; 0.001, as shown in the supplementary materials. However, since is from the original Noguchi and Stewart (2014), we do not treat it as a new product either.</p><p>The other three consumer goods -apartments, cars, and laptops -have also been used in context effects research <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Simonson and Tversky, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Evans et al., 2019)</ref>. For each product, the two attributes were on a 0-10 scale. In order for X and Y to have similar preference levels (assuming equal weight on the two attributes), the sum of the two attributes of X was similar to the sum of the two attributes of Y. Further, these ratings were mostly in the 4-10 range, so neither option would be too unfavorable on one of the attributes. Here we use novel numerical attribute values for these items to test the generalizability of our results. The attribute values for the 6 stimuli used in the experiment. For each stimulus, there were two different alternatives and . Two additional decoy alternatives were and such that these were strictly dominated by and respectively. The ternary choice set for each consumer good consisted of , and one of the two decoy options or . For every participant, for each consumer good, the decoy option was selected randomly. The binary choice set consisted of a choice between and in the two orders.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Procedure</head><p>During the course of the experiment, every participant answered a total of 12 questions over two blocks. The small number of trials per participant is based on the suggestion made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lichters et al. (2015)</ref> to avoid learning processes in repeated choice and since context effects are thought to be attenuated with a high frequency of repeated choices. In between the two blocks, we included ten filler trials in which participants were asked to name different state capitals in the United States of America. This distractor task was added based on the suggestion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lichters et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hutchinson et al. (2000)</ref> to avoid carry over effects and psychological reactivity from previous trials.</p><p>At the start of the experiment, each participant was assigned to one of 2x2 betweensubjects conditions [choice type: binary, ternary] x [layout: by-alternative vs by-attribute]. The layout of the options (as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) remained constant for participants throughout the experiment. The two blocks of the experiment were the graphical block and the numerical block. The order of the two blocks was randomized across participants. For each question, participants, depending on the condition they were assigned, saw two or three options of a consumer good and were asked to select the one that they preferred. The graphical block presented questions in a graphical format using bar graphs and the numerical block presented questions in a numerical format using tables. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for examples of questions in different formats.</p><p>Each block consisted of 6 questions with the 6 different consumer goods from <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Each consumer good appeared once in each block. For each consumer good, the decoy ( or ) was randomly selected for each question in the first block. Since there were only 2 binary presentation orders (XY and YX), these were randomized for every participant. For the ternary choice condition, the presentation order (of the target, competitor and decoy) was pseudo-randomly varied such that each participant saw all 6 orders. In the second block, the choice sets and order of alternatives were the same as in the first block. The only difference between the first and second block was the presentation mode (numerical versus graphical). The randomization was designed so that each of the 24 ternary conditions -2 presentation modes, 2 presentation layouts, 6 orders, and 2 decoy types (i.e., or ) -were counterbalanced. The two binary conditions were shown as often as 1 of the 24 ternary conditions, balanced equally in the two presentation orders XY and YX.</p><p>There were two attention checks (e.g. the true/false question "I have never used a computer") at different points in the experiment. At the end of the experiment, participants were asked for their demographic information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Planned Analyses</head><p>In this section, we describe the planned analyses1. First, we analyzed each of our 24 ternary choice conditions separately, then we conducted a single factor analysis to test for the attraction effect in different conditions, and finally we used nested logistic regression model comparisons to test for main and interaction effects. We also planned to conduct the same analyses combining the three stimuli from  to test for reliability. However, we departed from our planned analysis and excluded the shoes from the old stimuli due to a difference in our stimulus values as compared to the original values 1Since our tests were exploratory, a conservative approach to minimize Type-I (false positive conclusion) error would use a Bonferroni correction taking into account all 38 tests [24 single condition analyses; 10 (2 Mode, 2 Layout, 6 Order) single factor analyses; 4 (3 two-way interactions, 1 3-way interaction) interaction tests]. This would result in a p-value cut-off of p=0.05/38 = 0.001316. However, this approach would also increase Type-II (false negative conclusion) errors. Hence, we used a Bonferroni correction for each of the analyses separately and report the associated p-value cutoff.</p><p>as described in . Additionally, we ran the analyses combining the three novel stimuli to test for generalizability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Single Condition Analysis</head><p>We were first interested in a model-free test where we make no underlying assumptions about how the different conditions give rise to the attraction effect. To this end, as described in our power analysis, we conducted an exact binomial test for each of the 24 ternary choice conditions separately to test if the RST value was significantly different from 0.5. We corrected for multiple comparisons using a Bonferroni correction to the p-value, resulting in a significance cutoff of = 0.05/24 = 0.002 for each of the ternary conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Single Factor Analysis</head><p>We were interested in how the different presentation factors impacted the attraction effect. First, we were interested in testing whether presentation layout influences the attraction effect (e.g., does the by-attribute layout produce an attraction effect?) To this end, we aggregated all decisions made in the by-attribute layout condition. We then conducted an exact binomial test against a probability of 0.5 to test if the RST value was significantly different. We repeated this for the by-alternative layout. We corrected for multiple comparisons using a Bonferroni correction, setting the significance cutoff at = 0.05/2 = 0.025.</p><p>We performed similar analyses for the mode variables and order variables. Since there were two different modes, the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was set at = 0.05/2 = 0.025. Since there were six different orders, the Bonferroni correction was set at = 0.05/6 = 0.0083.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Interaction Effects</head><p>To test for interaction effects, we conducted a nested logistic regression model comparison. We set the selection of the target as the dependent variable. We compared the added advantage of including various interaction terms in the model to a null model with only the main effects. We planned to include by-subject random intercepts barring any model convergence issues. We used the likelihood ratio test for our nested model comparison with significance at the = 0.05 level.</p><p>We tested for the interaction between mode and format by comparing the null model Mode + Format to the model with the interaction term Mode + Format + Mode*Format.</p><p>We tested for the interaction between mode and order by comparing the null model Mode + Order to the model with the interaction term Mode + Order + Mode*Order. If the interaction tests were significant, we looked at individual contrasts for the mode and order interaction terms. When testing for the interaction between layout and order, our null model was Layout + Order and our model with the interaction term was Layout + Order + Layout*Order. If the interaction tests were significant, we looked at individual contrasts for the layout and order interaction terms.</p><p>To test for three-way interactions, we compared the null model Mode + Layout + Order+ Mode*Layout+ Mode*Order+ Layout*Order to the model with the additional three-way interaction term Mode + Layout + Order+ Mode*Layout+ Mode*Order+ Layout*Order+ Mode*Layout*Order. If the interaction test was significant, we looked at individual contrasts for the Mode, Layout, and Order interaction terms.</p></div>

First, we analyzed the data by collapsing across all six product types. Standard attraction effects, indicated by RST values significantly greater than 0.5, were observed in 23 out of 24 ternary choice conditions, after the Bonferroni correction ( = 0.05/24 = 0.002). The graphical × by-alternative × TCD condition was not significant after the Bonferroni correction, but was in the direction of a standard attraction effect ( = 0.544, = 0.008). Next, we partitioned the data into old products (i.e., Highlighters and Paper Towels from Noguchi and Stewart (2014)) and new products (i.e., Apartments, Laptop, Cars). As described in the methods, we excluded them from the new and old products. After the Bonferroni correction ( = 0.05/24 = 0.002), there was a significant standard attraction effect in 20 out of 24 ternary choice conditions for the old products and 11 out of 24 ternary choice conditions for the new products. The results of analyses performed on data sets after exclusions were similar and are reported in the supplementary materials.</p></div>

Standard attraction effects (i.e., RST values significantly greater than 0.5) were observed across all levels of the three factors of interest (i.e., Mode, Layout, and Order). These results held when the old and new product groups were analyzed separately. The results of analyses performed on data sets after exclusions are similar and are reported in the supplementary materials. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Interaction Effects</head><p>The results of analyses testing the interaction effects are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. As described in the planned analysis, we treated the subject as a random effect to account for individual differences.

As in the previous analysis, we use deviation coding so that the comparisons are made to the mean and not to the contrast class. We present our results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5 (left model)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hlavac, 2022)</ref>.

We also observed the attraction effect is significantly stronger in the DTC condition. It was significantly weaker in the DCT and TCD conditions where the target and the decoy were not adjacent to each other. For the conditions CDT and DTC, the strength of the effect is similar to the mean effect. These results indicate that the strength of the attraction effect is modulated by the order in which the three choice options were presented.</p><p>We observed that the strength of the attraction effect was significantly weaker in the graphical format than in the numerical format. There was no difference in the strength of the attraction effect in the by-attribute and by-alternative conditions. These results show that the strength of the attraction effect was modulated by the mode. However, there was no main effect of the layout.</p><p>We also tested whether the strength of the attraction effect was different for the old consumer products from Noguchi and Stewart (2014) as compared to the new consumer products. We added an extra variable 'product type' and tested another logistic regression: Target Selection ∼ Mode + Layout + Order + Product Type + (1|subject). As described in the methods, the products from Noguchi and Stewart (2014) -highlighter and paper towels -were coded as old. Further, apartments, laptops, and cars were coded as new. Shoes were coded separately. The variables used deviation coding, so the comparison is made to the mean effect. We present our results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> (right model). We observed that the strength of the attraction effect was modulated by the product type variable, with older stimuli producing a stronger attraction effect. Thus, the specific attributes and attribute values that were used in the experiment were also important in modulating the attraction effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">General Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we conducted a high-powered pre-registered experiment where we varied the mode (numerical vs. graphical), layout (by-attribute vs. by-alternative), and order as presentation factors thought to modulate the attraction effect . Previous literature had suggested that the attraction effect was fragile and required the stimuli to be presented in some specific formats, without which the attraction effect would disappear or reverse. We observed that the attraction effect was robust to each of these factors, often producing strong attraction effects where the target was chosen at an average 1.5 times as often as the competitor (i.e., RST = 0.6). While we observed a robust attraction effect across our various manipulations, the strength of the effect was modulated by the display factors. It was consistently stronger for some factors p-values less than p = 0.05/7 for the left model and p = 0.05/8 for the right model are in bold. * p&lt;0.05; * * p&lt;0.01; * * * p&lt;0.001</p><p>as compared to others. Specifically, we observed a dependence on order and mode. This indicates that the format in which information is displayed plays a role in decision-making processes.</p><p>Regarding order, we found the weakest attraction effect when the target and the decoy were not adjacent to each other. This might be because their adjacency potentially facilitates a comparison between the two, which brings out the dominance of the target relative to the decoy. This is possibly hindered when the competitor is between the target and the decoy. Further, we noticed that the attraction effect is the strongest for the order . This might be because when the decoy is presented first (i.e., left or top), it forms the baseline for future comparisons. The dominance of the target compared to this baseline potentially results in it being perceived as a superior option and finally results in it being chosen. Evans et al. (2021b) also found that the order DTC produced a strong attraction effect in the reanalysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Trueblood et al. (2015)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al. (2021b)</ref> also examined the impact of temporal order on the attraction effect and found a different pattern of results. For example, the temporal order TDC (where T is presented first, D second, and C last) produces a strong repulsion instead of an attraction effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al. (2021b)</ref> model this using a memory component that leads to slower evidence accumulation for a previously presented option. In our task, we do not anticipate any role of memory and hence do not need to account for this effect. Overall, order might interact with other cognitive processes (e.g., memory in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al. (2021b)</ref> and attention in the current experiment) and play an important role in the kind of evaluations and comparisons that are made during the decision-making process.</p><p>Order produces a remarkably consistent influence on the attraction effect across many different settings. This pattern was similar across the different modes and layouts as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. This pattern is similar to the one observed in the analyses reported in the supplementary materials using data from . <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans et al. (2021b)</ref> found a similar pattern in the reanalysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Trueblood et al. (2015)</ref>, which used a perceptual decision-making task. These results indicate potential common mechanisms between different kinds of decisions. Hence, we conclude that the influence of order on the attraction effect is a robust finding.</p><p>The influence of mode (i.e., numerical versus graphical) on the attraction effect is in accordance with Yang and Lynn (2014); Spektor et al. <ref type="formula">2021</ref>; , where numerical stimuli are predicted to produce stronger attraction effects.  suggests that this is driven by the concreteness of the representation, where numerical stimuli bring out the dominance relationship between the target and the competitor. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>, the influence of mode seems to be robust to the layout and order in which the information is displayed. In an exploratory analysis provided in the supplementary materials, we show that the dependence on mode does not hold for all of the consumer goods tested in the experiment. Specifically, it seems to hold for the old consumer goods from Noguchi and Stewart (2014) but not for the novel stimuli. Hence, further exploration is needed to understand how specific attributes and attribute values might interact with the mode.</p><p>We observed a null effect of the layout (i.e., by-alternative versus by-attribute) in our experiment. In an additional analysis presented in the supplementary materials, we only used data from the graphical mode, which is very similar in format to the stimuli used in , and still observed a null effect. This is a failure to replicate the results of . It is worth noting that there are differences in our experiment and , such as the number of trials and differences in participants, which could potentially explain the discrepancy in results. The number of trials could modulate the attraction effect since decision-makers might develop decision strategies to reduce mental effort during the course of a long experiment with a large number of trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahn et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lichters et al., 2015)</ref>. Such strategies might be more sensitive to differences in the ease of comparing options and thus reveal differences between presentation layout as found in . Strategies to reduce mental effort are less likely to be adopted in short experiments with a small number of trials (such as the present one). Our findings call into question the unified impact of layout on the attraction effect.</p><p>We observed that the attraction effect is at an average stronger for the consumer goods from  compared to novel consumer goods tested in our experiment. This might be because the consumer goods were chosen from Noguchi and Stewart (2014) based on their ability to produce strong attraction effects, resulting in a selection bias. <ref type="bibr">Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 16, No. 5, September 2021</ref> ATTRACTION EFFECT This might also be due to many potentially confounding differences between the two sets of consumer goods. For one, the consumer goods -paper towels, highlighters, and walking shoes in  were everyday low-value consumer goods. On the other hand, the novel consumer goods -apartments, laptops, and cars were high-value goods that are purchased rarely. Second, the attributes for the novel stimuli used a 1-10 scale and had similar units. The attributes for the older stimuli used different scales and had different units. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hayes et al. (2023)</ref> showed that when attributes are on a similar scale, individuals can make inter-attribute comparisons, which can impact the presence of the attraction effect. Thus, we find that the specific attributes and attribute values can modulate the strength of the attraction effect.</p><p>As discussed in the introduction, interactions between attentional processes and decision making have been invoked to explain context effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Trueblood, 2022;</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Trueblood et al. (2022)</ref> proposed a promising approach to model multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice using an attentional process that informs a preference accumulation process. In this model, a Markov attentional process probabilistically selects the options and attributes that are compared at any given moment in time. Preference is accumulated for the attended options until a threshold is reached, triggering a decision. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Trueblood et al. (2022)</ref> showed that the dependence of the attraction effect on spatial order can be explained by the Markov attention process by allowing the probabilities with which options are selected and compared to depend on their spatial proximity. For example, the model allows for larger transition probabilities when options are spatially adjacent. Thus, when the target and decoy are adjacent (such as in the order DTC), the model predicts that these two options will be compared more, thus leading to a stronger attraction effect. Further, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hayes et al. (2023)</ref> expanded this framework and allowed for between-attribute comparisons when attributes are on a common 0-10 scale, like the new stimuli in our experiment. They found that between-attribute comparisons reduced the strength of the attraction effect. Formats such as graphical displays might also allow for between-attribute comparisons since an individual can easily compare the size of bars for different attributes. The facilitation of between-attribute comparisons in graphical displays could explain the observed reduction in the attraction effect. Thus, the theory of attentional dynamics described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Trueblood et al. (2022)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hayes et al. (2023)</ref> is potentially a unifying framework to explain our findings.</p><p>From a practical and applied perspective, decision-making biases can be used to design choice architectures to improve the quality of decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Thaler et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lichters et al., 2017)</ref>. The attraction effect has been suggested as a method to help individuals make better decisions such as selecting more healthy food choices (van den Enden and Geyskens, 2021) or buying eco-friendly goods <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Guath et al., 2022)</ref>. Our findings have a direct implication for the format in which information about the choices can be displayed to produce the strongest effect. Our findings suggest that the information should be presented numerically, and the target and the decoy should be presented adjacent to each other to maximize the choice share of the target. Choice architects can utilize the presentation format as an additional dimension to aid in improving decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Constraints on Generality</head><p>In our study, we varied a large number of presentation factors and observed how they modulated the attraction effect. Despite our efforts to comprehensively test a large number of formats, there were additional presentation formats that we did not test in our experiment. For instance, we did not arrange the options in a triangle as in . Apart from presentation formats, additional experimental factors can modulate the strength of the attraction effect like time pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Evans et al., 2019;</ref> or the number of trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lichters et al., 2015)</ref>. Future experimenters might vary some of these factors to understand which ones might reverse the attraction effect.</p><p>In our experiment, we only used a single set of attribute values for the target and competitor options for each product (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). In fact, despite superficial differences, different studies use similar relative attribute differences for target, competitor, and decoy options <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cai and Pleskac, 2024)</ref>. Future experiments might vary the attribute values in order to more comprehensively test how attribute values influence the attraction effect. Experimenters that vary these values will face an additional challenge since it is more difficult to calculate the RST when the target and competitor options can take on a larger range of values. Innovative experimental designs and forms of inference will need to be considered (see for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dumbalska et al. (2020)</ref>).</p><p>All our options were presented with explicit attribute values. In some studies, the attributes are not presented explicitly to the participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Trendl et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dumbalska et al., 2020)</ref>. These kinds of stimuli (e.g., pictures of different fruits) might require the decision maker to generate attributes and convert these attributes to internal representations which might not be accounted for by the way we varied the 'mode' (numerical vs graphical).</p><p>We only studied value-based consumer decision-making. However, there are additional decision-making paradigms such as perceptual decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Trueblood et al., 2015)</ref>, intertemporal choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gluth et al., 2017)</ref>, risky gambles , and even memory tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Maylor and Roberts, 2007)</ref> that have been used to study the attraction effect. While we observed choice patterns that were consistent with findings from other paradigms, it is still an important theoretical question of whether people use the same mechanisms for attribute comparisons and integration across domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Trueblood et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Shimojo et al., 2003;</ref>. Future experiments might vary the task (e.g., consumer choice versus perceptual choice) along with the presentation format to test how the presentation format impacts choice across different tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Future Directions</head><p>Overall, our findings challenge researchers to provide explanations to account for the dependence of the attraction effect on presentation formats. As discussed in the introduction, the existing multi-alternative multi-attribute models in their current form do not give an account as to how presentation might impact choice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Trueblood et al. (2022)</ref>;  suggest that attention and comparisons are critical for multiattribute choice.  argue that the stimulus representation also plays a key role. While all of these ideas are related, they could be theoretically and computationally instantiated in different ways. Our data can help inform such theoretical developments.</p><p>One explanation for the dependence of the attraction effect on presentation formats relates to the interaction of attention and decision making processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Trueblood et al., 2022)</ref>. Future research could further investigate the interactions among presentation formats, attention, and decision making. For example, previous studies using process tracing have revealed that transitions between alternatives often predict the final decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Marini et al., 2023)</ref>. Additionally, research indicates that different multiattribute tasks exhibit distinct between and within-attribute transitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Yang and Krajbich, 2023)</ref>, as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hayes et al. (2023)</ref>. Interestingly, a bottom-up manipulation of attention did not alter the comparison process <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hasan and Trueblood, 2024)</ref>, suggesting that attention allocation may be influenced by decision strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Callaway et al., 2021)</ref> and top-down features like value <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Towal et al., 2013)</ref>. By coupling process tracing methods with presentation-format-based manipulations, researchers might discover significant differences in attention allocation and choices across different presentation formats.</p><p>Registered reports were introduced to increase transparency in the scientific process, validate experimental designs, and reduce publication bias against research outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chambers, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Henderson and Chambers, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chambers and Tzavella, 2022)</ref>.

Some journals have introduced a separate publication category called 'exploratory reports' to encourage researchers to conduct exploratory research, independently from the conventions of hypothesis-testing methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(McIntosh, 2017)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We undertook a registered report to conduct a high-powered exploratory study to understand the dependence of the attraction effect on presentation formats. We varied the mode (numerical vs graphical), the layout (by-alternative vs by-attribute) and the order (e.g. DTC -Decoy-Target-Competitor) in which options were displayed. We recruited over 2000 people and recorded over 24000 choices on value-based consumer decisions. We observed a robust attraction effect across each of these factors. The strength of the effect was modulated by the order and the mode but not by the layout. These empirical findings are not directly predicted by any of the modeling paradigms and can be used as a foundation for theory development.</p><p>Supplementary materials for "A registered report on presentation factors that influence the attraction effect" </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Power Analysis Calculation for Interaction Effects</head><p>Suppose that the attraction effect only occurs when the information is presented in a byattribute layout for the numerical mode of presenting stimuli and not otherwise. We could then expect to find a significant interaction between layout and mode in our analysis. In this section, we present a power analysis to estimate the effect size that we might be able to observe with our experiment for the interaction terms in our analysis. We conducted this power analysis prior to making any observations. Our power analysis calculations broadly involved three steps. First, we generate the probabilities for selecting the target in the different conditions based on a given effect size . In our experimental set-up, both the choice options X and Y are decoyed to make them the target. Therefore, in half the trials, is the target and in another half, is the target. Suppose the probability of selecting is when is targeted. In the absence of context effects, the probability of selecting remains when is targeted. Hence, the probability of selecting the target is 1 − . Further, is targeted in half the trials and is targeted in half the trials. Hence, the probability of selecting the target is ( ) = ( | ) ( ) + ( | ) ( ) = ( )/2 + (1 − )/2 = 0.5. We quantify the effect size of as the increase in the probability of selecting the target by compared to 0.5. For our simulation, we set the probability of selecting the target at 0.5 for all of the conditions except for the interaction conditions -for which we set it to 0.5 + .</p><p>In the second step, we generate choice data based on the probabilities generated in the first step. We generate observations for each condition, where each observation is 1 or 0 based on the probability of selecting the target for that condition. In our experiment, we have 150 observations per condition for each consumer good. Since we have a total of 6 consumer goods, we have 900 observations per condition when decisions made on all the goods are pooled together. Since we are interested in testing the reliability of the results, we aggregate the 3 consumer goods with stimuli values taken from  giving us 450 observations per condition, 150 for each of the consumer goods. Similarly, we are interested in testing the generalizability of the results, we pooled the decisions made on the 3 novel consumer goods to once again obtain 450 observations per condition. Therefore, we estimate the power for two values of -450 and 900.</p><p>In the third step, we fit a logistic regression and test for significance. Using the data generated in the second step, we set the selection of the target as the dependent variable. We compare the added advantage of including various interaction terms in the model to a null model with only the main effects. We use the likelihood ratio test to conduct a nested model comparison to test for significance at the = 0.05 level. For example, when testing for the interaction between mode and layout, our null model was Mode + Layout and our model with the interaction term was Mode + Layout + Mode*Layout. We fit the logistic regression using the statsmodels package in Python.</p><p>To estimate the power, we first select an effect size and a sample size . We first generate probabilities as described in step 1. We then repeat steps 2 and 3 1000 times. The power is then estimated as the fraction of times for which we observe a significant result. We present our results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>.</p><p>As shown in the figure, for small effect sizes, the power is low. That is, there is a high chance that the interaction terms will not be significant. However, as the effect size increases, the probability of observing a significant result also increases. With a power of 0.95, we would be able to observe a small effect of 0.05 of the interaction between mode and layout when all the consumer goods are pooled together and an effect of size 0.07 when old and new goods are analyzed separately.</p><p>For the order and mode interaction, the effect can be driven by different levels of order. The effect can be driven by a single level of order (e.g. Order DTC (decoy, target, competitor) and Numerical Mode) or by several different levels of orders interacting with the mode. In the figure, we present the results of the power analysis when there are 1, 2, and 3 possible levels of order interacting with the mode. When we combine all consumer products, with a power of 0.95, we will be able to detect an effect of size 0.09 when there is a single level of order interacting with the mode and 0.07 when two or three levels of order interact with the mode. When old and new goods are analyzed separately, with a power of 0.95, we will be able to detect an effect of size 0.11 when it is driven by one level of order interacting with the mode and an effect of size 0.08 when it is driven by two or three levels. These results are the same for the interaction between order and layout since both mode and We only show the results of the three way interaction when a single level of order interacts with the other two variables. When we combine the consumer goods, with a power of 0.95, we will be able to detect an effect of size 0.16. When we analyze old and new goods separately, with a power of 0.95, we will be able to detect an effect of size 0.22.</p></div>

Their data was comprised of 6 experiments. The full details for these experiments can be found in the original papers. We briefly go over the details of the experiments here. Experiment A was taken from , Experiment B was from , and Experiments C, D and E were previously unpublished data. Experiments A and B used two identical graphical formats. These formats are similar to the ones shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> in the main paper. One format was by-attribute, which facilitated a comparison of the alternatives on different attributes and the other one was by-alternative, where it was hypothesized to be more difficult to compare the alternatives.

Experiment D had the alternatives listed along rows and each attribute was a separate column. Boxes were drawn around each column. Experiment E was identical to Experiment D, but did not have the boxes drawn around the columns. We used this dataset to analyze the dependence of presentation mode and format on attraction and repulsion effects.

The strength of the attraction effect for the old stimuli from  was modulated by the mode, where they were stronger for numerical modes than for graphical modes. This pattern was not as apparent for the newer stimuli. In a subsequent regression analysis, we showed that this interaction between stimulus type and mode was significant (p&lt;0.001), suggesting that the older stimuli from Noguchi and Stewart (2014) produce a stronger attraction effect in the numerical mode which also happens to be the mode in which they were originally tested. Further, the main effect of mode was not significant (p&gt;0.05), suggesting that the effect of mode was primarily driven by it being stronger for the old stimuli.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Regression Models</head><p>To conduct statistical inference, we conducted a comprehensive regression model comparison. We report the model with no interactions in the main paper for parsimony. We also tested models in which information about the old and new stimuli was added as an extra variable. Here we tested models with 2nd order and higher order interactions. We present the results of our model comparison with a likelihood ratio test in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table S3</ref>. We observe that models with the 2nd order interactions fit the data better than the models without interactions. However, there is no significant improvement with the higher-order terms. We present the coefficients of the best fitting model in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table S4</ref>. We present the coefficients of all the models in the Appendix at the end of the supplement. Note that all of the variables were sum-contrast coded. Hence, the coefficients represent the deviation from the mean value.</p><p>The models tested were:    9 Replication of (Cataldo and Cohen, 2019)</p><p>In the main paper, we reported that there was no main effect of the layout. The original paper reported that the attraction effect was modulated by the layout used graphical displayed . This difference in result might have been due to the differences in the way in which we displayed the numerical information. To this end, we re-ran the regression analysis only for the graphical data by excluding the numerical data. We were interested in looking for the main effect of the layout. While  only reported a main effect of layout, we thought it might be interesting to see if the layout interacted with the order. Hence, we ran a second regression to test for the interaction with layout and order. We present our results in S5. We observe that there is no main effect of the layout implying a failure to replicate the results from . However, we do observe that for one order -DTC, the strength of the attraction effect is modulated by the format at the p &lt; 0.001 level and another order -CDT at the p &lt; 0.05 level.</p></div>

Another way to test for the attraction effect is based on the comparison to binary choices. We test if the attraction effect holds by testing if the presence of a decoy increases the choice share of the target compared to the binary choice share in the binary choice condition. Specifically, we calculate</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Deviation = ( /{ , , }) − ( /{ , })</formula><p>. We calculate the deviation with the decoy choices excluded and again with the decoy choices included. When the decoy choices are excluded, a positive deviation indicates ATTRACTION EFFECT that the choice share of increased relative to the choice share of in the ternary choice set compared with the binary choice set. When the decoy choices are retained, a positive deviation indicates an absolute increase in the choice share of .

After exclusions, we observe a robust attraction effect across all of the conditions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table  S6</ref> summarizes the results of exact binomial tests to test if RST is significantly different from 0.5 for each of the 24 conditions. In our first analysis, we collapsed across all consumer products. In 23 out of 24, we observed that the exact binomial test is significant. The only exception was the graphical × by-alternative × TCD condition. For the old products subset, the exact binomial test is significant in 22 out of 24 conditions. For the new products subset, the exact binomial test is significant in 12 out of 24 conditions. These results are generally consistent with the results observed using the full data set. <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">Table S7</ref> summarizes the results of exact binomial tests to test if RST is significantly different from 0.5 for each of the different factors. After exclusions, standard attraction effects were significant for all factors, which is consistent with the results of analyses performed on the full data set. <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table S8</ref> summarizes the results of nested logistic regression models for interaction effects of Mode, Layout, and Order.
