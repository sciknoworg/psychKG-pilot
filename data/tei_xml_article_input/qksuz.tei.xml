				<p>Social exclusion impairs decision-making, affecting social functioning. This study examines how social exclusionin both short-and long-terminfluences intertemporal decision-making, and whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can mitigate these negative effects. Experiment 1 (n = 131) found that immediately excluded individuals favored immediate rewards. Experiment 2 (n = 62) demonstrated that applying anodal tDCS to the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) reduced this preference. Chronic exclusion also led to a preference for immediate rewards (Experiment 3, n = 170), but multiple anodal tDCS sessions in the right vlPFC lessened this effect, suggesting long-term benefits (Experiment 4, n = 36). We discuss how self-control mediates the link between exclusion and intertemporal decision-making, and highlight tDCS as a potential therapeutic tool for socially excluded individuals.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Social exclusion refers to the experience of being isolated or rejected from social relationships or groups, leading to a sense of disconnection from others (K. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Williams, 2009</ref>; K. D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Williams, 2007)</ref>. Social exclusion results in a series of perceptual <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dewall et al., 2009)</ref>, emotional <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Reinhard et al., 2020)</ref>, and cognitive consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baumeister et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Buelow et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fuhrmann et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lurquin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Xu et al., 2018)</ref>. It also negatively affects a wide range of social functions and thus undermines an individual's quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Juanchich et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Peake et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Twenge et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Twenge et al., , 2007</ref>.</p><p>Intertemporal decision-making (also referred to as intertemporal choice, IC), which involves choosing between immediate and delayed rewards, is a critical component of social functioning because it affects long-term goal management, self-control, and future-oriented behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amasino et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Berns et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Peters &amp; BÃ¼chel, 2011)</ref>. The ability to delay gratification can be beneficial for managing conflicts and building long-lasting relationships. Conversely, a preference for short-term rewards, known as temporal discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Green &amp; Myerson, 2004)</ref>, may lead to impulsive behaviors that negatively affect social bonds and long-term cooperation. To date, only a few studies have investigated the relationship between social exclusion and intertemporal decision-making, and their findings remain inconclusive: Some studies showed that social exclusion led to elevated levels of discounting where participants favor immediate rewards over delayed ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bahrami &amp; Borhani, 2023)</ref>; however, others reported reduced discounting for social exclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Juanchich et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, building on prior research, our first goal was to systematically clarify the effects of social exclusion on intertemporal decision-making, in short-and long-terms, because the negative impacts of social exclusion vary in stages depending on its duration and persistence (K. D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Williams, 2007)</ref>: In the short-term, individuals experience immediate emotional distress and threat to belonging and control, leading to potential depletion of self-control that causes individuals to favor immediate rewards; if exclusion persists, however, individuals may move through these reflexive stages to a resignation stage where chronic exclusion leads to feelings of alienation, helplessness, and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Riva et al., 2017)</ref>, as well as chronic impulsivity and impaired ability to plan for the future. Notably, to our knowledge, studies have yet to investigate both the short-and long-term impact of social exclusion on intertemporal decision-making. To this end, we set up two experiments (Experiment 1 and Experiment 3) to examine how immediately excluded (short-term) and chronically excluded (long-term) participants perform during intertemporal decision-making tasks.</p><p>We also tested if transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) regulates the negative effects of social exclusion during intertemporal decision-making. Here, we focused on testing the potential impact of anodal stimulation in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), because it has been shown to consistently alleviate several negative effects of social exclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(He et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(He et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Riva et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Riva et al., , 2015</ref>. For example, stimulating the right vlPFC has been shown to reduce the pain resulting from social exclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Riva et al., 2012)</ref>. Anodal stimulation in the right vlPFC also improves emotional regulation after social exclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(He et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(He et al., , 2020</ref>, and reduces aggressive behavior in socially excluded individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Riva et al., 2015)</ref>. On the other hand, the prefrontal cortex also plays a critical role in self-control <ref type="bibr">(Hare et al., 2009, see below)</ref> and during intertemporal decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Figner et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Peters &amp; BÃ¼chel, 2011)</ref>. Here, importantly, we applied single-and multiple-session anodal tDCS in the right dPFC respectively on immediate (Experiment 2) and chronically (Experiment 4) excluded participants. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of multiple-session tDCS immediately post-stimulation and in a two-week follow-up to test if the effect is long-lasting.</p><p>In sum, with four experiments, we comprehensively investigated how short-and long-term social exclusion impacts intertemporal decision-making. We also examined how these effects may be modulated by applying anodal tDCS in the right vlPFC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1: The effect of short-term social exclusion during intertemporal decisionmaking</head><p>In the first experiment, we adopted a single-factor, between-subject design. We manipulated immediate social exclusion using the Cyberball paradigm, and investigated participants' discounting preference during intertemporal-decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>131 healthy undergraduate student participants (Mage = 19.48, SD = 1.09; 22 males) took part in Experiment 1. All participants in all experiments reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of psychiatric or neurological illness. A minimum sample size of 128 was selected such that this experiment would have at least 80% power to detect a medium-sized effect (f = 0.5) regarding the effect of social exclusion on intertemporal decision-making (Î± = 0.05) according to G*Power (3.1). Participants who completed the experiment received both a course credit and a small gift as compensation. All experiments were approved by the local ethics committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Procedure</head><p>Social exclusion. We used the Cyberball paradigm (K. D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Williams &amp; Jarvis, 2006)</ref> to manipulate the feeling of immediate social exclusion ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref>). Participants were instructed that they were playing an online ball-tossing game with two other human players, who were in fact computer players whose behavior was programmed to be consistent within the inclusion/exclusion condition. For each participant, there were 30 ball-tosses in total, and participants had to cooperate with their group members to toss the ball as soon as possible. In the inclusion group, participants received ball tosses 10 times (â of the total number of tosses, so that each group member received equal numbers of ball tosses). In the exclusion group, participants only received the ball two times at the beginning of the game. We asked two questions to each participant at the end of the game for manipulation check: (1) "How strongly did you feel to be excluded by others in the game you just played?" (7-point Likert scale, 7 being most strongly excluded), and (2) "Choose a number (0-100) to represent the percentage of the times you received a ball in the game you just played". Self-control resource. Extending existing literature, across experiments, we hypothesized a potential mediating role of self-control resource when investigating the relationship between social exclusion and intertemporal decision-making. Self-control is a key mechanism that influences how individuals manage competing short-and long-term goals. However, it also operates as a finite resource during cognitively demanding tasks such as decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baumeister et al., 2018)</ref>. Therefore, in the face of social exclusion, an individual's self-control resource may be directed to cope with negative emotions and thus reduced. Thus, this resource depletion can increase impulsivity and lead individuals to favor immediate rewards in intertemporal decisions. More importantly, the depletion of self-control resource may be potentially regulated by stimulating the right vlPFC with tDCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hare et al., 2009)</ref>; it may also manifest differentially in intertemporal decision-making as a result of short-and long-term exclusion. Taken together, understanding how self-control resource is affected by social exclusion helps explain why socially excluded individuals may struggle to make decisions that prioritize long-term outcomes. To this end, we measured self-control resource using The Self-Control Resources Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Finkel et al., 2006)</ref>. This scale uses two score items with a 7-point Likert scale: "I feel drained" and "I feel mentally exhausted", and two reversely-scored items "I feel full of vitality" and "I feel energetic". A higher sum score of all four items suggests a higher amount of self-control resource.</p><p>Intertemporal Choice Task. In all experiments, the IC task was adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wang &amp; Dvorak (2010)</ref>. This is a modified version of the IC task based on the paradigm as implemented in <ref type="bibr">Kirby &amp; Marakovic (1996)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kirby (Kirby, 2009)</ref>, which assesses temporal discounting with seven pairs of choice options. Participants were serially presented with two reward options in a pair. For each pair, they need to choose from either receiving a smaller amount of money tomorrow or a much larger amount of money in the distant future (see <ref type="table">Table S1</ref> in Supplement). Their response over the seven pairs was used to compute the temporal discounting parameter (k-value), see below.</p><p>Temporal discounting rate (k-value). We estimated an individual's temporal discounting following a well-established one-parameter model. This model regards the value of a present, subjective reward (V) as a hyperbolic function of delay (D) according to the formula V = A / (1 + kD), where A denotes the amount of the delayed (objective) reward and k represents an individual-specific rate of temporal discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Frederick et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Green &amp; Myerson, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kirby &amp; MarakoviÄ, 1996)</ref>. Here, a higher k-value represents a greater preference for an impulsive decision to choose a more present reward, and lower k-values imply an individual's greater tendency to delay gratification. Detailed methods regarding the estimation of k-values were reported in the Supplement S1. Importantly, in all experiments, for follow-up analysis regarding the k-values, we applied a natural logarithmic transformation to linearize the nonlinear relationship during the estimation of the temporal discounting parameter.</p><p>Procedure. In Experiment 1, first, participants were randomly assigned to either the inclusion or exclusion group. They then took part in the Cyberball game, which was designed to influence their sense of inclusion or exclusion (Step 1). Next, their self-control resource was assessed (Step 2). Lastly, they completed the intertemporal choice task (Step 3, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulation Check</head><p>A manipulation check (independent samples t-test) regarding the feeling of exclusion showed that participants in the exclude group reported a significantly higher sense of being excluded (M = 5.03, SD = 1.59) than those in the include group (M = 1.89, SD = 1.19), t <ref type="formula">129</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of social inclusion and the mediating role of self-control resource</head><p>Firstly, regarding self-control resource, independent t-tests showed that exclusion (M = 17.92, SD = 4.31) vs. inclusion (M = 20.52, SD = 3.81) groups showed a significant difference <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1b</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">), t(129) = 3.65, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d =0.64, 95%CI= [1.18, 4</formula><p>.00], suggesting that immediate social exclusion through the Cyberball paradigm indeed reduced the amount of self-control resource <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baumeister et al., 2018)</ref>. As for the k-values, the exclusion group (M = -5.67, SD = 2.12) showed significantly higher k-values in comparison to the inclusion group (M = -6.96, SD = 1.81), t(129) = 3.73, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = 0.65, 95%CI = [-1.97, -0.60], suggesting higher discounting (i.e., stronger preference for immediate rewards) as a result of short-term exclusion <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1c</ref>). Given that social exclusion led to both reduced self-control resource and increased discounting, we conducted a mediation analysis. Here, we set the dummy experimental group factor (exclusion vs. inclusion) as the independent variable, and k-value as the dependent arable; self-control resource was set as the mediator. We used the PROCESS (SPSS 26.0, model 4) to establish the structural equation model. Results of the bootstrapped (size = 5000) mediation analysis ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  1d</ref>) suggest not only a direct effect of self-control resource on k-value (Î² = -0.36, p &lt; .001), but also a significantly mediating role (Î² = 0.22, 95%CI = [0.08, 0.38]) within the effect of social exclusion on k-value (direct effect Î² = 0.40, p &lt; .02), and this mediation effect accounts for 35% (P M = 0.22 (indirect) / 0.62 (total)) of the total effect. Overall, the results from Experiment 1 suggest that short-term social exclusion reduced the amount of self-control resource and led to a higher preference for more immediate rewards. Together with the observed mediation role of self-control resource, this suggests that social exclusion may influence intertemporal decision-making both directly and indirectly through self-control resources. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2: Single-session tDCS modulates the impact of short-term social exclusion on intertemporal decision-making</head><p>Given that social exclusion has led to more impulsive intertemporal decision-making, as a next step, in Experiment 2, we aimed to examine if this negative impact may be modulated by neuromodulation in terms of tDCS. For this purpose, we firstly manipulated short-term social exclusion on all participants during the baseline measurement (T1); two days later (T2), they were invited again to receive anodal vs. sham tDCS stimulation, and their performance in intertemporal decision-making was again measured. Here, we hypothesized that in T2, in comparison to sham stimulation, anodal tDCS may increase the amount of self-control resource and foster a higher preference for long-term reward during intertemporal decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>62 healthy undergraduate student participants participated in Experiment 2 (three dropped out, thus Mage = 19.08, SD = 1.63; 27 males). A minimum sample size of 34 was required such that this experiment would have at least 80% power to detect a medium-sized effect regarding the effect of social exclusion on intertemporal decision-making (Î± = 0.05, f = 0.25 -G*Power 3.1). Participants who completed the experiment received CNY 20 as payment.</p><p>During T1, we measured participants' self-control resource and their performance during intertemporal decision-making as a baseline. Two days later (T2), participants returned to the lab and were randomly assigned to the anodal or sham stimulation group (see below for tDCS protocol). After tDCS stimulation, social exclusion was manipulated by the Cyberball paradigm for all participants. Unlike Experiment 1, all participants were manipulated as excluded during the paradigm. Self-control resource and performance during intertemporal decision-making was measured again <ref type="figure">(Figure 2a</ref>). tDCS protocol. In this study, we used the DC-STIMULATOR PLUS (NeuroConn, Munich, Germany) with a 5 Ã 7 cmÂ² sponge electrode. We positioned the anodal electrode at F6, following the International 10-20 EEG system, to stimulate the right vlPFC, and we placed the cathodal electrode on the opposite side above the eye's orbital region <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(He et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Riva et al., 2015)</ref>. We set the tDCS current to 2.0 mA, with a rise and fall time of 15 seconds. Previous studies have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of this intensity. Before starting the main experiment, we administered a 10-minute anodal/sham tDCS session to all participants. In the anodal group, we continued the stimulation for 10 minutes; in the sham group, the stimulation lasted only 30 seconds at the beginning <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Riva et al., 2015)</ref>. With this approach, we ensured that participants in both groups experienced mild sensations, such as tingling or slight discomfort, making them believe they were receiving electrical stimulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulation check</head><p>We conducted a manipulation check for social exclusion manipulation in T2 to ensure both groups did not differ in terms of the degree of short-term exclusion. Independent t-test showed no significant feeling of exclusion between the anodal and the sham stimulation group, t(57) = 0.16, p &gt; .05, as well as no significant difference in reporting the rate of receiving balls, t(57) = 0.07, p &gt; .05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anodal tDCS in the right vlPFC increased self-control resources and reduced discounting</head><p>For self-control resource, repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant interaction between measurement time and type of stimulation, F(1, 57) = 51.77, p &lt; .001, npÂ² = 0.48. Post hoc pairwise comparison revealed no difference between the two groups in T1 (anodal: M = 20.80, SD = 3.96; sham: M = 21.86, SD = 3.29, t = 1.12, p = 0.27). But in T2, there was a significantly increased self-control resource for the anodal (M = 21.40, SD = 3.53) vs. sham stimulation group (M = 16.31, SD = 4.43), t = 4.87, p &lt; .001, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2b</ref>. Regarding the k-value, repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant interaction between measurement time and type of stimulation, F(1, 57) = 12.99, p &lt; .001, npÂ² = 0.19. Pairwise comparison revealed no difference between the two groups in T1 (anodal: M = -6.53, SD = 1.61, sham: M = -6.41, SD = 1.68, t = 0.27, p = 0.78), but significantly increased k-value in T2 for the anodal vs. sham stimulation group (anodal: M = -6.85, SD = 1.60, sham: M = -5.31, SD = 1.82, t = 3.44, p &lt; .001, <ref type="figure">Figure 2c</ref>). Analogous to Experiment 1, we then carried out a mediation analysis to examine the role of selfcontrol resource on the effect of tDCS stimulation (anodal vs. sham) on k-value. Here, we set stimulation types as the dependent variable, the k-values in T2 as the independent variable, and self-control resource as the mediating variable. We additionally set both the self-control resource and k-values from T1 as the covariates, to control for the effect of T1 on T2. Here, bootstrapped (size = 5000) mediation analysis <ref type="figure">(Figure 2d</ref>) suggest no significant direct effect of stimulation on k-value (Î² = -0.35, p &lt; .05), but a significant role of self-control resource (Î² = -.38, 95%CI = [-0.72, -0.05]) mediating the effect of stimulation on k-value (total effect Î² = -0.73, p &lt; .01), and this mediation effect accounts for 52% (PM = -0.38 (indirect) / -0.73 (total)) of the total effect. Results from Experiment 2 suggest that, after short-term exclusion, anodal tDCS in the right vlPFC increased self-control resources and reduced participants' tendency to choose from more immediate rewards. Moreover, our mediation analysis suggests that, despite that tDCS modulated participants' discount rate, this effect was primarily driven by the key mediating role of self-control resource. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. a.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3: The long-term effect of social exclusion on intertemporal decision-making</head><p>In Experiment 3, instead of looking at short-term manipulation of social exclusion, we focused on how intertemporal decision-making alters in participants who suffer from long-term social exclusion. To this end, we recruited a large number of participants and measured their long-term social exclusion using the Ostracism Experience Scale for Adolescents (OES-A, Cronbach's alpha = 0.85, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gilman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zhang et al., 2018)</ref>. This scale has 11 items, each using a 5point Likert scale. A higher total score represents a higher degree of reported feeling of being socially excluded in everyday life. We then evaluated how long-term social exclusion impacts selfcontrol resource and intertemporal decision-making <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>170 healthy undergraduate student participants (Mage = 19.84, SD = 1.74; 66 males) took part in Experiment 3. A minimum sample size of 128 was required if this experiment would have at least 80% power to detect a medium-sized effect regarding the effect of social exclusion on intertemporal decision-making (Î± = 0.05, f = 0.5 -G*Power 3.1). Participants who completed the experiment received 30 CNY as payment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>Firstly, regarding the relationship between long-term social exclusion (OES-A) and self-control resource, we observed a significant negative correlation, Pearson's r = -0.28, p = .002, 95% CI = [-0.42, -0.14], <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3b</ref>. As for the k-value during intertemporal decision-making, we observed a significant positive correlation between OES-A and k-value, Pearson's r = 0.26, p &lt; .001, 95% CI = [0.11, 0.40], <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3c</ref>. Together, these results suggest that an individual's degree of long-term social exclusion may relate to a reduced amount of self-control resource and a higher preference for temporal discounting during intertemporal decision-making. We further conducted a mediation analysis to examine the role of self-control resource within the effect of long-term exclusion on kvalue. Here, bootstrapped (size = 5000) mediation analysis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3d</ref>) suggests a significant direct effect of social exclusion on k-value (Î² = 0.17, p &lt; .05) and a significant role of self-control resource (Î² = 0.10, 95%CI = [0.02, 0.17]) mediating the effect of social exclusion on k-value (total effect Î² = 0.27, p &lt; .01), and this mediation effect accounts for 37% (PM = 0.10 (indirect) / 0.27 (total)) of the total effect. The mediation analysis suggests that long-term social exclusion not only directly impacts intertemporal decision-making, but also does so indirectly through the mediating role of self-control resource. .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 4: Multiple-session tDCS modulates the impact of long-term social exclusion on intertemporal decision-making</head><p>In Experiment 4, building on previous experiments, we focused on investigating whether tDCS is able to regulate the negative effects of chronic social exclusion. For this purpose, for participants who reported higher-than-average OES-A scores, we measured their self-control resource and their performance during intertemporal choice task first in a baseline time window (T1), then immediately after multiple-session tDCS (anodal vs. sham stimulation, T2), and finally during a two-week post-stimulation followup session (T3). This design allows us to measure both the immediate and long-term effects of multiple-session tDCS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>36 healthy undergraduate student participants participated in this experiment (two dropped out, thus Mage = 18.78, SD = 0.93; 12 males). Based on the effect size as observed in Experiment 2, here, a minimum sample size of 10 was required such that this experiment would have at least 80% power to detect a medium-sized effect regarding the effect of social exclusion on intertemporal decision-making (Î± = 0.05, f = 0.48 -G*Power 3.1). Participants who completed the experiment received CNY 30 as payment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Procedure</head><p>The procedure of this experiment is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4a</ref>. We first preselected participants who reported above-average long-term social exclusion. For this purpose, we collected the OES-A scores from 241 undergraduate students and invited those who scored above average to participate. Due to the low degree of willingness to participate in the multiple-session tDCS, we included 36 participants in the formal experiment. For these participants, In baseline measurement (T1), we measured their self-control resource and their performance during intertemporal decision-making. Two days later, they were randomly assigned to either the anodal stimulation or the sham stimulation groups and started a 7-day multiple-session tDCS intervention. Within each stimulation session, the stimulation protocol was identical to that of the session in Experiment 2. Immediately after the tDCS intervention (T2), we measured all participants' selfcontrol resource and their performance during intertemporal choice tasks; they were again measured two weeks after the intervention (T3).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparability of Social Exclusion</head><p>We conducted an independent t-test to validate that, regarding the reported degree of long-term social exclusion (OES-A), there was no significant difference between participants in the anodal stimulation group (M = 37.61, SD = 3.22) and the sham stimulation group (M = 39.50, SD = 4.58), t(34) = 1.43, p &gt; .05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immediate and long-term effects of multiple-session tDCS</head><p>For self-control resource <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4b)</ref>, a repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant main effect of measurement time, F(2, 68) = 22.97, p &lt; .001, np 2 = .40, and a significant interaction between measurement time (T1/T2/T3) and type of stimulation (anodal/sham), F(2, 68) = 35.40, p &lt; .001, np 2 = 0.51. Within each measurement time, in T1, for anodal (M = 15.11, SD = 3.34) vs. sham (M = 16.50, SD = 2.75) stimulation groups, we observed no significant difference, t(34) = 1.36, p = 0.18. Immediately after the multiple-session stimulation (T2), the anodal group (M = 19.89, SD = 4.21) showed significantly higher self-control than the sham stimulation group (M = 15.94, SD = 3.06), t (34) = 3.20, p &lt; .002. This difference was, however, diminished two weeks after stimulation (T3). Here, the self-control resource of the anodal group (M = 16.33, SD = 3.38) did not differ from that of the sham stimulation group (M = 16.22, SD = 3.28), t(34) = 0.10, p =.92.</p><p>With regard to the k-value <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4c</ref>), a repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant main effect of measurement time, F(2, 68) = 10.34, p &lt; .001, np 2 = .23, and a significant interaction between measurement time (T1/T2/T3) and type of stimulation (anodal/sham), F(2, 68) = 8.79, p &lt; .001, np 2 = 0.20. Within each measurement time, in T1, for anodal (M = -3.26, SD = 1.24) vs. sham (M = -3.40, SD = 1.37) stimulation groups, we observed no significant difference, t(34) = 0.54, p = 0.59. Immediately after the multiple-session stimulation (T2), the anodal group (M = -5.12, SD = 1.27) showed significantly higher self-control than the sham stimulation group (M = -3.58, SD = 1.29), t(34) = 3.61, p &lt; .001. In T3, the k-value of the anodal group (M = -4.27, SD = 1.40) remained significantly lower than the sham stimulation group (M = -3.43, SD = 1.07), t(34) = 2.01, p &lt;.05.</p><p>We also carried out two mediation analyses to disentangle the role of self-control resource in evaluating the impact of tDCS on intertemporal decision-making. In the first model, for the effect in T2, we set stimulation type as the independent variable, the k-value of T2 as the dependent variable, and self-control resource as the mediating variable. Both the self-control resource and k-values from T1 were set as covariates in the mediation model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4d</ref>). Here, bootstrapped (size = 5000) mediation analysis ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4b</ref>) suggests no significant direct effect of stimulation on k-value (Î² = -.20, p &lt; .05), but a significant role of self-control resource (Î² = -.91, 95%CI = [-1.71, -.08]) mediating the effect of stimulation on k-value (total effect Î² = -1.12, p &lt; .001), and this mediation effect accounts for 75% (PM = -0.91 (indirect) / -1.21 (total)) of the total effect. This result suggests that, although multiple-session anodal tDCS reduced the k-value, this effect was primarily driven by its effect on the self-control resource. Furthermore, to evaluate the effects in T3, in the second model, we set T3's k-value as the dependent variable <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4e)</ref>, and both the self-control resource and k-values from T1 as the covariates. Here, however, bootstrapped (size = 5000) mediation analysis showed neither significant direct effect of stimulation on k-value (Î² = -.50, p &lt; .05) nor significant mediation effect (Î² = -.13, 95%CI = [-.39, -.01]).

Most importantly, from Experiments 1 &amp; 3, we consistently observed that both immediate and chronic social exclusion has led to an increased tendency of temporal discounting. Moreover, we also examined the potential remediation effect of anodal tDCS in the right vlPFC, and confirmed that this approach reliably reduced the negative impact of short-and long-term social exclusion on intertemporal decisionmaking. Across experiments, we also observed a significant mediating role of self-control resource.</p><p>A most important finding from the current study is the consistent relationship between social exclusion and increased temporal discounting during intertemporal decision-making. Across experiments, social exclusion consistently showed a direct impact on intertemporal decisionmaking, i.e., excluded individuals prefer immediate rewards over delayed ones. Here we argue that this direct impact may derive from several perspectives. Firstly, it has been shown that social exclusion can evoke a state of cognitive deconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Twenge et al., 2003)</ref>, such that affected individuals simplify their thought processes, especially when performing cognitively demanding tasks such as intertemporal decision-making that demand a greater amount of cognitive resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Evans, 2008)</ref>. This simplification of an individual's thought processes potentially leads to a higher tendency of myopic decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bahrami &amp; Borhani, 2023)</ref>. Secondly, it has been proposed that social exclusion commonly leads to emotional and physical pain or numbing, a coping mechanism that protects individuals from the distress associated with rejection. This defensive mechanism potentially leads them to prioritize immediate self-reward over delayed gratification <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(DeWall &amp; Baumeister, 2006)</ref>. Thirdly, social exclusion affects psychological distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Yanagisawa et al., 2011)</ref>, rendering future rewards less attainable or desirable. This altered perception of time may potentially increase the focus on immediate gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Calluso et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Twenge et al., 2003)</ref>. Lastly, a number of studies suggest that social exclusion increases the tendency of risk-taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Buelow &amp; Wirth, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pancani et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Svetieva et al., 2016)</ref>. Consequently, excluded individuals may neglect potential risks and long-term gratification, and become more impulsive during intertemporal decision-making.</p><p>Besides the direct impact of social exclusion on intertemporal decision-making, confirming our hypothesis, we also consistently observed a significant mediating role of self-control resource. Our results from Experiments 1 &amp; 3 showed that social exclusion directly leads to reduced selfcontrol resource <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baumeister et al., 2018)</ref>, which are finite and highly relevant for cognitively demanding tasks such as intertemporal decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chester &amp; DeWall, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lurquin et al., 2014)</ref>. Our mediation analysis from both analyses jointly suggests that self-control resource plays a primary role in how social exclusion negatively impacts intertemporal decision-making. Moreover, the potential remediation effect of anodal tDCS in the right vlPFC was also driven to a large extent by self-control resource (see below).</p><p>Our findings also suggest that both immediate manipulations of social exclusion (short-term) and chronic social exclusion (long-term) lead to an increased tendency of temporal discounting during intertemporal decision-making. According to the Temporal Need-Threat Model of social exclusion, the negative consequences of social exclusion vary in stages based on the duration of the exclusion (K. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Williams, 2009)</ref>. In the short term, exclusion triggers immediate emotional distress and a heightened sense of vulnerability, prompting defensive reactions such as aggression or withdrawal. In the longer term, chronic exclusion can lead to deeper psychological effects such as chronic loneliness, decreased self-worth, and diminished motivation, which may impair not only social functioning but also mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ren et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">K. Williams, 2009)</ref>. Here, despite distinct characteristics and severity between stages, at least regarding the impact of social exclusion on self-control resource and intertemporal decision-making, we did not observe any discernible difference between short-term and long-term exclusion: In both Experiment 1 and Experiment 3, immediate manipulation and chronic reports of social exclusion lead to reduced self-control resource and increased temporal discounting. Our results suggest that the impact of social exclusion, aligning with the Temporal Need-Threat Model, is not merely a transient reaction but also a more deeply ingrained alteration of decision-making frameworks. Moreover, the fact that we observed a more chronic risk-prone orientation resulting from long-term exclusionas observed in Experiment 3adds an important piece of evidence to the existing literature, and could potentially re-emphasize the importance of evaluating the impact of social exclusion in both short-and long-terms, especially in incorporating ostracism as a fundamental variable in decisionmaking models.</p><p>Lastly, with two tDCS experiments, we showed that both single-and multiple-session anodal tDCS on the right vlPFC reduces the negative impact of short-and long-term social exclusion on intertemporal decision-making. This remediation effect has important theoretical and practical implications. First, extending current social neuroscience literature on the role of the PFC during intertemporal decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Figner et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gui et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jimura et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Peters &amp; BÃ¼chel, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sellitto et al., 2010)</ref>, our results for the first time provide a causal evidence supporting this role. Second, we also corroborated the line literature remediating a range of negative impacts of social cognition by stimulating the right vlPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(He et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(He et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Riva et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Riva et al., , 2015</ref>. This, in turn, suggests that the right vlPFC may be not task-specific, but plays a more general role underlying the neural networks affected by social cognition. Third, across Experiments 2 &amp; 4, our results also showed a robust impact of tDCS on increasing the amount of self-control resource. These results also extend current literature on the role of the vlPFC in selfcontrol by providing a first piece of causal evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chester &amp; DeWall, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hare et al., 2009)</ref>. Lastly, we not only showed the remediation effect of single-session tDCS on short-term exclusion, but also observed a robust effect of multiple-session tDCS on chronic social exclusion. In Experiment 4, this effect was not only pronounced immediately after the tDCS sessions (T2) but was also potentially long-lasting (T3), even if the T3 effect was primarily driven by the mediating role of the self-control resource. Practically, these results provide a solid basis for further exploration of short-and long-term therapeutic interventions for acute or chronic mental disorders such as depression, anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(He et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zhao et al., 2021)</ref>, and even psychosis (L. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wang et al., 2018)</ref>, which are often caused and exacerbated by social stress resulting from exclusion.</p><p>In sum, we for the first time showed a consistent relationship between social exclusion and increased temporal discounting during intertemporal decision-making both in the short-and longterm. We also showed that anodal tDCS in the vlPFC could potentially address this adverse effect from both immediate and chronic social exclusion, and this remediation effect may have a longlasting effect. These findings provide important novel insights in social psychology and social neuroscience and have important clinical implications to improve resilience and decision-making outcomes for individuals who suffer from social exclusion.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>= 12.79, p &lt;.001, Cohen's d = -2.24, 95%CI = [-3.62, -2.65].

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S1. Rate of temporal discounting</head><p>In the intertemporal choice task, in seven trials, participants were asked to choose between two reward options: a smaller reward available immediately (immediate reward) and a larger reward available after a certain delay (delayed reward).</p><p>To model participants' decision-making behavior, we employed an existing model that uses the discount rate parameter k to represent the tendency to prefer delayed rewards. A higher k-value indicates a stronger preference for immediate rewards, reflecting greater impulsivity, while a lower k-value suggests a greater willingness to wait for delayed rewards, reflecting lower impulsivity and stronger delay gratification.</p><p>This model is based on a hyperbolic discounting function, = 1 + which describes how the subjective value of delayed rewards decreases non-linearly as the delay increases. By using this model, we can quantify participants' preferences for immediate versus delayed rewards.</p><p>To estimate each participant's k value, we identified their 'non-difference point' in intertemporal choices. For example, if a participant regards $60 for now to be equal to $100 in 2 days after, we can set the k-value '0.33' as a 'non-difference point'.</p><p>In this study, the non-difference point of each participant in the IC task was identified by observing the first time they changed their choice from delay option to immediate option. All items in this task are shown in <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>. For example, if a participant consistently chose the delay option from item 1 to item 3, and then changed his/her choice to the immediate option at item 4, then the nondifference point should be estimated between the k-value of item 3 and the k-value of item 4. We calculate the geometric mean of these two k-values as the participant's final IC k-value.</p><p>In extreme cases, participants might choose all delayed options or all immediate options, which means there is no 'non-difference point'. In this case, we adopted a valuation method to estimate a k-value for this participant. During valuation, it can be determined that if a participant exclusively chooses the immediate options, their discounting rate must be higher than the highest discount rate in this task. Accordingly, the final k-value of this participant is the geometric mean of the maximum k-value and 4 Ã . Conversely, if a participant exclusively chooses the delay options, their k-value must be lower than the lowest k-value in this task, and we use the geometric mean of the minimum k-value and 1 4 as the final k-value. </p></div>			</div>
