			<abstract>
				<p>The association between cognitive training and exercise motivation remains unclear, particularly when the training is not explicitly focused on modifying goal content. Our study investigated the impact of such training on exercise-related decision-making skills among a sample of low-active adults (N = 233; Mage = 46.7 years) who completed the Exercise Motivation Inventory-2 (EMI2) at baseline and one-month follow-up. Latent profile analyses (LPA) were used to identify participants&apos; motivational profiles at each time point, and longitudinal tests of profile similarity and latent transition analyses (LTA) assessed the replicability of these profiles and the stability of participants&apos; profile membership over time. Our results revealed four profiles, which were replicated over time: Weakly Motivated, Moderately Motivated with Fitness Orientation, Moderately Motivated with Psychological Well-being Orientation, and Strongly Motivated. Membership to these profiles was not influenced by participants demographic characteristics, and only minimally by baseline Fitbit steps and cardiorespiratory fitness. The first two profiles displayed fewer months (over a period of 12 months post-intervention) meeting physical activity guidelines, whereas the latter two showed higher levels of adherence. The Strongly Motivated profile was the least stable but most influenced by the cognitive training intervention, whereas the Moderately Motivated with Fitness Orientation was more stable but similarly influenced by the intervention. These findings highlight the potential of a multimodal cognitive training in influencing exercise motivation and behavior, providing practical implications for tailoring interventions to specific motivational profiles. Future research should investigate the specific types of cognitive training most effective for enhancing exercise motivation and adherence.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Approximately 42.5% of US adults do not meet public health guidelines for physical activity (i.e., 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity per week; World Health <ref type="bibr">Organization, n.d.)</ref>. Adult aging is also associated with a lower likelihood of taking advantage of a goal-oriented physical activity <ref type="bibr">[exercise]</ref> program <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bethancourt et al., 2014)</ref> and with a higher likelihood of dropping out from such programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Molanorouzi et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>During middle age, declines in physical functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown et al., 2017)</ref> as well as increases in chronic health conditions and cognitive decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aubert et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Taylor et al., 2020)</ref> all exacerbate the importance of maintaining physical activity for overall health and well-being.</p><p>These observations all highlight the physical, psychological, and social benefits of exercise across the lifespan as a way to help mitigate age-related changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(McPhee et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>These benefits often drive many middle-aged adults to initiate an exercise program <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bethancourt et al., 2014)</ref>. Motives for engaging in and continuing exercise may also change over time for any number of reasons owing to fluctuations in work or family obligations (e.g., retirement or empty nest syndrome; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cox &amp; Rhodes, 2023)</ref> or personal health status, which in turn may impact exercise motivation and behavior. Although motives for exercise in midlife can mirror those of young adults (e.g., enhancement of physical functioning and physical appearance; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mullen &amp; Whaley, 2010)</ref>, middle-aged adults tend to reallocate attention toward health preservation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hoare et al., 2017)</ref> and to leverage more social support during physical rehabilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brewer et al., 2003)</ref>. Understanding the unique motivational profiles of middle-aged adults can inform targeted interventions accounting for life changes and providing support and encouragement to maintain an active lifestyle.</p><p>Exercise motives can be used as a map to guide and tailor interventions designed to promote adherence and enjoyment <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ley, 2020)</ref>, and in turn more favorable health outcomes.</p><p>Using latent profile analysis, researchers have studied underlying subpopulations of MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 5 participants endorsing distinct types of motives for exercising (i.e., motivational profiles).</p><p>Specifically, evidence gathered to date suggests that adults whose motivational profiles center around autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Emm-Collison et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lindwall et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Miquelon et al., 2017)</ref> tend to engage in more physical activity. However, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lindwall et al (2017)</ref>, a major limitation of prior research is that exercise motives have predominantly been conceptualized along a continuum (from low to high levels), whereas more holistic approaches to motivational profiles in relation to fitness and exercise goals should also include considerations of balance and compatibility. Balance reflects the range of goals individuals pursue, which could be either imbalanced (i.e., hyper-focused on a specific objective to the neglect of others), or well-balanced (i.e., valuing a diversified portfolio of goals that ensures a comprehensive approach to fitness, promoting overall health and wellbeing). The compatibility dimension involves the interrelation of these goals, which can be in conflict (i.e., pursuing objectives that are mutually exclusive or incompatible, like trying to gain muscle mass and lose weight simultaneously), or complementary (i.e., following a set of goals that synergistically support each other to achieve a broader objective, such as combining cardiovascular, strength, flexibility, and balance exercises to improve overall health). Although anyone can endorse multiple motives for exercise, this endorsement does not guarantee full commitment to successful goal attainment. Concordant psychological phenotypes (see for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sheldon, 2004)</ref> may facilitate exercise adherence, whereas discordant motives may serve as a psychological barrier.</p><p>Even when comprehensive approaches to exercise motivation are pursued in research and untethered to restrictive theoretical assumptions of motivational continuums or stages, analyses have primarily isolated levels of exercise motivation at a single point in time <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bomi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Huellemann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lindwall et al., 2017)</ref> or consolidated multiple occasion data in a single latent profile analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Rector et al., 2019)</ref>. Few studies have been designed to MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 6 test the effects of interventions on longitudinal transitions from one motivational profile to another, and the impact of profile status and change on subsequent physical activity.</p><p>Moreover, most previous studies have relied on self-reported physical activity. Among available evidence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gebhardt et al. (1999)</ref> used latent transition analysis (LTA) with a sample of 504 Dutch nursing staff members (Mage = 33) to characterize stability and naturally occurring changes in physical activity reflecting five behaviorally distinct profiles over a oneyear period. Similarly, Schmid et al (2020) used LTA to identify "movers" (30%) and "stayers" (70%) in terms of motivational profiles, exercise behavior, perceived changes in fitness and well-being among a sample of 769 German university students (Mage = 27) followed over four months. To our knowledge, no study has yet examined the extent to which middle-aged adults transition toward more favorable motivational profiles in the context of an exercise intervention, while also relying on electronic data collection of exercising.</p><p>The complex dynamics of exercise motivation in adults often deviate from the prescriptive approaches of many physical activity promotion programs, which traditionally emphasize performance goals like meeting national guidelines. This focus may not effectively support low-active populations who might lack the requisite psychological competencies or self-regulatory capacity to realize such objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Rector et al., 2019)</ref>. In this context, individuals' beliefs in their capabilitiestheir self-efficacyemerge as a pivotal influence on motivation, with the potential to either constrain or facilitate exercising <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McAuley &amp; Blissmer, 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">McAuley et al. (2011)</ref> showed that the impact of baseline executive functioningthe cognitive processes that regulate thoughts and actionson longterm exercise adherence was mediated by effects on self-efficacy, underscoring the intricate interplay between self-efficacy, self-regulation, and executive functioning. Complementing this understanding, our review <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Buckley et al., 2014)</ref> highlighted the reciprocal relationship between exercise and executive control. We, therefore, propose a shift in strategy towards MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 7 interventions that bolster participants' self-regulatory skills, such as goal prioritization, decision-making, and time management, while encouraging learning and fully accommodating personally defined goals. This approach, used in the motivational outcome data collection for the current study, is aimed at reinforcing participants' efforts to adhere to national physical activity guidelines, thereby enhancing their overall exercise experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Study</head><p>This study aims to (a) explore the baseline heterogeneity in exercise motives among low-active, middle-aged adults within a randomized controlled trial context, (b) determine if a multi-modal cognitive training intervention (alone or in combination with individual differences) affects the pattern of transitions across motivational profiles, and (c) assess the extent to which endorsement of specific motivational profiles (or longitudinal transitions across profiles) differentially affects physical activity engagement across a one-month interval. Understanding profile stability and transitions to profiles associated with adherence to physical activity guidelines may reveal strategies for promoting physical activity engagement and maintenance. were not meeting physical activity guidelines for moderate intensity (150 minutes per week) and 56% were not meeting vigorous intensity guidelines (50% met one guideline or the other). Average body mass index for the sample was 33.04 kg/m 2 (SD = 7.97). Self-reported MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 8 levels of past engagement indicated that, on average, it was months-to-years since they were continuously active (i.e., without stopping for more than two weeks), and the average lifetime exercise experience was between six months and two years. Most (95.9%) participants believed that the purpose of the study was to "test the effects of exercise on memory".</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The broader purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to test the effectiveness of a novel multimodal exercise adherence-promoting ("Games") intervention on physical activity behavior relative to an attentional control ("Videos") condition, and to maximize real-world translatability and generalizability across diverse populations. A detailed description of the parallel-groups design, intervention protocol and training effectiveness for the broader investigation has already been published <ref type="bibr">(Mullen et al., n.d.)</ref>. In brief, participants were randomly assigned to receive 20 hours of cognitive training via Games (n = 118; stationary computerized tasks emphasizing executive functioning and exerciser self-certainty [affirming one's convictions and doubting one's self-doubt], and exergaming with dual-task components) or attentional-control health educational Videos (n = 115). Training was split across five, two-hours lab sessions (overall adherence = 98.3%), followed by five, two-hours home sessions. At-home protocol adherence was similar for both groups. For the Games group, an average of 76.7% of the five-hour cognitive training was completed at home. Video engagement was assessed with accuracy to questions about each of the videos. The average accuracy for in-lab sessions was 82.4% and for at-home sessions was 82.0%. In total, 70.4% of day 10 logs were completed; 58.8% of logs were submitted, on average, across all five at-home sessions. The Games and Videos groups submitted approximately the same percentage of home logs (61.0% vs. 56.5%).</p><p>Participants were also provided a yearlong fitness facility membership with daily opportunities to join group classes and encouraged to meet public health recommendations MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 9 through any combination of facility-based or self-guided activities. They were encouraged to meet 2018 public health recommendations, primarily through moderate intensity activity (minimum of 150 minutes of aerobic training, two days per week of strength training) and to engage in any combination of fitness facility (class-supported) exercise or self-guided activity, including at-home walking and weightlifting. For purposes of the present investigation, participants completed a battery of assessments (psychosocial, neuropsychological, and physical) at baseline (T1: pre-intervention), and after one-month (T2: post-intervention). This study is thus intended to capture the immediate motivational changes attributable to the intervention. However, physical activity monitoring was maintained for 12 months post-intervention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Demographics. Age (in years), gender (0 = female; 1 = male), education (1 to 7), race (0 = white; 1 = other), employment status (0 = part time; 1 = full time), and annual family income (1 to 8) were self-reported at baseline. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jurca et al. (2005)</ref>, we derived a fitness estimate that incorporated gender, resting heart rate (RHR), body mass index (BMI), and a self-reported physical activity (SRPA) index. Participants graded their habitual physical activity across multiple contexts, providing an SRPA index value on a scale from 0 (inactive) to 4 (more than 3 hours of aerobic exercise weekly).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimated cardiorespiratory fitness at baseline. Using a strategy established by</head><p>Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is expressed in ml/kg/min. The BMI was obtained through height and weight measurements using a Seca 213 portable electronic scale and stadiometer, while the RHR was ascertained through pulse oximetry (SantaMedical Generation 2) after a tranquil 10-minute interval. The final estimated CRF value was then computed through the provided equation: CRF = Gender (2.77) -Age (.10) -BMI (.17) -RHR (.03) + SRPA + 18.07 MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 10 Physical activity. Physical activity steps at baseline were assessed from Fitbit Charge 2 portable devices over a period of seven days. Similar procedures were repeated at the end of each month post-intervention, for a period of 12 months. Participant accounts were configured to be remotely synchronized and aggregated with the 3 rd party Fitabase service (Small Steps Labs LLC, San Diego, CA). Seven days of data collection prior to randomization were averaged. Days were considered "valid" if participants had at least 10 hours of consecutive heart-rate activity. Procedures for wear-time and non-wear procedures have been fully described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Troiano et al. (2008)</ref> and applied to Fitbit data by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gaudet et al. (2017)</ref>. A multiple imputation procedure based on predictive mean matching was used to account for any missing data (ranged from 6.00% to 36.73% missing days per month, with a mean of 22.46% across the trial) prior to calculating the composite step score. Minutes spent in moderate and vigorous intensity (based on Fitbit's algorithmic classification utilizing participant profiles that include age, sex, height, weight, and heart rate measures) were used to generate binary variables indicating whether or not participants met physical activity guidelines (PAG; 1=yes, 0=no) each month (based on the last seven days of the month). The percentage of months in accordance with guidelines permitted the calculation of three continuous measures of PAG adherence (meeting moderate intensity-only guidelines, or meeting vigorous intensity-only guidelines, or meeting moderate or vigorous intensity).</p><p>Exercise Motives. The 51-item Exercise Motivation Inventory-2 (EMI-2, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ingledew et al., 1998)</ref> was used to assess individuals' self-reported motives for exercise using a six point scale (0=Not at all true for me, 5=Very true for me). Although the EMI-2 consists of 14 subscales, our study focused on six key motives -stress management, enjoyment, affiliation, health, appearance, strength/endurance. This selection was not random but was informed by the common motives for exercise reported by middle-aged adults and those changes most likely to be experienced and prioritized during group exercise classes or self-guided training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 11</head><p>We particularly centered our investigation on motives like physical appearance, strength, and health, as they are typically high priorities for our target population. Affiliation, on the other hand, was included to account for individual differences and personal preferences, recognizing that social support was not an explicit component of our intervention design.</p><p>Instead, our approach aimed to enhance self-regulatory capacity, providing participants the autonomy to seek their own support, if desired. Consequently, those who found enjoyment in group classes may have manifested stronger affiliation motives. This approach reflects the complexity of exercise motivation in a real-world setting and gives a more accurate insight into the factors driving individuals to participate in and adhere to regular physical activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses Preliminary Analyses</head><p>All analyses conducted in this study were estimated in Mplus 8.8 with the robust maximum likelihood (MLR) estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2017)</ref>, and full information maximum likelihood (FIML) to handle the limited number of missing data at the item level (MT1 = .04%, MT2 = 10.7%). FIML allowed us to include all participants (N = 233) who completed survey data on at least one occasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Enders, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Graham, 2009)</ref>. We first estimated preliminary factor analyses to evaluate the psychometric properties and longitudinal invariance of our motivation measure. Invariant (i.e., equivalent over time) factor scores, estimated in standardized units (M = 0, SD = 1), were saved from these models and used in our main analyses. Relative to manifest scale scores, factor scores provide a way to preserve the nature of the underlying measurement model (e.g., invariance) while partially controlling for unreliability (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Morin et al., 2016)</ref>. Details on these models and their invariance are reported in the online supplements. Correlations between all variables included in this study are presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 12</head><p>We estimated LPA solutions including 1 to 8 profiles separately at T1 (preintervention) and T2 (post-intervention) using the six motivation indicators obtained as part of our preliminary analyses (stress management, enjoyment, affiliation, health, appearance, strength/endurance). The mean and variance of all six motivation indicators were allowed to vary across profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Morin &amp; Litalien, 2019)</ref>. To ensure convergence on a true maximum likelihood, these analyses relied on 5000 random start values each allowed 1000 iterations, and 200 final optimizations. These values were increased to 10000, 1000 and 500 for the longitudinal analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Morin &amp; Litalien, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to considering the theoretical meaningfulness, heuristic value, and statistical adequacy of each solution, statistical indicators were also used to guide the selection of the optimal number of profiles at T1 and T2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Morin &amp; Litalien, 2019)</ref>: the Akaïke Information Criterion (AIC), the Consistent AIC (CAIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the sample-size Adjusted BIC (ABIC), the adjusted Lo-Mendel-Rubin likelihood ratio test (aLMR) and the bootstrap likelihood ratio test (BLRT). Lower values on the AIC, CAIC, BIC, and ABIC suggest a better-fitting model while a significant p-value on the aLMR or BLRT suggests the superiority of a solution relative to one including one less profile. Statistical simulation studies have demonstrated that some statistical indices (i.e., CAIC, BIC, ABIC, BLRT) were particularly effective and should therefore be prioritized in selecting the optimal number of profiles, whereas others generally failed to provide useful guidance (AIC, ALMR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Diallo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Peugh &amp; Fan, 2013)</ref>. For this reason, these last two indicators are only reported to ensure full disclosure and will not be used to guide model selection. Moreover, all indicators continued to suggest the addition of profile beyond the optimal solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Marsh et al., 2009)</ref>. It has thus been suggested to represent the information criteria graphically using elbow plots, in which the flattening of the slope can be used to guide the solution of the optimal solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Morin &amp; Litalien, 2019)</ref>. Finally, we also report MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 13 the entropy, as an indicator of classification accuracy (ranging from 0 to 1). Although the entropy is not a reliable indicator of the quality of a solution, it does provide useful descriptive information <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lubke &amp; Muthén, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Longitudinal LPA and Latent Transition Analyses (LTA)</head><p>After selecting the optimal LPA solution at both time points, and assuming the same number of profiles over time, these solutions were combined into a longitudinal LPA to assess their similarity over time in the following sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Morin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Morin &amp; Litalien, 2017)</ref>: (1) configural similarity (same number of profiles); (2) structural similarity (same within-profile means); (3) dispersion similarity (same within-profile variances), and (4) distributional similarity (same profile size). Similarity is confirmed when lower values are observed on at least two information criteria out of the BIC, ABIC, and CAIC from one step to the next <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Morin et al., 2016)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictors and Outcomes of Profile Membership</head><p>We first estimated a series of predictive models to verify the possible relevance of controlling for participants demographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, education, race, employment status, and annual family income).

We contrasted a series of four models: (a) null effects: These variables were unrelated to participants' profile membership at T1 and T2; (b) T1: These variables were allowed to predict profile membership at T1, but not T2; (c) T2: These variables were allowed to predict profile membership at T2, but not T1; (d) Transitions:</p><p>These variables were allowed to predict changes in profile membership between T1 and T2.</p></div>

Neither the ABIC, nor the BLRT, converged on a dominant solution. The CAIC reached its lowest point for the 5-profile solution at T1 and T2, and the BIC reached its lowest point for the 7profile solution at T1 and the 5-profile solution at T2. However, the elbow plots suggest that the optimal solution is likely located between three and five profiles at both time points.</p><p>Based on these results, solutions including three to five profiles were more thoroughly inspected. A first observation was that these solutions were already quite comparable over MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 15 time, thus providing early evidence of configural similarity. A second observation was that adding a fourth profile resulted in a meaningful addition to the solution at T1 and T2 (the new profile corresponded roughly to the second profile illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>). Adding a fifth profile did not result in a more theoretically meaningful, distinct, and interpretable solution (it only resulted in the arbitrary division of our first profile into two smaller profiles with a similar shape). Therefore the 4-profile solution was retained for further analyses. The results from the tests of longitudinal similarity conducted on this 4-profile solution are reported in the top section of <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and supported its complete longitudinal similarity (i.e., each step resulted in a decrease in the value of all three information criteria). The final model of distributional similarity was thus retained for interpretation and is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> (detailed parameter estimates as reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table S4</ref> of the online supplements).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study sought to identify the nature of the exercise motives profiles observed among a sample of low-active, middle-aged adults. Moreover, it investigated (a) the replicability of these profiles and the stability of participants' profile membership over a period of one-month, (b) the effects of a multi-modal cognitive training intervention on participants' profile membership and profile transitions, beyond those of participants' baseline levels of cardiovascular fitness and exercising, and (c) the impact of specific motivational profiles on participants' ongoing levels of physical activity engagement over a 12-month period post-intervention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivational Profiles</head><p>Our results revealed four profiles, corresponding to Weakly Motivated, Moderately Motivated with Fitness Orientation, Strongly Motivated, and Moderately Motivated with a Psychological Well-Being Orientation participants. These profiles share important similarity with those found in other samples across the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bomi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Huellemann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lindwall et al., 2017)</ref>, and appeared to reflect meaningful inter-individual differences in exercise motives. Importantly, identical profiles were identified before and after our intervention, thus supporting the replicability and robustness of these profiles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 19</head><p>Participants' profile membership showed some degree of change before and after the intervention. Indeed, whereas membership into the Moderately Motivated with Psychological Well-being Orientation (stability of 67.4%) and into the Weakly Motivated (54.8%) profiles remained relatively stable over time, membership stability was lower for the Moderately Motivated with Fitness Orientation (45%) and Strongly Motivated (37.9%) profiles. These results indicate that the profiles are not rigid individual characteristics, but rather changeable configurations describing participants' motivational orientation at a specific point in time.</p><p>The Strongly Motivated profile was the least stable over time, with most participants corresponding to this profile transitioning (57.1%) to one of the moderately motivated profiles, although transitions toward the profile with a well-being orientation (42.7%) were twice as frequent as those involving the profile with a fitness orientation (14.8%). In contrast, only less than 5% of the initially Strongly Motivated participants transitioned toward the Weakly Motivated profile. This result suggests that maintaining consistently high levels of motivation across many indicators can be challenging. However, rather than dropping drastically over a one-month period, these motives seem to become more focused (toward fitness or well-being) rather than to remain generalized. When considering these results, it is particularly interesting to note that the Moderately Motivated with Psychological Well-being Orientation (with the highest stability in membership) and the Strongly Motivated (with a dominant transition tendency toward the Moderately Motivated with Psychological Wellbeing Orientation profile) profiles were systematically associated with the highest level of adherence to physical activity guidelines.</p><p>It was also interesting to note that Weakly Motivated and Moderately Motivated with Fitness Orientation participants at baseline all seemed to experience a dominant transition toward the Moderately Motivated with a Psychological Well-Being Orientation profile (30% for the former profile, and 34.4% of the latter). This result suggests that individuals who MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 20 initially exhibited low levels of motivation or a strict focus on fitness may have shifted toward a more balanced profile centered on psychological well-being over time. This observation is particularly interesting, as both of these profiles were associated with the lowest adherence to physical activity guidelines. The low levels of affiliation motives observed in these two profiles suggest that they may benefit from additional social support.</p><p>This could potentially take the form of increased interaction and supervision from exercise leaders, expert guidance, or enhanced peer camaraderie, either through targeted interventions or as a natural extension of membership activities. However, affiliation motives tend to be infrequently endorsed by middle-aged adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Molanorouzi et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effects of Cognitive Training on Motivational Profiles</head><p>Even though profile membership seemed relatively independent from participants' demographic characteristics, the cognitive training intervention had differential effects on profile transitions. First, the intervention increased the likelihood of transitioning from the exercise motivation were positively modulated in response to the intervention. This could be due to the flexibility of this intervention, which allowed everyone to attend aspects of exercise that were either personally meaningful or sustainable. Indeed, our intervention was designed in accordance with experimental and theoretical assertions about self-regulatory capacity, in conjunction with public health physical activity guidelines, and was somewhat detached from participants' own preferences, goals, and belief-systems. Specifically, our intervention emphasized dual-task traininghalf involved stationary computerized tasks and the other half involved cognitive-motor training through exergamingand was expressly designed to enhance self-regulatory capacity (e.g., goal prioritization and decision-making), and in turn, sustained physical activity engagement. Moreover, upon completion of the 20hour intervention, no supervision or guidance was provided, allowing participants flexibility in the choice of how to meet physical activity guidelines. Although changing one's reasons for exercising was not the primary goal of our intervention, it appears to have helped participants gain new insights and derive a sense of progress and enjoyment from exercise. It is therefore not surprising that our findings suggest that favorable motivation stability and change can be explained, at least in part, by our intervention.</p><p>In contrast, the intervention had no impact on transitions for participants who initially corresponded to the Moderately Motivated with a Psychological Well-Being Orientation profile. Interestingly, participants corresponding to this (most stable) profile, along with those corresponding to the Strongly Motivated (most unstable) profile, adhered most closely to physical activity guidelines. One possible explanation for the lack of intervention effects could be that participants corresponding to this profile already displayed an optimal motivational orientation characterized by well-developed strategies and a robust internal drive to exercise, making them less susceptible to fluctuations targeted by our intervention. It is also plausible that members of this profile may have recently undergone lifestyle changes or have made lifelong commitments to prioritizing personal well-being over physical fitness or appearance. Of course, it is also possible that our measures were not sensitive enough to detect subtle changes in motivational profiles, or that the timing and frequency of the intervention were not optimal for affecting motivational fluctuation in this group. However, the intervention had no effects on transitions for participants who initially belonged to the Weakly Motivated profile. This suggests that, despite its demonstrated efficacy for some participants displaying already moderate or high levels of motivation, our intervention may fall short of generating changes among Weakly Motivated participants, who MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 22 may require a more intensive or sustained intervention. These speculative explanations lay the groundwork for further research into how cognitive training interventions impact not just physical activity, but also the complex motivational profiles that underlie these behaviors.</p><p>Our results finally highlighted the role of baseline cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity levels in relation to profile membership. Fitter participants were less likely to belong to the Moderately Motivated with Fitness Orientation profile relative to the Weakly Motivated and Moderately Motivated with a Psychological Well-Being Orientation profiles.</p><p>Moreover, participants with higher physical activity levels were also less likely to be classified in the Moderately Motivated with Fitness Orientation profile relative to the Strongly Motivated and Moderately Motivated with a Psychological Well-Being Orientation profiles. It is possible that individuals focused on fitness may be successful without extensive support or feedback, but perhaps could be swayed to diversify their goals in order to benefit from short-and long-lasting improvements in their affect and well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>These findings have important implications for designing targeted interventions to promote physical activity adherence among middle-aged adults. Focusing on strategies that encourage a balance between various exercise motives, particularly psychological well-being, may help individuals maintain higher levels of physical activity and overall well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lachman et al., 2018)</ref>. Facilitating a sense of agency in the reframing of age-related perceptions and expectations at program onset, and then checking in to validate or redirect feelings of self-worth is also advisable. The multi-modal cognitive training intervention appears to be effective in promoting more favorable motivational profiles, especially for those initially focused on fitness goals or those who are strongly motivated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>There are some limitations to this study that should be acknowledged. First, one could MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND EXERCISE 23 argue that our recruitment could have led to a biased "motivated sample" or that our survey methods may be subject to social desirability bias. However, with 25.6% of participants showing weak levels of motivation and just 12.7% reflecting strong levels of motivation, this possibility seems unlikely. Second, the study sample was limited to low-active, middle-aged adults, which may limit the generalizability of our findings to other age groups or more active populations. Future research should explore the stability and transitions of motivational profiles in different populations and investigate the specific mechanisms through which interventions influence motivational profiles and subsequent physical activity engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This study provides valuable insights into the motivational profiles of low-active, middle-aged adults, and their transitions over time.
