			<abstract>
				<p>While some evidence suggests that faces are perceived holistically, research on the neural organization of the visual system and people&apos;s subjective experiences indicate that face parts can also be analyzed individually. Thus, advances in theories of face perception are met with two major challenges: How can hierarchical face representations be used to integrate holistic and analytic encoding within the same framework? And how can the stages of face processing be integrated with higher-level cognitive processes, such as memory and decision-making, that are recruited during facial perception? We propose a novel computational framework termed the Modular Serial-Parallel Network (MSPN), which synthesizes several perceptual and cognitive approaches including memory representations, signal detection theory, rule-based decision-making, mental architectures (serial and parallel processing), random walks, and process interactivity. MSPN provides a computational modeling account of four stages in face perception: (a) representational, (b) decisional, (c) logical-rule implementation, and (d) modular stochastic accrual of information and can account for both choice probabilities and response-time predictions. We used MSPN to explore and validate theories across multiple paradigms: (i) in the composite face paradigm, our analyses revealed support for holistic encoding in aligned conditions and analytic encoding in misaligned conditions providing an explanation for the Congruency × Alignment interaction; (ii) in the part-to-whole paradigm, analytic encoding and holistic encoding were equally successful in accurately capturing facial feature recognition; (iii) in a new study of the other-race effect, MSPN showed an impressive ability in fitting the individual choice RT distributions over other models. The application of MSPN suggests that facial processing varies based on the task, that holistic perception does not necessarily imply complete pooling into a single face object, but MSPN can reveal the precise nature of processing that gives rise to holistic effects in different paradigms.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Faces are a critical source of social information, and the ability to accurately identify and interpret facial features is essential for successful social interaction.</p><p>Identifying a person's face allows us to better adapt to social situations, improve our social skills, find a romantic partner, or recognize an enemy. It is not surprising that many researchers support the idea that face perception is special and different from the perception of other visual objects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ellis &amp; Young, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Biederman &amp; Kalocsais, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Golby et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">McKone, Kanwisher &amp; Duchaine, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Leibo, Mutch, &amp; Poggio, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">McKone, &amp; Robbins, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">but cf. Gauthier &amp; Logothetis, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bukach, Gauthier, &amp; Tarr, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Both face and object perception involve the use of hierarchical representations, in which a face or object is represented as both a whole and as individual parts. For instance, in our everyday experience, we can easily shift our attention between different parts of an object or face, and from the individual parts to the entire object or face.</p><p>There is neurophysiological evidence supporting the idea that the visual cortex has a hierarchical organization of neurons with receptive fields that increase in size from simple, elementary features to whole objects or faces (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hubel &amp; Wiesel, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Riesenhuber &amp; Poggio, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Hochstein &amp; Ahissar 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Nichols, Betts, &amp; Wilson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b206">Zhen, Fang &amp; Liu, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Henriksson, Mur &amp; Kriegeskorte, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Erez, et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Haas, Schwarzkopf, Alvarez, Lawson, Henriksson, Kriegeskorte, &amp; Rees, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Wang, Zhen, Song, Huang, Kong, &amp; Liu, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Nestor, Plaut &amp; Behrmann, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Goffaux, Duecker, Hausfeld, Schiltz &amp; Goebel, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Fan, et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Zhang, Jiang, Song, Zhang, &amp; He, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Ricci &amp; Serre 2020</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Tanaka &amp; Farah, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">cf. Rossion, et al., 2011)</ref>. This suggests that the brain processes visual information in a hierarchical manner, with lower-level neurons responsible for detecting basic features and higher-level neurons responsible for integrating these features into more complex representations of objects and faces. This hierarchical organization allows us to process visual information at different levels of granularity, from individual features to whole objects or faces.</p><p>To understand how the brain processes faces, researchers have proposed the opposing concepts of analytic and holistic encoding. The holistic encoding hypothesis suggests that the brain creates a new, integrated representation of a face by combining the individual features of the face into a single unit (for the comprehensive review see . Decisions about the identity or other aspects of the face are based on this emergent, holistic representation. Analytic encoding, on the other hand, refers to the idea that the brain processes faces by analyzing individual featural units separately. With analytic encoding, decisions and behaviors are driven by values representing individual features rather than any combination of those features. Effects consistent with holistic processing are then, theoretically, the result of overlearned, automatic attentional strategies applied to these individual features <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Richler, Palmeri &amp; Gauthier, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Richler, Wong &amp; Gauthier, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Various methods used to test the holistic encoding hypothesis involve manipulating the degree of interference expected from holistic processing and measure the sensitivity of the perceptual system to these changes. This approach has been used with a variety of methods, including altering the wholeness of a face through feature displacements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Tanaka &amp; Farah, 1993)</ref>, hiding or removing face parts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Tanaka &amp; Farah, 1993)</ref>, face inversion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Yin, 1969)</ref>, splitting and misaligning face halves (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Young, Hellawell, &amp; Hay, 1987)</ref>, comparing the recognition of individual parts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Tanaka &amp; Farah, 1993)</ref>, studying Thatcherized-effects arising from inverting individual features (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Thompson, 1980)</ref>, and scrambling the face (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Collishaw &amp; Hole, 2000</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Maurer, Le Grand, &amp; Mondloch, 2002</ref> for a review). Inference in these paradigms typically involves first identifying performance differences between upright, aligned faces and other conditions (e.g., inverted, misaligned faces or non-face objects), and then interpreting these differences as indicators of holistic processing.</p><p>One of the key limitations of previous work in the domain of holistic face perception is the use of vaguely defined theoretical constructs. Many studies have relied on concepts such as failure of selective attention as a marker of holistic processing, yet this may result from multiple theoretical mechanisms that mimic each other . Specifically, failure to attend to individual facial features may result not only from the holistic "gluing" of features into an integrated perceptual representation but instead from an overlearned attentional strategy. The lack of clarity regarding which specific cognitive operations contribute to holistic processing has led to conceptual ambiguity, making it difficult to determine whether different studies are measuring the same underlying phenomenon. Furthermore, neither of these accounts say anything about the underlying processing system -for instance, whether processing is serial or parallel <ref type="bibr">(Fific &amp; Townsend, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>A second limitation of prior theoretical approaches is the tendency to overgeneralize theoretical constructs without providing a clear rationale for how different processing structures interact. This overgeneralization reduces the falsifiability of models, as different mechanisms may be invoked to explain the same empirical results without a clear decision rule for determining which mechanism applies in a given context. An example of this issue is the Interactive Configural Processing Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Maurer, Le Grand, &amp; Mondloch, 2002)</ref>, which proposes that face processing involves multiple levels of featural, configural, and holistic information. However, this theory does not specify how these subsystems interact or which conditions lead to the activation of one type of processing over another. Without a clear decision structure, such models become overly flexible, making them difficult to test rigorously.</p><p>A third major issue is model mimicry, where different theoretical accounts can produce similar behavioral patterns, leading to misinterpretation of holistic effects. A notable example is the partial version of the composite face task <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Goffaux &amp; Rossion, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Rossion &amp; Boremanse, 2008)</ref>, where participants must determine whether one half of a face remains the same while ignoring the other half. The common inference from this task is that holistic processing causes interference between aligned face halves.</p><p>However, accuracy differences between aligned and misaligned faces can also be explained by response biases rather than genuine holistic integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Gauthier &amp; Bukach, 2007)</ref>. Furthermore, alignment effects could be driven by multiple cognitive mechanisms, including increased parallel processing, exhaustive processing, or failures of inhibition for aligned faces. The presence of model mimicry in these paradigms highlights the need for formal computational models that explicitly test competing mechanisms rather than assuming that behavioral differences necessarily indicate holistic processing.</p><p>Finally, a significant limitation of prior work is the reliance on single dependent measures, often focusing solely on accuracy while neglecting other critical behavioral indicators. This approach limits the falsifiability of models and prevents a comprehensive analysis of cognitive and perceptual processes. For example, studies that only analyze response accuracy fail to account for trade-offs between speed and accuracy, which provide important diagnostic evidence for distinguishing between different processing architectures. Even when both reaction times and accuracy are collected, they are often analyzed separately rather than being jointly modeled within the same theoretical framework. Without a quantitative structure that links both response accuracy and reaction times, previous studies have struggled to rigorously validate their theoretical claims, leaving open the possibility that alternative explanations remain untested.</p><p>Taken together, these limitations highlight the need for a more rigorous and computationally explicit approach to the study of holistic face perception. In the current paper, we propose the Modular Serial-Parallel Network (MSPN), explicitly designed to alleviate and address each of these limitations of previous approaches by providing a unified framework that formally specifies processing architectures, decision-making mechanisms, and the interactions between perceptual and memory processes, thus enabling stronger theoretical validation and greater model falsifiability.</p><p>Modular <ref type="bibr">Serial-Parallel Networks (MSPN)</ref> In this section, we introduce the Modular Serial-Parallel Network (MSPN) model, to provide a common framework for integrating analytic and holistic encoding with cognitive processes such as memory and decision-making. MSPN is a complete processing model that can account for response accuracy, choice preference, and response times (RTs) in tasks with binary response outcomes, although it can be extended to tasks with multiple alternatives or continuous responses (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Smith, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">van Ravenzwaaij, et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Zhou, et al., 2021)</ref>. The model synthesizes advances in RT modelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Busemeyer, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Link, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Luce, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Townsend &amp; Ashby, 1983)</ref>, mental architecture modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Kantowitz, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Schweickert, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Sternberg, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Townsend, 1984)</ref>, non-parametric measures of systems identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Townsend &amp; Nozawa, 1995;</ref>, and theories of decision making in perceptual categorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ashby &amp; Townsend, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ashby &amp; Gott, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fifić et al., 2010)</ref>.  Note: The stimuli are composed of two dimensions, X -lips-to-nose separation and Y -eye-to-eye separation, with four values per dimension, combined orthogonally to produce the 16 combinations of the stimulus set. The central face indicates a spatial location of the reference face that was used to establish decision criteria for responding on both featural dimensions. The stimuli in the lower-right quadrant of the space, separated by dotted lines, are the members of the "target" category (Category A), whereas the remaining stimuli are the members of the other category (Category B). Membership in the A category is described in terms of a conjunctive rule -(both facial features are larger than that of the reference face), and membership in the B category is described in terms</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"AND"</head><p>At the representational level, perceptual objects, such as faces, are decomposed into a set of elementary visual features. These featural representations are stored as point values in a multi-dimensional face space, with each dimension representing a different feature. There is noise associated with each featural representation, modeled as a normal distribution around the true feature value <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1</ref>, Left -the axes "Memory representation"). This is intended to capture the idea of single feature tuning neurons in the primary (or lower-level) visual system, which are thought to be important for early processing of visual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Hubel &amp; Wiesel, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Riesenhuber &amp; Poggio, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>At the decisional level, the cognitive system establishes stimulus-response associations and determines how to segregate featural representations based on task expectations. This is achieved through setting a decision criterion, which partitions a featural dimension into two response regions. In categorization choice tasks, each region is associated with a different binary decision outcome <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1</ref> left, category A and B). For example, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, if a featural activation falls to the right of the decision line (dotted line), this is interpreted as evidence in favor of category A, while activations to the left are interpreted as evidence in favor of category B. This process is related to signal detection theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Green &amp; Swets, 1966)</ref> and its multidimensional extensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ashby &amp; Townsend, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ashby &amp; Gott, 1988)</ref>, which propose that decision-making is based on the evaluation of sensory evidence against a criterion.</p><p>In the next stage, logical rule implementation, a system can use different logical combinations of micro-decisions on separate features representations to decide which on a response (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Townsend &amp; Nozawa, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fifić, Little &amp; Nosofsky, 2010;</ref>. For example, if recognition requires all features to be analyzed, the system might use a conjunctive rule with an AND gate. This is also called an exhaustive stopping rule. On the other hand, if recognition only needs one feature to be recognized, the system might use a disjunctive rule with an OR gate, which is called a selfterminating stopping rule. In this case, the system can make a final decision based on a single feature, regardless of whether other features are available or not.</p><p>In the next section, we describe the modular stochastic accrual of information. In MSPN, we combined two extremely successful approaches to the modeling of RT data and response choices, namely the random-walk and mental-architecture approaches.</p><p>The core of these ideas was recently published as the logical rule models first introduced in perceptual categorization by <ref type="bibr">Fifić, Little, &amp; Nosofsky (2010;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Little, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Blunden, Hammond, Howe &amp; Little, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Fong, Blunden, Garrett, Smith &amp; Little, 2024)</ref> and tested across several experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Blunden, Howe &amp; Little, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Blunden, Wang, Griffiths &amp; Little, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cheng et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Fong, et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Little, Nosofsky &amp; Denton, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Little, Nosofsky, Donkin &amp; Denton, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Moneer, Wang &amp; Little, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Yang, Wang, Chang,, et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The random walk (RW) is a stochastic accumulator of noisy evidence over time that makes discrete steps over discrete time units. In the random walk, the observer establishes a threshold representing the amount of evidence that is needed to make a category A or B decision. At each step, a random walk process collects a small amount of evidence coming from activated noisy memory or sensory representation. The likelihood of accumulating either evidence for A or B is determined by stepping probability p to Criterion A, and 1-p toward Criterion B. The parameter p defines how likely is that, at each step of evidence accumulation, the sampled evidence from memory representation supports either A or B decision. In MSPN (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fifić, Little &amp; Nosofsky, 2010)</ref>, the value of p is proportional to the area under the normally distributed featural representation, bounded by the decision criterion and by the end of the tail of that distribution <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>) on the featural dimension. It is important to note that the stepping probabilities are not treated as free parameters in MSPN (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fifić, Little &amp; Nosofsky, . 2010</ref>) but are indirectly derived from the parameters describing memory and decision-making process. 1</p><p>1 We use the random walk model as a convenient approximation to the continuous accumulation of evidence and prediction of response time distributions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008)</ref>. Other approximations are possible including linear ballistic accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2008)</ref> which has been used in some applications of the logical rule models <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Moneer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cheng et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>We adopt the random walk approach here because it provides a tractable way to simulate interactions between processing channels. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. A face presented on a two-dimensional space representing lips-to-nose and eye-to-eye, respectively Note: Each facial property is represented as a noisy distribution around the mean value N(M, σ), separated by a decision bound D, into two response regions. Each region contributes to evidence sampling toward one of the two category responses A and B. For each facial property, the sampling regions are proportional to the area under the normal distribution so that in 1 = ∫</p><p>( 1 , σ 1 ) 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">−∞</head><p>, and 1 = 1 − 1 . The stepping probabilities 1 and 2 , are used in two separate random walk processes, associated with each facial property, and it is important to see that their values are determined by the properties of the normal distribution associated with the status of featural representations and the position of the decision bounds (D1 and D2).</p><p>In (I) sampling of the featural evidence will likely be congruent at each time step as both 1 and 2 , are larger than .5 (shaded regions), which means that both random walks are more likely to sample evidence for category A then for category B. In contrast, as shown in <ref type="bibr">(II)</ref> sampling of the featural evidence will likely be incongruent at each time step, as the first property is more likely to sample evidence for category A membership, while the second property is more likely to sample evidence for B category. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D 1 D 2 N(M 1, σ 1 ) N(M 2, σ 2 ) N(M 1, σ 1 ) N(M 2,<label>σ 2 )</label></formula><p>If the evidence from a sampled feature falls into region A, the random walk takes a step in the direction of Criterion A; otherwise, it takes a step in the direction of Criterion B. The final decision about whether the stimulus belongs to category A or category B is determined by whether the evidence reached Criterion A or Criterion B, respectively. The time required to make a decision using the random walk model is determined by the number of steps needed to complete the process.</p><p>To determine an overall response, potentially combining several random walks, a mental architecture is implemented. A mental architecture determines processing order of several random walks, each representing micro-decisions about separate facial features. In a serial architecture, the featural sources are analyzed in a strictly sequential fashion. Serial processing is represented as a series of sequential random walks ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure    1</ref>, on the right, at the top). If the decision rule is an AND rule, then the expected RT is the sum of the two random-walk evidence accumulation times RT=T1+T2; but if the decision rule is an OR rule, then the RT is determined by one of the random walks RT=T1, or RT=T2. In a parallel processing architecture, the series of featural sources are analyzed simultaneously, which is represented as a set of parallel random walks <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1</ref>, on the right, in the middle). If the decision rule is an AND rule, the expected RT is the slowest time to process each feature, RT=Max(T1, T2); if the rule is an OR rule, then the expected processing time is the fastest processing time of the two features, RT=Min(T1,T2). 2</p><p>Finally, MSPN makes provisions for possible process dependency when multiple attributes from the same object are considered. The concept of process dependency means that the time needed to complete processing of a single attribute, depends on the time needed to process another attribute(s). The concept is non-trivial and several definitions of process dependency have been provided <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Townsend &amp; Ashby, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ashby, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Colonius, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Townsend &amp; Thomas, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Diederich, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Usher, &amp; McClelland, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Dzhafarov, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Townsend &amp; Wenger, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Kujala &amp; Dzhafarov, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Eidels, Houpt, Altieri, Pei &amp; Townsend, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Little, Eidels, Houpt, Garrett &amp; Griffiths, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Yang Altieri &amp; Little, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Yang, Wang, Chang, et. al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Zhang, Liu &amp; Townsend, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Townsend, &amp; Liu, 2022)</ref>. In MSPN, we will consider the version of the process dependency that has been typically considered within the parallel processing systems, dubbed the parallel-interactive model <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Eidels, et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Yang, Yang, Wang, Chang et al., 2019)</ref>. In this approach, the interaction between two stochastic accumulators occurs when accumulators can communicate with each other during evidence accrual. We will consider how this communication is formalized in the framework of random walk accumulators. For example, two parallel random walks could exchange the sampled evidence toward one of the response boundaries, at each step during accumulation.</p><p>The concept of process dependence between separate processing units has been proposed in several cognitive models, including lateral inhibition models <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Grossberg, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">McClelland &amp; Rumelhart, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Usher &amp; Ratcliff, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Eidels, et al., 2011)</ref>. The nature and extent of interaction in these models is often determined by the values of their free parameters. For instance, in many stochastic sequential sampling models, the type of interaction is determined by the values of the model's parameter matrix, such as in the stochastic General Recognition Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ashby, 2000</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Eidels et al, 2011)</ref>. On the other hand, other theoretical approaches have fixed the type of interaction between stochastic accumulators based on the model's assumptions, such as the dynamic relationship between facilitatory inputs and inhibitory lateral connections between accumulators (as seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Grossberg, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">McClelland &amp; Rumelhart, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Usher &amp; Ratcliff 2001)</ref>.</p><p>In MSPN, two random walk counters interact by exchanging evidence from activated features at each step of their random walk. For example, if the first random walk samples evidence for category A, its accumulator will increase by +1. If the second random walk also samples evidence for category A, the interactive module of MSPN will exchange the values, so that each random walk adds 1+1=2 to its accumulator, resulting in a faster "march" towards category A. On the other hand, if either of the random walks sample evidence for category B, their accumulators will decrease by 1.</p><p>In general, there are two possible scenarios when considering only two random walks for two features: (a) both random walks are accumulating evidence in the same direction (towards the same decision criteria;  <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Townsend &amp; Wenger, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Wenger &amp; Townsend, 2001)</ref>. They argued that the spectrum of processing from purely analytic to holistic can be defined by three fundamental cognitive properties: processing order, stopping rules, and process interdependency.</p><p>Processing Order (Serial &lt; Parallel)</p><p>The first axiom states that serial processing, involving sequential feature analysis, is less holistic than parallel processing, which analyzes multiple features simultaneously.</p><p>Analytic processing, associated with piecemeal, feature-based representations, typically occurs as a slower serial process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Tversky &amp; Krantz, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Smith &amp; Nielsen, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bradshaw &amp; Wallace, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Hole, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Fitousi, 2021)</ref>. In contrast, holistic processing assumes unitized representations and is often associated with fast parallel processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Matthews, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Sergent, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Wenger &amp; Townsend, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fifić &amp; Townsend, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Martens, Leuthold, &amp; Schweinberger, 2010)</ref>. MSPN formalizes this principle through its modular organization, allowing a probabilistic switch between serial and parallel processing modules from trial to trial. Specifically, the parameter pmod determines the likelihood of engaging either serial or parallel processing, enabling MSPN to quantify the degree of analytic versus holistic processing. Within the serial module, the processing order is further specified by the parameter pser, representing the probability of analyzing facial attributes in a particular sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stopping Rules (Terminating &lt; Exhaustive)</head><p>Holistic encoding is characterized by exhaustive processing, which integrates all available feature-based evidence before reaching a decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">(Wenger &amp; Townsend, 2001</ref>). Conversely, analytic processing is associated with terminating stopping rules, allowing decisions to be made as soon as a single informative feature is sufficiently processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Townsend &amp; Nozawa, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Innes-Ker, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fifić &amp; Townsend, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Yang, Fifić, Chang &amp; Little, 2018)</ref>. MSPN implements stopping rules explicitly through logical gates. An AND (exhaustive) rule requires completion of processing for all facial features before a response can be generated, reflecting holistic encoding. In contrast, an OR (self-terminating) rule allows responses based on the completion of only one feature's evaluation, characteristic of analytic processing. This distinction enables MSPN to explicitly determine whether observed holistic effects result from genuinely exhaustive processing or from another mechanism.</p><p>Process Interdependency (Independent &lt; Interactive/Coactive)</p><p>The third axiom concerns feature interdependency. Independent feature processing,</p><p>where facial features are separately evaluated, is considered less holistic than interactive processing, in which features dynamically exchange information <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ashby, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Townsend &amp; Wenger, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Eidels et al., 2011)</ref>. MSPN quantifies feature interaction through the parameter pcross , which modulates the probability of evidence sharing between two random-walk accumulators within parallel processing channels.</p><p>At pcross = 0, features are processed independently without cross-talk. At intermediate levels (0 &lt; pcross &lt; 1), partial interaction occurs, reflecting graded holistic processing.</p><p>At maximal levels (pcross = 1), MSPN represents a fully integrated, coactive processing model analogous to a face template, in which all facial feature information seamlessly contributes to a unified perceptual decision. Thus, MSPN allows quantification and differentiation among these varying levels of feature interdependency and clearly distinguishes genuine holistic face processing from simpler forms of parallel or serial independent processing.</p><p>Memory Representation and Decision Components in MSPN: In addition to these foundational axioms, MSPN provides deeper insights into facial representation at both memory and decisional stages through its detailed parametric structure (for details see The importance of memory-level analyses connects directly to prominent theoretical accounts of holistic face perception. For example, the overlearned attention hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chua, Richler, &amp; Gauthier, 2014</ref> and theories emphasizing failures of selective attention  propose distinct underlying mechanisms driving holistic effects. MSPN's ability to quantify memory variance can help distinguish between these theories by determining whether changes in memory representations or decisional criteria underlie holistic effects.</p><p>At the evidence accumulation stage, MSPN explicitly models decision-making as a stochastic random-walk process, characterized by parameters such as stepping probabilities toward decision boundaries and decision thresholds (+A, -B). Although MSPN formally uses stepping probabilities to represent discrete evidence accumulation toward one of the decision boundaries, these probabilities closely align conceptually with drift rates, a term commonly employed in continuous drift-diffusion models. Drift rates, in general communication, refer to how quickly and reliably evidence accumulates for individual features, while decision thresholds represent how much cumulative evidence is required to commit to a categorical decision. These parameters allow MSPN to quantify precisely how different facial features contribute to overall perceptual judgments, revealing feature-specific differences in evidence strength and decisional criteria.</p><p>In sum, MSPN's explicit incorporation of processing order, stopping rules, process interactivity, and detailed parametric analyses of memory and decision-making provides a robust framework for validating and differentiating theoretical accounts of holistic face perception.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Accounts of Holistic Face Processing and Their Validation within MSPN</head><p>Holistic face processing has been widely studied through different theoretical lenses, each proposing distinct mechanisms underlying the integration of facial features into a coherent percept. These accounts range from face templates and configural processing theories to interactive and attentional models. While these frameworks have provided valuable insights, they often lack a unified computational structure to formally test their predictions. The Modular Serial-Parallel Network (MSPN) offers a means to quantitatively assess these theories by specifying the extent of feature interactivity (pcross), processing architecture (pmod ), memory variance, and evidence accumulation parameters, including decisional parameters. Below, we discuss key theoretical perspectives on holistic processing and how MSPN can serve as a tool for their validation and falsification.</p><p>1. Face Template Hypothesis: One of the most prominent ways to understand holistic face processing, stemming from Gestalt ideas about the benefits of whole configurations, is with recourse to the idea that the parts of the faces are pooled or integrated into a unitary whole. That is, the individual parts of the face along with their configuration and second-order characteristics (e.g., spatial relations between parts) are pooled into a single object. The notion that faces are processed as whole-face templates falls into this category.</p><p>Evidence in favor of face templates comes from tasks showing that face inversion impairs identification relative to upright face processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Maurer, Le Grand, &amp; Mondloch, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Valentine, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Yin, 1969)</ref>. One argument is that the individual parts and their organization are identical in an upright face compared to an inverted face; consequently, the impairment caused by inversion must be because inverted faces do not match the preferred template orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(McKone &amp; Yovel, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, inverted faces may be processed less efficiently than upright faces because the automatic allocation of attention is disrupted by inversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Curby &amp; Gauthier, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sekular et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Richler et al., , 2012</ref>. In support of the latter argument, inverted faces can reveal a composite face task interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cheng et al., 2018)</ref>, but this has been shown to arise later in the processing time course . <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Gold et al. (2012)</ref> tested whether recognizing whole faces provides additional benefits beyond recognizing individual parts by using an "integration index." This index compares actual performance to that predicted by optimal integration (Bayesian integrator). A value of 1 indicates optimal integration, while values greater than 1 suggest additional benefits from processing the whole face. Gold et al. found values slightly below 1 for both upright and inverted faces, suggesting no advantage for wholeface integration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Richler et al. (2012)</ref>  2. Configural Processing Theory: The configural processing theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Diamond &amp; Carey, 1986)</ref> extends beyond the face template model by emphasizing that emergent spatial relationships among facial features provide additional information critical for recognition. This theory suggests that upright faces are processed by encoding secondorder spatial relationships, which are disrupted by face inversion and other transformations such as misalignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Thompson, 1980)</ref>. Unlike the face template hypothesis, which assumes that face perception is based on a predefined holistic representation, configural processing theory argues that face recognition benefits from the explicit encoding of spatial relationships between features rather than a fixed template.</p><p>A related definition of holistic processing posits that the specific configuration of an upright face conveys additional information that enhances recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Diamond &amp; Carey, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Rhodes et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Searcy &amp; Bartlett, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Leder &amp; Bruce, 2000)</ref>. This is demonstrated in the Thatcher illusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Thompson, 1980)</ref>, where local feature distortions (e.g., inverted eyes and mouth) appear grotesque when a face is upright but go unnoticed when the face is inverted. This illusion supports the claim that face perception relies on the processing of global spatial relationships rather than isolated features. Other face manipulations, such as inversion or misalignment, also impair the use of configural information, further suggesting that upright face recognition depends on the encoding of spatial structure rather than just featural content.</p><p>Within the Modular Serial-Parallel Network (MSPN) framework, this theory can be tested by analyzing how spatial properties influence the structure of memory representations. Specifically, if configural processing is a core mechanism, manipulations of spatial relationships should systematically alter both the mean and variance parameters of memory representations, reflecting how spatial configurations affect facial encoding. The key MSPN prediction is that different spatial configurations (e.g., varying distances between features) should correspond to distinct mean and variance values. This would indicate that configural properties are explicitly encoded in memory rather than being merely an emergent consequence of feature integration..</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conversely, falsification of the configural processing account would occur if spatial</head><p>properties of facial features do not systematically modulate memory mean and variance, suggesting that face perception operates primarily at a featural level rather than encoding explicit configural relationships. In this case, MSPN would fail to detect distinct representational differences (in mean or variance) between spatially altered and unaltered faces, undermining the claim that configural information is independently represented in memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Interactive Configural Processing Theory: The Interactive Configural Processing</head><p>Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Maurer, Le Grand, &amp; Mondloch, 2002)</ref> extends configural processing accounts by proposing that face perception integrates multiple levels of configural information, building upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Diamond and Carey's (1986)</ref> model. This theory suggests that face processing involves the integration of all facial features and their spatial relations into a single perceptual representation, rather than treating features as isolated units. It differentiates between three primary levels of configural processing: first-order relational processing, which enables recognition of a stimulus as a face due to its basic structural arrangement (e.g., two eyes above a nose and mouth); holistic processing, which integrates facial features into a unified percept, making it difficult to selectively attend to individual components; and second-order relational processing, which encodes subtle spatial variations among features, allowing for the discrimination of individual faces. While this theory provides a broad conceptual framework, it does not specify a systematic mechanism explaining how these different levels interact. A major limitation is the lack of a formal decision structure, making it unclear when and how different processing levels are engaged during face recognition. This reduces its falsifiability, as it does not generate specific predictions about when face perception relies on featural, holistic, or configural processing strategies.</p><p>The Modular Serial-Parallel Network (MSPN) provides a quantitative method for evaluating whether face perception dynamically transitions between these processing levels or consistently relies on a single interactive process. Within MSPN, the Interactive Configural Processing Theory can be tested by examining whether configural integration occurs through interactive processing mechanisms and whether task-dependent feature interactivity emerges. Specifically, MSPN predicts that in the composite face task, where participants must attend to one part of the face while ignoring the other, misaligned faces should exhibit independent processing (pcross = 0), while upright aligned faces should exhibit significant feature interactivity (pcross &gt; 0). Additionally, if face inversion disrupts configural encoding, MSPN should reveal a reduction in feature interactivity (pcross &gt; 0 with upright faces but decreased or absent with inverted faces). If interactive processing is central to holistic perception, inversion should lead to decreased, but not eliminated, feature interactivity (pcross &gt; 0 with inversion), reflecting a partial breakdown of configural integration rather than a shift to purely featural processing.</p><p>Conversely, falsification of the Interactive Configural Processing Theory would occur if face processing does not exhibit task-dependent modulations of feature interactivity. Specifically, MSPN would fail to support the theory if misalignment conditions still showed interactivity (pcross &gt; 0 in misaligned faces), suggesting that spatial alignment is not necessary for configural processing. Similarly, if face inversion does not lead to changes in feature interactivity (pcross remains the same across upright and inverted faces), it would suggest that configural processing is not fundamentally disrupted by inversion, contradicting one of the core assumptions of the theory.</p><p>Additionally, a strong falsification criterion would be if face recognition relies primarily on serial processing with self-termination (pmod = 0), meaning that decisions can be reached without integrating configural relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Interactive Processing Models:</head><p>Interactive processing models <ref type="bibr">(Fifić &amp; Townsend, 2010)</ref> propose that holistic face effects arise from graded interactivity between facial features, rather than from a rigid face template. These models suggest that evidence accumulation across different facial features can range from completely independent processing (pcross = 0) to fully interactive, coactive processing (pcross = 1). The coactive processing framework suggests that face perception benefits from facilitatory parallel cross-talk between feature-processing channels, meaning that when face parts interact, the exchange of information aids identification by increasing the efficiency of evidence accumulation. This interaction occurs at different levels of integration, allowing graded holistic effects rather than an all-or-nothing template-driven process <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Eidels et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Interactive facilitatory cross-talk between facial features has itself been posited as a theoretical definition of holistic processing . According to this approach, holistic face perception emerges from graded interactivity between facial features rather than being dependent exclusively on fixed configural representations. MSPN explicitly embodies this process-based perspective by allowing varying degrees of interactive information exchange across parallel channels. At lower levels of interaction (0 &lt; pcross &lt; 1), MSPN models partial interactivity between feature-specific channels, reflecting a continuum of holistic processing rather than a strictly categorical distinction between independent and integrated processing. When pcross = 0, face features are processed independently without inter-channel influence, indicating purely analytic processing. In contrast, at maximal interactivity (pcross = 1), MSPN describes fully coactive processing, in which information from separate feature channels merges completely, effectively simulating the effects of a holistic face template.</p><p>Importantly, coactivity can also be defined at the representational level, where a face is treated as a single entity, processed within one unified channel, implying complete integration at the stage of memory representation, prior to evidence accumulation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Townsend &amp; Nozawa, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fifić, Little, &amp; Nosofsky, 2010)</ref>. This definition suggests that all feature integration and information pooling occur before any evidence accumulation or decision-making begins. Such a representation-based coactive model contrasts with MSPN's primary definition, which emphasizes process-based parallel interactive facilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Eidels et al., 2011)</ref>. Despite conceptual differences, both process-based interactive models and representation-based coactive models generally yield similar empirical predictions for holistic processing effects (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Howard et al., 2017</ref>, for potential dissociations).</p><p>MSPN thus distinguishes between these two interpretations by explicitly manipulating interactivity parameters within the evidence accumulation process. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Overlearned Attention Hypothesis:</head><p>The overlearned attention hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chua, Richler, &amp; Gauthier, 2014</ref> challenges the notion that holistic effects arise from inherent, face-specific mechanisms, instead proposing that they stem from learned attentional biases. According to this view, holistic face processing is not an innate property of the visual system but rather a perceptual strategy that develops through experience and expertise in recognizing upright faces. Unlike theories that posit automatic, mandatory holistic integration, the overlearned attention hypothesis suggests that face perception relies on an attentional strategy that prioritizes whole-face processing due to its learned efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Chua &amp; Gauthier, 2016)</ref>. However, this strategy is not obligatory; individual face parts remain available for independent processing, but over time, expertise makes attentional allocation less flexible and more biased toward holistic strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Richler et al., 2011a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Richler et al., , 2011b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Wong &amp; Gauthier, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Empirical evidence supporting this theory comes from findings demonstrating that holistic effects can be learned and unlearned. The composite face task has been particularly useful in testing this hypothesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chua et al. (2015)</ref> showed that the composite face task interaction effect-often taken as evidence of holistic processingcan be trained to emerge with non-face objects. That is, if participants develop expertise with a novel stimulus class, they begin to process those stimuli holistically, similar to how faces are processed. Conversely, by manipulating face stimuli to disrupt their diagnostic value in a pre-task classification phase, the holistic effect can be eliminated for upright aligned faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chua et al., 2014)</ref>. These findings suggest that holistic processing is a consequence of learned attentional strategies rather than an innate property of face perception. Learning to disregard non-diagnostic face regions reduces reliance on holistic strategies, demonstrating that the effect is not intrinsic to face perception itself but rather a byproduct of experience and expertise.</p><p>This attentional expertise hypothesis contrasts with strong holistic processing accounts, which assume that face perception innately requires the integration of all features into a single, unitary representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Carey, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Diamond &amp; Carey, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Gauthier &amp; Tarr, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Meadows, 1974)</ref>. If holistic face perception were truly automatic, it should be resistant to learning-based modifications, yet the ability to both induce and eliminate holistic effects in experimental settings suggests that attentional biases, rather than face-specific mechanisms, drive these effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Gauthier, Skudlarski, Gore, &amp; Anderson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Grill-Spector et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Xu, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>One of the issues with the testability of the Overlearned Attentional Theory is that the so-called "holistic effects" can be attributed to several possible mechanisms, making it difficult to isolate a definitive explanation. For example, Chua et al. (2014) highlight this challenge: "Although our current data cannot speak to whether failures of selective attention to diagnostic composites occurred because of attention weights assigned to diagnostic parts, or from facilitated grouping of parts that were automatically attended, both of these explanations are consistent with our general hypothesis that learned attention to diagnostic parts drives holistic processing of faces."</p><p>This core ambiguity is that the observed holistic effects could stem from increased attentional weighting to specific facial features or from a facilitated perceptual grouping process that enhances holistic perception. These two mechanisms-attentional prioritization vs. grouping-are theoretically distinct according to the Modular Serial-Parallel Network (MSPN) theory and represent different levels of holistic processing.</p><p>The first account, in terms of MSPN, focuses on enhancing memory processes for particular facial features. If holistic effects stem from learned attentional strategies, then MSPN should reveal increasing drift rates and decreasing memory variance with expertise, reflecting greater efficiency and stability in facial representations over time.</p><p>These effects would be evident as changes in the drift rate of memory representations and their variance.</p><p>However, the second account aligns more closely with the Parallel Interactive Processing approach (Fific &amp; Townsend, 2010, which assumes that holistic effects in facial recognition tasks (e.g., composite face paradigms) emerge due to increased facilitation between face parts. In MSPN terms, this would manifest as changes in the pcross parameter, indicating stronger perceptual integration between facial features.</p><p>In short, the Overlearned Attentional Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chua, Richler, &amp; Gauthier, 2014</ref>) may not be fully defined regarding how selective attention to facial parts occurs. This is where MSPN provides a critical advantage, as its framework allows for a precise examination of the presence or absence of violations of selective influence-a key distinction that can only be observed under a serial self-terminating processing framework. Within the MSPN model, this would require clear-cut attentional separation of facial parts, something that holistic effects should disrupt if interactive processing mechanisms are at play. In addition, MSPN allows for distinguishing the between the type of failure of the selective attention, that could result in the so-called observed holistic effect, that is whether it is simply the result of the increasing memory weights of the attended facial parts, and/or it is the results of cross facilitation between facial parts. Thus, distinguishing between these competing accounts requires empirical tests that manipulate attentional weighting and perceptual grouping separately, while leveraging MSPN's parameters (drift rate, variance, pcross) to detect systematic changes in processing dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Failure of Selective Attention Hypothesis:</head><p>The failure of selective attention is not a theoretical framework but rather an empirical construct used to characterize the inability to selectively process individual facial features without interference from irrelevant face parts (for an overview see . Although frequently cited as evidence of holistic face perception, it is not a singular phenomenon but rather a broad category of effects that can emerge through different mechanisms.</p><p>Various experimental paradigms have been used to operationalize this construct, with the composite face task serving as a primary method. This task demonstrates that observers struggle to ignore irrelevant facial information when making feature-based judgments, leading to interference effects that suggest faces are not perceived as independent features but as integrated wholes. Similarly, the Garner interference task <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Garner, 1974)</ref> provides additional evidence that facial dimensions are difficult to process independently, as variations in irrelevant dimensions often disrupt task performance. The fact that these tasks capture the failure of selective attention in different ways raises the question of whether holistic face processing is a consequence of perceptual integration, attentional constraints, or decision-level interactions.</p><p>Richler &amp; Gauthier (2014) outline multiple possible mechanisms underlying the failure of selective attention, emphasizing that holistic face perception may arise due to distinct cognitive and perceptual processes rather than a single unified effect. One proposed mechanism is perceptual-level integration, in which facial features are automatically bound together in early visual processing, making it difficult to isolate individual features . Another account suggests that attentional constraints play a role, with expertise-driven biases prioritizing whole-face representations, making selective processing effortful <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">(Wong &amp; Gauthier, 2010</ref>).</p><p>Finally, decision-level interference provides an alternative explanation, in which responses to one feature are influenced by congruency effects from irrelevant features, leading to systematic disruptions in accuracy and response times. These different mechanisms indicate that holistic face effects may not stem from a single cognitive process but rather from multiple interacting sources of interference.</p><p>The diversity of these potential mechanisms presents a challenge for holistic processing theories, as different experimental paradigms may be capturing distinct cognitive effects rather than a single cohesive process. Given this complexity, it is necessary to employ rigorous computational methods that can differentiate between these underlying mechanisms. The Modular Serial-Parallel Network (MSPN) offers a powerful framework for testing whether holistic face perception results from genuine feature integration or from attentional and decision-level limitations. MSPN allows for a direct assessment of whether interference effects stem from processing constraints, attentional biases, or response-based congruency effects by distinguishing between serial, parallel, and interactive processing architectures.</p><p>If holistic effects arise purely due to attentional limitations, MSPN should reveal strong evidence for serial processing (pmod = 0) and feature independence (pcross = 0), indicating that face perception is not truly holistic but rather that selective attention is constrained by experience-driven biases. This would support the idea that faces are not necessarily processed as wholes but rather that individual features cannot be selectively ignored due to learned attentional strategies or decision-level interference. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Walkthrough of a two-feature face categorization study</head><p>In this section, we provide a step-by-step account of how MSPN operates in a binary decision task (computational details are presented in Appendix A). We assume an experiment in which an observer must learn to categorize faces with respect to two second-order facial features: eye-to-eye separation and lips-to-nose separation (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Fifić, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fifić &amp; Townsend, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang, Fific, Chang et al., 2018)</ref>. From these two dimensions, we create a set of faces such that each face varies on the two properties but in different combinations. Assume that 4 featural values are selected for each dimension; when orthogonally combined, this produces a 4 ×4 stimulus space (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>) .</p><p>Assume the goal is to that the binary task involves learning to perceptually recognize two groups of faces, Group A and Group B, as indicated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure    1</ref>; dotted lines in the face matrix), such that subjects would learn to accurately make a classification decision and respond Category B either when the separation of two eyes or the separation between lips and nose of the test face was narrower than that of the reference face {4, 4}, and otherwise, respond Category A. During the initial phase of the task, a participant would learn the values of the facial features and develop a featural representation for each dimension.</p><p>When a test face is presented, MSPN assumes that it is decomposed into featural representations activated in memory. For example, when test face {7,5} is displayed <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1</ref>, circled face), the activated featural representations are eye-to-eye separation {7} and lips-to-nose separation {5}. The cognitive system determines whether the activated features belong to category A or B by sampling evidence from both sources.</p><p>The sampling process is a stochastic process and occurs in small steps over time via a random walk. At each step, sampled evidence is classified as either category A or B evidence by comparing the sampled featural dimensional value to the decision criteria.</p><p>We assume that the decision criteria is approximately {4, 4}, the midpoint on both dimensions. The retrieved value of the eye-to-eye separation and lips-to-nose separation might be {6.37, 3.13} (e.g., a random draw from a normal distribution centered at {7, 5}. In this case one source of evidence would be classified as belonging to category A: {6.37 &gt; 4}, and the other as belonging to category B: {3.13 &lt; 4}. This evidence drives the two random walks counters, each accumulating evidence from a single feature. The first RW increases one step toward the A bound; the second increases one step toward 3 There are several reasons for choosing this particular design. First, application of the orthogonal manipulation of featural properties (4 × 4) leads to a factorial design, which can be used to correctly identify the underlying mechanistic structure of the cognitive processes involved (e.g., serial versus parallel processing). The foundation of this idea is demonstrated in work of the Systems Factorial Technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Townsend &amp; Nozawa, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fific &amp; Little, 2017)</ref>, which is a methodological suite of tools designed to improve identification of underlying processing orders, while avoiding model mimicry. Second, the full factorial design, allows for testing properties of using different logical rule combinations which result in different predictions for the conjunctive and disjunctive rule categories <ref type="bibr">(Fifić et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Little, Eidels, Fifić &amp; Wang, 2015;</ref>. Third, this stimulus design defines three regions of the stimulus configuration set (more details in the method section). Under task specifications, these regions incur different processing mechanisms thus forcing different outcome behavior of different models, which can improve identification of model's properties. the B bound. Before continuing, the system tests whether one of the two counters reached either decision bound. If the B boundary is reached then the system stops and a B response is generated. This is called the "OR" rule of information integration or sometimes referred to as the self-terminating rule. If both counters reach the A boundary, then the system would stop too and trigger the A category response. Given that both featural sources match the category membership, this rule was defined as the "AND" rule or sometimes referred to as exhaustive stopping rule. The system continues gathering evidence if it is unable to make a final decision. The evidence sampling process is random, so the next set of values collected could be {7.12, 5.13}, which would both indicate category A membership.</p><p>The accumulation of evidence for both features can be conducted in a serial or in parallel fashion <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1</ref> on the right). If the system uses a serial module, then the two random walks would be engaged in sequential order; that is, evidence sampling would occur on one feature (e.g., eye-to-eye separation) first. The order of serial completion is governed by the parameter pser, representing the probability that, on each individual trial, the dimensions are processed in the order lips-to-nose -then-eyes-to-eyes (rather than eyes-to-eyes then-lips-to-nose, see Appendix A). Depending on the final classification decision (A or B), the RW will terminate on finding that the first feature is B (following the "OR" rule) or continue with the second feature following classification as A (following the "AND" rule). If the second processed feature is classified as B then the system would respond B. Otherwise, the final response would be A. If processing is parallel, both random walks operate at the same time. The same logic is used to determine the final response based on the outcomes of each RW.</p><p>If the parallel processing module is engaged, then the system can further engage the interactive mechanism. In the computational model, the interaction is determined by the amount of cross-talk, pcross, between the featural random walks (Appendix A).</p><p>The interactivity is modulated by the opening of the communication gate between the two random walks. If the gate is fully open (pcross=1), the evidence in both channels is summed in each channel creating a correlated set of random walks. In the illustrative example, if the evidence sample is {7.12, 5.13}, each random walk will add one unit of evidence toward the A boundary; however, given that the gate is open, this evidence is exchanged and added to both evidence counts. Consequently, sampling congruent evidence rapidly leads to accumulation toward a boundary leading to faster decisions (see the superimposed random walks in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, right the Parallel Interactive module).</p><p>By contrast, if the sampled evidence is {6.37, 3.13} (i.e., a step toward A in the first RW and a step toward B in the second), the random walks exchange incongruent evidence. When incongruent evidence is exchanged, the random walk that stepped toward A would receive unit evidence to step down toward B resulting in sedentary state after sampling evidence. Sampling incongruent evidence slows processing. Under conditions where mainly congruent evidence is exchanged the two random walks create a high-level integral representation that could be defined as extreme holistic encoding.</p><p>If the gate is closed (pcross = 0; i.e., pure independent channel processing), this prevents the exchange of evidence and results in access to individual facial features. If the gate is partially open (0 &lt; pcross &lt; 1), some evidence exchange between two random walks is allowed which results in correlations of different magnitudes between two featural detectors.</p><p>In MSPN, modularity is controlled through a mechanism that allows the system to operate in either a serial or parallel module. The switch between modules from trial to trial is controlled by the parameter pmod. This adaptive behavior enables the system to process features either sequentially or in parallel, affecting the overall behavior across multiple trials. Such dynamics ensure that the system's output is a mix of responses from the two modules, enhancing the cognitive system's capability to exhibit more naturalistic behavior in its organizational processes. This is akin to how natural cognitive systems might operate, allowing for a flexible and adaptive response pattern that aligns with the varying demands of environmental stimuli.</p><p>A related approach, the Multiattribute Dynamic Decision (MADD) model, also employs modularity by dividing cognitive processes into modules capable of serial or parallel operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Diederich, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Diederich, , 2024</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Diederich &amp; Oswald, 2016)</ref> One of the critical questions researchers explore when combining several cognitive models within the common MSPN framework is whether the integration affects the identifiability of these nested models. To address this concern, we conducted a validation procedure to assess whether the nested models maintain their distinctiveness and identifiability amidst the amalgamation (please see Appendix B).</p><p>These tests consistently demonstrate strong model discriminability and identifiability, addressing any potential concerns of model mimicking or confusion.</p><p>The validation procedure provides robust evidence that the combined cognitive models retain their individual characteristics and can be effectively differentiated within the overarching MSPN framework. This reassures us that our approach of unifying these models under MSPN does not compromise their integrity or hinder their distinct identification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MSPN as an umbrella for process analysis or as an exploratory tool</head><p>Note that MSPN, as an umbrella framework, does not prescribe specific mechanisms or details for individual face perceptual processes. Instead, MSPN can be used as a starting point to develop more detailed and specific questions about processing.</p><p>MSPN can also serve as a validation/falsification tool for critical assumptions, providing evidence for serial or parallel processes in computational face perception networks or testing specific models of evidence accumulation modules used (continuous or discrete time models) and the properties of memory representations underlying them.</p><p>In the subsequent section, we apply MSPN framework as an exploratory tool, specifically focusing on its utility in testing holistic analytic assumptions and providing validation tests for major facial paradigms. Two prominent examples, namely the composite face and the part-to-whole paradigm, will be examined using the MSPN framework.</p><p>We will also introduce and elucidate how MSPN can serve as a theoretical tool in the realm of categorization perceptual tasks, particularly addressing the phenomenon of the other-race effect. This section will demonstrate the application of MSPN in examining cognitive processes related to the other-race effect. By doing so, we aim to showcase the versatility of MSPN as a theoretical framework for understanding and analyzing complex perceptual tasks within the domain of face perception, specifically emphasizing its relevance in the context of the other-race effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applying MSPN to the composite face paradigm</head><p>The composite task has become a standard paradigm in face processing research, applied to various areas such as tracking face recognition development, studying abnormal face recognition development, and evaluating computational models <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cassia et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Le Grand et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Dailey &amp; Cottrell, 1999)</ref>. Holistic processing is inferred from a Congruency × Alignment interaction on sensitivity (d', <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Richler, Cheung, &amp; Gauthier, 2011a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">,2011b</ref>. MSPN offers a comprehensive solution to address various limitations in the context of the composite face paradigm and to provide validation/falsification tool, with which one can explore assumptions underlying face processing:</p><p>1. Joint Analysis of RT and Accuracy: In the traditional approach to testing facial perception, researchers typically analyze either only one measure or, less commonly, both measures in their studies. However, these are typically analyzed separately, and the results are compared for converging validity properties. MSPN's ability to make joint predictions for both reaction time (RT) and accuracy supports the validation of its inferences regarding the specific underlying processes being investigated. The joint analysis allows for explaining intricate relationships between RTs and accuracies, such as a trade-off between these two measures, within the same theoretical framework.</p><p>2. Avoiding Tradeoffs: Separate random walks, associated with different facial features, are engaged in sampling evidence from feature representations. The engagement of random walks' response criteria A and B allows the model to create a variety of response outcomes, including tradeoffs, thus incorporating these as the verifiable theoretical constructs. Thus, the model can dynamically adjust its processing mode based on the requirements of the task and participant strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.</head><p>Modular Organization: MSPN's modular structure allows for both serial and parallel processing, enabling a probabilistic engagement of these modules. This allows MSPN to flexibly switch between analytic and holistic encoding in perceptual operations, accommodating the joint analysis of both reaction times (RTs) and accuracy.</p><p>Parameters like pmod control the likelihood of using the serial or parallel module,  . Critics have pointed out that the partial composite face design, when compared to the complete composite face design, is less valid due to confounds from decisional bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(Richler Gauthier, Wenger, Palmeri 2008;</ref>. However, counterarguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Rossion, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Rezlescu et al., 2017)</ref> suggest that the complete design is is not convincingly strong and lacks construct validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Rossion, 2013)</ref>.  Note: Stimuli are arranged across two critical dimensions, shown here only for the aligned conditions (the misaligned condition has the same stimulus configuration). The upper face half is the "target", and the bottom face half is "irrelevant". The running assumption is that the irrelevant part can also influence making final perception decision, and depending on the serial or parallel module used can differently contribute to response behavior. The green lines indicate the decision bounds that are used to separate each stimulus dimension into response regions. The dataset used in the MSPN analysis is from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Gao et al. (2011)</ref>. The study used the complete composite-face paradigm , where participants first matched Navon stimuli at either the global or local level before attempting to match the top halves of composite faces. 4</p><p>The same/different decision is influenced from two sources. The first source is the target feature, in this case the upper facial section. If the target feature is the sole basis of decision making, then we term this a single-dimensional model. The second source is the irrelevant bottom section of the face. We assume a stimulus configuration that represents the facial feature space. This configuration operates in an orthogonal dimension space with two dimensions associated with each of the top and bottom facial sections. The top and bottom sections can either be the "same" or "different" across the study/test pairs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>We postulate that the presentation of the same/different congruent and incongruent conditions engage the modular processing system outlined by MSPN allowing for a flexible switch between analytic and holistic encoding in perceptual operations. Several hypotheses are proposed based on the MSPN framework:</p><p>(1) Although the bottom section of the face does not help participants respond in the composite face task, we assume that when faces are aligned, the bottom face half influence performance through some degree of holistic processing or failure of selective attention. In terms of MSPN, by allowing the "irrelevant" non-target dimension to influence perceptual decision-making, we should find better model performance compared to the single-dimension model. This should allow the model to predict errors observed in the composite face task and provides a processing-based instantiation of a failure of selective attention.</p><p>(2) We expect that misaligning the face halves results in more analytic processing than aligning the faces. We predict that the best-fitting model in the aligned condition will demonstrate a prevalence for holistic encoding, revealed in the MSPN as an increase in the pcross parameter. By contrast, the misaligned conditions should show a tendency toward analytic encoding with a value of the pmod parameter closer to 0 and the absence of parallel processing and process facilitations. Model fitting details: The computational models' properties are described in the Appendix C. We fitted the models to the mean RTs and response accuracies, aggregated across subjects, as reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Gao et al. (2011)</ref>. The model fits are reported in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, separately for the aligned and misaligned face conditions. The best fitting parameter values across models are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>. The critical statistics used to infer holistic processing, the Congruency × Alignment interaction values, are reported in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. For comparison in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 4</ref> we displayed the Congruency × Alignment interaction values as observed in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Gao et al. (2011)</ref> vs the best model fit provided by MSPN.    The models demonstrated strong alignment with the aggregated subjects' data. Unsurprisingly, as model complexity increased, so did the fit. As higher-level hierarchical representations are engaged, there is a better correspondence between the model and the data. In every instance, the full MSPN yielded the most accurate fits to the data compared to all other models 5 .</p><p>First, we observe that incorporating so-called "irrelevant" or non-target dimension in perceptual decision-making results in improvements compared to the singledimension model <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>. This finding lends support to the notion that the composite effects partly arise from attending to irrelevant dimensions (or failure to suppress attention to irrelevant dimensions). This is further validated by the finding that the single-dimension model demonstrates a much better fit to the data in the misaligned condition than in the aligned condition. Second, in the aligned condition, model fit consistently improves when combining serial and parallel models <ref type="table">(Table 2:</ref>  It is noteworthy that MSPN provides a high resolution of the underlying perceptual and cognitive processes, offering insights that cannot be observed using other methodologies in the composite face task. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cheng et al. (2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cheng et al. ( , 2025</ref> argued in favor of a mixture of serial and parallel processing of composite face but did not directly model the composite face task, instead relying on fitting a categorization task (like our <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>) and arguing for a generalization across task types.</p><p>Also, the Congruency × Alignment interaction values estimated from the model fits provide important clues to understand the convergent properties of the MSPN properties achieve the observed results. Consequently, insights from MSPN can be used to validate or falsify proposed models in facial perception.</p><p>( <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). The results show that two models -the single dimension and the parallel model -showed zero interaction contrast values, indicating an inability to fit the observed data and an absence of holistic encoding. All other models showed some positive Congruency × Alignment interaction. This is expected for the mixed-serial parallel model (serial/parallel in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, 3 and 4), the interactive parallel model, and MSPN. Interestingly, the serial model was also able to generate the interaction albeit of a small magnitude; this is unexpected given the assumption of additivity typically associated with serial processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">(Sternberg, 1969)</ref>. However, a mixed order in the sequence of processing two facial features combined with significant error responses introduces the possibility of non-additive effects. (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chua et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Chua et al., , 2016</ref> can be instantiated in MSPN. Moreover, decision bound placement allows several response outcomes. In the Appendix D, we illustrate how a single MSPN parameter, decision bound placement (Dx), operating on the "target" feature, can contribute to significant Congruency × Alignment interactions across aligned and misaligned conditions, that qualitatively matches those observed in other studies. In the serial model, the decisional component on the "relevant" facial feature can produce the hallmark of holistic processing although the model is strongly analytic.</p><p>In essence, the conclusion is that the Congruency × Alignment interaction is not a helpful statistic for identifying the specific combination of information processing characteristics that underlie performance. MSPN allows us to move beyond simplistic interaction analyses; this allows for a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between different cognitive processes involved in face perception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applying MSPN to the part-to-whole paradigm</head><p>In the part/whole task <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">(Tanaka &amp; Sengco, 1997)</ref>, participants initially study a whole face and then are tested on their memory of individual parts presented both in isolation and within the context of the whole face. Studies employing the part/whole task consistently demonstrate that recognition of individual parts is more accurate when tested in the whole-face condition compared to in isolation, providing empirical support Hierarchical Face Representations for a holistic perspective where alterations in the typical viewing configuration interfere with recognition. Importantly, this advantage is specific to normal, intact, upright faces and is not observed for inverted or scrambled faces or non-face objects. A key result is the sequence of correct recognition rates, P(c), is ordered across different conditions: Like the composite face interaction, the specific processes underlying the order of accuracy across conditions is not revealed by this ordering. Fific and <ref type="bibr">Townsend (2010)</ref> applied Systems Factorial Technology to suggests that the observed sequence, P(c) isolated parts &lt; P(c) old configuration, could be explained by a non-holistic mechanism <ref type="bibr">(Fific &amp; Townsend, 2010)</ref>. For instance, the old configuration condition contains more features congruent with the target face than the isolated parts condition. The addition of congruent features might allow for a redundant target effect (RTE; <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Raab, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Miller, 1982)</ref>, which can be explained through parallel processing (i.e., statistical facilitation; <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Miller, 1982)</ref>, which is only weakly holistic if the channels are independent according to Townsend and Wenger's spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Townsend &amp; Wenger, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Wenger &amp; Townsend, 2001</ref>). .</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P(c)</formula><p>The challenge for a parallel processing explanation is the "new configuration" condition also leads to improved accuracy compared to the isolated parts condition.</p><p>Novel configurations incorporate incongruent facial features (those not belonging to Joe) that could obstruct the recognition of the face stimuli containing the target features (Joe's face). Redundant feature processing in the new configuration condition could reduce response accuracy due to the introduction of incongruent features. Alternatively, an independent parallel model might not be affected by incongruent conflicting information <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Little et al., 2015</ref> but could still benefit from some redundancy due to configural information in the new configuration condition. In the original paper, all three conditions were intermixed within a single block of trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">(Tanaka &amp; Sengco, 1997)</ref> making it improbable that different processing strategies are employed across conditions.</p><p>When the target feature is embedded in either a new or old configuration, target and non-target features could be processed sequentially or in parallel and may involve interactions or operate independently, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 5</ref> (bottom).</p><p>For a strictly serial process, it is plausible that the perceptual analysis begins with the "non-target" facial feature, which may or may not belong to our target face, Joe. If this non-target feature is identified, correctly or incorrectly, as belonging to Joe, the system may self-terminate even though the target feature has not been analyzed. This could allow a serial process to predict the pattern of P(c)isolated parts &lt; P(c)new configuration &lt; P(c)old configuration.</p><p>As in our application to the composite face task, we assume a specific configuration representing the facial feature space. This configuration operates on an orthogonal dimension space with two dimensions associated with each of the target feature and the facial context, varying between "same" (i.e., belongs to Joe) or "different." (i.e., doesn't belong to Joe, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 5</ref>). Note the top panel corresponds to the isolated parts condition, where only the target feature is presented without any facial context; the bottom panel represents the stimulus configuration where the target feature is presented along with facial context, either belonging to Joe (Old Configuration) or not (New Configuration). The separation of the panels is solely for the sake of clarity in presentation, and it is assumed that both configurations initiate the same memory system for retrieval of activated facial feature representation. The middle/smaller circle letter indicates the target feature A=Joe, and B=not Joe. A and B condition trials were mixed within a block. The difference between diagrams in A and B is that in the isolated part condition, only a single feature is presented so, it is assumed that it can only give a rise to one memory representation for presented facial feature, so that the only one decision bound was used in the model. The other two conditions shown in B, would display two parts the target feature location small circle A and B and the facial context part (large circle A and B). It is assumed that these two conditions will give a rise to two activated mental representations that could be assessed, and the two decision bounds were used accordingly. The </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dy Dx</head><p>We make the following hypotheses:</p><p>1. Non-holistic approaches (i.e., serial processing) can predict the observed pattern of accuracy (P(c)isolated parts &lt; P(c)new configuration &lt; P(c)old configuration).

The near-identical results when fitting the serial and parallel modules suggests that the observed effects alone cannot distinguish between separate perceptual processes. Additionally, MSPN's ability to fit non-holistic stimuli, such as inverted faces and houses, indicates that all stimuli in this experiment can be accounted for by highly analytic processing.

Configural features (also termed second-order relations;</p><p>Maurer, Le <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Grand, &amp; Mondloch, 2002)</ref> refer to coding of spatial relations between facial features. The canonical positions of facial features (eyes are above nose and nose above mouth) are defined as the first-order relations. The second-order relations are spatial variations within these first-order relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Diamond &amp; Carey, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Maurer, Le Grand, &amp; Mondloch, 2002)</ref>. Second-order relations are important for perceptual discrimination of faces and can provide important clues to face identification <ref type="bibr">(Fifić &amp; Townsend, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang, Fific, Chang, &amp; Little, 2018)</ref>. In addition to the first-and second-order relational features, our facial perception relies on recognition of particular facial properties, such as the nose, eyes, lips, or skin texture. For the purpose of detecting the holistic vs analytic encoding properties across races, we will limit the domain of our exploration to only the second-order relations.</p><p>The use of second-order features should also help validate MSPN. Previous studies using second-order facial features demonstrated holistic signatures in a face categorization task implementing comparison of parts versus wholes <ref type="bibr">(Fifić &amp; Townsend, 2010)</ref>. This study found evidence for coactivity using Systems Factorial</p><p>Technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Townsend &amp; Nozawa, 1995)</ref> implying that facial features were pooled together indicative of extreme parallel facilitation, as described in <ref type="figure">Figure (</ref>bottom right). Identification of coactivity suggests strong holistic encoding <ref type="bibr">(Fifić &amp; Townsend, 2010)</ref>. More importantly for the present paper, it was also observed that different processing architectures (serial, parallel, coactive) were employed across different facial conditions. For example, when the contextual facial features changed, thus affecting the overall facial configuration, there was more reliance on analytic processing than on holistic processing. By contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cheng and Little (2025)</ref> found no evidence of coactivity but instead found that second order face categorization was best explained by a mixture of serial and parallel processing, with more serial processing when faces were misaligned and more parallel processing when faces were aligned.</p><p>One question <ref type="bibr">(Fifić &amp; Townsend, 2010)</ref> was whether the other-race effect could show some differences in the types of processing from the processing of same-race faces. In a follow up study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Yang, Fifić, Chang, &amp; Little . (2018)</ref> manipulated secondorder relational features across face race conditions. Using SFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Townsend &amp; Nozawa, 1995;</ref>, the authors showed the weak holistic encoding for the samerace faces and strong analytic encoding for the other-race faces. That is, same-race faces were processed in a parallel self-terminating fashion, and other-race faces were processed in a serial self-terminating fashion. These results further supported the idea of modularity of the underlying processing networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expectations</head><p>Our primary goal is to analyze the perceptual and cognitive properties of facial perception. Our second goal is to compare the properties of the face perception of the two different races and their properties of the face perception of the other-and the samerace faces. Our participant groups are Eastern Asian (e.g., Taiwan) and Western</p><p>Caucasian (e.g., USA). These groups geographically reside within their native race culture and are consequently less exposed to faces of another race. Two sets of faces that are typical for the Asian and Caucasian cultures will be used in the classification task.</p><p>First, independently of the subject's race, we expect to observe mainly evidence for holistic encoding of faces; that is, subjects should show more prevalence of parallel then serial processing and more interdependent than independent processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">(Wenger &amp; Townsend, 2001)</ref>. These properties will be evident from the model parameters, pmod and pcross, respectively. Note that the current approach does not require some form of holistic disruption of faces to test "holistic" level of processing unlike other methods (e.g., face inversion or misalignment). Consequently, MSPN can test holistic properties on natural variations in position of facial features, thus increasing the study's ecological validity.</p><p>Second, following a large body of evidence in the domain of face perception, we expect our results to support the other-race effect, that is more perceptual holism associated with a same-race face compared to an other-race face. Accordingly, we expect that the same-race faces will show more cross-talk interaction between facial features and/or more evidence for switching to parallel processing of facial features than the other-race faces. In contrast, it is expected that the other-race faces will demonstrate more facial feature independence and/or serial processing. </p></div>

The stimuli were presented on a 19-inch CRT monitor (CTX VL951T) with a refresh rate of 85 Hz and resolution of 1024×768. A chin-rest was used in order to prevent head movements.

A chin-rest was used in order to prevent head movements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design, Stimuli, and Procedure</head><p>Participants were required to perform two experiments tested with the own-race faces and other-race-faces, respectively. The test order of the two experiments was counterbalanced across participants. The face stimuli were the same as those used in <ref type="bibr">Yang, Fific, Chang, &amp; Little (2018)</ref>; each face was 12° in height and 8° in width (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). The Western Caucasian and Eastern Asian female faces were regarded as typical faces which were rated by another group of participants from the same subject pool (please see <ref type="bibr">Yang, Fific, Chang, &amp; Little 2018</ref>, supplementary materials for the rating results). Each experiment consisted of two phases: a psychophysical phase and formal test phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychophysical Phase</head><p>In the psychophysical phase, we asked the participants to perform a face classification task based on the comparison between the eye-to-eye separation or lipsto-nose separation of a reference face and the test face. We adopted the method of the method of constant stimuli to measure the psychometric function relating feature separation to classification accuracy. The psychometric functions were then used to select salience levels of the eye-to-eye separation and lips-to-nose separation for the following formal test phase. Specifically, there were seven levels for each feature. Only one facial feature was manipulated at a time; that is, when eye-to-eye separation was tested, the lips-to-nose separation of the test face (level 4) was kept the same as that of the reference face; on the other hand, when lips-to-nose separation was tested, the eyeto-eye separation of the test face (level 4) was kept the same as that of the reference face. The eye-to-eye separation was <ref type="bibr">32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, or</ref>   <ref type="bibr">8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18,</ref> or 20 pixels (level 1 to level 7) for Caucasian face. The reference face was defined as the stimulus with level 4 in both eye-to-eye separation and lips-to-nose separation (i.e., Asian face: eye-separation: 44 pixel; lipsto-nose separation: pixel; Caucasian face: eye-to-eye separation: 28 pixel; lips-tonose separation: pixel). <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the two second-order manipulations, separately for Eastern Asian face stimuli. In half of the trials, the test face was the same as the reference face whereas in the rest of trials, the test face and the reference were different in one of the second-order relational manipulations. Specifically, eye-to-eye separation contained seven levels and lips-to-nose separation also contained seven levels. Participants first performed a practice block of 70 trials. Participants then performed 10 blocks of 70 test trials. All the second-order manipulations were randomly intermixed within a block with equal presentation frequency. Across four sessions, which were conducted on different days, there were 200 trials per manipulation in total.</p><p>A psychometric function can then be obtained from the observed data and based on the results of the psychometric function, we can individually select the salience levels for the factorial manipulations in the formal experiment. The selection method is introduced as follows. First, for each individual subject, we plotted the probabilities of responding "Category B" as a function of eye-to-eye separation levels and lips-to-nose separation levels, respectively. The psychometric functions were monotonically Hierarchical Face Representations decreasing functions ranging from 1 to 0. Low accuracy (ACC) may result in incorrect SFT inferences regarding the processing characteristics (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Little, Yang, Eidels &amp; Townsend, 2022)</ref>; thus, we used a criterion of ACC &gt; 0.9 for the selection of high and low salience levels. Second, we plotted the correct RTs as a function of eye-to-eye separation levels and lips-to-nose separation levels, respectively. These functions were inverted U-shape functions, with the fastest RTs for both the narrowest (level 1) and widest level (level 7), which were obviously different from the reference stimulus level (level 4), and the slowest RT for the level closest to the reference stimulus level (level 4). We then combined both the ACC and RT information while keeping the accuracy higher than 0.9 (i.e., the first step) to derive the high and low salience levels for the narrowest and widest separation cases, respectively, via interpolation. This method would ensure that Category A and Category B were equally discriminable.</p><p>The high discriminability level (H) was defined as the stimulus level with approximately100% accuracy and similar RT for Category A and Category B. The low discriminability level (L) was defined as the stimulus level with approximately 90% accuracy and similar RT for Category A and Category B. Levels were calibrated separately for each individual subject. The stimulus levels were formally defined as discrete levels ranging from 1, 1.5, 2, …, to 7. Levels were rounded to the nearest .5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test Phase</head><p>On each trial, after presentation of a fixation point for 350 ms, a test face was presented centrally until a response was made. Participants were instructed to quickly and accurately make a classification decision and respond Category B ("Amy" for a Caucasian face or "美玲"for an Asian face) either when the separation of two eyes of the test face was narrower than that of the reference face or when the separation between lips and nose of the test face was narrower than that of the reference face, and to, otherwise, respond Category A ("Mary" for a Caucasian face or "淑芬" for an Asian face). The inter-trial interval was 500 ms.</p><p>In the formal test phase, the design was a 4 (eye-to-eye separation) × 4 (lips-tonose separation) factorial design. As a result, there were 16 stimuli grouped into four categories <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1</ref>). (1) Redundant Category B: in this category, both eye-to-eye separation and lips-to-nose separation of the test face were narrower than those of the reference face;</p><p>(2) Single Category B with eye-to-eye separation narrower than the reference;</p><p>(3) Single Category B with lips-to-nose separation narrower than the reference; (4) Category A: both eye-to-eye separation and lips-to-nose separation of the test face were furtherer than those of the reference face.</p><p>The experimental procedure of the test phase was the same as the psychophysical phase. After a practice block of 40 trials, participants performed ten sessions of 800 trials, divided into ten blocks. All the trials were randomly intermixed within a block with equal presentation frequency. After the experiment, there were 500 trials for each condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>Response time and accuracy analyses, the face categorization task</p><p>Conditionalized on each individual subject and stimulus, we removed RTs greater than 3 standard deviations above the mean and RTs less than 100 msec. This procedure led to removal of less than 1.8% of the trials from analysis.</p><p>The mean correct RTs and error rates for each face race, across all subjects averaged across all stimuli for the respective facial condition are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 8</ref>. In general, there is a substantial variability in both RTs and accuracy rates across subjects. Note: Participants c1-c5 are Caucasians, and a1-a5 are Asians. SE: standard error of mean; ORE=other-race effect; I-ORE=Inverse other-race effect; one-way ANOVA for the difference effect (df1=1 and df2&gt;15000 depending on the number of correct responses in the analysis); *p &lt; .05；**p &lt; .01; "---"=non-significant 1 2 3 4</p><p>We examined the group differences in face categorization's mean correct RT and accuracy rates, in the following mixed ANOVA design: Participants' race (Asian, Caucasian) × Face Race (Asian, Caucasian) as between-subject and within-subject factors, correspondingly. The results showed that neither the two effects nor the interaction between the two factors were significant (for the RT analysis the p &gt;.32, for the accuracy analysis the lowest p &gt;.167). The finding indicated that no systematic other-race effect could be observed at the group level data.</p><p>To avoid potential data aggregation issues in data interpretation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Estes &amp; Maddox, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">, Fifić, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Liew, Howe &amp; Little, 2016)</ref> we further examined the mean correct RTs and accuracy data at the individual level. We showed the results of a dependent measures t-test, Face Race (Asian, Caucasian), in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 8</ref>. At the mean correct RT level, we observed the other-race effect for 5 out of 10 subjects (c3, c5, a1, a2, and a3). At the accuracy level we observed the other race-effect for 3 out of 10 (c2, c5, and a2).</p><p>Moreover, the consistent other-race effects across both the RT and response accuracy were confirmed in only 2 out of 10 cases (c5 and a2). In contrast, three subjects showed the opposite of the other-race effect, the inverse other race effects at the correct RT mean level (c4, a4, and a5), and six subjects showed the inverse effect at the response accuracy level (c1, c4, a1, a3, a4, a5) that is the advantage of processing of the otherrace face, at both mean RT and accuracy levels. The results of the individual-level analysis showed variability in face processing effects, that was not consistent across the manipulated conditions of the Participant Race and Face Race factors, thus corroborating the group mean analysis.</p><p>Both the group-level and individual-level ANOVA results failed to provide strong support for a consistent other-race effect for all observers. A reasonable explanation for the absence of the other-race effect is that it could be due to the adjustments of the discriminability of configural facial feature effect, conducted after the psychophysical phase of the study. This step could create perceptually similar second-order relational features, across different Face Race and Participant Race conditions. By making the second-order relational features approximately equally discriminable (salient), the difference in facial categorization between participants' races could be diminished.</p><p>By employing computational modeling and model selection, we analyze the data for each subject across different race stimulus sets. By exploring values of the model parameters, we can make inferences about underlying mechanistic processes in holistic and analytic encoding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantitative Model Fitting</head><p>One way to explore MSPN's validity is to demonstrate its superiority over simpler models using model selection procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Myung &amp; Pitt, 2004)</ref>. We tested five computational models, four of which were special cases of the MSPN: (1) serial selfterminating, (2) independent parallel self-terminating, <ref type="formula">3</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 7</ref>. Overall, MSPN showed advantage over other nested models. Considering the average BIC, MSPN shows dominance over the serial, parallel, parallel interactive, and coactive models, respectively across all comparisons, for all participants. These results support the validity of the MSPN's modularity assumption.</p><p>When compared to the free-drift model, MSPN comes very close to the benchmark values. In fact, it is notable that the averaged BIC scores are smaller for the MSPN than that of the free-drift model in 15 out of 20 comparisons. This supports the constructive validity of MSPN. What may be a surprising result is that in 13 out of 20 comparison cases <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">(Table 7)</ref>, the MSPN best fitting log-likelihood values are lower than that of the free-drift model. This means that the parameter constrained MSPN provides a better fit to data than the free-drift model, with fewer parameters (19 vs 21). We will bring up this finding in the discussion section.</p><p>To learn about the specific cognitive and perceptual properties of the model across important experimental conditions, we will turn to analysis of the recovered best MSPN parameters reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 8</ref>. The parameters are divided between two modules, the serial (left) and parallel (middle) modules, and the module shared (right) parameters.</p><p>We use the estimated MSPN parameter values to explore perceptual/cognitive properties of facial perception. We are looking for evidence to support hierarchical organization of the facial representations and the mechanistic properties behind facial perception in the light of the analytic/holistic encoding. To answer these questions, we pay special attention to (1) the modularity gate parameter which indicates the likelihood of trial-to-trial switching between serial and parallel modules, pmod and to (2) the parameter of cross-featural interaction, pcross, only for the parallel model. The two parameter values are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 8</ref>.</p><p>In general, these parameter values are interpretable, showing values that range within acceptable values. In all cases, for example, the decision boundaries (Dlips-to-nose and Deye-eye) for both the serial and parallel modules that are used to partition each stimulus dimension <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1, 2-d</ref> face space on the left) into response regions are approximately positioned around values of 3 on both dimensions with some individual subject variation. This implies that participants may be using decision rules on featural dimensions to separate the stimulus conditions into two response categories, one of which would satisfy the conjoint rule (Category A region, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>) and one to satisfy the disjoint rule (Redundant Category B, region <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>). Not all of the subjects had decision boundary values at the most optimal points (around value 4; see e.g., subject c2, Asian face), which led to mis-categorizations of some of the faces.</p><p>MSPN provided very good fits to both correct and incorrect RT distributions across most of the facial conditions. Note MSPN is able to capture very complex response patterns of individual subjects' RT distributions. For example, in Appendix G Figure G Subject c1 Asian faces, the pattern of RT distributions shows that some faces near the category imaginary decision bounds (for example, the distributions across the third row and across the second column, assuming the origin is in the lower left corner)</p><p>were not categorized correctly by the participant. A pattern of undecisive respondingshowed that there was a close to equal split between correct and incorrect response distributions but not in all cases. However, MSPN was able to successfully capture these intricate patterns of RT distribution for both correct and incorrect responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall facial perception in testing holistic vs analytic encoding</head><p>The average pmod parameter values across all subjects and conditions showed that, across the study trials, subjects were engaged 63% in parallel processing, and 37% in serial processing (pmod = .63). We observed some individual differences, which showed that one subject was almost systematically serial in facial processing (c4 in Asian face condition) showing almost 90% of cases of strict seriality (pmod =.1), but other subjects showed dominant tendency for parallel processing (c2 in Caucasian face conditions) showing almost 90% parallel processing trials (pmod =.9). Most of the subjects showed a higher propensity for using the parallel module. This dominance of parallel over serial processing was also supported in the comparison of the nested models (the models 1-4 in <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>).</p><p>In MSPN, the average cross-featural interaction pcross value indicated that the amount of interaction between featural analyzers, was on average 28% of exchanged sampled featural evidence (pcross =.28), when parallel processing of facial features was diagnosed. The signatures of serial processing strongly support the presence of analytic encoding and active use of facial parts, independently of the facial wholeness. The signatures of parallel processing suggest, in the absence of process interactivity, a weak holistic encoding in which facial features were processed simultaneously, but that still could be accessed individually. The presence of the process interactivity between featural detectors strongly supports the holistic encoding and implies that on some trials subjects either used holistic face representations, or a partly combined facial representations, above the featural properties.</p><p>Overall, we can conclude that the subjects showed the evidence of a mixture of serial and parallel processing, with more tendency to parallel processing. In terms of the support for the analytic/holistic debate, the results showed evidence for both encodings. The results strongly support the modularity of the facial processing and also the existence of hierarchical organization of facial representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Other-Race effect</head><p>We analyzed the MSPN parameters specifically focusing on pmod and pcross, conditioned on the congruency between face race and participate race (same, other). On average, no evidence is observed to support the hypothesis that the same-and otherrace conditions exhibit a propensity toward serial or parallel.</p><p>The MSPN best fitting parameter values <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">(Table 8)</ref> showed that 4 out of 5</p><p>Caucasian subjects were mainly relying on the parallel module in both the same-race and other-race faces (c2, and c5). It is interesting to note that one subject (c4) consistently relied on serial module in processing both types of faces. Likewise, the Asian subjects showed an increase in proportions of parallel processing, and decrease in serial processing, when switching from the same-to the other-race face <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">(Table 8</ref>).</p><p>This finding is consistent with the idea that other-race faces are more likely to engage the analytic than holistic encoding. When the amount of interaction between featural analyzers is observed, then on average both groups show the expected trend under the current holistic hypothesis's: Judging by the pcross values, both subject race groups, Asians and Caucasians, showed a slight increase in the amount of interaction between featural units, when processing same-race rather than other-race faces Mean[ pCross ]same race = .32, sd=.41, Mean[ pcross ]other race = .24, sd=.34. However, the effect failed to reach significance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Participant Race effect</head><p>One can also compare the MSPN parameters values between the two race groups, Asians and Caucasians. First, there is no significant difference between the two race groups on the amount of parallel/serial processing Mean The results indicated that both groups showed on average similar properties of facial perception.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>This  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>Through its application in the composite face task and part-to-whole task, MSPN has demonstrated effectiveness in identifying the architecture underlying behavior in these two central paradigms. We next briefly discuss the main findings of MSPN's application as an exploratory tool, leveraging model fitting results to elucidate its capacity to validate or falsify theoretical constructs related to facial perception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application to the Composite Face Task</head><p>MSPN has identified conditions under which holistic processing (or application of an overlearned attentional strategy) is more likely to occur, such as the alignment of facial halves, and has provided quantitative measures that support the theory's validity.</p><p>Not only do the different modules of MSPN support the idea of hierarchical representation and the amount of holism exhibited across aligned and misaligned conditions-showing that more parallel and interactive processes are likely in aligned compared to misaligned conditions (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>)-but the results also demonstrate that the recovered parameters from the MSPN model are consistent with this finding (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>). The MSPN parameters corroborated the view that in the aligned condition, This thinking leads us to another important finding in the study, concerning the validity of the hallmark of holistic perception, that is, the interaction between Alignment × Congruency d' values. A significant amount of research is devoted solely to the analysis of the interaction term, often neglecting other stimulus conditions. In effect, the Alignment × Congruency interaction is considered a sufficient and necessary indicator of holistic processing. Intriguingly, we show that several analytic models can also predict an Alignment × Congruency interaction (the pure serial model, see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>).</p><p>The fact that strictly analytic processing can qualitatively predict the hallmark interaction signature questions the validity of using the composite face paradigm to detect holistic processing. Addressing the question of why selective attention fails in the composite task, the answer likely lies in the engagement of the non-target facial part, but it cannot be unequivocally argued that this is due to pooling of information from across the entire face. Further research is advised, following these findings, by applying MSPN to a larger data set of published works if available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application to the Part-to-Whole Face Task</head><p>Model fitting revealed that different modules, capable of embodying either a more holistic or more analytic approach, fit the empirical data equally well across a variety of conditions including the processing of inverted faces and non-face objects.</p><p>This finding introduces a significant challenge to the validation of the part-to-whole paradigm as a definitive measure of holistic versus analytic processing. Specifically, the fact that several different MSPN modules could fit the data well suggests that the order of accuracy across conditions in the part-to-whole task may not be as diagnostic as previously believed.</p><p>Interestingly, MSPN not only allowed some inference about processing of faces but also provided good fits to the house stimuli used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Tanaka and Sengco (1997;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref>). In all three experiments, both the serial and parallel modules of MSPN were able to capture the data almost perfectly.</p><p>Our research supports the idea that our cognitive/perceptual operations use a hierarchical process to recognize faces. The implication is that processing might start by examining at specific features and then combining those features together to understand the whole face or object (cf. Lynch, <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Cheng, &amp; Little, 2021)</ref>. In simple terms, our work highlights the complexity of how we perceive the world around us and suggests that the MSPN model could be a valuable tool for future research in understanding these processes better.</p><p>In general, the insights offered by MSPN advocate for a more comprehensive approach to data collection and analysis, encompassing both correct and incorrect RTs, as well as examining a broader range of conditions beyond the conventional metrics (e.g., Alignment × Congruency interaction in the composite face task).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application to the Other-Race Face Effect</head><p>In the current study, we were able to analyze holistic/analytic processing properties through estimated best fit parameters. Individual subject estimates of pmod indicate the proportion of trials cases in which subjects would use serial and parallel modules. Some subjects showed a propensity for pure serial processing <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">(Table 7</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 8</ref> after inspection of the pmod recovered parameter values -c4 for both face conditions, and a3 for the Caucasian face condition) while some showed for pure parallel processing (c2, c3, and a1 for the both face types, for example). Overall, close analysis of the recovered best fitting MSPN model parameters indicated that subjects were mainly relying on parallel processing of facial features. This finding is corroborated by many publications assuming that facial perception, that is usually considered to be the holistic, is presumably conducted in parallel (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Matthews, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Sergent, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Wenger &amp; Townsend, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fifić &amp; Townsend, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">cf.

This validates the model's central assumptions that the category A group will be processed exhaustively and the category B group will be processed using a self-terminating strategy. 6</p><p>The cross-talk parameter, pcross, indicates the amount of process interactivity.</p><p>This parameter varied across different subjects and conditions. An increase in the crosstalk between simple features processing units increases the amount of exchanged information between featural detectors represented here as two random walks.

In terms of the hierarchy of facial representations, an interaction creates a novel higher-level complex feature, and at the same time disables access to the constituent features. Varying the amount of interactivity one can switch between two different perceptual states: one <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Note that the definition of the type of logical rules used in the MSPN model, is neither arbitrary, nor determined ad-hoc. A nature of the binary task is that there is always one response category which contains a target (target present) and the other response category which doesn't contain the target (target absent). The target, in the current study, is a facial feature that can be solely used to make a final decision -and these are the facial features associated with the top, left group of faces in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> eye-to-eye values less than 4 and lips-to-nose values that are less than 4).</p><p>between seeing parts and another one seeing whole objects. By and large, these states correspond to analytic and holistic encoding hypotheses. In accordance with Wenger <ref type="bibr">and Townsend Axiom 3 (2001)</ref>, the increase in interaction between processing features supports evidence for holistic encoding. Across all subjects and face types, the model fitting results showed a low amount of interactivity when parallel module was used (the average value of pcross=.28) implying a weak level of holism. The overall finding is consistent with the idea that a moderate amount of holistic encoding was involved in our task.</p><p>Model comparison and analysis of the estimated parameters showed trends toward the other-race effect even though our statistical tests did not reach conventional significance levels. One way to address this would be to collect more individuals; the other race face effect is typically observed at the group-level rather than the individuallevel. We note, however, that the goal of our study was to collect sufficient RT data per facial condition so that the RT distributions could be fit for each individual and each item. This represents a different goal to usual other-race face effect studies (cf.  and could explain why we failed to find a significant effect. In future, it is advisable to sample both a larger set of participants and a larger sample of faces. Such face variance should improve generalizability of the current study (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baribault et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Another potentially confounding factor that could diminish the other-race effect in our study is the effect of experience with other race faces. Prolonged exposure to other race-faces reduces the other-race effect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Goldstein, &amp; Chance, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Hancock &amp; Rhodes, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Wan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Lindsay, Jack &amp; Christian, 1991</ref>; see the review in <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">Young et al. 2012)</ref>. This is likely not the case in our study, as we sampled subjects from two geographically separated populations (Taiwan and USA). Although some cross-race exposure of the other race-faces is possible through shared media (such as movies), we suspect that the bulk of the exposure of our participants has occurred within own-race faces. It is somewhat unlikely that the shared facial environment could dilute a possible other-race effect in our study.</p><p>A more likely reason for the absence of the other-race effect is due to the feature discriminability adjustment conducted in the psychophysical phase of the current study (see Blaha, 2017, for similar arguments). This step was done to counter off the effect of possible individual-subjects and the cross-race difference in facial feature detections.</p><p>First, the individual-subject differences in detection of facial features, could be a significant source of random subject variability, that could affect detection of the true processing properties, when aggregated subject data is used. As hinted above, the aggregated data could be used for inference only if the subject groups are homogeneous with respect to the perceptual mechanism they use. Aggregation of such data (such as averaging) would lead to unbiased estimates of the statistical parameters of interest.</p><p>However, the homogeneity status of subject groups is not known. If groups are sampled of non-homogenous subjects, then data aggregation could lead to systematic biases in data interpretation and inference.</p><p>Given that we found the weak other-race effect for both Asians and Caucasians we could argue that this result was due to the individual adjustments of perceptual effects. Presumably, the equal adjustment of feature salience created an equal perceptual effect for different race faces. Although, the result contradicts a large body of the other-race effect literature, including the authors' recent publication , the current study pointed to a potentially very important confound in the crossrace facial studies. More research is needed to further explore and document the populational norms in facial properties distribution, which could provide valuable insights and strengthen the generalizability of the findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Wang, et al, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Wen, Wong &amp; McGrath, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Danel, et al, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Wen et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Kalina, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Fang, Clapham &amp; Chung, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Goldstein, 1979)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research recommendations</head><p>The current findings underscore the necessity for a more detailed approach to model validation and the interpretation of data in cognitive science. We highlight the importance of comprehensive datasets that encompass a broader range of conditions and response metrics to constrain model predictions and enhance their falsifiability. As such, the discussion surrounding the composite face task and the part-to-whole paradigm urges researchers in facial area studies to move beyond the most popularly reported signatures and instead rely on more complete datasets that can provide a firmer foundation for theoretical conclusions and model validations.</p><p>Our use of MSPN both as an exploratory tool and as a full processing theoretical framework marks it as a pivotal distinction in cognitive science. As an exploratory tool, its application aims at probing existing theories and uncovering empirical evidence.</p><p>Conversely, when MSPN is harnessed as a theoretical framework, it assumes a more foundational role, structuring and guiding the development of comprehensive theories that encompass the entirety of cognitive processing involved in phenomena like the other-race effect. This dual capacity of MSPN not only amplifies its versatility but also enhances its contribution to advancing our understanding of complex cognitive processes.</p><p>Another future extension would be to apply MSPN to different tasks. In the present paper, we applied MSPN to a categorization task, which has been validated in many research papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Townsend &amp; Nozawa, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fifić, Townsend &amp; Eidels 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Fifić, Nosofsky &amp; Townsend, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fifić, Little &amp; Nosofsky, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Griffiths, Blunden &amp; Little, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fitousi &amp; Algom, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fifić, Houpt &amp; Rieskamp, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> for tutorial see <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Fifić &amp; Little, 2017)</ref>, some of which covered facial perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Fifić, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fifić &amp; Townsend, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cheng et al, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cheng &amp; Little, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Fitousi, 2021)</ref>. To improve generalizability, it would be interesting to extend the SFT double factorial paradigm to other types of decisions and to apply MSPN. For instance, similar modelling approaches have been recently developed for change detection tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Blunden et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Fong et al., 2024)</ref>. Consequently, we would recommend conducting a large scale, double factorial composite face task involving aligned, misaligned, upright and inverted face stimuli, and then applying MSPN to infer processing in each condition. To avoid potential budgetary limitations incurred by relying on large data set collection, another suggestion would be to integrate the MSPN model with the adaptive design approaches, presumably focused on the hierarchical Bayesian modelling. Hierarchical approaches are very effective in ameliorating issues of nominal identification of perceptual/cognitive strategies and could be combined with individual data analysis (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Wiecki, Sofer &amp; Frank, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Houpt, Heathcote &amp; Eidels, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Houpt &amp; Fifić, 2017)</ref>. Such methods, although computationally intensive, would provide a posterior likelihood identification of groups of subjects with similar cognitive strategies, for a smaller data set.</p></div>

The configural processing theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Diamond &amp; Carey, 1986)</ref>  The interactive processing model <ref type="bibr">(Fifić &amp; Townsend, 2010)</ref> posits that holistic effects arise from graded interactivity among facial features. Coactivity could be considered as a special case of the parallel interactive model in which all featural accumulation evidence is exchanged between working evidence accumulators. Work on coactive models has been developed over several decades and reached a peak with the recent development of the non-parametric tests for the coactive processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Miller, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Townsend &amp; Nozawa, 1995;</ref>. However, the extensive search for coactive model signatures, across wide research on holistic properties, has not been always successful (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Eidels, Townsend &amp; Pomerantz, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Eidels, Townsend, Hughes Perry, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cheng et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Yang, Altieri &amp; Little, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">) (c.f. Fifić, Nosofsky &amp; Townsend, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">Fifić, &amp; Townsend, 2010)</ref>. The present approach, which allows detection of a graded amount of parallel interactivity, provides an important alternative to the application of pure coactive model. MSPN directly validates this theory by enabling measurement of intermediate interaction values (0 &lt; pcross &lt; 1). Our findings confirm intermediate interactivity levels, aligning closely with interactive processing theory predictions. Pure serial (pmod = 0, pcross = 0) or purely independent parallel processing (pcross = 0) would falsify this graded interaction perspective.</p><p>In our findings, this theory was partly confirmed as MSPN identified clear evidence for parallel interactivity among feature detectors across multiple tasks, supporting the graded interaction hypothesis. However, we also found consistent evidence for a mixture of serial (analytic) and parallel processing within the same tasks, suggesting that holistic face processing does not exclusively rely on parallel interactivity. These results align closely but not exclusively with the interactive processing model, highlighting MSPN's capacity to reveal nuanced cognitive architectures underlying facial perception.</p><p>The Overlearned Attention Hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chua, Richler, &amp; Gauthier, 2014</ref> provides an alternative account of holistic perception, attributing holistic effects to learned attentional strategies rather than innate face-specific mechanisms. According to this perspective, experience and expertise progressively stabilize and refine memory representations, leading to higher drift rates and reduced variance, while the processing architecture (serial or parallel) and interactivity parameters (pmod, pcross) remain stable.</p><p>MSPN framework provides a way to empirically identify the mechanisms that arise as attentional patterns are learned by detecting whether holistic effects arise due to changes in attentional weighting (drift rate, variance) or structural changes in perceptual organization (pmod, pcross). While MSPN did not directly validate the learning-dependent changes at the memory representation level independently of architecture or interactivity parameters, it did reveal systematic shifts in parameters like pmod and pcross across different task conditions (see also Fific &amp; Townsend, 2010 for converging evidence).</p><p>Critically, the fitting results from the composite face paradigm in the current study support the idea that the so-called holistic effect in the aligned composite face task arises from cross-item facilitation. This is evidenced by the high value of the pcross parameter in the aligned condition, which was significantly greater than in the misaligned condition. However, there remains a shadow of doubt regarding the validity of the composite face paradigm in supporting the "holistic effects" and consequently the predictions of the overlearned attentional theory. Specifically, the pure serial model, which allows for perfectly selective attention to individual facial parts, also demonstrated-albeit weakly <ref type="table">(Table 4</ref>)-a signature of the holistic effect in the composite face task. This raises concerns about the Overlearned Attentional theory, as the serial model serves as a baseline reference for purely analytic featural processing.</p><p>The fact that holistic-like effects still emerge under a serial framework suggests that the composite face paradigm, which is often associated with the Overlearned Attention theory, may not be an adequate tool to clearly differentiate between competing explanations. Instead, more refined methodologies that directly test interactivity versus attentional weighting mechanisms are needed to fully assess the validity of the Overlearned Attentional theory. Thus, the results highlight the need for a more detailed theoretical approach that integrates both attentional mechanisms and structural modifications in perceptual processing rather than attributing holistic effects solely to overlearned attentional strategies.</p><p>Finally, the failure of selective attention hypothesis (as reviewed in  argues that holistic face effects result from attentional limitations rather than actual integration of facial features. Importantly, this hypothesis does not represent a unified theoretical model but rather a broadly defined construct operationalized differently across various tasks and contexts. MSPN can clarify these distinct mechanistic possibilities by operationalizing attentional failure as minimal parallel interaction with primarily serial processing (pmod = 0, pcross = 0). However, if MSPN reveals substantial parallel processing (pmod &gt; 0) or clear interactive integration (pcross &gt; 0), this would suggest genuine holistic mechanisms beyond mere attentional failures.</p><p>Across all studies, we found evidence that the perceptual system attempted to use selective attention, mainly through engagement of the serial self-terminating system, which, when combined with accurate memory representations, allows clear-cut selective attention to a single feature without interaction. For instance, in the other-race study, one Caucasian subject (c4, Tables 7 and 8) exhibited systematic serial selective attention across both race conditions, demonstrating a high level of analytic processing.</p><p>Moreover, MSPN analyses of the composite face and part-to-whole tasks revealed that results could be successfully explained by the serial self-terminating model. It should be noted that in the composite face task, the serial model itself demonstrated prediction of the Alignment × Congruency interaction (pure serial model; see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>), whereas in the part-to-whole paradigm, this purely analytic model was able to tightly fit all conditions, emerging as a strong candidate model. This outcome highlights a limitation identified earlier: reliance on a single dependent measure, such as accuracy, may deflate model falsifiability. Our analysis clearly demonstrates this. In the composite task, joint RT and accuracy modeling was possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Gao et al., 2011)</ref>, but full datasets are rarely published. In the part-to-whole task, we only analyzed accuracies provided by authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">(Tanaka &amp; Sengco, 1997)</ref>; thus, it remains an open question whether MSPN model fits would change if complete datasets were jointly analyzed.</p></div>

At the basic hierarchical level of facial representations lie the fundamental principles governing the organization of memory representations. MSPN models psychological representations of face stimuli as perceptual distributions along multiple facial feature dimensions, with each memorized representation characterized by both a mean (μ) and a variance (σ²). The mean value (μ) represents the most likely location of the memory representation along a given feature dimension, while the variance (σ²) serves as a critical parameter quantifying the discriminability and memory stability of each feature dimension. A smaller variance indicates higher perceptual precision and stability of facial features in memory, whereas greater variance reflects perceptual uncertainty and weaker representations.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Whereas representation-based coactivity models assume a single integrated processing channel from the outset, MSPN's parallel interactive framework maintains separate feature channels with explicit inter-channel interactions that dynamically exchange evidence during processing. The distinction between these two theoretical conceptions becomes empirically testable when examining patterns of interaction across experimental manipulations of face perception. MSPN provides a rigorous computational framework capable of differentiating whether holistic effects are due primarily to early representational integration (single-channel coactivity) or dynamic interactive processing occurring later during the accumulation of evidence. Consequently, MSPN serves as a valuable tool for resolving debates regarding the precise mechanistic locus of holistic processing-whether it arises from stable representational templates or from dynamic interactions among facial features at the decisional processing stage.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Conversely, falsification of the failure of selective attention hypothesis as a simple attentional limitation would occur if MSPN showed evidence for parallel processing (pmod &gt; 0) or interactive feature integration (pcross &gt; 0). If features are found to be truly interdependent, then selective attention failure would reflect genuine holistic processing rather than an attentional constraint. Moreover, MSPN's ability to model drift rates, decision boundaries, and process interactivity provides a means to distinguish between perceptual-level integration, attentional biases, and response-based interference, offering a more precise mechanistic account of face perception. By systematically varying key parameters such as feature interactivity (pcross), processing architecture (pmod ), memory variance, and drift rates, MSPN provides a formal computational framework to test, validate, and falsify competing theories of holistic face perception. Unlike traditional behavioral methods, which rely on indirect inferences, MSPN offers a mechanistic approach that quantitatively evaluates how different processing strategies contribute to face perception. This approach advances the field by allowing for stronger model validation, clearer distinctions between competing theories, and a deeper understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying holistic face processing.</figDesc></figure>

Like MSPN, the MADD model emphasizes flexibility in cognitive strategy selection and demonstrates how modular architectures can produce complex decision-making behavior. However, while MADD provides a general framework for serial and parallel processing orders, it does not specify memory storage for representations, a key feature of MSPN. Together, these models illustrate the shared principle of adaptability through modularity, highlighting how modular cognitive architectures facilitate flexible and context-sensitive decision-making. Identifiability of the nested models within the MSPN framework MSPN combines several modes of processing in a single network capturing the idea that cognitive functions related to face perception are interconnected and organized hierarchically. Individual cognitive models within this framework can be seen as modules or components contributing to the overall process of face perception. MSPN aids in understanding the flow of hierarchical information between these modules, shedding light on their collective contribution to face perception. MSPN can be approached from two distinct perspectives: one as an overarching structure encompassing various face perception modules (from completely analytic to strongly holistic) designed specifically for the operational purposes of measuring modularity and independence, and the other as a comprehensive computational account of face processing that captures the flexibility exhibited across tasks. From the first viewpoint, MSPN acts as an umbrella for analyzing face perceptual processes or as an exploratory tool. It serves as a unifying structure, bringing together a diverse range of face perception models under one overarching framework. MSPN acts as an umbrella by providing a theoretical scaffolding, enabling researchers to integrate and comprehend different face perceptual processes within the broader context of human face cognition.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Within MSPN, decisional bias is incorporated as part of the psychological constructs used in memory processes and evidence retrieval from memory representations (for example, a decision-bound Dx, Appendix A), as well as a criterion in the random walk module, which sets the threshold for evidence accumulation needed to elicit a response (for example +A, -B response bound values, Appendix A). Thus, MSPN provides a comprehensive theoretical framework to address response biases in facial processing. By leveraging MSPN, we aim to enhance our understanding of the complex dynamics of facial perception and to illuminate the mechanisms underlying holistic processing. 7. Modulation of Interactivity: MSPN's parameter pcross modulates the amount of cross-talk between random walks, influencing the level of featural interdependency. This modulation links the results to the hierarchical structure of facial representations, offering insights into how holistic encoding emerges. In summary, MSPN provides a unified computational framework that addresses the limitations of the composite face paradigm by offering a flexible, modular, and interactive approach. It not only explains the joint analysis of RT and accuracy but also captures individual differences, response biases, and the hierarchical nature of facial representations, providing a more detailed understanding of the composite face effect.</figDesc></figure>

By contrast, in the misaligned condition, pure serial processing provides a superior fit compared to most of the other models, including the parallel model, suggesting strong analytic encoding.Moreover, the recovered parameters across all models align with the aforementioned observations. Notably, MSPN's best-fitting parameters reveal a distinct segregation between aligned and misaligned conditions indicating a hierarchical structure: In the aligned condition, pmod = .9, indicating that 90% of trials utilized the parallel module, and pcross = 1, suggesting maximal interactivity among features thus supporting strong holistic encoding. In contrast, in the misaligned condition, pmod = .17, signifying that only 17% of trials engage the parallel module, and 83% of trials utilized the serial module. Additionally, pcross= .46 indicates a moderate level of interactivity among the 17% of parallel trials, primarily supporting the analytic hypothesis and weakly supporting the presence of holistic encoding.</figDesc></figure>

Here is a summary of the observed ordering: P(c) isolated parts: After studying Joe's face, Joe's eyes are displayed on their own, without any other facial features. This isolated presentation typically leads to lower recognition accuracy due to the absence of contextual cues. P(c) new configuration: Joe's eyes are paired with other facial features in an unusual arrangement. Recognition rates are improved compared to the isolated parts condition, suggesting that the inclusion of additional features facilitates identification. P(c) old configuration: Joe's eyes are presented in their normal facial configuration resulting in the highest recognition accuracy, underscoring the brain's use of holistic processing for effective facial recognition. This distinct pattern of responses strongly supports the concept of holistic facial perception, challenging the idea that selective encoding of individual features suffices to explain recognition outcomes. Nevertheless, this pattern of performance is also consistent with an overlearned attentional strategy, which is preserved in the old configuration condition but not in the other conditions. (Presumably the new configuration condition allows for configural information to guide attention in a manner that the isolated attention condition does not).</figDesc></figure>

Each model predicts a specific pattern of RTs distributions for both correct and incorrect responses. The tested models were formed by fixing some of MSPN's parameter values (Appendix A). For example, by setting the modular gating parameter to zero, MSPN becomes identical to a (1) Serial self-terminating model; by setting pmod equal to one and pcross equal to 0, MSPN becomes identical to a (2) parallel self-terminating model. By setting pmod equal to 1 and by and by letting the interaction pcross parameter to vary, MSPN is identical to (3) Parallel interactive model. By setting the value of the parallel interactive parameter pcross to one (and setting pmod to 1) MSPN is identical to a (4) coactive model. To further evaluate the validity of the best-fitting model, we compared it to a simpler free-drift model, which is much less constrained than the MSPN. The free-drift model serves as a highly parameterized baseline, making only a few basic assumptions of the MSPN framework-namely, that an evidence accumulation process occurs, defined as the probability of stepping toward a target boundary, with common absorbing boundaries across different stimulus conditions. In contrast, MSPN calculates the stepping probability by determining the proportion of the area under a noisy representation distribution that is bounded by a decision criterion. As such, the stepping values in MSPN are constrained by the stimulus configuration, memory representations, and decisional processes. By comparison, in the free-drift model, these stepping probabilities are treated as unconstrained free parameters. Each face condition is represented as a single noisy distribution sampled using a separate random walk, disconnected from the mechanistic assumptions of MSPN. Consequently, the free-drift model is not logically derived from the MSPN's mechanistic principles and instead functions purely as a statistical model. Its primary role is to serve as a benchmark, with its fitting score used to evaluate the quality of the parameter-constrained MSPN fits. This comparison allows us to assess whether the additional complexity of Hierarchical Face Representations MSPN-grounded in its mechanistic assumptions-is justified. By balancing model fit with complexity (see Appendix F), this analysis highlights that MSPN's parameterconstrained approach offers a theoretically grounded and mechanistically superior account of the observed data relative to the much less constrained free-drift model. The rationale behind inclusions of the simpler model variants is to evaluate whether the additional complexity of MSPN is justified, as a measure that balance a goodness of model fits and model complexity (Appendix F) For each subject's best fitting model (as determined by the BIC), the complete set of predicted correct and incorrect RT distributions are shown along with the observed distributions in Appendix G (Figure G). Each box in Figure G shows an observed quantile plot histogram, for unconditional RTs, over the two classificatory responses -Category A and B. The negative x-axis scale represents Category B decision RT scale, and the positive scale represents the Category A RT scale. The predicted models' values are indicated by the superimposed red dots, over the observed responsetime bins. Placement of the observed and model fits boxes in Figure G, match that of the stimulus facial configuration in Figure 1, left. From there one can see which category responses were misclassified and could be treated as incorrect. As we can see from the MSPN fits (Figure G) most of these individual subjects' cases are successfully captured by MSPN.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_20"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>paper discusses a novel computational framework called the Modular Serial-Parallel Network (MSPN). MSPN integrates various perceptual and cognitive approaches to address the challenges in face perception theories, particularly how to combine holistic and analytic encoding within a unified framework. MSPN is designed to simulate four stages in face perception: representational, decisional, logical-rule implementation, and modular stochastic accrual of information. It offers insights into the dynamics of cognitive processing, illustrating the interplay between holistic and analytic encoding mechanisms. In facial perception research, it is crucial to have models that can accommodate the hierarchical representation of faces, blending holistic and analytic processing. MSPN is proposed to fill this gap, providing a comprehensive model for understanding face perception through a combination of memory representations, signal detection theory, mental architectures, and process interactivity. The hierarchical nature of facial representations suggests that faces are processed at multiple levels, ranging from individual features to holistic gestalts. Understanding facial perception involves recognizing the intricate layers of information encoded within facial features, from basic visual cues to complex cognitive interpretations. The current study details the components of MSPN, elucidating how they encapsulate the hierarchical organization of facial information and contribute to our understanding of perceptual and cognitive mechanisms in facial perception tasks. The model components are identifiable through the free parameter values and can be used to link the observed evidence to assumed model's components. The key MSPN parameters that could be used identify perceptual analytic and holistic properties, are the modularity gate parameter, which indicates the likelihood of trial-to-trial switching between serial and parallel modules, pmod, and the parameter of cross-featural interaction, pCross. In cognitive science, the investigation of facial perception mechanisms stands as a central challenge to understanding human cognition and social interaction. The complexity of these mechanisms demands sophisticated analytical tools capable of disentangling the intricate interplay of cognitive processes involved. MSPN offers dual utility as both an exploratory tool and a comprehensive theoretical framework for full processing analysis (see for instance,</figDesc></figure>

To arrive at a conclusive understanding of the underlying processes, interpreting the entire dataset under the MSPN model is required. In practice, research employing the composite face paradigm seldom reports the complete dataset, including both correct and incorrect RTs, as well as response accuracies for all stimulus conditions in the study. Consequently, the model fits of MSPN could significantly vary, potentially being much different or less conclusive, if based solely on partial data instead of the full dataset.</figDesc></figure>

For instance, disruptions such as face inversion or misalignment of face halves (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Thompson, 1980)</ref> should affect perceptual sensitivity at the memory level, as reflected by changes in MSPN variance parameters. If spatial properties of facial features were not clearly discriminated or had minimal influence on MSPN's memory parameters, this would falsify configural processing theory. Our empirical results aligned with this theoretical prediction, demonstrating distinct sensitivity to spatial relationships during displacement of canonical first-order configural features, such as lips and eyes, thus supporting this model. Our other-race study results, examining specific configural features in terms of spatial separation, showed that both response times and categorization accuracies are sensitive to spatial separation magnitude, providing additional supporting evidence that these configurations are likely to be perceptually differentiated.The Interactive Configural Processing Theory<ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Maurer, Le Grand, &amp; Mondloch, 2002)</ref> extends the configural processing theory by proposing multiple hierarchical levels of configural and featural integration. Although conceptually broad, this theory lacks detailed specifications of the mechanisms or decision rules governing interactions among these hierarchical levels. MSPN uniquely enables testing these mechanisms by predicting specific changes in the degree of interactivity under various experimental conditions. For example, this account would be supported by findings demonstrating</figDesc><table><row><cell>differential cross-channel interaction parameters (pcross ) when faces are aligned (pcross</cell></row><row><cell>&gt; 0) compared to misaligned (pcross = 0). Conversely, identical MSPN parameters for</cell></row><row><cell>aligned, misaligned, and inverted faces would weaken the hierarchical assumptions of</cell></row><row><cell>this theory.</cell></row><row><cell>MSPN indeed revealed differential cross-channel interaction (pcross) between</cell></row><row><cell>aligned and misaligned faces in the composite face task, indicating higher interactivity</cell></row><row><cell>in the aligned condition, consistent with the theory's predictions. However, the theory</cell></row><row><cell>also does not accommodate cases of exclusively featural processing, as observed with</cell></row><row><cell>at least one subject (c4) in the other-race study, who consistently exhibited a strictly</cell></row><row><cell>featural analysis rather than integrating multiple processing sources. Additionally,</cell></row><row><cell>because the theory itself lacks precise specifications regarding the mechanisms or</cell></row><row><cell>decision rules governing interactions across hierarchical levels, the MSPN results can</cell></row><row><cell>only provide general alignment rather than definitive validation. Thus, although</cell></row><row><cell>MSPN's findings partially align with the Interactive Configural Processing Theory, the</cell></row><row><cell>support remains constrained by the theory's broad nature and absence of mechanistic</cell></row><row><cell>detail.</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

Logical-rule models of classification response times: A synthesis of mental-architecture, random-walk, and decision-bound approaches. Psychological Review, 117, 309-348. Specific parametric assumptions are needed to implement the information processing models described in the introduction. For present purposes, we introduce various simplifying assumptions. First, in our face classification task, the stimuli vary along two second-order configural features: eye-to-eye separation and lips-to-nose separation. We denote the two: Dlips-to-nose and Deye-eye. Individual subject scaling analysis is used to create perceptual values that are equally spaced on a psychophysical scale. Therefore, a reasonable simplifying assumption is that the psychological representation of the stimuli lies on the 4×4 grid structure illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>We further assume that associated with each stimulus are two normal distributions of perceptual effects, with the perceptual effects along Dlips-to-nose, along the x-axis, and Deye-eye, along the y-axis, being statistically independent for each stimulus value. The means of the distributions are set at 1, 3, 5, and 7 respectively, for stimuli on Dlips-to-nose and likewise on Deye-eye. All stimulus values have the same variability along Dlips-to-nose and likewise for Deye-eye. To allow for the possibility of differential attention to the component dimensions, or that one dimension is more discriminable overall than the other, the variance of the distribution of perceptual effects is allowed to be a separate free parameter for each dimension, σx 2 and σy 2 , respectively. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, left panel, shows the two axes with two separate normal distributions associated with each stimulus value.</p><p>To implement the perceptual-sampling process that drives the random walk <ref type="figure">(Figure 1, right)</ref>, the observer establishes a decision-bound along each dimension, Dlipsto-nose and Deye-eye. Response criteria, +A and -B, representing the amount of evidence needed for making an A or a B decision on each dimension <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>, right panel, associated with each random walk) are also established. A scaling parameter k is used for transforming the number of steps in each random walk into milliseconds.</p><p>Each model assumes that there is a residual base time, not associated with decision-making processes (e.g., reflecting encoding and motor-execution stages). The residual base-time is assumed to be log-normally distributed with mean μR and variance σR 2 .</p><p>The serial self-terminating model requires an additional free parameter pser representing the probability that, on each individual trial, the dimensions are processed in the order lips-to-nose then-eyes-to-eyes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B Model Recovery Tests</head><p>To bolster the credibility of the MSPN model's assumptions, we sought to verify that the identified properties, specifically processing order and process dependency, are discernible in the fit to observed data without any ambiguity. The standard procedure for model validation involves simulating data from a parametrically fixed model with known characteristics and then fitting that model with the to ensure the parameters can be recovered accurately. This model recovery process ensures that the model aligns with the actual characteristics of the mental processes, reinforcing the validity of the model's assumptions.</p><p>For this purpose, we generated three distinct datasets: (1) pure serial, (2) pure parallel, and (3) parallel interactive, using the MSPN computational model. This allowed us to create three specific computational model cases by fixing the key parameters (pmod and pcross). The simulated dataset comprised a 6 x 9 stimulus configuration with two dimensions, varied factorially as per the study's design.</p><p>Here are the details of the fixed parameter:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix D Testing the Pure Serial Model with Variable Decision Boundaries and Its Effect on the Congruency × Alignment Interaction in the Composite Task</head><p>In our exploration of the pure serial model, we simulated an experiment to examine the effects of variable decision boundaries on facial feature recognition under different conditions within the composite task. Specifically, we focused on the parameter value, Dx, for the "relevant" facial dimension, which varied continuously in the same and different upper facial part conditions. To generate predictions for each stimulus, we performed 40,000 random walk simulations across the 4 stimulus types and 2 alignment conditions, resulting in a total of 320,000 simulations.</p><p>The outcome measures from these simulations include the probability of correctly recognizing when the upper facial features in stimuli are the same, ( ). We selected initial values that achieved above-chance recognition accuracy for the target item (the upper part; see <ref type="table">Table D1</ref>). Simulated accuracies are shown in <ref type="table">Table D2</ref>.</p><p>We found that a minor change in Dx across the aligned and misaligned conditions, while maintaining all other parameters constant (see <ref type="table">Table D1</ref>), affected the predicted value of p(c) shown in <ref type="table">Table D2</ref>. We next calculated the Congruency × Alignment interaction term, '=2.34.</p><p>Hence, we have demonstrated that changing a single parameter (Dx) in a strongly analytic, pure serial model can predict the hallmark signature of facial holistic processing. This raises some significant challenges in interpreting the Congruency × Alignment interaction as an index of holistic processing. We do note, however, that the size of the Congruency × Alignment interaction term may also depend on various other properties of the system, encapsulated by other parameters within the model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix F Quantitative Model-Fitting Comparisons for the Other-Race Face Experiment</head><p>We fitted the models to our other-race experimental data using the method of quantile-based maximum-likelihood estimation (QMLE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Heathcote, Brown, &amp; Mewhort, 2002)</ref>. For each individual stimulus, the observed correct and incorrect RTs were both divided into the two sets of the following quantile-based bins: the fastest 10% of correct RTs, the next four 20% intervals of correct RTs, and the slowest 10% of correct RTs (and for the incorrect RTs correspondingly)</p><p>We used a modified <ref type="bibr">Hooke and Jeeves (1961)</ref> algorithm that maximized the multinomial log-likelihood function:</p><p>where Ni is the number of observations of stimulus i (i=1,n); fij is the frequency with which stimulus i had a correct and an incorrect RTs in the j'th quantile (j=1, m); and pij (which is a function of the model parameters) is the predicted probability that stimulus i had a correct, or incorrect, RT in the j'th quantile.</p><p>To consider the differing number of free parameters for some of the models, we used the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC;Wasserman, 2000). The BIC is given by:</p><p>where lnL is the (maximum) log-likelihood of the data; P is the total number of free parameters in the model; and M is the total number of observations in the data set.</p><p>The model that yields the smallest BIC is the preferred model. In the BIC, the term P•ln(M) penalizes a model for its number of free parameters. Thus, if two models yield nearly equivalent log-likelihood fits to the data, then the simpler model with fewer free parameters is preferred.</p><p>For each stimulus, we generated 10,000 simulations resulting in 4 × 4 × 10,000=160,000 random walk simulations for the entire data set for each individual subject. We used 1000 different random starting configurations of the parameter values to estimate the best-fitting parameters.    </p></div>
