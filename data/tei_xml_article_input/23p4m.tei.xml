			<abstract>
				<p>Speakers&apos; form choices on how to express referents in connected discourse are driven by a wide variety of considerations. Yet, it is to date unclear how precisely relevant factors are shaping referential choice and which of these are most important during discourse production across languages. Using computational modeling on a naturalistic corpus of spoken narratives across 16 diverse languages, we systematically investigated the predictability of 16 functional factors on referential choice. We moreover used a novel technique from explainable artificial intelligence to get precise insights into the decision making processes of our models, in order to draw inferences on the precise relationship of the factors with referential choice. We show that 1) referential choice is multifactorial, 2) anaphoric distance, referent salience in local discourse, and syntactic function a referent is allocated to, are most predictive of referential form, 3) many other factors discussed prominently in the literature, like referent competition, topic persistence or the presence of agreement, have little to no predictive power, 4) and that these factors are generally shared across languages, with large differences across languages mostly pertaining to idiosyncratic properties of languages, such as word order or the expression of nominal number. Our study is the first large-scale study of referential choice across diverse languages using naturalistic corpus data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Speakers' choices on which form of expression to use for a particular discourse referent at a given point in discourse are responsive to various contextual factors that are seen to manipulate their accessibility. Full descriptions such as the woman are used where accessibility is low, for instance where an entity is new or has not been mentioned in a while, and pronouns such as she where accessibility is high, for instance where it is the topic of consecutive sentences. In addition, many other factors have been found to influence referent accessibility and hence the choice of referential form. Producers' choices have moreover repeatedly been found to align with actual recipients' needs with utmost precision and reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Arnold et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Tily &amp; Piantadosi, 2009)</ref>, despite the many other challenges they face during speech and discourse planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Arnold, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Levelt, 1989</ref>). This is remarkable given that producers have no access to their recipients' minds and thus have to rely on contextual cues in calculating referential choice.</p><p>Despite the enormous body of theoretical work, exactly what cues producers rely on, and how these interact and co-determine accessibility status and referential choices remains unclear. Previous studies were often hampered by restricted availability of discourse production data and a focus on single-language studies, where comparison with results from other studies (and other languages) has been undertaken as part of their interpretation in relation to a general picture of reference production in human languages.</p><p>And while this is true even for a single well-researched language like English, how mechanisms of referential choice work in comparison across languages is for the most part uncharted territory, despite the enormous body of theoretical and empirical work. This situation is at odds with the claim of generalizability of current models of referential choice, a claim that necessitates foremost comparative studies of language use across human languages and societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Evans &amp; Levinson, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Henrich et al., 2010)</ref>. Where individual-language studies do make reference to general theories of referential studies and/or other empirical studies, it is not always clear that relevant referential features were in fact operationalized and categorized in precisely the same manner. It remains thus unclear to what extent the postulated regularities of referential choice in fact extend over larger and more varied production data, and across diverse languages. Also, many theoretical works rely mostly on written production data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ariel, 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ariel, , 2000</ref>, which are unlikely to reflect the cognitive pressures of spontaneous production in a face-to-face communicative situation that make the challenges of referential choice and its dazzling mastery by speakers of all human languages such an intriguing phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Linders &amp; Louwerse, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Pickering &amp; Garrod, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">, 2013</ref>. Finally the descriptive methods deployed in earlier work, but also some of the statistical (regression) methods deployed in more systematic corpus studies, typically only give insights into the overall set of different factors that contribute to variation in referential choice. However, these methods are not well-suited to giving a detailed account of how precisely different factors contribute to human decisions on the referential form. Hence, despite the widespread agreement about the catalog of factors, how each of these factors precisely contributes to referential choice in relation to other factors, let alone in comparison to other languages is unknown.</p><p>In this paper we report on a cross-linguistic study of referential choice where we implemented a computational model based on a richly annotated spoken narrative text corpus. While a computational model cannot mimic a human mind, its purpose here was to study the statistical associations between the rich information represented in the discourse context and referential choices, as this is what human producers are likely to draw on. Our corpus contains subcorpora from 16 languages, including from South America, Europe, the Caucasus, the Middle East, and Papunesia, and hence represents a significant diversity across human languages. Moreover, the corpus annotations ensure that all relevant features are categorized in the same manner across the language corpora, thus uniquely allowing for comparison across diverse languages. We trained machine learning algorithms on 16 theoretically-motivated factors to predict the referential form. Then, using a novel method from explainable artificial intelligence, we could reconstruct precisely how these factors predict single decisions. By aggregating this information, we were able to make general inferences on which factors are generally important in individual form choices and compare these decisions across languages. We found recency of mention, salience in the immediately preceding discourse and syntactic function to be universally most predictive.</p><p>Information pressure, competition between referents and discourse givenness were universally least predictive of individual form choices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Referential choice in discourse production</head><p>In this section we first provide a brief background to research on referential choice as rooted in the functionalist tradition. We then offer a brief account of empirical research into referential choice, including corpus linguistic as well as computational work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functionalist approaches to referential choice</head><p>Reference processing is a perennial challenge for language users during any communicative event: During any conversation or narration, the recipient (or 'audience') will have to decode not only the sentence constructions, headed by specific lexical verbs, that express chains of events in various coherence relations to one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Wei &amp; Knoeferle, 2023)</ref>. They will likewise have to identify the nominal expressions denoting certain event participants with the (real or imaginary) entities they refer to. And conversely, a producer will have to choose types of referent expressions that will -broadly speaking -enable their reference resolution on behalf of the recipient. At least since <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chafe (1976)</ref>, reference production has been regarded as a matter of 'audience design' so that a producer does not merely follow their own concerns but is altruistic towards their audience by catering for their needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Clark &amp; Murphy, 1982)</ref>. Hence, in a narration where (1) is taken from, the speaker will deploy full ('lexical') NPs to introduce new entities, like an orphanage or some place, or take up entities that have not been mentioned in a while, like the three children. And they will resort to reduced referential devices where an entity has been talked about immediately subsequent to this new mention, as is the case with the two instances of she and the subsequent zero form, all in anaphoric reference to my grandmother; also, the grandmother seems to be of greater concern in this passage, hence entertaining greater topicality and/or importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chafe, 1994)</ref>:</p><p>(1) English [mc_english_london01_a.  And [the three children] i , <ref type="bibr">[...]</ref>  These alternations between three major form types -full NP, pronominal and zero -and a range of variants thereof (e.g. different determiners and modifiers in NPs, stressed vs unstressed vs reduced pronouns) have canonically been attributed to the activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chafe, 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chafe, , 1994</ref> or accessibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ariel, 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ariel, , 1990</ref>) of a particular entity. Broadly speaking, full NPs are used where accessibility is deemed low and reduced forms of reference like pronouns or zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Kibrik, 2011)</ref> where accessibility is high. Thus, a producer chooses the form type that they deem appropriate with regards to their recipients' state of mind <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chafe, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Clark &amp; Murphy, 1982)</ref>. As activation or accessibility are not immediately accessible to a producer, they draw on the discourse and other contextual information -the 'common ground' <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Clark &amp; Brennan, 1991)</ref> -to estimate the accessibility of any given referent.</p><p>Probably the most widely recognized of such contextual 'accessibility-lending' cues is recency (of an antecedent mention) <ref type="bibr">(Ariel, 1990, p. 22)</ref>, equivalent to anaphoric distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Givón, 1983a)</ref>: As accessibility decays over the course of a discourse, an entity that has not been mentioned in a while exhibits low accessibility, whereas an entity only just mentioned is highly accessible. The full NP use for the second mention of orphanage or children in (1) illustrates the lowering of accessibility through (non-)recency. Conversely, the high accessibility warranting the use of pronouns and zero to take up my grandmother will be attributed to immediate recency of the antecedent mention. Related to recency is the notion of unity. It captures the idea that accessibility covaries with the occurrence of two or more mentions of a single entity within or across syntactic or discourse units. Where an antecedent is within the same unit, accessibility is higher than where it is outside of it.</p><p>Where discourse units are concerned, this refers primarily to paragraphs or episodes.</p><p>The other two of the four accessibility-lending features <ref type="bibr">(Ariel, 1990, pp. 28-29)</ref> are saliency and competition. High saliency makes an entity more accessible. Saliency can be inherent or contextual: While human discourse referents are inherently more salient than nonhuman ones, the saliency of any entity can be contextually raised, for instance where the expression of a referent occurs in subject position, or lowered where it occurs elsewhere.</p><p>Competition of an entity with another entity as a possible intended referent lowers its accessibility. Under referent competition, saliency often decides which referent receives a higher degree of accessibility. This is essentially what is behind the experimental finding that subjects are generally 'better antecedents' for pronominal anaphors in examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Stevenson et al., 2000)</ref>, such as (2) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Kameyama (1996)</ref>:</p><p>(2) a. John hit Bill. Mary told him to go home. b. Bill was hit by John. Mary told him to go home.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Kameyama (1996)</ref> participants in comprehension experiments would in both examples opt for the subject of the preceding sentence as the more likely antecedent of him, with no regard to the respective change in content of the passage. Distance and salience may interact in such a way that they conjointly yield very high accessibility, so that subject chains in English are most prone to show zero anaphors, as illustrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Torres Cacoullos &amp; Travis, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Accessibility-lending cues are in turn dependent on what <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ariel (1990)</ref> conceives of as three different kinds of context: the physical environment (as just seen) and the immediate discourse as well as what she terms the encyclopaedic context which essentially subsumes the familiarity of language users with certain entities due to their world knowledge and shared cultural background. Hence, while discourse-new entities have generally low accessibility as there is no representation of these in the current discourse model, they still differ in their accessibility according to various familiarity-related considerations, as is reflected in the use of definite NPs in languages like English and German (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Prince, 1981</ref>) (e.g. the sun or the President upon first mention). We confine ourselves to the linguistic context of the discourse as this is the only set of factors that a computational model can reliably code for based on corpus data.</p><p>All referring expressions, i.e. those forms that can be used for reference, are ranked according to the degree of accessibility they are associated with. The key properties determining this association are attenuation and informativity. 1 Any attenuated ('reduced'; <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Kibrik, 2011)</ref> form with lower informativity will be associated with higher accessibility than any more verbose form with higher informativity. Thus, zero reference is associated with exceedingly high accessibility, pronominal forms with lower but still high accessibility, and full <ref type="bibr">('lexical';</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Du Bois, 1987)</ref> NPs with low accessibility. In addition to these basic distinctions, referring expressions can be differentiated in many more ways, e.g. through prosodic prominence ('stress') of pronouns or by addition of modifiers to NPs. A central claim of accessibility-based approaches is that ranking of forms is exhaustive and exceptionless: All form differences indicate some difference in accessibility, including for instance the difference between an unstressed pronoun and zero anaphor. For example, the sentence in (3a) is printed on the bottle which is thus extremely high in accessibility, preventing the use of a pronoun. Similar considerations apply to example (3b), where the relevant context is the immediate discourse rather than the physical environment:</p><p>(3) a. Shake __ before using! (printed on syrup bottle) b. Here's [some syrup] i for you. Shake 0 i before using. <ref type="bibr">(Ariel, 1990, p. 60)</ref> Hence, in accessibility-based theories zero is a distinct form type with its own associated degree of accessibility which is systematically higher than that of pronouns <ref type="bibr">(Ariel, 1990, pp. 76-78)</ref>. This holds for any language, i.e. regardless of whether a language shows a general preference for one or the other high-accessibility marker, as reflected in the distinction between so-called 'pro-drop' and 'non-pro-drop' languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Roberts &amp; Holmberg, 2009)</ref>, or languages with higher or lower 'referential density' <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bickel, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>There is a range of other theories which conceive of referential features slightly differently, but essentially make similar predictions: Givón (1983a) (and various works thereafter) builds on the notion of topicality that applies to entities across sentences and is determined by anaphoric distance and other discourse factors. Topical entities (within 'topic chains') receive attenuated form of expression, typically unstressed pronouns or zero.</p><p>Centering Theory draws on the idea of 'centers' around which coreference relations across sentences are built <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Grosz et al., 1995)</ref>, with syntactic pivots (subjects in English) as preferred centers, so that coreference chains are preferably built along preferred syntactic positions. A similar model is Prominence Theory (Von <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Heusinger &amp; Schumacher, 2019)</ref>, where a discourse context contains prominence-lending cues that triggers preferred coreference relations in a subsequent sentence. In both of these latter two models, less attenuated forms are used to signal that the antecedent deviates from the preferred one within specific constellations of cross-sentence coreference. Givenness Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Gundel et al., 1993)</ref> builds essentially on the same basic assumptions as Accessibility Theory, but deviates in its emphasis on the role of pragmatic inferencing on behalf of the recipient (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Atlas &amp; Levinson, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Levinson, 1987)</ref>. Producers are thus somewhat less confined to specific referential forms as they can expect their recipients to establish coreference relations as part of the more general process of 'coherence establishment' <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Hobbs, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Kehler, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Kehler &amp; Rohde, 2013)</ref>. This model thus allows for more flexibility in the association between form and accessibility status, thus differing from the strict one-to-one relation that Accessibility Theory is bound to postulate. This is also more in line with a view that reference production is probabilistic rather than deterministic, as a producer will only ever be able to draw on rough estimates of their recipients' state of mind.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reference production across languages and cultures</head><p>Functionalist theories of referential choice are universalistic in that they are designed to capture its underlying mechanisms in any human language. Languages differ in their inventories of referential forms, yet, all forms within a language are ranked according to accessibility. Also, seemingly similar form types may come with different accessibility-related properties in different languages. For instance, reduced forms of reference such as personal pronouns and pronominal demonstratives may bear different degrees of conceptual information like gender, animacy, or other semantic distinctions, for instance in English or Tulil. These may make these forms more appropriate for lower-accessibility referents in some languages but not others.</p><p>Languages also differ with regards to coreference across sentences: In a 'syntactic language' such as English, only coreferent subjects can be dropped, and a dropped subject will always trigger a coreference interpretation with the preceding subject. In a 'pragmatic language' such as Mandarin, coreference relations are always subject to pragmatic inferencing alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Huang, 2000)</ref>. Hence, a sentence like She dropped the melon and burst.</p><p>is odd in English while its equivalent in Mandarin is totally acceptable as the zero anaphor in the second clause is readily interpreted as coreferent with the melon rather than she <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(LaPolla, 1993)</ref>, an interpretation prevented by rules of syntax in English.</p><p>Languages prominently differ in the presence of argument indexing morphology or argument agreement. Essentially, where agreement is present for any given syntactic function, it makes the use of a pronominal form less likely in many contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Jaeggli &amp; Safir, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Taraldsen, 1978)</ref>. While it is understood at least since <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Gilligan (1987)</ref>, that such a complementarity does not hold as an absolute universal, strong tendencies towards complementarity have repeatedly been found (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Berdičevskis et al., 2020)</ref>, including within individual languages where presence of agreement is conditioned by other features, for instance by tense-aspect categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Seo, 2001)</ref>, or via syncretisms in the verbal paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Rosenkvist, 2018)</ref>. Only the latter type of language-internal constructional variability can have an effect on language-specific models, as consistent presence or absence of agreement is simply not informative.</p><p>Cultural norms and habits of discourse production can likewise impact reference production so that language communities may differ in their explicitness about the entities they talk about. For instance, in the Kiranti language Belhare, explicit reference is avoided until there is high competition with other potential entities and potential ambiguity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bickel, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Stoll &amp; Bickel, 2009)</ref>. In some languages, such tendencies to remain implicit in particular about human referents may be tied to specific cultural and socio-political norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Clancy, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Duranti, 1994)</ref>. Similarly, either human or any globally more important entities have been found to be taken special care of by reserving pronominal (in contrast to zero) reference to these <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Genetti &amp; Crain, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Haig et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Schnell &amp; Barth, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Schwenter, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Schwenter, , 2016</ref>. These tendencies run counter accessibility-based theories where a more salient entity receives higher accessibility to be expressed as zero rather than pronominal form. As such they may present serious challenges to these theories and hence need to be considered in systematic cross-linguistic studies into referential choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other aspects of reference production and information management</head><p>Related to referential choice are various constructional and clause-combining patterns that discourse producers have been stipulated to deploy in service of information management. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chafe (1976)</ref> observes that highly activated referents realized by pronominals or zero tend to be allocated to subject position, hence his light subject constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chafe, 1994)</ref>. Du <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Bois (1987)</ref> claims the same to hold for transitive subjects (A) alone, stipulating that only intransitive subjects (S) and objects (P) are designed to serve as 'staging platforms' for less accessible referents and hence lexical NPs (Du <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Bois, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The relevant hypothesis here is that producers choose specific clause constructions in order to have a particular referent occur in, e.g. subject position so they receive the intended interpretation, for instance as a continuing topic. Similarly, the information-theoretic notion of uniform information density <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Jaeger, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Levy &amp; Jaeger, 2007)</ref> has been found to bear on the allocation of lexical NPs to be more likely in sentences whose structure without the NP is longer and more informative <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Schiborr, 2023)</ref>. A related tendency is that only one lexical NP with a discourse-new or generally low-accessibility referent should appear in a single clause unit <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chafe, 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chafe, , 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Du Bois, 1987)</ref>. While syntactic position is obviously not the motivation for a particular referential choice, sentence-related features may serve as cues for a computational model to predict referential choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical support for functionalist models of referential choice</head><p>From its beginnings in the 1970s research on reference production has drawn on language production data. Yet, their selection was exceedingly opportunistic and its features were massively varied. The main idea at the time was that any kind of actual naturalistic language use was most valuable in yielding important insights into human linguistic behavior and its impact on the development of grammatical structures. Thus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chafe (1980)</ref> initiated research based on retellings of a short silent movie that would yield parallax texts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Chafe (1994)</ref> draws on dinner table conversations recorded by the author, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ariel (1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ariel ( , 2000</ref> uses literary and newspaper texts, mainly from English and Hebrew. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gundel et al. (1993)</ref> draw on written texts like novels, short stories, and magazine articles from five languages, with collection sizes ranging from 240 (Chinese) to 655 (English) word tokens <ref type="bibr">(Gundel et al., 1993, p. 290)</ref>. Even smaller selections of data are drawn on in studies in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Givón, 1983a)</ref>, e.g. from English <ref type="bibr">(Givón, 1983c, p. 347)</ref> or Japanese <ref type="bibr">(Hinds, 1983, p. 58)</ref>.</p><p>The empirical and methodological basis of research on reference production was greatly enhanced through innumerous corpus studies associated with the sociolinguistic strand of language variation and change. Studies typically focused on subject realization, for instance on Tok Pisin <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Sankoff, 1977)</ref>, Bislama <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Meyerhoff, 2000)</ref>, English <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Travis, 2007)</ref>, comparing English and Spanish (Torres Cacoullos &amp; Travis, 2019), Mandarin <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Li &amp; Bayley, 2018)</ref>, Portuguese <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cameron &amp; Flores-Ferrán, 2004)</ref>, or the Oceanic language Vera'a <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Schnell &amp; Barth, 2020)</ref>. Object realization is more rarely treated, but some studies do exist, for instance on Bislama <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Meyerhoff, 2002)</ref>, Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Schwenter, 2016)</ref>, or Vera'a <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Schnell &amp; Barth, 2018)</ref>. These studies are characterized by implementation of sophisticated statistical methods, with various types of regression models having emerged as the standard over the years. Overall, findings at least for subjects have generally borne evidence supporting accessibility as a driving factor in subject realization, whereas matters are more diverse for objects where considerations of humanness or global topicality seem to play a role of their own (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Schnell &amp; Barth, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Schwenter, 2014)</ref>. While greatly enhancing the empirical robustness of theoretical claims, these studies do, however, still suffer from the neglect of factor weights and are not ideal for dealing with highly collinear feature distributions in the data. They also typically lack a clear comparative study design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Many of the functionalist notions relevant in referential choice have been quantified</head><p>into computational models, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Gatt et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Krahmer &amp; Van Deemter, 2012)</ref> for summaries. Generating referring expressions is a core task in natural language processing, and deciding the referential form, the central focus of this study, is typically only the first step, with the second step deciding on the actual expression of the referent <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gatt &amp; Krahmer, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Reiter &amp; Dale, 1997</ref>). These studies have, similar to our study, used machine learning techniques to classify the referential form. With the caveat that they have primarily focused on written English and on pronominalization (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Kibrik, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kibrik et al., 2016)</ref>, they have generally found referential choice to be multifactorial with a variety of features together best predicting the referential form <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Greenbacker &amp; McCoy, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Kibrik, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kibrik et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Same &amp; van Deemter, 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Strube &amp; Wolters, 2000)</ref>. Particularly important in these studies is the recency of mentioning the antecedent, as well as the syntactic function of the referent. Due to these models generalizing across many speakers and observations, they assume no variation in the use of referential form types within or even across speakers, and essentially will always produce the same referential form in the same context. To some extent, this is similar to the one-to-one mapping between activation and form predicted by Accessibility Theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outline of the current study</head><p>Scholars of reference production, and specifically of referential choice, can today draw on a wealth of theoretical and empirical work that has established a host of regularities of language use in this area that has found ample support from studies of different human languages. The general rules of referential choice have in addition been supplemented by innumerous observations of specific associations between referents and their form in individual languages. Yet, what is missing to date is the systematic scrutiny of referential choice rules in language production across human languages with the aim of evaluating the importance of the various factors found relevant thus far in comparative perspective. It is thus essentially unclear how generalizable earlier findings are across languages, especially as studies were rarely undertaken with a clear comparative research setup and operationalizations of the various factors were not guaranteed to be uniform across corpora and studies.</p><p>We also do not currently have a good understanding of how all the factors known to play a role actually play out vis-a-vis one another. This is particularly concerning because many of these are known to interact strongly. For instance, an entity that is the topic of a (given stretch of) discourse will typically also be mentioned frequently across sentences, often in subject position, and hence anaphoric distance to its previous mention will be short. As referential choices will here often be a pronoun or a zero, which of the factors is responsible to what extent?</p><p>We here tap into the possibilities of newly available spoken data from diverse languages, their systematic rich annotation, as well as latest computational methods to tackle these questions. Our goal was to estimate the decision making process of human language users by building a computational model that provides us with an evaluation of the importance of factors held responsible for the choice between the three major form types of full NP, pronominal form and zero reference. Importantly, our computational model was not intended to be a fully cognitively plausible model of referential choice that closely mimics human mechanisms of referential choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(McClelland, 2009)</ref>. It was instead intended to get insights into the role of the different hypothesized mechanisms by examining the associations between different factors in relation to referential choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>We framed referential choice as a computational problem, where the goal was to predict the choice between the three basic form types, namely a full noun phrase (NP) ("the woman"), a pronominal (pro) form ("she") or zero (0) reference, for each instance of reference. Our goal was to fathom the relevance of different factors widely considered in previous studies, casting a wide net by including all information that can be gleaned from corpus annotations. We thus seeked to estimate the generalizability of the canonical inventory of factors and their relative importance, as well as the divergence in their relative importance across languages.</p><p>The computational framework consisted of 1) preparing the corpora for computational analyses and identifying the referential expressions to include in the study, 2) automatically extracting features, i.e. quantifications of the factors that co-determine referential choice, 3) creating computational models to make predictions about it, and 4) evaluating these predictions and investigating the decision making process of the model itself. These steps were repeated for each language corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corpus preparation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corpus description</head><p>For this study we used the openly available 'Multilingual Corpus of Annotated Spoken Texts' (Multi-CAST; Haig &amp; Schnell, 2022) 2 , which comprises of spoken monologic narrative texts from a current total of 19 languages. Each language corpus draws (in most cases) on larger, multipurpose documentary collections stemming from dedicated language documentation projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Himmelmann, 1998)</ref>. To be included in the corpus, texts had to be annotated according to Multi-CAST annotation standards and comprise of minimally 1,000 clauses to ensure reliable corpus analysis. While the subcorpora share in linguistic register, text content is not controlled for.</p><p>The key feature of Multi-CAST is its unique standardized annotation schemes.</p><p>Included subcorpora will already contain three standard layers of annotation, namely 1) time-aligned transcriptions in working orthography, 2) their free idiomatic translations into English <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Schultze-Berndt, 2006)</ref>, and 3) morphological annotations according to the Leipzig Glossing Rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Comrie et al., 2008)</ref>. Added to these are annotations following the conventions of GRAID (Grammatical Relations and Animacy in Discourse; <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Haig &amp; Schnell, 2014)</ref>  discourse referent: A discourse referent is a stable entity that is introduced into the universe of discourse and can then be tracked across sentences throughout a discourse by deploying a range of referential devices that will pick up precisely the same entity (Du <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Bois, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Karttunen, 1976)</ref>. The indices are assigned to each mention of a discourse referent throughout each text in each corpus.</p><p>These layers of annotation form a grid-like structure as exemplified in (4). This can be investigated in terms of vertical relations across layers, associating for instance a referent index with its GRAID annotation (form, humanness, syntactic function), its morphological gloss and its specific lexical instantiation. Likewise, syntagmatic relations can be determined, for instance identifying a referent index and its antecedent occurrence, and the relevant properties of this relation (e.g. respective GRAID annotations, intervening clause boundary symbols). This then determines anaphoric distance. In this manner, all relevant factors can be read off the corpus annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identifying referential expressions</head><p>In a first step, we identified all nominal expressions and zero positions that mention a discourse referent, i.e. have a referent. We restricted our investigation to third person referents as these are the only ones that regularly admit all three form choices. We also removed all instances of vocatives, possessives, appositional modifiers, and referents without any syntactic function, e.g. where a nominal expression is verbalized, yet the syntactic construction is discontinued. Finally, we only considered those instances of zero reference that can be associated with an argument role of a given predicate, have a specific referent, and alternate regularly with an overt form of expressions. This excludes what are treated in GRAID as 'forced zeroes', i.e. implied arguments that can never be realized overtly, such as controlled subjects in to-complements in English, and are thus enforced by a specific syntactic configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corpus overview and statistics</head><p>An overview of Multi-CAST and its 16 language subcorpora with RefIND annotations is given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. With these languages coming from 10 different language families and from different macro-areas (Asia, Europe, Papunesia, South America), the corpus reflects immense cross-linguistic diversity. We also included statistics on the total number of clauses and on the total number of referent tokens considered in each subcorpus.</p><p>The sizes of the subcorpora are modest, ranging from the minimum of 1,000 to slightly over 6,000 clauses. Similarly, the number of referent tokens ranges from 1,600 to 7,700. Despite our filtering process, the majority of the referents is analyzed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feature implementation</head><p>We used an automatic approach to extract the feature values for various factors, which can be applied across all 16 languages. This makes the estimated feature values unbiased and independent of the language. We automatically extracted 16 factors recurrently found relevant in the literature, grouped into four broad categories: 1) topicality and global discourse properties, 2) clause structure, 3) inherent referent properties, and 4) phoric relations. Importantly, we take a cross-linguistic perspective and hence do not consider features that are based on language-specific constructions. 3</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Topicality and discourse properties</head><p>The discourse-related properties of discourse referents define their relationship with the overall context of the discourse and its communicative goals. Global topicality is the extent to which communication revolves around a discourse referent. Global topicality is approximated by considering frequency of mention, which was found to be predictive of the referential form <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chen et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Siddharthan et al., 2011)</ref>. It is implemented as the proportion of mentions of the current referent compared to all mentions of all referents within a text <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chafe, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Thompson, 1990)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>No</head><p>Topic persistence is reflected in the number of clauses out of 10 clauses subsequent to a current mention which mention a given discourse referent <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Givón, 1983b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Givón, , 1992</ref>. It thus resembles part of a producer's forward planning of the discourse to unfold.</p><p>Topic salience is reflected in the number of clauses out of 10 clauses preceding a current mention of a given discourse referent. The basic assumption that frequently mentioning a given discourse referent will raise its salience and hence make it more accessible in retrieval tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ariel, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Chafe, 1994)</ref>. 4</p><p>Information pressure captures the density of discourse referents either globally as the average number of discourse referents per clause throughout an entire text (Du <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Bois, 1987)</ref>, or locally as the number of discourse referents mentioned in the last three clauses <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Haig et al., 2021)</ref>). It thus characterizes the discourse environment of a referent mention.</p><p>High information pressure incurs more competition between discourse referents, thus incentivizes the deployment of lexical NPs, including in specific instances of reference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clause structure</head><p>These factors subsume properties of the local syntactic context of a referent expression. Note that these factors are likely not motivating factors for a particular referential form, but rather factors that correlate with the occurrence of certain form types.</p><p>Syntactic function has been found to correlate with types of referent expression, in particular the syntactic function A, or both S and A ('subjects'), with non-lexical form <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Brennan, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Chafe, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Du Bois, 1987)</ref>. While not a motivating factor for referential choice per se, a computational model can draw on syntactic function as a relevant predictor of referential form.</p><p>Verb position captures the position of a referent expression relative to the verb within a sentence. The rationale behind this feature is that lexical NPs with less accessible referents tend to occur after the verb, sometimes even involving inversion of canonical word order <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Lambrecht, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Ward &amp; Birner, 2004)</ref>. Conversely, pronominal expressions with highly accessible referents tend to occur early within a sentence, and hence before the verb <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bock, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Christiansen &amp; Chater, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Clause length is measured in number of word forms, excluding the referent expression in question. It has been found to correlate with referential choice: Longer clauses increase the overall likelihood that a more explicit form of reference is used <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Arnold et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Schiborr, 2023)</ref>, thus lowering the information density of the clause <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Jaeger, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Levy &amp; Jaeger, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Clause type registers whether a referent expression occurs in an independent, adverbial, relative, and complement clause. Reduced form of reference is more likely in subordinate clauses by the principle of unity as their antecedent is likely to be found in the matrix clause, i.e. within the same complex sentence.</p><p>Number of discourse-new referents in a single clause unit is also included.</p><p>Again, while this factor does not directly co-determine referential choice, clauses have been shown to exhibit maximally one new referent and one full (lexical) NP <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chafe, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Du Bois, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Givón, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Pawley &amp; Syder, 2000)</ref>, and hence it is likely that once one lexical form has already been encountered in a clause, the form of another referent in the same clause is more likely to be non-lexical.</p><p>Agreement is operationalized here as the presence or absence of a morphological marker within the predicative phrase that co-expresses the grammatical person, number and/or gender of an argument in a given syntactic function. Typically, only one explicit form expressing these features should occur in one syntactic function <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Berdičevskis et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Taraldsen, 1978)</ref>. Where agreement is either consistently marked or consistently absent for a particular function in an individual language, it bears no predictive power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inherent referent properties</head><p>Discourse referents exhibit properties that are independent of their relation to the discourse or syntactic context and different from interrelations between their successive mentions.</p><p>Humanness is captured as a binary feature [+/-human].

The impact of number is subject to cross-linguistic variation. For instance, non-singular referents are more likely overtly realized in the Oceanic language Vera'a and other languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ariel, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Schnell &amp; Barth, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">, 2020</ref>, but left not overtly realized in Mandarin <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Li &amp; Bayley, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phoric aspects of referents</head><p>Phoric aspects of referents comprise their relations to the antecedent mention of a discourse referent.</p><p>Anaphoric distance, or recency, is measured in the number of clauses between a current mention of a discourse referent and its antecedent mention. The expectation was that higher distance makes the deployment of a lexical NP more likely <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ariel, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Arnold et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Givón, 1983b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Greenbacker &amp; McCoy, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kibrik et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Same &amp; van Deemter, 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Schiborr, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Strube &amp; Wolters, 2000)</ref>. Essentially, the question here is whether there is a function shift from antecedent to the current mention. In particular where anaphoric distance is low, continuity of function correlates with high accessibility, whereas function shift lowers accessibility and hence triggers more explicit form of reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ariel, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Givón, 1983b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Grosz et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Schiborr, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Schnell &amp; Barth, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Antecedent form resembles the form type (NP, pro, 0) of an antecedent.</p><p>Referential choice may echo antecedent form choices by way of morphosyntactic priming or earlier activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cameron &amp; Flores-Ferrán, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Schnell &amp; Barth, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Torres Cacoullos &amp; Travis, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Travis, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Discourse-givenness captures whether a referent is the first instance of a discourse referent in a given discourse, with possible values of [+/-given].

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational modeling</head><p>We framed referential choice as a computational prediction problem and used machine learning to train a classifier to predict the form of each referent token in the corpus, based on the factors described above. As such, our study continues a line of research on referential choice deploying machine learning techniques (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ferreira et al., 2016b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Kibrik, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kibrik et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Same &amp; van Deemter, 2020b)</ref>. The goal of using computational modeling was not so much to create a cognitively plausible model of referential choice, but rather to get insights into the statistical associations between the factors hypothesized in literature and the referential form <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(McClelland, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The classifier was used to generate predictions about the form of referents that the model has not been exposed to. We then evaluated these predictions to investigate 1) the prediction quality of the model, and hence the adequacy of the factors included, and 2) how the model made these decisions, i.e. in what way and how much each factor contributed to the predictions made. There are a few advantages to using a machine learning framework as opposed to more explanatory framework where a model is created that best explains all data at hand. First and foremost, due to the small sample sizes, there may be concerns on the generalizability of more explanatory models, and hence the findings. By using observations unseen to the models, we could more broadly investigate the generalizability of our model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Shmueli, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Yarkoni &amp; Westfall, 2017)</ref>. Moreover, this setup allows us to train and evaluate our model on different divisions of the data, thereby essentially repeating the same procedure. Aggregating over results of the evaluation of these different models then furthermore allows to make more robust claims.</p><p>Like Same and van Deemter (2020b), we used a classifier with a 'tree-like structure', i.e., recursive partitioning, specifically the random forest implementation from Scikit-learn in Python <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Pedregosa et al., 2011)</ref>. As an ensemble learning method, random forests combine the results of many individual decision trees, trained on both subsets of the observations and of the features. Tree-based models tend to perform on par or even better than neural network models on grid-like data and excel with small data sizes as they need less training examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Grinsztajn et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Levshina, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Shwartz-Ziv &amp; Armon, 2022)</ref>. Such models are moreover frequently used in linguistics, including in referential choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Greenbacker &amp; McCoy, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kibrik et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Same &amp; van Deemter, 2020b)</ref>, and well-suited for many linguistic tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Levshina, 2021</ref>).</p><p>Our computational model only works with numeric data. This means that we had to split the factors that comprise different categories, e.g. syntactic function and antecedent form, into multiple binary features that each mark the presence or absence of a single category within the factor. The 16 factors are hence further subdivided into multiple separate features, for instance the feature 'syntactic function = A (transitive subject)' with the values '0' = false and '1' = true, as we will also see in <ref type="figure">Figure (</ref>1).</p><p>Since we were interested in the individual features determining referential choice, both within and across languages, we trained and evaluated a single model for each language. By not assuming any dependency between languages, any patterns between language then most likely emerge from similar patterns in the data, rather than shared information in training. Due to the modest size of the subcorpora, we implemented a 10-fold cross-validation for more reliable estimates, a common strategy, also in computational studies on reference production (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kibrik et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Strube &amp; Wolters, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adequacy of models in predicting referential choice</head><p>We first investigated the average performance from the 10 evaluation rounds. This informs us about the predictive adequacy of the features included. Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Strube and Wolters (2000)</ref>, we compared the average prediction accuracy of the model to the prediction accuracy of a model that would always predict the most frequent referential form. This corresponds to the proportion of the most frequent form choice in the test set.</p><p>While accuracy is a good indicator of the overall performance of the models, it does not reflect how well a model is able to predict each individual referential form. For example an unequal number of instances of the different forms seen in training potentially leads to biases in the prediction. Hence, in addition, we inspected the type of errors that the model made for each of the three referential form types <ref type="bibr">(NP, pronominal, zero</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contribution of individual factors to predictions</head><p>Next, we zoomed in on the individual features that play an important role in the predictions. For this we deployed a method, originating from explainable artificial intelligence, and, to our knowledge, unused in linguistics, namely Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). SHAP is based on a mathematical formula to calculate payouts (feature importance) to multiple players (features) in a cooperative game (predicting the referential form), where being better at the game leads to a higher payout <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Shapley, 1953)</ref>.</p><p>SHAP is a method used after training a model, and investigates, using the data unseen in training, i.e. test data, in what direction and how much each feature contributes to the predictions made by the model. SHAP has several advantages over more traditional methods to calculate feature importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Lundberg et al., 2020)</ref>. Traditional measures like Gini importance, which measures feature importance directly in the model by assessing tree splits <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Levshina, 2021)</ref>, and permutation-based importance, which is calculated by randomly shuffling the values of a feature before testing, and measuring the impact on the model performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Altmann et al., 2010)</ref>, lead to biased estimates of the contribution of factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Hooker et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Strobl et al., 2007)</ref>. By summarizing the SHAP values across the features for a single observation, and by looking across each of the three form types, we can reconstruct not only which decision the model made for that observation, but also which factors contributed in which direction and how much to this decision. First note that SHAP provides an explanation for each of the three form types separately. SHAP values are computed based on each feature and the associated value it had in the observation. They are ranked according to their contribution towards the decision. We only show the 9 features that contributed the most. The contribution of the remaining features is shown in a single value, which is possible thanks to the additivity property of SHAP values <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017)</ref>. SHAP values also reflect in which direction a feature influences a prediction. A positive contribution (in yellow) indicates that the feature pushed the model towards predicting a certain form for a referent, while a negative contribution (in blue) indicates that the feature pushed the model away from predicting a certain form.</p><p>The visualization starts at the bottom of each graph with the expected value</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E[f (x)]</formula><p>, the model's expected probability output f (x) when no feature information is available. This is essentially equivalent to the probability of observing the form type in the corpus, meaning that across the three form types, the expected values should sum up to value close to 1. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We can observe that the expected value is very low for zeros in English, which is unsurprising given its rarity in usage; the expected value for NP's and pronominal forms is much higher. As we move towards the top of each graph, we observe how each individual feature contributes to model's beliefs. And finally, by summing the SHAP values across all features for a single form type, we arrive at the model's predicted probability output f (x). By looking across each form type, we can then infer that the form type with the highest predicted output value was the form type that the model classified this observation as. Note that the model's predicted output also sums to approximately 1 across the form types, and hence essentially describe the certainty of the model in its prediction.</p><p>SHAP values thus give insights in how each feature pushes the expected value towards or away from predicting a certain form type. In this example, we can observe that the features clearly push the model away from classifying the referential form as NP. The opposite is true for the zero form type: The features clearly push the decision towards the zero form type. Yet, thanks to the high expected value for pronominal forms and despite that the features do not push the model clearly in any direction, the highest output value can be observed for the pronominal form, meaning that this is the form type that is assigned to the referent.</p><p>In this example, the model correctly predicted the referential form to be</p><p>pronominal. Yet, the features of the model also provided some evidence for a zero form, something that would have indeed been possible in this example. This brings us to an important point: SHAP values are solely based on the model's predictions and do not take into account whether these predictions were actually correct. It is for this reason that it is of utmost importance that the model is accurate in its predictions, as the model does not otherwise reflect how the features predict referential choice, and subsequently, the SHAP values would not inform us about the contribution of individual factors to referential choice. Finally, zooming in onto the factors that were important in this single prediction:</p><p>The fact that the anaphoric distance iss short (i.e. 1), clearly is useful information for all three form types, pushing the classification towards one of the reduced forms. So does the topic salience value of 2, but to a lesser extent. Interestingly, a high global topicality score (approximately 7% of the total mentions were of this discourse referent), the antecedent function being S (subject in intransitive clause), and a clause length of 10 words (without including the referent being classified) push the predictions towards a zero form, rather than to a pronominal form. Yet, this is only a single example, and it remains to be seen whether these patterns generalize across all observations or even across languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global importance of factors</head><p>These local SHAP values can be aggregated into global feature importance scores, due to their additivity property <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017)</ref>. Both larger positive and large negative SHAP values influence the predictions more, hence, by taking the absolute value, we can calculate a feature importance score for a single observation. Averaging across all observations then yields a single feature importance score for each referential form choice, based on the training data. We could then sum across the three choices to get a per-feature importance score.</p><p>There are a few more technicalities. First, because categorical factors, such as syntactic function and clause type, consist of multiple binary features (i.e. one for each category), we added up the individual features for each factor across each prediction before taking the mean absolute score. Also, because we used a 10-fold cross-validation setup, the procedure of calculating SHAP values was repeated 10 times. This means that we got SHAP values from 10 different evaluation rounds. This setup moreover guarantees that every referent in our corpus is used exactly once in evaluation. We merged all the SHAP values from the 10 evaluation rounds before calculating the mean absolute score. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adequacy of models in predicting referential choice</head><p>The average prediction accuracy per corpus is reported in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.

We summarize the average precision and recall across form types (again over the ten evaluation rounds) in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Here, we include the distribution of the referential form types in the test sets for comparison. First note that this distribution is rather skewed in most language corpora, in particular for pronominals and zeros whose</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2</head><p>Average accuracy across 10 evaluation rounds with the majority vote accuracy as reference.</p><p>proportions vary widely across language corpora. Consequently, we observe particularly low precision and even more so recall scores for these two form types. The proportion of NPs, on the other hand, is relatively stable across corpora, echoing earlier findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Haig et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>A lower precision and recall is to be expected with a low proportion of pronouns or zeros, as in the Mandarin and Bora corpora, respectively, as there will be only few observations in training. With the already small sample sizes, it is likely that there are simply not enough observations for the model to learn to correctly classify observations into these form choices, and even more so generalize these predictions to unobserved observations. Regardless, the models have clearly learned something, as demonstrated by the high precision and recall for the form choices with higher proportions, and the overall high prediction accuracies reported in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. So while the accuracies are generally high, validating that the models are able to predict the referential form of a referent, there is variation across corpora in how precise the models are in predicting pronominal and zero forms, and how good they can be retrieved.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> Precision and recall across referential form types.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contribution of individual factors to predictions</head><p>A SHAP value visualizes how each feature influences a local prediction. Because each feature can contribute differently to the model's prediction on each of the referential forms, three separate values are computed, one for each referential form <ref type="bibr">(NP, pronominal, zero)</ref>. A value highlights whether the feature contributed towards the classification as a given form type, thus having a positive impact, or away from it, thus having a negative impact. We also consider for each feature its specific value -which can be color codedand thereby highlighting the relationship between the feature value and the corresponding SHAP value. This three-way information of individual decisions, the direction and size of the SHAP value and the feature value provides a wealth of information by itself. Here, we summarize the SHAP values by feature. This shows the general tendencies in SHAP values for each feature, that is, how each feature tends to contribute to the predictions. The density of SHAP values is indicated on the y-axis, meaning that in regions with more SHAP values, these spread out "vertically". The features are sorted on their mean absolute SHAP value, the feature importance for a referential form. Here, we only show the five most important features for each form type, as for reasons of space, we cannot summarize the SHAP values for all features across all forms, and the most important ones contributed most to the predictions. We filtered out the languages for which either precision or recall was below 70% for a particular referential form, as per the discussion above. While NPs survived the filtering process in all language corpora, 12 language corpora were removed from the pronoun and 7 from the zero set of SHAP values. As discussed above, both precision and recall are low in these cases, for the most part because there were low proportions of these respective form types observable in the test data. Thus, unsurprisingly, the language corpora remaining in  the pronoun set and the zero set, respectively, are precisely complementary. Only three language corpora (from Chirag, Jinghpaw and Kalamang) were removed from both the pronominal and the zero set. In other words, the model is overall still accurate for all non-lexical forms of reference, which is preferably either pronominal or zero within each language. While basically arbitrary, 70% is chosen here as a rather conservative threshold, thus implying that the majority of the remaining predictions were correct (precise), and respective form types were correctly retrieved (recalled).</p><p>Many features in the top 5 are shared across languages for each of the referential form types. Also, the specific impact of feature values on each SHAP value is mostly similar across languages, both in direction as well as in magnitude of the effect. Features that are shared across most languages for predictions on lexical NPs are anaphoric distance and topic salience. For the decision to classify a referential form as pronoun, anaphoric distance is shared across languages, but also singularity and whether the antecedent is a pronoun play an important role, the latter reflecting a degree of perseverance in the deployment of pronouns that is likely due to morphosyntactic priming <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cameron &amp; Flores-Ferrán, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Pickering &amp; Branigan, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Schnell &amp; Barth, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Torres Cacoullos &amp; Travis, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Travis, 2007)</ref>. Finally, for the decision on classifying a referential form as zero, the same features as for classifying a referential form as NP are shared across most languages, but with a reversal of the directionality of the SHAP values.</p><p>We now zoom in on the three most important features across all three form types: anaphoric distance, topic salience, and syntactic function. Anaphoric distance is the most important feature in 13 languages for the decision to classify a referent as NP. Generally, while anaphoric distance does show up consistently in the decisions for pronoun or zero forms too, its ranking with regards to the latter two is more variant. Moreover, its effect on NP classification is monotonically weakening with ascending feature values, meaning that with higher anaphoric distances the model decisions gradually shift further away from classifying a referent expression as an NP. The results are reversed for the decisions on both other referential forms. Crucially, there is a consistent tipping point where the model's decisions seem to reverse, namely at around an anaphoric distance between 3 and 5. Distances of 6 and higher are clear cues for the model to classify a form of reference as full NP.</p><p>In two languages, topic salience is the most important feature. This highlights the importance of a discourse referent being established as a topic in the immediately preceding discourse for or against the choice of classifying a referent mention as an NP.</p><p>Yet, the impact of specific feature values on the model's classification decisions are slightly different here. Specifically, it is much less monotone: For high topic salience scores, it seems less important how high the score is, as any moderately high value is a clear cue for the model to not classify a referent expression as an NP and to classify it as both a pronoun and zero form, and vice versa.</p><p>Syntactic function is less consistently being ranked in the top 5 across languages across all form choices, indicating a larger variability in the role of the syntactic function in the predictions across languages. The individual categories of syntactic functions yield quite different effects. Whether a referent is the sole argument in an intransitive (S) or the agentive argument in a transitive clause (A) shows up consistently among the most important features, and as a more important one than the function P. This suggests that the choice of a referential form is more permissive for P and more restrictive for S and A.</p><p>However, we should also note that these individual binary features are very much dependent on each other. Only one of these features can have the value 1 at the same time.</p><p>Interestingly, Sumbawa is an exception: Even though both anaphoric distance and topic salience are in the top 5 most important predictors, verb-finality is the most important one. This suggests that in Sumbawa, NPs are not common at all in verb-final constructions, thereby providing the model with a strong cue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global importance of factors</head><p>We next zoom in on feature importance. The average relative feature importance values are summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. The boxplot (left) summarizes the importance scores across languages and across all three form types. Next to the relative importance estimates, we assessed the relative order of feature importance scores across languages. For each language, we ranked the features on their relative importance and then summarized these ranks into a rank distribution for each feature (right). As such, the feature importance boxplot shows the strength of the importance across languages, while the rank distribution shows the relative strength of a feature in comparison to the other features. The features are moreover ordered on their median feature importance strength across languages.</p><p>First, note the multitude and variety of features that are important in predicting referential choice, both within and across languages, highlighting its complexity. There is no feature that has a median of over 0.2 across languages, thus highlighting how multifactorial a matter referential choice is. Yet, while there is significant variation between languages in the importance of different factors, there is also high cross-linguistic consistency with anaphoric distance, syntactic function and topic salience being top predictors.</p><p>Similarly, there is general consistency in which factors are not very important in referential choice: whether agreement is present, the number of new referents in clause,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6</head><p>Feature importances summarized across languages, and rank distribution.</p><p>clause type, discourse givenness, and information pressure. Agreement is a poor predictor, even for the languages that do have variation in agreement marking. This suggests that, while agreement can still play a role in the overall use of pronouns versus zeros for example, it does not influence the predictions on a very local level. Another point is that agreement pertains only to a subset of functions, and as such its impact on the model overall is fairly confined.</p><p>Some features show significant variation in their impact on the model across languages, especially the syntactic function, singularity and verb position, pointing towards their effect being language-specific. Some languages seem to idiosyncratically favor the use of pronouns for non-singular referents, e.g. Vera'a, whereas others favor zero in the same context, e.g. Mandarin. Similarly with regards to verb position: It is well known that some languages place pronominal subjects pre-and NP subjects post-verbally, or show inversion with certain referential status that may to some extent correlate with referential form type <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Ward &amp; Birner, 2004)</ref>. Among the language corpora in Multi-CAST, the one from Sumbawa shows systematic placement of NPs in subject (A or S) function postverbally.</p><p>While this placement is of course not the driving force behind the form choice, the model can nonetheless rely on post-verbal placement as a cue for NP form, hence its effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Using computational models, we studied the factors predictive of referential choice in monologic narratives across diverse languages. Crucially, nearly all of the 16 factors that have been discussed in the literature for a long time contribute to some extent to the predictions made. Our study thus underscores that referential choice is multifactorial (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Kehler &amp; Rohde, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Kibrik, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kibrik et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Same, 2024)</ref>. This is very much in line with accessibility-based theories that see accessibility to be manipulated by different factors across different contexts, so that for instance, where a referent is given and its antecedent at low distance, it may still be realized as an NP due to competition, as the latter does still contribute to the model. Basically then, these theories find some support across larger datasets from diverse human languages.</p><p>At the same time, however, it is only a small set of features, namely anaphoric distance, syntactic function and topic salience that are the most important predictors across languages and hence carry the biggest burden in referential choice (cf. Same, 2024, for English). Of particular interest is the monotonicity in the interrelation of anaphoric distance and the likelihood to predict a full NP, as well as the cross-linguistically stable tipping point at around 3-5 clauses distance from when prediction of full NP becomes quasi-absolute. Likewise, a mostly similar monotonic interrelation between topic salience and the form of expression can be observed across languages, with a tipping point at approximately 3 immediately preceding mentions. This seems to point to the role of some form of activation (and its decay over time), potentially connected to issues of working memory, that are likely universal across human languages (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Schiborr, 2023)</ref>. We do note, however, that anaphoric distance and its different possible measurements deserve further scrutiny in the future (but see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Same &amp; van Deemter, 2020a)</ref>.</p><p>While current theories find overall support by our analysis, we also note important deviations from its predictions. For instance, while topic salience (pertaining to preceding context) is an important factor across languages and form types, topic persistence is only marginally important, being only in nineth position or lower across all languages, despite the latter being more prominently featured in the literature on referential choice (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Givón, 1983b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Givón, , 1992</ref>. This provides strong evidence that speakers seem to entertain little capacity for forward planning and audience design in discourse production <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Arnold, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">MacDonald, 2013)</ref>. Conversely, topic salience and anaphoric distance -Givón's 'lookback' -are overall more relevant, thus also stressing the incrementality of discourse production.</p><p>Syntactic function showed significant variation across language in its predictive ability, yet was overall a strong predictor. Perhaps, this variability in overall importance reflects an overall difference between syntactic and pragmatic languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Huang, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, knowing whether the referent is a subject, was generally the most informative syntactic feature. Importantly, the subject function was more informative for the referential form than the object, suggesting that objects are more permissive in the referential choice and more restrictive for S and A. In addition, knowing that the referent is in subject position had a consistent influence on the predictions, despite the variability in importance. Referents in subject position were, across all languages where the feature was in the top 5 most important predictors, less likely to be an NP, and more likely to be zero.</p><p>The picture for how syntactic function influences the prediction of pronominal forms is less clear, and warrants future research. But overall, this is consistent with Chafe's light subjects as a function of a confluence of factors like humanness, topicality and agentivity, leaving the P function open to more balanced feature value distributions and form types <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chafe, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Haig, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>What bears hardly any relevance are the features of discourse givenness, information pressure and competition, reflected here in the number of discourse referents within the immediately preceding context. This is somewhat surprising given the wealth of experimental research that has shown repeatedly how speakers steer the attention of their addressees towards the correct discourse referent under referential competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Fuchs &amp; Schumacher, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Repp &amp; Schumacher, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Von Heusinger &amp; Schumacher, 2019)</ref>. It is likely that habits in discourse production play an important role here so that speakers of diverse languages prefer continuations with the same discourse referent as topic once established in a discourse, at least over a certain number of clauses. Moreover, addressees are often in a position to establish the correct intended coreference as part of coherence establishment during discourse from <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Kehler (2002)</ref>, illustrated in in (5). This suggests that future corpus-based work in this area should attempt to integrate at least semantic information on predicates and potentially also information on coherence relations between utterances/sentences.</p><p>In addition to the commonalities in referential choice noted thus far, our model outcomes also point to a number of cross-linguistic differences. Crucially, these pertain primarily to fairly idiosyncratic properties of languages, for instance, whether non-singular reference is preferably undertaken by a pronoun or zero, or whether the placement of NPs and pronouns is subject to word order variation, hence the effect of verb position on the model to classify an instance of reference as NP. In sum, decision making in referential choice is likely driven by a very similar set of functional factors across diverse languages, in particular those pertaining to the immediately preceding discourse context. Turning now to the differences between predicted form types, the observation that only full NPs are reliably predicted by our model across all language corpora puts the postulated completeness of form types as responsive to referential features into question.</p><p>Obviously, cross-linguistic differences and the complementarity of languages foremost reflects different preferences for one of each non-lexical form of references across languages.</p><p>To some extent the low precision and retrieval figures we obtained are likely due to their low respective frequencies. Yet, it is also likely that the choice between these referentially exceedingly similar forms is subject to more idiosyncratic influences in individual languages. Among these are structural factors, for instance where pronouns develop towards bound cross-indices within the well-known grammaticalization pathway of agreement markers from free pronouns <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Schnell, 2018)</ref>. Likewise, cultural factors pertaining to discourse production habits may be relevant, for instance a tendency to remain mostly silent for as much as possible about entities that is widespread across many cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Stoll &amp; Bickel, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The small corpus sizes and low frequencies of pronominal or zero forms cannot account for all prediction errors, and we can only speculate what could account for these errors. First, even though we included a wide range of factors, these factors were all language-agnostic and did not target language-specific constructions, and likely non-exhaustive. Similarly, referential choice could be further mediated by the common ground established between the speaker and the comprehender, something that is impossible to capture based on the corpus text and the functional relations annotated.</p><p>Moreover, there is individual speaker variation in referential choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ferreira et al., 2016a)</ref>, something that is unaccounted for in our models, as they infer average patterns across all speakers <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Kibrik et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>It is important to stress that computational models like ours are not intended to mimic language users' minds, and it is also unlikely that the computational models here closely reflect the actual cognitive processes of language users in deciding a referential form.</p><p>Rather, these models capture associations between the factors and the produced referential forms, based on naturalistic production data that are the end result of the human decision making processes on referential choice, sharing the same discourse context. And because the functional factors considered in this study have been found or at the very least are strongly expected to bear psychological reality, these associations still provide insights in the factors generally relevant in referential choice. For instance, some features that turned up as important are well-known to not directly contribute to referential choice on behalf of speakers. Rather, these effects are an artifact of other, more intricate considerations. This is primarily true for importance of the syntactic functions A and S against full NP use:</p><p>Here it has been well known that the function itself does not lead the speaker to not use a NP. Rather, it so happens in human language discourse that an agentive participant is typically given and highly accessible, hence their non-lexical form <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Haig &amp; Schnell, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Occurrence in the syntactic function A itself thus does not represent a cognitively relevant factor to predict not to use an NP, yet these factors are highly correlated. This is, to our knowledge, the first study that evaluates the relevance of existing linguistic literature on referential choice at such a large scale on naturalistic data across a diverse sample of languages. Despite the sample of languages being both typologically and culturally very diverse, we found strong general tendencies in the cognitive-functional factors predictive of the referential form. Because each model was created completely independently of the other models, the fact that we find similar factor importances across languages can hardly be due to chance. Hence, this suggests that these cognitive-functional mechanisms may in fact be universal. For example, we expect some notion of recency or saliency in the immediately preceding discourse to be universally a driving factor of referential choice. At the same time, it is unlikely that information pressure and competition for discourse prominence are universally important factors.</p><p>While SHAP has been used in natural language processing to explain large language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Kokalj et al., 2021)</ref> and cognitive neuroscience to find the brain areas and time range most predictive for a certain effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Sylvester et al., 2024)</ref>, there are, to our knowledge, no studies that have used SHAP to test linguistic theories, despite its potential.</p><p>The strength of SHAP lies within its ability to provide reliable estimates of how individual decisions are made by any computational model, meaning that calculating feature importance can be done less opaquely. Here, we have essentially directly compared the factors important in individual decisions on referential form choices across languages, while at the same time not assuming any dependencies between languages. Moreover, we have only touched upon the possible ways to analyze SHAP values; we only focused on global patterns in SHAP values, i.e. how model decisions are formed when looking across all observations. Instead, one could zoom in on individual observations, as well as groups of observations (e.g. referents part of a same subject chain) to get more precise insights in how languages might predict the referential form. Likewise, we here only investigated individual factors. It is very likely that factors interact and influence the choice in unpredictable and non-linear ways. While such interactions are evidently captured by our computational models, these are not visible at the level of summarization described here.</p><p>Our computational framework provides many starting points for studying such interactions. For instance how interactions between factors influence the model decisions can be studied with our framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Referential choice has been primarily studied using small amounts of corpus data, typically from individual languages. While this can be very interesting for hypothesizing the factors involved in referential choice, it is important to test their hypothesized relevance against actual corpus data from typologically diverse languages, as this provides insights into the generalizability and actual importance of these factors. In the current study, we trained a computational models on each language in Multi-CAST, a corpus consisting of spoken narratives from 16 typological diverse languages, to predict the form of a referent, based on a set of linguistically and psychologically-motivated features. Our models could fairly accurately predict the referential form on data that it has not been exposed to, despite the small data samples. Using a method from explainable artificial intelligence, but which is novel in linguistics, we investigated how the models made these predictions, that is, we investigated the precise influence of these features on referential choice.</p><p>Our study provides a first global assessment of the factors involved in referential choice. It thereby provides many starting points for more in-depth analyses of individual features and referential forms. Such analyses can be conducted on the basis of the methodology used here. In particular, because SHAP values reflect local, individual observations, it is possible to analyze the models' decisions on a per-observation basis.</p><p>Similarly, the similarities and differences between the predictions made for pronominal and zero need to be further investigated to detail out the considerations in deciding one of these reduced forms. And finally, we have here mainly zoomed in onto the shared patterns across languages. At the same time, there is also significant variation between languages, especially concerning more idiosyncratic properties. These warrant a more in-depth investigation to disentangle how these factors precisely affect referential choice and why.</p><p>Multi-CAST and the various contributors to the collection listed on the corpus website at https://multicast.aspra.uni-bamberg.de/.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>were put into [an orphanage] k .

Finally and not unimportantly, SHAP computes the contributions locally, that is, for each individual prediction of a referential form in the test set. SHAP values represent these locally computed contributions of individual factors to individual form choices. Hence, a score is computed for each feature representing how and how much that feature contributed to the decision to classify an observation as either an NP, pronoun or 0. This means that a single prediction is represented by multiple SHAP values, one for each predictive feature. A single SHAP value subsequently denotes how a single feature influenced any single prediction of a referential form. In other words, a SHAP value represents the average marginal contribution of a feature towards predicting a referential form. In Figure 1, we visualize this local decision making process for one such classification in the English subcorpus. Here the model is tasked with classifying the referential form of the referent in (4Local explanation using SHAP of the decision of the model to (correctly) classify the referent in Example (4) as a pronominal form.</figDesc></figure>

Precision describes how likely it is that when the model predicts a particular referential form, it is correctly classified, while recall describes how likely it is that the model correctly retrieves a particular referential form. A low precision for a referential form indicates that the model has difficulty in making accurate predictions on that referential form. A low recall indicates that the number of instances of a form type retrieved is low compared to the total amount and therefore not representative of all data.</note></figure>
