			<abstract>
				<p>In keeping with the view that individuals invest cognitive effort in accordance with its relative costs and benefits, reward incentives typically improve performance in tasks that require cognitive effort. At the same time, increasing effort investment may confer larger or smaller performance benefits-i.e., the marginal value of effort-depending on the situation, or context. On this view, we hypothesize that the magnitude of reward-induced effort modulations should depend critically on the marginal value of effort for the given context, and furthermore, the marginal value of effort of a context should be learned over time as a function of direct experience in the context. Using two well-characterized cognitive control tasks and simple computational models, we demonstrate that individuals appear to learn the marginal value of effort for different contexts. In a task-switching paradigm (Experiment 1), we found that participants initially exhibited reward-induced switch cost reductions across contexts-here, task switch rates-but over time learned to only increase effort in contexts with a comparatively larger marginal utility of effort. Similarly, in a Flanker task (Experiment 2), we observed a similar learning effect across contexts defined by the proportion of incongruent trials. Together, these results enrich theories of cost-benefit effort decision-making by highlighting the importance of the (learned) marginal utility of cognitive effort.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The resource-limited nature of cognitive processing prescribes that people should exert cognitive effort only when it is worthwhile-that is, when the costs incurred by expending additional effort are justified by the benefits it may confer <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Hull, 1943;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kool &amp; Botvinick, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Shenhav et al., 2017)</ref>. For example, reward incentives mobilize cognitive processing resources across diverse cognitive control tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bijleveld et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Frömer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hübner &amp; Schlösser, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Padmala &amp; Pessoa, 2011)</ref>, which is thought to result from a cost-benefit tradeoff calculation <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Shenhav et al., 2017)</ref>: increasing the benefits tied to effort exertion offsets the cognitive costs of exerting effort. People also tend to avoid exertion of cognitive effort when given the choice, in line with the idea that mentally demanding behavior is experienced as costly <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kool et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Vogel et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref>, and further buttressing the notion that effort allocation arises from a cost-benefit calculus.</p><p>Less is known, however, about how individuals integrate cost and benefit information in making effort allocation decisions over time. Providing explicit information regarding task demands (i.e., effort costs) and available reward incentives (i.e., benefits) both modulate effort expenditure and alter individuals' 'decisions' to engage in effortful processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Braem, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Krebs et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Vassena et al., 2019)</ref>. One important, but open question concerns whether the marginal benefits of rewarded effort interact with the demand level of the environment. In other words, does an individual's inclination to adjust effort expenditure over time further depend on the context-specific benefits of this effort allocation? Intuitively, efficient allocation of effort should consider the net utility (benefits minus costs) of effort expenditure: in contexts where increasing control allocation is costly, reward incentives should exert less influence on effort outlay than contexts where increasing control allocation is inexpensive.</p><p>Building on this framework, we propose that reward-guided effort allocation should depend on the marginal utility of increasing effort in a particular context-that is, the additional task performance benefits gained from increasing effort allocation-and that the computation of this marginal utility should drive learning of efficient effort allocation, over time. While marginal utility is a foundational idea for understanding how, for example, a decision-maker takes into account their current wealth level in making reward-related choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Li &amp; Hsee, 2021)</ref>, marginal utility may be a critical concept for understanding motivated cognitive control, as it suggests boundary conditions on when reward incentives should be expected to mobilize effortful cognitive processing.</p><p>Learning an efficient effort allocation should require exposure to its marginal utility on the basis of direct experience. This idea is in line with Reinforcement Learning accounts of control allocation, which posit that people learn the expected value of control allocation based on features of the task environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Abrahamse et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bustamante et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chiu &amp; Egner, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Krebs et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Silvetti et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Verguts et al., 2015)</ref>. Extending this line of inquiry, here we consider whether individuals learn to modulate reward-guided effort, over time, in accordance with the marginal utility of effort allocation in different contexts. We investigate the hypothesis that differentially experienced marginal benefits of effort intensification can drive context-specific learning of effort allocation.</p><p>To illustrate the idea of marginal benefit of control allocation, consider the case of taskswitching ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>) for which flexible responding in the face of changes in stimulus-response rules imposes considerable executive control demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Monsell, 2003)</ref>. These task set reconfigurations result in the pervasive 'switch cost,' which are reduced by monetary incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kleinsorge &amp; Rinkenauer, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Sandra &amp; Otto, 2018)</ref>. As in other cognitive control tasks, larger incentives are thought to bring about increases in effort investment, compared to small or no incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Botvinick &amp; Braver, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Shenhav et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>At the same time, the frequency with which task switches occur modulates switch costs -such that more frequent task switches engender smaller switch costs -presumably due to the increased demand for effortful control processes required when switches are rare <ref type="bibr">(Bogdanov et al., in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Dreisbach &amp; Haider, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Liu &amp; Yeung, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Monsell &amp; Mizon, 2006)</ref>. Here, we propose that the marginal benefit of increasing effort allocation depends on context, and specifically, on the default control level, vis-à-vis the task switch rate. Hence, boosting the benefits of additional effort exertion-for example by increasing reward incentives-should lead, over time, to different magnitudes of reward-induced effort modulations in contexts with different default control levels. In contexts with already-high control demand, people should learn that the marginal benefit of additional effort exertion is negligible and over time, as a consequence, reduce reward-induced effort modulations. Conversely, in contexts with a lower default level of control demand, the marginal benefit of increased control allocation in switch trials remains substantial.</p><p>We formalize these predictions by leveraging an established computational model of task-switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Yeung &amp; Monsell, 2003)</ref>. This model allows making ex ante predictions about the relationship between cognitive control (i.e., effort) allocation and task switch costs, depending on the task switch rate. We use this approach to demonstrate, computationally, that enacting switch cost reductions is more effortful under high-demand (i.e. high task switch rate) versus low-demand (i.e. low switch rate) conditions. In doing so we are able to quantify, from first principles, the expected marginal benefit (in terms of task switch cost reductions) of increasing effort allocation under different environment demand levels. In short, Yeung and Monsell's simple response competition model assumes that that a top-down 'control input' signal-whose application is effortful and is modulated by reward incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Liu &amp; Yeung, 2020;</ref>-reduces response interference between tasks. By simulating two different task switch rates, instantiated as task-level priming from the previous trial, the model yields predicted task switch and task repetition RTs as a function of control input <ref type="table">(Figures 1A</ref> and B), and consequently, task switch costs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Yeung and Monsell's (2003)</ref> model of task-switching. (A and B) The relationships between task repetition and task switch RTs as a function of control input for low switch rate (i.e., low-demand) contexts and high switch rate (i.e., high-demand) contexts. (C) Computed task switch costs (task switch minus task repetition RTs) as a function of control input. (D) Change in switch cost with respect to increases in control input for high-and low-switch rate contexts. (E) Predicted Task Switch costs, as a function of reward incentive level, for a model that indiscriminately increases control input with reward level. (F) Predicted Task Switch costs for a model which increases control with reward levels in in accordance with the marginal value of effort in each demand context.</p><p>In this model (see Methods below for simulation details), an important RT pattern emerges, irrespective of control input: a higher task switch probability engenders smaller task switch costs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1A, B</ref>, and C), corroborating previous observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dreisbach &amp; Haider, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Liu &amp; Yeung, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Monsell &amp; Mizon, 2006)</ref>. Of note, the slope of this curve relating control input to switch costs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>) is steeper in the low switch rate context then the high switch rate case, which means that a 25ms switch cost reduction, for example, would require a markedly larger proportional increase in control input under a high switch rate (dark curve) than a low-switch-rate environment (light curve). To better illustrate this point, the marginal decrease (or derivative; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>) in switch costs with respect to increases in control input is more negative in the low, versus high, switch rate context at all values of control input considered.</p><p>Having demonstrated, computationally, that the marginal benefit of additional effort exertion-in terms of switch cost reduction -should be greater in low-demand versus highdemand contexts, we experimentally probe a key question: do people learn, over time, efficient reward-guided control allocation in a task-switching paradigm? (as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). More specifically, does this (learned) efficient allocation reflect both 1) varying reward incentives, and</p><p>2) the differing marginal benefits of increasing effort investment across demand contexts?</p><p>To formalize our ex-ante predictions concerning how reward-induced switch cost modulations might change over time as a function of the (presumably learned) marginal value of effort, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1E</ref> depicts predicted switch costs for a model which applies control input directly in proportion to reward incentives-indiscriminately across demand levels-over and above the default control input determined by the demand level task switch rate. Thus, we predicted that individuals would increase effort in accordance with reward incentives, irrespective of demand level, which would manifest as smaller switch costs in higher-reward conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hall-McMaster et al., 2019;</ref>. Over time, we hypothesize that participants learn that reward-induced effort investment is more beneficial in the low-demand context, by virtue of the larger marginal decrease in switch cost per unit of additional control. We can formalize this idea with a model that modulates control input in accordance with reward incentives, but critically, scales these control input modulations by the marginal value of effort-i.e., the slope of the relationship between control input changes and switch cost changes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>)-for which the high-demand context is roughly one half of the low-demand context. Accordingly, we predicted that we would observe, as an endpoint of learning this marginal value, reward-induced modulations of switch costs only in the to the low-demand context, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1F</ref>.</p><p>To demonstrate the generalizability of this adaptive learning mechanism across diverse cognitive control paradigms, we also examine whether individuals learn this same efficient allocation of control in the classic Eriksen Flanker task <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Eriksen &amp; Eriksen, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Yu et al., 2009)</ref>. Indeed, as it has been observed in variants of this simple conflict task that reward incentives reduce incongruence effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Burton et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hübner &amp; Schlösser, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Yamaguchi &amp; Nishimura, 2019)</ref>, we should also expect to find evidence for learned sensitivity to the marginal value of effort exertion in reward-induced reductions in control of response interference.</p><p>Finally, across both experiments, we examined, in exploratory analyses, whether selfreported individual differences in effort costs, operationalized by the Need for Cognition scale <ref type="bibr">(NFC;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cacioppo et al., 1984</ref>)-a trait measure of an individual's intrinsic motivation to exert cognitive effort-could predict an participants' sensitivity to the marginal value of effort investment. In past work, we have observed that lower-NFC individuals are more inclined to increase cognitive effort investment in accordance with reward incentive, manifesting as larger reward-induced switch cost modulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Sandra &amp; Otto, 2018)</ref>. Taking this result as evidence that perceived effort costs, measured by the NFC, also bear upon cost-benefit effort allocation decisions, we might expect here that low-NFC individuals should also be more sensitive to the marginal benefits of effort investment, compared to high-NFC individuals, for which effort costs might be negligible.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited 104 US participants on Amazon's Mechanical Turk <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Crump et al., 2013)</ref>, who were paid a fixed amount ($3 US) plus a bonus contingent on their task performance, ranging from $1-2. Participants provided informed consent in accordance with the McGill University Research Ethics Board. Following the criteria used in our previous work , we excluded the data of 13 participants who failed to perform either task with an accuracy of at least 75% on task repetitions and 7 participants who missed 10% or more response deadlines on either the preliminary or reward phase of the task, leaving 83 participants in the final analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task-Switching Paradigm</head><p>In a Preliminary phase, participants completed 100 trials of a task-switching paradigm in the absence of incentives to gain familiarity with the task. On each trial of this paradigm, which followed previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Otto &amp; Daw, 2019;</ref>, a colored square appeared on screen and participants needed either to report whether the square was blue or orange (the "COLOR" task) or whether the square's fill was solid or striped (the "PATTERN" task). The position of the square on the screen (lower half versus upper half; counterbalanced across subjects) indicated which task the subject was to perform <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>). Across both tasks, responses were either associated with a left-or right-hand button press (e.g. blue = left, orange = right; solid = left, striped=right), using the 'E' or 'I' buttons on the keyboard. Mappings of stimuli features to keys were counterbalanced across participants. 50 of these preliminary trials had a low task switch probability (10%; meaning that 90% of the trials repeated the previous task, the "Low Difficulty" context) while 50 had a high task switch rate (50%; the "High Difficulty" context). Participants were given 1500ms to respond, at which point they received feedback on screen indicating they made a correct response.</p><p>Following this Preliminary phase, subjects began the Reward phase, where a number at the beginning of each trial signaled the reward available for correct responses (either 1 or 10 cents; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). The difficulty context was indicated by a colored frame around the available reward. In the low (green) and high (red) difficulty contexts, the task switch probabilities were 10% and 50%, respectively. Each difficulty context block was 40 trials long, and consisted of 2 reward 'mini-blocks' composed of 20 trials of either 1-or 10-cent incentives contingent on making a correct response within the response deadline. Thus, each difficulty context contained two levels of reward, pseudo-randomized within difficulty contexts. Participants completed six reward context blocks, whose orders were pseudo-randomized across participants, totaling 240 trials.</p><p>Prior to the main task, participants completed the Need for Cognition (NFC) scale, an 18item questionnaire which measures participants' intrinsic motivation to engage in cognitively demanding activities (e.g., "I prefer complex to simple problems" and "I prefer my life to be filled with puzzles I must solve"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cacioppo et al., 1984)</ref>, as well as the behavioral inhibition system / behavioral activation system scales (BIS/BAS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Carver &amp; White, 1994)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>To ensure that task-switching behavior reflected participants' experienced difficulty context-that is, the high or low task switch rate-our analyses omitted the first 10 trials of each demand block, and, following previous work, excluded outlier trials with RTs greater than 3 standard deviations from each subject's mean RT <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Otto &amp; Daw, 2019</ref>; &lt;1% of trials per participant; note that the key patterns of significance hold without this exclusion applied) and excluded trials following errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Liu &amp; Yeung, 2020</ref>; &lt;10% of trials per participant). We estimated mixed-effects regressions using the lme4 package for the R programming language <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bates &amp; Maechler, 2009)</ref>, taking each mini-block's task switch cost (mean log-transformed correct task switch RT minus the mean log-transformed correct task repetition RT) as the outcome variable, and the demand level (i.e. task switch probability), available reward for that mini-block, task block (representing whether the mini-block occurred in the first or last 120 trials of the experiment) as predictor variables with all possible interactions between these predictors.</p><p>This model specification took all predictor variables as fixed and random effects (see</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplemental Materials for regression equation). Significance tests for each coefficient estimate</head><p>were performed using Satterthwaite's method in the 'lmerTest' package <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kuznetsova et al., 2017</ref>). In the model examining individual differences in NFC, we z-scored these NFC scores across participants before being entered as a predictor variable. In performing post-hoc pairwise comparisons, we corrected for false discovery rate using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Benjamini-Hochberg (1995)</ref> procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational Model of Task-Switching</head><p>We implemented an established model of task switching, described in detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Yeung and Monsell (2003)</ref>, previously used to model the effects of reward incentives ) and task strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Spitzer et al., 2019)</ref> on task switch RT costs. This model assumes that task responses result from competition between the two tasks (here, the 'shape' versus 'pattern' task), each activated in accordance by the default 'strength' of the task as well as possible priming from task activation on the previous trial. Note that this model, as originally described, makes predictions about RTs but not response accuracy per se. In particular, task performed on the previous trial receives additional input via priming-thereby increasing its activation-while the task which was not performed on the previous trial receives zero additional input from priming. As a result, on task switches, competition between the two tasks is heightened-due to task priming-and the consequent activation levels of the two tasks result in slower RTs.</p><p>Importantly, providing additional 'control input'-which increases the activation level of the tobe-completed task, instantiating a form of top-down control-can counteract the task priming responsible for task switching costs.</p><p>On each trial, the net input for a given task i (i.e. shape versus pattern) is determined by a linear combination of four input sources:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">inputi = strengthi + primingi + controli + noise (1)</formula><p>where strengthi corresponds to the strength of the task, primingi corresponds to previous activation (or 'inertia') from the previously-executed task (zero if the task was not executed on the previous trial), controli represents control input (varied parametrically in our simulations), and noise is simply zero-mean Gaussian noise (σ = 0.1). The activation of each task set is computed by the following negatively-accelerated function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">activationi = 1 -exp(-1.5* inputi)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The response generation time is computed by dividing a threshold by the generation rate, calculated as the normalized activation of both tasks:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">generation ratei = activationi / Σactivation (3) generation timei = THRESHOLD / generation ratei (4)</formula><p>The threshold parameter was arbitrarily set to 350. Finally, the model outputs a simulated RT for the task set that first produces a response:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">RT = 150 + generation timei + resolution time (5)</formula><p>where the resolution time is computed by sampling an ex-Gaussian distribution (µ = 150, σ =10</p><p>,τ = 40).</p><p>In the present simulations we instantiate the task switch rate (10% versus 50%) by altering the priming parameter: a low task switch rate corresponds to a larger value of the priming parameter (0.1) more task priming should occur with frequent task repetitions, whereas a high task switch rate is instantiated with a smaller value of the task priming parameter (0.05) because task priming (with respect to the previous trial's task) is less beneficial in the face of less frequent task repetitions. Further, we assume that the strength parameter for the two tasks are equal (0.1) on the basis of similar performance (in both accuracies and RTs) we observe between the shape and pattern tasks (see Overall Task Performance below).</p><p>We simulated 500,000 trials of the model under each of the two demand levels (i.e., task switch rates) for each control input parameter value, ranging from 0.20 to 0.50, and plotted task switch and task repeat RTs as a function of control input ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref> and B for low and highdemand respectively). Task switch costs were then computed as the difference between task switch and task repeat, as a function of control input for each task switch rate ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>).</p><p>Finally, for each demand level, we computed the marginal decrease of task switch costs with respect to control input by taking the backward difference of switch costs (with control input ∆ = 0.04) yielding an approximate derivative of switch costs with respect to control input ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure   1D</ref>),</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incentivized Model Simulations</head><p>We simulated the effect of trial-level reward incentives on task switch costs in Experiment 1 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1E</ref> and F), which we operationalized as an increase in control input over and above a 'default' control level associated with the demand context, following our previous work :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">'()*+,*,.+/0.1 = '()*+,* + ( * _ ) * 0.05</formula><p>We set the default level of control for each demand context, controlcontext, to 0.05 and 0.25 in the low-and high-demand contexts respectively. Our simulations assumed that initially, the model naively and indiscriminately applies control as a function of reward level across the two demand contexts, which is instantiated by a setting marginal_value to 0.5 in both reward contexts, yielding the patterns of reward-induced switch cost reductions seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1E</ref>. We assume that when the differing marginal values of effort for the two demand contexts have been learned ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>), reward-induced control in the high-demand context is scaled by a factor of one half, mirroring the ratio of the average slopes of the value function relating control input to switch costs in the high-versus low-demand contexts. Accordingly, the end-of-learning model assumes that the marginal_value takes a value of 0.5 in the low-demand context and 0.25 in the highdemand context, resulting in the pattern of switch cost reductions depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1F</ref>. In all cases the resultant control input is scaled by a constant (0.05) to ensure input is provided in units appropriate for the task-switching model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reward Incentives and Switch Costs</head><p>We next examined, over time, how reward incentives modulated switch costs in two demand levels. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> depicts Task switch costs as a function of demand level (low versus high), reward incentive (1 cent versus 10 cents), and trial block (first half versus second half, depicted in panels A and B respectively). While it is apparent that switch costs were smaller overall with larger incentive-consistent with previously observed reward-induced switch cost reductions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fröber &amp; Dreisbach, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kleinsorge &amp; Rinkenauer, 2012;</ref>)-the effect of incentives in each of the two demand levels changed over time. In the first half of the experiment, reward incentives reduced switch costs both in high-and low-demand blocks, suggesting that initially, participants were willing to increase control allocation in accordance with rewards regardless of the cost of increasing control-that is, even if marginal increases in effort have lower net benefit in high-demand blocks. However, in the second half of the experiment, reward incentives reduced switch costs only in low-demand blocks, where marginal increases in effort expenditure carry greater net benefit, but not in high-demand blocks,</p><p>where marginal increases in effort expenditure carry a smaller benefit. Task switch costs in Experiment 1, expressed as the difference between median task switch RTs and task repetition RTs, as a function of available reward and demand context (i.e,, low versus high task switch rate), and trial block (First versus Second half, depicted in Panels A and B respectively). Initially, participants exhibit rewardinduced switch cost reductions in both demand contexts, but after learning, reward-induced switch cost reductions are only apparent in the low-demand context.</p><p>Statistically, in a mixed-effects model examining switch costs as a function of reward, demand level, and trial block (see full coefficient estimates in <ref type="table">Table 2)</ref>, we observed a significant interaction between reward, demand level, and trial block upon switch costs (β=0.1634, SE=0.0589, p=0.006), indicating that the observed reward-induced switch cost reductions jointly depended on demand level and trial block. We also observed a negative but nonsignificant main effect of reward (β=-0.0227, SE=0.0326, p=0.441), suggesting that this reward incentive did not uniformly operate over both demand levels and over time. Further supporting this observation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A B</head><p>that these switch cost modulations were time-dependent, we did not find a significant two-way interaction between reward incentives and demand level (β=-0.0363, SE=0.0411, p=0.378).</p><p>We further probed the specificity of the three-way interaction between reward incentive level, demand context, and trial block in a series of post-hoc, pairwise tests. In the first half of the experiment, we observed that reward incentive level exerted a significant effect of reward incentive level in the high-demand context (t =2.596, p=0.0415; all tests corrected for false discovery rate) but not in the low-demand context (t=1.2728, p=0.274). In the second half, we observed a marginally significant effect of reward incentive level in the low-demand context (t=2.050, p=0.0870) but no significant effect in the high-demand context (t=0.0525, p=0.9581).</p><p>Together, these comparisons suggest that participants initially exhibited reward-induced control modulation in the high-demand condition, but later, these reward-induced control modulations were only apparent in the low-demand condition.</p><p>We also probed whether participants' diminishing sensitivity to incentive levels in the high-demand condition resulted in lower overall levels of reward receipt, rather than merely modulating the extent reward-guided effort allocation between reward amounts. As reward incentives were tied to correct responses, we could probe this question by analyzing trial accuracy on high-demand blocks as a function of trial block (early versus late), finding no significant effect of trial block upon accuracy on high-demand blocks (β= 0.0430, SE=0.0558, p= 0.441). This lack of a trial block effect suggests against the possibility that the abovementioned changes in strategy reflected decreased overall performance (and reward receipt) in the high-demand condition, but rather, indicates that people learned to exert less (costly) effort without losing reward, in accordance with our learned marginal benefit of effort hypothesis.</p><p>Finally, we probed whether fatigue-manifesting as a general slowing effect as a function of time on task <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Lorist et al., 2005</ref>)-might explain the abolition of a reward effect in the highdemand context over time. However, we observed no apparent effect of trial number upon highdemand RTs, controlling for task switches (main effect of trial number: β= -0.0142, SE=0. <ref type="bibr">0134, p=0.295</ref>; interaction between trial number and trial type: β= 0.0073, SE= 0.006, p=0.268),</p><p>suggesting against the possibility of a fatigue effect selective to the high-demand context. We also found no evidence for more general fatigue effects (see Supplemental Material).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Differences in Need for Cognition (NFC) and Reward Sensitivity (BAS)</head><p>We also examined, in exploratory analyses, how the dynamics of reward-induced switch cost modulations differed as a function of individual participants' NFC scores (M=62.03, SD=</p><p>17.90). While we intuited that low-and high-NFC participants might be differentially sensitive to the marginal value of effort, we did not have strong predictions about the locus of the possible predictive NFC effect vis-à-vis main effects or interactions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> depicts the same analysis as above, separately considering low-NFC and high-NFC participants (defined by a median split).</p><p>Interestingly, we found that these time-dependent changes in reward-induced switch cost modulations were especially pronounced in low-NFC individuals ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A and B)</ref>. By contrast, high-NFC participants, particularly on later trials, exhibited switch cost reductions in accordance with reward levels in both demand levels. Statistically, this observation was supported by a significant four-way interaction between NFC (taken continuously), reward, demand level, and trial block (β= -0.1266, SE=0.0539, p=0.033; see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> for full coefficient estimates), indicating that the observed group-level interaction between demand level, reward, and trial block was moderated by participants' individual NFC levels. Using the same regression approach, we did not observe that reward responsiveness, as measured by the BAS subscale, exerted any predictive effect on reward-induced switch cost reductions overall, and as a function of demand level, trial block, or their interactions (all interactions ps &gt; 0.381). In summary, and dovetailing with previous observations that high-NFC individuals tend to exert more effort overall <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Sandra &amp; Otto, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref>, this pattern of learned effort allocation suggests that high-NFC individuals may be less inclined to optimize efficiency of effort allocation. Experiment 2 examined the generality of this learning effect to a wholly different cognitive control paradigm: the arrow Flanker task <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Eriksen &amp; Eriksen, 1974)</ref>. On each trial of the task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5)</ref>, participants indicate the direction of a central target stimulus <ref type="bibr">(&lt; or &gt;)</ref> presented between either congruent (&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;) or incongruent (&gt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&gt;) 'flankers'. Typically, responses are slower on incongruent trials as compared to congruent trials, which we term the Flanker incongruence effect. Importantly, past studies have observed modulations of the Flanker incongruence effect observed in accordance with the proportions of incongruent stimuli, typically manipulated in a blockwise fashion: the incongruence effect is reduced in contexts with a larger proportion of incongruent trials (e.g. 75% incongruent trials) compared to contexts with a smaller proportion of incongruent trials (e.g. 25% incongruent trials), which has been attributed to strategic modulations of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Gratton et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Yu et al., 2009)</ref> or contingency learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Braem et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Schmidt, 2019</ref>).  Following the results of the demand level (i.e., task switch rate) manipulation in Experiment 1, we intuited that the marginal benefit of increased control allocation-manifesting as reductions in incongruence costs under large incentive amounts-would also differ across demand contexts, as defined by the proportion of incongruent trials. To illustrate the marginal utility of effort allocation across these two demand contexts, we modified the task-switching model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Yeung and Monsell (2003)</ref>, which in its original formulation predicts that Flanker-like incongruence effects arise from 'task sets' of unequal strength (see Methods below for details).</p><p>Our modified Flanker model predicts smaller incongruence costs in contexts with larger proportions of incongruent trials ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6A</ref>). These incongruence costs decrease in both the 50% and 80% incongruence contexts with increasing control input, but importantly, at different rates. Echoing the task-switching model simulations, the marginal utility of increasing control allocation, which can be seen as the rate of decrease of incongruence costs with respect to control input ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6B)</ref> is consistently larger (i.e., more negative) in the 50% (low-demand) context than in the 80% (high-demand) context. On the basis of the differing marginal utility of effort investment across demand contexts, we reasoned that in the 50% incongruent trial context, participants would consistently modulate their control allocation in accordance with reward incentives. However, in the 80% incongruent condition, we would expect-as in Experiment 1-that participants would learn the negligible marginal value of effort investment, and would accordingly, cease to modulate effort in accordance with incentives over time. As in Experiment 1, we formalized these learning predictions with two different models. First, we simulated a 'naïve' model that allocates control input directly in proportion to reward incentives ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6C</ref>) irrespective of demand context.</p><p>Then, we considered a model that has learned the differing marginal value of effort for each context ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6B</ref>), which scales these control input increases by the marginal value of effort for each context, yielding the predicted pattern of incongruence costs in depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6D</ref>.</p></div>

Prior to the Flanker task, participants completed the NFC and BIS/BAS questionnaires.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flanker Task</head><p>Participants performed a standard version of the Flanker task ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>) in which they were required to identify the directionality of a central target (&lt; or &gt;) presented between four congruent or incongruent flankers on either side of the stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Eriksen &amp; Eriksen, 1974)</ref> and the stimulus remained on the screen until the participant responded or 1000ms had elapsed. The timing and presentation of feedback for both the preliminary and reward phase of the task mirrored Experiment 1. In a preliminary (no reward) phase, participants first completed 50 low- <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We should note this sample was collected during the global coronavirus pandemic (November 2020), which has been characterized previously as a less attentive AMT participant population then previous AMT samples <ref type="bibr">(Arechar &amp; Rand, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>demand trials (50% proportion incongruent) and 50 high-demand trials (80% proportion incongruent) to familiarize participants with the Flanker task and each demand level. The order of these demand levels was counterbalanced across participants. On all trials, the demand level context was signaled by a colored border (green versus red, signaling low and high-demand respectively).</p><p>Following the preliminary phase, subjects began the reward phase, where, following Experiment 1, a number at the beginning of each trial signaled the reward available (1 or 10 cents) for making a correct response. Each demand level block was 20 trials long, comprised of 2 reward mini-blocks of 10 trials of 1-or 10-cent incentives. Participants completed 12 reward context blocks, whose orders were pseudo-randomized across participants, totaling 240 trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Following Experiment 1, we omitted the first 5 trials of each demand block to ensure that Flanker behavior reflected the demand level of the current context and excluded outlier trials with RTs greater than 3 standard deviations (note that the exclusion of these outlier RTs does not affect the key patterns of significance described below). Our mixed-effects regression approach mirrored that of Experiment 1, but took each mini-block's incongruence costs-computed as the mean log-transformed correct incongruent RT minus the mean log-transformed correct congruent RT)-as the outcome variable. We took all predictor variables as fixed and random effects (see</p></div>

To do this, we assume that each Flanker trial involves two (possibly) competing "tasks"-identify the directionality of the Flanker stimuli versus identify the directionality of the center stimulus-and that Flanker stimuli exert more influence over responses than the central stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Yu et al., 2009)</ref>. Specifically, we assume that the 'Flanker' task and 'Center' task have respective strength parameters of 0.6 and 0.2. We further assume that control input is only applied to the 'center' task, and accordingly, the 'Flanker' task receives zero control input on every trial.</p><p>In line with the literature on congruency sequence effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Gratton et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Braem et al., 2019)</ref>, we assume trial-by-trial priming effects apply that depend on the congruency status of the previous trial. Namely, we assume that both the 'center' and 'flanker' tasks were primed when the previous trial was congruent (as both led to the correct response), and that task priming only takes effect for the 'center' task (but not the 'flanker' task) when the previous trial type was incongruent, to simulate the idea that people focus more on the relevant dimension following incongruent trials (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Botvinick et al., 2001)</ref> or carry-over control settings from the previous trial more generally (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Braem et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Egner, 2014)</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr">Yeung and Monsell's</ref> original model, the resolution time (in Equation 5 above) is governed by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">resolution time = r + f[ r -(generation timej -generation timei) ]<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where r was sampled from an ex-Gaussian distribution (µ = 150, σ =10 ,τ = 40) and f is a function that dictates whether the difference in generation time between the two tasks causes interference or facilitation. Following Yeung and Monsell, f takes a value of 0.5 for incongruent stimuli and 0 for congruent stimuli.</p><p>We simulated 500,000 trials under each demand level (50% versus 80% proportion incongruent), at control input parameter values ranging from 0.05 to 0.20. The task priming and threshold parameters were set arbitrarily to 0.4, and 300, respectively. The Flanker incongruence effect was the computed as the difference between incongruent and congruent RTs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6A</ref>).</p><p>As in the task-switching model, we also computed an approximate derivative of incongruence effects with respect to control input ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6B</ref>) via backward differencing. We applied the same procedure as described above to simulate the effect of reward incentives in the Flanker task model, initially setting marginal_value to 0.1 in both reward contexts ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6C</ref>) and after learning, setting marginal_value to 0.1 and 0.025 in the low-and high-demand contexts respectively (mirroring the approximate ratio of the slopes of the incongruence costs in depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6B</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Task Performance</head><p>We observed significant incongruence effects in the Flanker task-expressed as longer</p><p>RTs on incongruent versus congruent RTs-in low-demand (50% congruent) blocks (mixedeffects regression on RTs: incongruence effect β = 0.0843, SE= 0.00488, p&lt; 0.0001) and in highdemand blocks (80% incongruent; β = 0.0729, SE= 0.005247, p &lt; 0.0001; see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). Jointly examining the effects of trial type (congruent versus incongruent) and proportion incongruence upon RTs, we observed a significant interaction between proportion of incongruent trials and trial type (congruent versus incongruent), indicating that incongruence costs were significantly smaller in the 20% congruent (high-demand) condition (β =-0.0113, SE=0.00482, p=0.0225), but no significant main effect of proportion congruence (β = 0.003535, SE= 0.00399, p = 0.379).</p><p>Examining accuracy, we observed incongruent trials were significantly less accurate in the low-demand condition (mixed-effects logistic regression on accuracy: incongruence effect β=-3. <ref type="bibr">498,</ref><ref type="bibr">SE=1.442,</ref><ref type="bibr">p=0.0153)</ref> and in the high-demand condition <ref type="bibr">(β= -0.6439, SE=0.2311, p=0.00534</ref>; see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). We did not observe a significant effect of proportion congruence (main effect β=0.3304, p= 0.2393, p= 0.167) nor a significant modulation of incongruence costs by proportion incongruent trials <ref type="bibr">(interaction β= -0.3332, SE=0.2369, p=0.160)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reward Incentives and Incongruence Effects</head><p>We then examined Flanker incongruence costs (incongruent -congruent correct RTs) as a function of demand level (low versus high), reward incentive (1 cent versus 10 cents), and trial block (first half versus second half). In the early blocks of the experiment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7A</ref>), reward incentive level appeared to decrease Flanker effects only in the high-demand (80% incongruent)</p><p>context, but in later blocks ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7B</ref>), the locus of reward incentive effects shifted from the high-demand to the low-demand (50% incongruent) context. This timecourse of reward-induced Flanker effect modulations is consistent with the notion that participants shifted the locus of reward-guided control to contexts with the largest marginal benefit for in control allocation-in other words, from the high-demand condition (small marginal benefit) to the low-demand condition (large marginal benefit). We estimated a mixed-effects regression examining incongruence costs as a function of reward, demand level, and trial block (early versus late; see fixed-effect coefficient estimates in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>), finding an interaction between reward and demand level (β= -0.0427, SE=0.0128, p=.001), an interaction between demand level and trial block <ref type="bibr">SE=0.0128,</ref><ref type="bibr">p=0.006)</ref> and, critically, a significant three-way interaction between reward, demand level, and trial block (β= 0.0701, SE=0.018, p=0.0001). That is, in accordance with a learning account, the relationship between reward incentive and demand level depended on trial block. We further probed this interaction with post-hoc pairwise tests, we found that in the first half of the experiment, reward incentive level significantly decreased incongruence costs in the highdemand (t=3.40257, p=0.0035; all tests corrected) but not the low-demand context (t=0.29873, p=0.7656). In the second half, we found that reward incentive level significantly decreased</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">A B</formula><p>incongruence costs in the low-demand context (t=2.272, p=0.0494) but not in the high-demand</p><p>context <ref type="bibr">(t=-0.7015, p=0.645)</ref>. Mirroring the pattern of results in Experiment 1, these comparisons suggest that reward incentives initially influenced control allocation in the highdemand context, but later, the locus of these incentive effects shifted to the low-demand context.</p><p>As in Experiment 1, we also probed whether the apparent withdrawal of effort in the high-demand condition resulted in lower overall levels of reward receipt. To do this, we analyzed trial accuracy on high-demand blocks as a function of trial block (early versus late), and found no significant effect of trial block upon accuracy on high-demand blocks (β=-0.1085,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SE=0</head><p>.1418, p= 0.444). Again, the absence of trial block effect in the high-demand condition indicates that effort modulations became less sensitive to varying incentives levels over time, rather than a general decrease over time in overall performance. Finally, examining the possibility of a fatigue explanation for the time-dependent disappearance of a reward effect in the high-demand condition, we probed whether RTs slowed over time in the high-demand context, finding little support for a slowing effect (effect of trial number: β= -0.002317, SE= 0.004, p=0.1598; interaction between trial number and trial type β= -0.005250, SE=0.00375, p=0.167).</p><p>We also found no evidence for more general fatigue effects (see Supplemental Material).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Differences in Need for Cognition (NFC) and Reward Sensitivity (BAS)</head><p>Finally, following the exploratory analyses in Experiment 1, we probed whether individual differences in NFC moderated the learning effects observed in the Flanker task.</p><p>Adding individual NFC scores to the incongruence cost predicting model reported above, we observed no significant interactions between NFC and reward level, demand level, trial block, and the possible interactions between these variables (ps &gt; 0.355; see <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> for full coefficients). The lack of predictive effect of NFC suggests that, unlike in task-switching, individual differences in intrinsic motivation to exert cognitive effort did not exert any predictive bearing on reward-guided control (and its learning) allocation in the Flanker task. Similarly, we did not observe any interactions between BAS reward responsivity and reward effects on incongruence costs, or between reward responsivity, demand level, and trial block (all interactions ps &gt; 0.228). Put another way, our observed learning effects in the Flanker task were similar for both low-and high-NFC individuals, possibly owing to the considerably different structure of the Flanker task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The notion that reward incentives can mobilize cognitive processing resources has been influential and finds broad empirical support <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kool &amp; Botvinick, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015</ref>). Up to now, investigations of cost-benefit effort decision-making have typically treated costs and benefits as factors that exert a time-invariant influence on effort allocation decisions: a given reward incentive level will evoke the same change in effort allocation at different times.</p><p>Here we considered the possibility that people learn the marginal utility of allocating additional cognitive effort-that is, the benefit of increasing control allocation in accordance with incentives-over time.</p><p>Across two different cognitive control paradigms, we examined how reward-induced effort modulations vary over time across contexts with different marginal utilities of effort investment. We found compelling evidence that people learn to efficiently allocate effort in accordance with both the incentives and the context-dependent, marginal utility of increasing effort allocation, illustrated by simulations of a simple computational model ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 2D and   6B</ref>). In task-switching (Experiment 1), participants initially exhibited reward-induced effort increases in both high-and low-switch rate contexts-as evidenced by decreases in task switch costs-but over time ceased to modulate effort investment in the high switch rate context.</p><p>Similarly, we examined the same apparent learning in the Flanker task (Experiment 2), by manipulating demand contexts by altering the proportion of incongruent trials. We found that participants learned to increase effort investment in low-demand contexts where increasing control allocation results in appreciable reductions of incongruence costs, and at the same time, ceased investing effort in accordance with incentives in the high-demand contexts, where increasing control allocation results in appreciable reductions of incongruence costs.</p><p>These results highlight the importance of marginal utility calculation in cost-benefit decision-making about cognitive effort allocation. Further, they speak to influential accounts of motivation, explaining the relationship between task demand and effort investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brehm &amp; Self, 1989)</ref>. The classic Motivational Intensity Theory (MIT) postulates that individuals invest effort only when it yields a tangible benefit, withdrawing resources when this is not the case.</p><p>This basic tenet is fully in line with our results. Second, MIT postulates then when difficulty is unknown, effort investment fully depends on "success importance" (i.e. the influence of reward incentive in the case of our task). This is in line with participants' initial behavior (where switchcost reduction is overall driven by reward), and with the idea that after learning of the marginal benefit, effort investment changes (resources are withdrawn when not worth it). While MIT theory's predictions by and large concern physiological markers of effort exertion (e.g. An important question concerns the sort of learning underlying the changes in effortful behavior observed here-that is, what aspect(s) of the task environment are participants learning in order to produce the apparent changes in reward-induced control allocation between early and late blocks of the experiments? One possibility is that the notion of the marginal value of effort is a general principle (or rule of thumb) that humans and animals abide by, to varying extents <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hsee et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Reinagel, 2021)</ref>, in making real-world effort allocation decisions, but in each task domain, the relationship governing effort increases and performance benefits is learned experientially. Accordingly, we believe the learned insensitivity of control allocation levels to reward incentives (in accordance with demand level) observed here reflects participants' application of this general principle to the specific task domains and operationalizations of demand examined here, which requires that participants have had enough experience to learn the appropriate effort-performance relationships in different demand contexts. On this view, individuals are capable of adjusting effort expenditure in accordance with its marginal utility, but we would only expect to observe that participants tune reward-induced effort increases in accordance with demand context after having learned the specific effort-performance relationship for each demand context in our experiments. Future research should endeavor to understand 1) the extent to which peoples' understanding and application of marginal value of effort is a general phenomenon divorced from specific task domains, and 2) how and when an individual's learning (and application) of this general principle unfolds over the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Insel et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Rodman et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Beyond learning an efficient demand level-and reward-guided effort allocation strategy, we also observed that participants' task switch costs were smaller in high-switch rate (i.e. highdemand) contexts and their Flanker incongruence costs were smaller in contexts with a high proportion of incongruent stimuli, suggesting that participants adjusted their levels of control in accordance with the environmental demand level. These shifts in control allocation mirror previous findings in task-switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Liu &amp; Yeung, 2020)</ref> and Flanker <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aben et al., 2017)</ref> paradigms. A tacit assumption in these lines of work is that participants must somehow learn to adapt control allocation to the environmental demand level-irrespective of reward incentivesover time. Indeed, we found varying degrees of evidence for this sort of learning in the two experiments, vis-à-vis interactions between trial block and switch/incongruence costs <ref type="table">(Tables 2   and 5</ref>). We presume that these presumably strategic shifts in reward-induced effort allocation are operating over and above these more general shifts in control mode prompted by environment demand level (and the regression modeling approach we take supports that interpretation).</p><p>Nonetheless, as little previous work has addressed how individuals learn this sort of control allocation strategy, understanding the nature of learning of these broader control adaptations would also be a fruitful avenue for future research.</p><p>Another key question concerns how the brain computes and represents the marginal utility of effort, and furthermore, how this is used to modulate attention and decision-making.</p><p>One proposed neuro-computational model, the Reinforcement Meta Learner <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Silvetti et al., 2018)</ref> suggests that cognitive control optimization results from the interplay between mesolimbic dopamine (coding for effort costs and reward-related information), norepinephrine (implementing control) and the medial prefrontal cortex (operating performance monitoring and deciding control signal intensity). This cortical-subcortical circuit directs cognitive control allocation by minimizing the cost of control, maximizing reward, and weighting the controldependent performance improvement-i.e. the marginal utility of effort. From this perspective, cognitive control allocation is boosted only when its resultant performance improvements overcome its intrinsic cost. Marginal utility computation is thus part of an optimization process in which the brain learns to efficiently allocate control, which in turn, influences reward-based decision-making (meta-learning). Similarly, our experimental result suggests refinements to other reinforcement-learning based accounts of effort allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Holroyd &amp; McClure, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lieder et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Shenhav et al., 2017)</ref> to incorporate, over and above the value of effort exertion, peoples' apparent sensitivity to the (presumably learned) relationship between changes in effort investment and changes in performance.</p><p>It is also worth noting that in high-demand conditions in the second half of both experiments, participants did not appear to modulate their control levels in accordance with the incentive levels available. In our account, this lack of differentiation between reward levels is a result of learning that exerting additional effort to either reduce switch costs (in Experiment 1) or</p><p>Flanker incongruence costs (in Experiment 2) confers little performance benefits in high-demand conditions. Indeed, inspecting the high-demand condition in Experiment 1, we observed that high-incentive (10 cent) switch costs actually increased over time-resembling the low-incentive switch costs observed in the first half of the experiment-suggesting that participants simply ceased to intensify their control levels in accordance with incentives. However, in Experiment 2, we observed a different pattern of control modulation in the high-demand condition: participants began to up-regulate their control on low-incentive conditions, such that the low-and highincentive incongruence costs both began to resemble the high-incentive incongruence costs observed early in the experiment. It is possible that here that the lack of apparent differentiation between these incentive levels resulted from participants intensifying their control levels in the high-demand context over time, irrespective of incentive levels (resulting in lower incongruence costs across both incentive levels) rather than learning to withholding additional control in the high-incentive condition, possibly because maintaining a high level of control with in a demand context is less effortful than continually re-allocating control on a trial-by-trial basis. At the same time, Flanker-like effects-unlike task switch costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Rogers &amp; Monsell, 1995)</ref>-have been observed to decrease incrementally over time with repeated task exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kelley &amp; Yantis, 2009)</ref> suggesting that these changes in control modulations could be operating over and above decreases in 'baseline' incongruence costs in the Flanker task. Future work should aim to address 1) the generality of these observed effects across task domains and 2) the possibility that individuals might find effortful-and consequently, avoid-frequent reallocation of cognitive control in response to changing incentives levels in favor of maintaining a steady control level.</p><p>We also found, in Experiment 1, that individuals low in Need for Cognition (NFC)-who have little intrinsic motivation to expend cognitive effort-appeared to be more sensitive to the marginal utility of effort investment. In other words, the learning effects we observed with respect to reward-modulated switch cost reductions appeared strongest in low-NFC individuals.</p><p>We previously found that NFC predicts the extent to which individuals exhibit reward-modulated task switch cost reductions <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Sandra &amp; Otto, 2018)</ref>. The present result adds nuance to the idea that subjective effort costs (operationalized by low NFC levels) not only bear upon benefit sensitivity, but sensitivity to the marginal utility of effort investment. Curiously, we did not observe this predictive effect in the Flanker task (Experiment 2), which was considerably easier (see overall task performance in <ref type="table">Table 1 versus Table 4</ref>). This could suggest that NFC might only exhibit predictive bearing on effort outlay (or changes in effort outlay) in sufficiently difficult tasks. Supporting this idea, a recent study found no evidence for a relationship between NFC levels and Flanker effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Gärtner et al., 2021)</ref>. At the same time, it is possible that the  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>), it might be the case that low-versus high-NFC individuals employ higher default control levels. Future work could leverage physiological measures like pupillometry to elucidate both default levels, and rewardinduced changes in effort allocation <ref type="bibr">(van der Wel &amp; Steenbergen, 2018)</ref>. To this point, we have also found suggestive evidence that the relationship between task-evoked pupillary responses and task switch costs is stronger in low-NFC individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(da Silva Castanheira et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, our results also dovetail with the recent observation that the efficacy of cognitive effort-the environmental contingency between performance and reward receipt, holding demand constant-is a critical determinant of individuals reward-induced effort investment in a Stroop-like task <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Frömer et al., 2021)</ref>. When efficacy, which was explicitly signaled to participants before each trial, was high, participants were more inclined to invest effort in the task in accordance with varying incentive level (as evidenced by faster and more accurate responses) compared to when efficacy was low. In contrast to this design, the present experiments did not instruct participants about the marginal utility of effort expenditure, but nonetheless, both our results and Frömer et al.'s result suggest that participants appeared to find efficient reward-guided effort allocation strategies.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the task switch rate manipulation in Experiment 1-used to define demand contexts-simultaneously alters both the control demands of task-switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Mayr et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Monsell &amp; Mizon, 2006)</ref> and the trial-to-trial predictability of the subtask.</p><p>That is, the 50% (versus 10%) switch rate in the high-demand condition is more difficult not only because participants need to maintain flexible control in the face of increased task switches, but also the task to be completed in each trial is less predictable. While recent studies find that individuals both avoid roughly equiprobable task switch rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Sayalı &amp; Badre, 2019)</ref> and experience them as more demanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Devine &amp; Otto, 2021)</ref>, the present design does not allow us to disentangle the joint contributions of control demands and unpredictability to the increased demand level of the high-demand context. Nonetheless, our overarching hypotheses about flexible, reward-guided allocation of control over time concern experienced demand levels associated with different contexts but are agnostic to specific source(s) of the demand level differences, but rather, presupposes only that one context need be more difficult than another. An open question, then, concerns the relative contributions of control demands and task unpredictability to cost-benefit effort decision-making.</p><p>Another plausible alternative explanation for the pattern of results observed in Experiment 2 (the Flanker task) could be that participants did not adjust "control parameters" over time, but rather the extent to which they chose to rely on learned contingencies between task features and responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Schmidt, 2019)</ref>. For example, in the high-demand (80% incongruent) context of the Flanker task, the flanking arrows were predictive of the response (i.e., with 80% accuracy). Accordingly, participants may exhibit smaller incongruence costs in the high-demand context not because they allocate more control, but simply because they benefited more from the mostly-predictive Flanker feature-that is, they learned that they can simply make the opposite response as indicated by the visually-dominating flanker arrows. By the same token, in the high-demand context, participants were also more likely to experience incongruent stimuli and benefit from exact trial repetitions. However, while these (arguably) low-level forms of learning have been demonstrated to contribute substantially to the modulation of congruence effects by proportion congruence in Flanker and Flanker-like tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Braem et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Schmidt, 2019)</ref>, it is unclear why such contingency learning effects would further interact with reward and experiment half in the manner we observed here. Supporting the differential demand interpretation of the two Flanker task contexts examined here, a body of literature suggest that individuals rate Flanker-like tasks with higher proportions of incongruent trials as more demanding than settings with smaller proportions of incongruent trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Desender et al., 2017)</ref>, and prefer to avoid these contexts if given the choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Schouppe et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Nonetheless, useful follow-up experiments would be to investigate whether these learning effects are observed using paradigms with equal opportunities for contingency learning across both demand conditions (e.g., 20% incongruent versus 80% incongruent), or paradigms without opportunities for contingency learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Braem et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Schmidt, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>It is also worth pointing out that that in these two experiments, participants were incentivized to make accurate responses (within a certain response deadline) but we operationalized exertion of cognitive effort using RT-based measures. We should note here that a number of studies examining motivated cognitive control also index control/effort allocation using RT-based measures but, importantly, tie reward incentives-cued before each trial or block of the to-be-completed task-to response accuracy. For example, past studies by other groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Braem et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Capa et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Umemoto &amp; Holroyd, 2015)</ref> and our own group <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(da Silva Castanheira et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Vassena et al., 2019)</ref> repeatedly finds that even when reward incentives are tied solely to response accuracy, these incentives shape RTs in demanding cognitive tasks. In our view, this body of work suggests that individuals engage in some form of effort-reward calculus even when reward outcomes are not necessarily tied to the performance consequences of these effort modulations. One possible interpretation of these ubiquitous RT incentive effects is that in many of these studies (including the present experiments) participants must nonetheless expend effort to ensure their responses are fast enough to meet RT deadlines (1500ms and 1000ms in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively), in order to obtain the offered reward amount. On this view, large incentives justify response speeding while at the same time, engaging in such speeding under smaller incentives would constitute an unjustified, over-exertion of control. At the same time, speeding (or, alternatively, invigoration of responses) while either maintaining or improving accuracy is often interpreted as a signature of effort investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hübner &amp; Schlösser, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Manohar et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Otto &amp; Daw, 2019</ref>).</p><p>Finally, it is worth noting that the demand contexts were explicitly signaled with border colors (and minimal instructions) in both experiments <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figures 1 and 5</ref>), which we believe was necessary here for participants to cumulatively learn the demand contexts over blocks and, accordingly, the marginal utility of effort. It remains an open question whether participants would be able to learn the demand context without explicit cues and evidence the type of learning exhibited in the two experiments reported here. On the basis of prior Flanker work finding evidence for implicit learning of control requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ghinescu et al., 2010</ref>) -i.e., without any instructions describing the relationship between cues signaling proportion of incongruent trials-we might expect that the learning effects observed here might also be possible in environments without clear cues signaling demand contexts.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Simulated task switch costs resulting from</figDesc></figure>
