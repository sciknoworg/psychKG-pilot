			<abstract>
				<p>Everyday decision-making often involves choosing between multiple alternatives, and establishing unified theories for this process would benefit broad disciplines of behavioral science. A key challenge lies in explaining behavioral irrationalities that specifically arise in multi-alternative decisions. This study, based on pre-registered procedures, investigated such non-normative behaviors in a three-choice dot numerosity discrimination task. We systematically manipulated the value of the lowest-numerosity alternative (the dud stimulus) and quantified its non-normative effects on choice, response time, and confidence. We then explained observed irrational behaviors with a sequential evidence accumulation model featuring a &quot;max vs. next&quot; decision algorithm. This pseudo-optimal decision-making rule naturally captured a well-known non-normative choice pattern: the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives. Our model also explained a multi-choice metacognitive bias, known as the dud-alternative confidence boost, by considering evidence accumulation dynamics right after stimulus presentation. By uncovering the computational processes behind these non-normative multi-choice behaviors, this study represents a significant advancement in understanding the core principles of decision-making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Public Significance Statements</head><p>• This study presents an evidence accumulation model that generates testable predictions for multi-alternative decision-making, applicable across diverse cognitive domains.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pseudo-Optimal Evidence Accumulation as a Foundation for Multi-Choice Irrationalities</head><p>A principled understanding of human decision-making is a central issue in behavioral science, with implications for statistics, economics, cognitive psychology, and computational neuroscience <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bogacz et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Green &amp; Swets, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Luce, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Savage, 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Tajima et al., 2019)</ref>. One major challenge, however, is that human decision behavior often cannot be described by simple statistical norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hoven et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kellen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Miyoshi et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rahnev &amp; Denison, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Zheng et al., 2022)</ref>. This is particularly evident in multi-choice scenarios (i.e., choice among three or more options), and finding the roots of such non-normative behavior is considered a crucial step toward elucidating the fundamental laws of decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Charman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Furl, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Louie et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Windschitl &amp; Chambers, 2004)</ref>. To advance this goal, this study presents mathematical modeling of non-normative threechoice behaviors, considering choice proportion, response time (RT), and decision confidence.</p><p>This study revolves around two critical phenomena within the relevant disciplines. The first is the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) axiom (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Luce, 1959)</ref>. Typically, this phenomenon manifests as a change in the relative choice proportion between the first alternative (target stimulus with the greatest intensity) and the second alternative (distractor stimulus with the second greatest intensity) with varying intensities of the third alternative (dud stimulus with the lowest intensity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Furl, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Louie et al., 2013)</ref>. This observation challenges broad decision-making models operating on the ratio-of-strength principle (e.g., the softmax transformation as a notable implementation of this principle) and is considered a pivotal topic in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dagsvik, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Furl, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gluth, Kern, Kortmann, et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Louie et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>However, previous studies reporting the IIA violation have produced mixed results on whether the target vs. distractor choice proportion increases or decreases with respect to the third alternative's intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cox &amp; Kable, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Furl, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gluth et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gluth, Kern, Kortmann, et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Holper et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Louie et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rustichini et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Webb et al., 2020)</ref>. One potential reason for this inconsistency is that these studies predominantly focused on value-based decision-making, where stimulus intensity is defined through participants' subjective rating or bidding. These measures themselves are outcomes of subjective decision process and are prone to random internal fluctuations. Therefore, the present study scrutinized the IIA violation in three-alternative dot numerosity discrimination, where objective physical quantity defines stimulus intensity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 1)</ref>. In this psychophysical experiment, we manipulated the intensity of the third stimulus over a broader range than in previous research.</p><p>This approach allowed us to thoroughly characterize the impact of the third alternative on participants' choice behavior and provided robust constraints for testing our proposed model. Another phenomenon of interest is a so-called dud-alternative confidence boost, wherein subjective decision confidence irrationally increases with the inclusion of an additional, clearly incorrect alternative in choice lineups (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Charman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hanczakowski et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Windschitl &amp; Chambers, 2004)</ref>. Adding an extra alternative should not improve actual decision accuracy but unreasonably inflates subjective confidence, highlighting a stark dissociation between objective vs. subjective senses of decision accuracy (i.e., metacognitive miscalibration). This phenomenon contradicts ideal probabilistic computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ma, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Meyniel et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Pouget et al., 2016)</ref> and thus offers valuable insights into human metacognitive processes (for a comprehensive review on confidence and metacognition, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Miyoshi et al., 2024)</ref>. Moreover, this phenomenon has practical implications in areas such as face lineup memory, contributing to the development of fair eyewitness identification procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Wixted et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Wixted et al., , 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wixted &amp; Wells, 2017)</ref>. Despite recent research across various cognitive domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Comay et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Horry &amp; Brewer, 2016)</ref>, the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon remains elusive. This paper proceeds as follows. We begin by presenting behavioral data from a preregistered three-choice dot discrimination task, focusing on the IIA violation and the dud-alternative confidence boost (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref> for the preregistered protocol). Next, we introduce our computational model, developed based on pilot data (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S1</ref>) and grounded in the evidence STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 5 accumulation framework (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bogacz et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Tajima et al., 2019)</ref>. We then validate the model using the three-choice data, assessing its alignment with the preregistered behavioral trends. Finally, to further evaluate the model's generalizability, we test its predictive accuracy on separate two-choice data, employing parameters derived from the three-choice experiment.</p><p>Our model features three independent evidence accumulators and employes a max vs. next (MVN) algorithm, which renders a decision when the difference between the top two evidence values reaches a threshold. This algorithm is known in statistics for providing an asymptotically optimal multi-hypothesis sequential probability ratio test under specific conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(McMillen &amp; Behseta, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">McMillen &amp; Holmes, 2006)</ref>. While several studies have employed this algorithm to describe human decision-making behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ditterich, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Krajbich &amp; Rangel, 2011)</ref>, our study is the first to explore its connection to the IIA violation by manipulating the third stimulus intensity across a broad range.</p><p>To date, accumulator modeling of confidence has largely been confined to two-choice scenarios (though see <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ratcliff &amp; Starns, 2013)</ref>. Moreover, most computational studies have attributed confidence formation solely to evidence accumulation during the post-decisional phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fleming &amp; Daw, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hellmann et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Maniscalco et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Navajas et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Pereira et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pleskac &amp; Busemeyer, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Yu et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast, we posit that confidence arises from both the post-decisional phase and the period immediately following stimulus presentation.</p><p>The importance of this early period in shaping confidence has been highlighted in experimental studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cai et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hoven et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Shekhar &amp; Rahnev, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Xue et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Zylberberg et al., 2012</ref>), yet this insight has not been integrated into contemporary computational research. Additionally, our pilot results indicate that this early-stage component may contribute to the dud-alternative confidence boost (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure A1</ref>). This study, therefore, examines the STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 6 effectiveness of our proposed confidence rule in capturing participants' confidence rating behavior across varying stimulus intensities.</p><p>In summary, this study seeks to elucidate the dynamics of non-normative multi-choice behaviors through a grounded computational framework-a milestone not yet attained in related research. By incorporating the early-stage development of confidence, our model offers fresh insights into the computations underlying metacognitive monitoring. Therefore, successfully validating our proposed model would mark a significant advance in unravelling principled laws of decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited 24 participants (12 males, 12 females; aged 19-24, M = 20.88, SD = 2.19). The sample size was determined through a power analysis based on pilot data. Data from one participant were excluded according to preregistered exclusion criteria (see Supplementary Material).</p><p>Participants took part in our experiment for a total of four days and were compensated with 1,500 yen for their participation each day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics Information</head><p>The research protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the Graduate School of Informatics at Kyoto University. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apparatus</head><p>We used the free software PsychoPy 3 (version 2022.2.4) to conduct the experiment. Stimuli were presented on a 23.8-inch LCD monitor with a display resolution of 1920 x 1080, set against a black background. Participants viewed the monitor from a distance of 57.3 cm in a darkened room.</p><p>Additionally, Tobii Pro Spectrum was used to record participants' eye movements at a 120 Hz STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 7 sampling rate. Note that the eye-tracking data were not the primary focus of this study, and we used eye-tracking only to ensure that participants maintained appropriate engagement with the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants performed dot numerosity discrimination tasks spanning four days. The initial three days involved a three-choice experiment, designed as an exact replica of our pilot experiment <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 1)</ref>. On the fourth day, participants conducted a two-choice experiment, intended as a generalization test for our proposed model trained in the preceding three-choice experiment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Three-Choice Experiment</head><p>The experiment spanned across three days, with participants completing a minimum of six practice trials followed by a main experiment consisting of eight blocks of 72 trials per day.</p><p>Participants had at least a one-minute break between the blocks. They received correct/incorrect performance feedback after each practice trial, but no feedback was provided during the main experiment. Before each block, participants underwent eye-tracking calibration under the default settings of PsychoPy 3. If eye-tracking recording was interrupted during an experimental block, the block was restarted to ensure that every participant completed eight blocks in total. This resulted in a total of 1,728 trials per participant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 8</head><p>At the beginning of each trial, participants fixated on a white fixation cross measuring 0.5° of visual angle. The fixation cross was placed 1.5 cm below the center of the screen to ensure proper display of all stimuli. An invisible area of interest (AOI) was defined spanning 2° around the fixation cross. Once participants maintained their gaze within the AOI for 500 ms, the fixation cross disappeared and two or three white-rimmed circles of a 10° diameter appeared. The circles remained on the screen for 3,000 ms or until a response was made. These circles were evenly spaced and positioned at the upper middle, lower left, and lower right of the fixation point. The centers of the circles lay on the circumference of an invisible circle of a 20° diameter, centered at the fixation cross. Each circle contained specific numbers of white dots of a 0.15° diameter, representing a choice option corresponding to the target (numerosity = 100), distractor (numerosity = 90), and dud stimulus (six within-participant conditions: numerosity = 0, <ref type="bibr">27, 45, 63, 76, or 86)</ref>. The configuration of the dots was randomized across trials, presented at randomly selected grid points inside each circle. Notably, the dud condition of 0 represented a two-alternative choice between the target and distractor, with only the two circles being visible.</p><p>During each trial, participants were required to choose the stimulus of the greatest numerosity by pressing the up, left, or right arrow key as quickly as possible. They had 3,000 ms to make their choice, and if they failed to respond within this time, a warning message appeared, and the trial was excluded from subsequent data analyses. After responding, they reported confidence in their choice on a four-point scale. They were instructed to use the entire range of the confidence scale throughout the experiment, and there was no time limit for the confidence report. After the confidence report, a 300 ms interval followed before the next trial started. The order of the trials was randomized across participants, with the dud value (six conditions) and the location of each option (six different patterns of target, distractor, and dud positions) being fully crossed within each block (each of the 36 different combinations was repeated twice within each block).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-Choice Experiment</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 9</formula><p>On the fourth day, participants completed eight two-choice blocks, each composed of 72 trials. Prior to the main trials, participants underwent a practice session and eye-tracking calibration, following the same protocol used in the three-choice experiment.</p><p>The procedure for the main trial mirrored that of the dud = 0 condition in the three-choice experiment. Two circles were presented, positioned either at the upper middle, lower left, or lower right of the fixation point, prompting participants to select the circle containing a larger number of dots. The critical manipulation involved setting the target value to 92, 96, and 100, while the distractor value remained constant at 90. Trial sequences were randomized across participants, ensuring that the target value (three conditions) and the location of each option (six different patterns of target and distractor positions) were fully crossed within each block (each of the 18 different combinations was repeated four times within each block).</p><p>This experimental design aimed to investigate a confidence trend known as the double increase pattern (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rausch &amp; Zehetleitner, 2019)</ref>. According to the normative signal detection theory model <ref type="bibr">(Green &amp; Swets, 1966, pp 40-43)</ref>, as the intensity of the target increases with constant distractor intensity, confidence in correct choices increases while confidence in incorrect choices decreases. However, empirical studies have documented instances where confidence increased both for correct and incorrect choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kiani et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Maniscalco et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Miyoshi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rausch et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rausch et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Stolyarova et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">van den Berg et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Zawadzka et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Through computational modeling, the present study sought to understand the conditions and mechanisms that lead to this non-normative metacognitive behavior. To summarize, this experiment is designed as a generalization test to assess whether our proposed model, trained on three-choice data, can effectively generalize to two-choice data with special emphasis on participants' confidence rating behavior.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral Results</head><p>First, we analyzed three-choice data from 23 participants <ref type="figure">(Figure 2)</ref> regarding preregistered Hypotheses 1-4. All tests below were two-sided, with the significance level α set at .05. For mixed model analyses, we used maximum possible random effect structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barr et al., 2013)</ref>. All the analyses were performed on the free statistical software R (version 4.2.2).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 12</head><p>To test Hypotheses 1-2, we fit two variants of multinomial models <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Webb et al., 2020)</ref> to individual participants' data. These models predict the choice probability for each alternative using the softmax transformation of the stimulus utility (only the target and distractor were considered when the dud numerosity was zero).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">[ , , ] = ( , , )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here, the utility of each alternative Ui is calculated by the following transformation of each stimulus's numerosity Vi, where ΣjVj indicates the sum of all alternative values.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= + � = , , = , , �<label>(2)</label></formula><p>A standard logit model estimates only the constant term λ with the relative coding parameter ω constrained to be 0. This is the classic implementation of the multinomial logit regression, which operates upon the IIA axiom <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Luce, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dagsvik, 2016)</ref>. On the other hand, a relative coding model estimates both λ and ω as free parameters. With the inclusion of the ω parameter, this model deviates from the standard multinomial logit regression and allows for the violation of the IIA axiom. Specifically, the relative proportion of target vs. distractor choices increases against the dud value when ω &lt; 0, whereas it decreases against the dud value when ω &gt; 0</p><p>(the latter case is often discussed in its relation to divisive normalization, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gluth, Kern, Kortmann, et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Louie et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Webb et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The model fitting showed that the relative coding model yielded a better AIC value than the standard logit model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 3a)</ref>, indicating the occurrence of the IIA Violation. Additionally, a one-STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 13 sample t-test indicated that the mean estimated ω parameter was significantly smaller than zero (t(22) = 2.41, p = .025; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3b</ref>), confirming that the relative proportion of target vs. distractor choices increased against the dud value. To test Hypothesis 3, we conducted a mixed linear regression on RT, incorporating choice outcome (two levels: target, distractor), dud value (six levels), and their interaction as fixed effects.</p><p>The model also included a random intercept and random slopes for choice outcome and dud value.</p><p>Likelihood-ratio tests revealed significant effects of choice outcome (χ 2 (1) = 38.44, p &lt; .001) and dud value (χ 2 (5) = 211.78, p &lt; .001), while their interaction was not significant (χ 2 (5) = 2.61, p = .759).</p><p>These results confirmed Hypothesis 3, indicating that mean RT was faster for target choice than distractor choice.</p><p>Next, to test Hypothesis 4, we performed a mixed linear regression on confidence, considering choice outcome, dud value, and their interaction as fixed effects. The model also incorporated a random intercept and random slopes for choice outcome and dud value. Likelihoodratio tests revealed significant effects of choice outcome (χ 2 (1) = 121.94, p &lt; .001) and dud value (χ 2 (5) = 127.63, p &lt; .001), while their interaction was nonsignificant (χ 2 (5) = 4.84, p = .436). Crucially, STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 14 a mixed model contrast between the dud conditions of 0 and 27 confirmed Hypothesis 4, demonstrating that the inclusion of the dud alternative increased mean confidence (t(32.9) = 4.95, p &lt; .001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accumulator Modeling</head><p>Next, we conducted accumulator model analyses on the three-choice experiment <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 4)</ref>.</p><p>The model consists of three independent accumulators, encoding the evidence in favor of target, distractor, and dud alternatives (only two accumulators were considered when the dud value was zero 1 ).

Additionally, there is Gaussian noise e t i with a standard deviation σ. For each time step, a noise was sampled independently for each accumulator according to Equations 6-8.

For fitting simplicity, we concatenated confidence levels of 1-2 and 3-4 into low and high confidence categories.

The solid curves in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> represent the predictions from the fitted MVN model and As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2c</ref>, the MVN model explained RT data reasonably well (for full RT distributions, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure A2</ref>). Notably, within the dud value range of 0-45, RTs remained relatively flat before exhibiting a sharp increase. This non-linear pattern is difficult to explain using decision rules like the PPA algorithm, which treats all options equally (see Equation 20). In contrast, the MVN algorithm, which considers only the top two accumulators, can readily account for this non-linearity (see Equation 13).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 8: The MVN model captures the nonlinear increasing trend of RTs against the dud value,</head><p>with target choice faster than distractor choice.</p><p>Furthermore, as predicted in Hypothesis 9, the MVN model offered a decent description of the confidence data, capturing the confidence boost triggered by the inclusion of the dud alternative <ref type="figure">(Figure 2d)</ref>. The behavioral data exhibited a non-monotonic trend, with the initial confidence boost followed by a gradual decline after the dud value of 45. The MVN model qualitatively captured this non-monotonic trend, though not perfectly. Upon closer inspection, this up-and-down pattern was present in the early-stage confidence variable <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 5a)</ref>. The post-decisional confidence variable did not demonstrate this non-monotonic trend but showed greater metacognitive accuracy ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure   5b)</ref>. Thus, the combination of these two variables provided a reasonably accurate description of participants' confidence rating behavior.  Regarding Hypothesis 10, the MVN model faced some difficulty in fully explaining the relationships among all three variables <ref type="figure">(Figures 2e and 2f)</ref>. Specifically, it struggled to capture RTs for low-confidence target choices and high-confidence distractor choices. Since these trials comprised a relatively small proportion of the total trials (27% for the former and 7.8% for the latter), the misfits for these conditions likely had limited impact on the overall model fit.</p></div>

These dynamic models provide greater flexibility in describing the relationships between stimulus intensity and choice probability, without being constrained by the axiomatic ratio-of-strength principle. Our study showed that the proposed accumulation model, utilizing the pseudo-optimal MVN algorithm, naturally accounts for the IIA violation without necessitating additional mechanistic assumptions.</p><p>It is worth noting that prior studies have explored IIA violations in three-choice problems through approaches distinct from ours <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Trueblood et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Trueblood et al., , 2014</ref>. These studies delved into socalled context effects (i.e., attraction, similarity, and compromise effects) within multi-attribute decision-making scenarios (e.g., preference choice based on products' quality and price). Our study also focused on the dud-alternative confidence boost, where introducing an extra choice option irrationally elevates subjective decision confidence. While confidence in multi-choice problems has recently garnered attention, research on its computational foundations remains limited (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Comay et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ratcliff &amp; Starns, 2013)</ref>. To address this gap, we employed the evidence accumulation framework to provide a grounded explanation for the dud-alternative confidence boost. Specifically, the speed of initial decision formation immediately following stimulus presentation was shown to play a key role in shaping this confidence bias (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure A1</ref>).</p><p>This early-stage confidence component is not merely an ad-hoc construct improvised to explain the dud-alternative boost. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Shekhar and Rahnev (2018)</ref> demonstrated that consecutive TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) at 250, 350, and 450 ms after stimulus presentation affected confidence levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Xue et al.

The early confidence component accounted for the non-normative dud-alternative boost, while the postdecisional component ensured appropriate metacognitive accuracy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Clarke et al., 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Galvin et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Guggenmos, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Miyoshi et al., 2022)</ref> by retrospectively STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 30 evaluating the correctness of the decision made. Notably, our study manipulated dud values over a broader range than previous studies, throughout which our model offered a reasonable explanation of the observed non-monotonic trend of confidence.</p><p>While the post-decisional confidence component serves for deliberative metacognitive monitoring, the early-stage component can be characterized as a heuristic (and thus bias-prone) element, offering a quick assessment of the likelihood that one's decision will be correct. In controlled laboratory environments, this early heuristic component may contribute limited metacognitive accuracy. Specifically, aside from the dud manipulation, stimulus intensities were fixed at target = 100 and distractor = 90 in the present experiment, resulting in small variation in decision-making difficulty across trials. Consequently, much of the variability in the early confidence component was driven by subtle internal fluctuations in the evidence accumulation rate and starting point parameters (i.e., σd and β), and thus the early confidence variable did not strongly track trialby-trial choice correctness. However, in natural environments, stimulus intensity is likely to vary considerably, leading to greater fluctuations in decision-making difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Miyoshi &amp; Lau, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Webb et al., 2023)</ref>. In these cases, the early confidence component should exhibit greater variability across different decision-making occasions and more accurately track subsequent choice correctness. Therefore, the ability to rapidly estimate choice correctness during the early poststimulus phase of decision-making, without prolonged post-decisional evidence gathering, would offer an adaptive advantage in real-world settings.</p><p>It is worth emphasizing that the MVN model seamlessly described the complex patterns of choice, RT, and confidence across a broad range of dud alternative values. This likely reflects the inherent selectivity of the MVN rule, which focuses exclusively on top two accumulators. In particular, the RT trend remained nearly flat across the dud values around 0-45, and the MVN rule effectively captured this pattern by ignoring the influence of the dud alternative. Algorithms that treat all options equally are sensitive to slight variations in the dud value, making it difficult to capture the observed non-linear RT trend ( <ref type="figure">Figure S2)</ref>. These findings highlight the selective nature of human information processing, which prioritizes task-relevant information and minimizes cognitive load by filtering out irrelevant inputs. This adaptability may be a key to unraveling the intricacies of multi-alternative decision-making.</p><p>Despite these successes, the present findings also come with some limitations. First, our use of noisy multi-choice accumulators necessitated iterative simulations for model fitting, introducing randomness in parameter estimation. Our case differs from scenarios involving noiseless multichoice accumulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Trueblood et al., 2014)</ref> or those involving noisy two-choice accumulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hellmann et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pleskac &amp; Busemeyer, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rausch &amp; Zehetleitner, 2019)</ref>, where analytical likelihood functions can be leveraged for precise model fitting. Furthermore, the infrequency of dud choices in our research design demanded extensive iterations in model fitting. These challenges led us to data aggregation, setting aside individual differences, to ensure stable parameter estimation.</p><p>The stability issue also restricted our focus to a reduced set of parameters essential for explaining the core behavioral patterns of interest. For instance, we opted not to include trial-to-trial variability in non-decision time, despite its recognized influence on the leading edge of RT distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Ratcliff &amp; Tuerlinckx, 2002)</ref>. As seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the MVN model's data description was not entirely flawless, and these factors may be reflected in the residual misfits.</p><p>Second, while our definition of the confidence time windows is informed by prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boldt &amp; Yeung, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cai et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Shekhar &amp; Rahnev, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">van den Berg et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Xue et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Zylberberg et al., 2012)</ref>, it does involve some arbitrariness. Thus, instead of specifying precise timelines, our modeling highlights two critical phases-early-stage and post-decisional periods-in the formation of confidence. This adds qualitative nuance to our modeling approach, which should be acknowledged when interpreting the present findings.</p><p>Lastly, aside from the methodological limitations, we did not observe the anticipated double increase in confidence in the two choice experiment; instead, we observed the folded X pattern, STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 32 where confidence in correct responses increased while confidence in incorrect responses decreased with increasing target intensity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rausch &amp; Zehetleitner, 2019)</ref>. As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 6</ref>, this folded X confidence pattern reasonably tracks the pattern of choice accuracy, and our MVN model accurately predicted its occurrence. However, humans often exhibit the seemingly unreasonable double increase in confidence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kiani et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rausch et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rausch et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Stolyarova et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">van den Berg et al., 2016)</ref> and identifying the conditions that give rise to these two distinct confidence patterns may provide insights into the computations specific to the human metacognitive system. As noted earlier, the early confidence component of our MVN model exhibited a dual increase in the pilot study, though this did not occur in the present main experiment. Exploring the experimental conditions and parameter values that lead to the emergence of the double increase in the initial confidence variable could be an interesting avenue for future research.</p></div>

The evidence in favor of three options (target, distractor, and dud) evolves independently over time step t. The evidence accumulation rate for each alternative is contingent on the corresponding dot numerosity. A decision is made when the difference of the first-and second-place evidence reaches a threshold set at 1 (t = 1483 in this case). Two critical time periods, highlighted by the grey areas, are postulated for deriving decision confidence. The development of the MVN variable within these areas collectively contributes to confidence construction.</figDesc></figure>
