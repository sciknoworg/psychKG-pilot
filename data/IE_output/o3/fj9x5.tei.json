      "novel zoo animal resource allocation task (distribution of 12 food tokens to single- vs. double-animal boxes)"
    ],
    "justification": "The article states that children \"distributed tokens representing food to four different types of zoo animals, arrayed across three boxes\" and that biasing the distribution toward the two single-animal boxes \"would constitute evidence of partition dependence,\" indicating that performance on this token-allocation task operationalizes the construct."
