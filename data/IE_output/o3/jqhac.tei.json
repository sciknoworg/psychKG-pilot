    "justification": "\"Push cases elicit uniquely large consideration failures in our task\" and participants scored markedly lower on push cases (e.g., .63 vs .95 on switch cases), so the size of the score decrement on these push trials is taken as evidence of a failure of consideration."

    "justification": "Throughout the Results section the authors report \"standardized scores\" on each grid type (e.g., .94 on push-control, .96 on switch-control), indicating that overall task performance is quantified with this standardized scoring metric."
