    "measured_by": "optimal stopping task (Secretary Problem)",
    "justification": "The article notes that “Optimal stopping problems provide a domain-general framework… A classic formal example is the Secretary Problem,” which is introduced specifically to quantify how people shift from exploration to exploitation.",

    "measured_by": "patch foraging task",
    "justification": "Discussing foraging paradigms, the authors state that “foraging tasks have been developed… The agent has to decide whether to remain in the current patch… or travel to the next patch,” describing their use for studying repeated transitions from exploitation to exploration.",

    "measured_by": "n-armed bandit task",
    "justification": "The review explains that “This trade-off is typically investigated through n-armed bandit tasks… the agent has to choose between multiple slot machines (or ‘arms’)… with the goal of maximizing overall returns,” directly linking the task to measuring the construct.",

    "justification": "Citing Wilson et al., the paper says they “developed a horizon task, a modified version of a n-armed bandit task… to examine whether participants tend to rely more on random or directed exploration,” indicating the measure targets the directed-versus-random exploration construct.",
