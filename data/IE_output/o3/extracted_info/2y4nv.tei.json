    "justification": "“Using a variant of the Q-learning model, we found that their learning rate for confirmatory prediction errors was significantly greater than their learning rate for disconfirmatory prediction errors,” indicating that the construct (confirmation bias) is operationalised via the two learning-rate parameters of the computational model.",

    "justification": "“Subjects performed the task while wearing an eye-tracking device that recorded their gaze… we analysed the targets of their attention allocation around the decision onset and the feedback presentation,” showing that gaze recordings serve as the measure of attention allocation.",

    "measured_by": "pupil size (pupil diameter) captured by the Pupil Core eye-tracker",
    "justification": "“Pupil size was recorded using a Pupil Core headset… we observed a biphasic pupil size response… directly modulated by factual outcome value,” demonstrating that trial-evoked pupil diameter is the instrument for assessing arousal‐related responses.",
