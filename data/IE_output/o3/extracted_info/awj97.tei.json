    "measured_by": "difference between mean likelihood ratings to share true vs. false headlines in the 12-headline sharing task",
    "justification": "“Sharing discernment was computed as a participant's mean likelihood of sharing true news headlines minus their mean likelihood of sharing false news headlines.” This specifies how the construct was measured with the headline-sharing task.",

  {
    "measured_by": "likelihood ratings to share each of 12 news headlines",
    "justification": "“All participants then completed a headline task assessing their sharing intentions for a set of 12 headlines, in which they indicated how likely they would be to share 12 news headlines.” This links the construct ‘sharing intentions’ to the headline-rating instrument.",

  {
    "measured_by": "self-reported importance rating question",
    "justification": "“Participants were then asked to provide additional information… and the importance they personally placed on sharing only accurate information.” This shows the construct was measured through a direct self-report rating.",
    "construct": "Importance of sharing only accurate information"
  },
  {
    "measured_by": "ratings of likelihood to implement, acceptability, and perceived effectiveness",
    "justification": "“To assess whether acceptance of the intervention differed across conditions, we asked participants for their subjective assessment… rating the likelihood that they would implement it…, how acceptable they would find its implementation…, and how effective they thought it was.” This details the measurement of intervention acceptance.",
    "construct": "Acceptance of the intervention"
