    "justification": "The authors state that in Scenario 1, which “was about different budget allocation ratios for safety research programs,” “an option was chosen more often when it was the status quo than when it was neutrally framed,” indicating that this decision scenario was used to capture the magnitude of status quo bias.",

    "justification": "For Scenario 2, participants decided whether to keep or switch the pre-ordered wagon colour; the paper reports that it “asked participants to evaluate and decide among … color options for a wagon,” and compares choice rates when a colour is framed as the status quo versus alternatives, using these differences to test the status quo bias.",

    "measured_by": "Scenario 3 ‘investment-portfolio selection’ hypothetical decision task",
    "justification": "The replication included an investment-portfolio question where “participants chose from different investment portfolios,” and the analysis contrasted choices when a portfolio was labelled the current (status-quo) allocation versus when it was not, employing this task to measure status quo bias.",

    "measured_by": "Scenario 4 ‘college job-offer’ hypothetical decision task",
    "justification": "Scenario 4 required participants to decide “whether one chooses to remain in the current job or to accept a job offer from other colleges,” and the study examined how often the current job (status quo) was retained compared with neutral or non-status-quo framings, using this to assess the status quo bias.",
