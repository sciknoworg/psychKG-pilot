    "justification": "They argue that “if the success rate of the pass trial reaches zero … the change … is considered to have been made simply by continuous (serial) revision,” whereas sustained success “demonstrated parallel preparation,” so the success-rate measure operationalises parallel processing.",

    "justification": "LED onset times were “strictly controlled … divided into eight conditions (0–70 %)” using each player’s pre-measured hang-time, specifically to probe “the reaction time for making a decision … when the objective changes for a movement that has already been initiated.”",
