    "justification": "To reduce confounds, the authors describe that “Huang et al. (2021b) presented participants with (non-trolley) dilemmas where both the utilitarian and deontological choices were intuitive,” indicating these specially designed vignettes serve as instruments for measuring moral choices when both options feel intuitive.",
