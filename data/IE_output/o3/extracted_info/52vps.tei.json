    "justification": "Participants completed a computerized task in which they repeatedly chose between four fractal options (A, B, C, D) whose reward means and variances were manipulated; their choices on this task were used to examine how people make decisions when value uncertainty varies.",

    "measured_by": "Dirichlet weight parameter derived from the entropy-weighted dual-process model",
    "justification": "Model fitting showed that the overall Dirichlet weight, estimated for each participant, indexed the extent to which the frequency-based system influenced choices; higher Dirichlet weights were ‘closely associated with a lower likelihood of selecting C’, linking this parameter to frequency-based decision making.",
