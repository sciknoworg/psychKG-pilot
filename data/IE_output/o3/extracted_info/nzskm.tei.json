    "justification": "The article notes that “experiments showing that even those who profess antiracist beliefs find it harder to associate positive words with black faces compared to white faces (the ‘implicit association test’; Greenwald, McGhee & Schwartz, 1998…)” thereby identifying the IAT as the tool for measuring implicit bias.",
