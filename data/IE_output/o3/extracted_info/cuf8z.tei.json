    "measured_by": "SentiWordNet lexical sentiment scores",
    "justification": "The article explains that “SentiWordNet associates with each ‘synset’ three continuous numeric scores: positivity, negativity and neutrality… By aggregating these scores across the entire text, an overall sentiment value can be derived,” indicating that the construct of text sentiment is operationalised with the SentiWordNet scoring tool.",

    "measured_by": "Mohammad & Turney word-emotion association tool / NRC Emotion Lexicon",
    "justification": "It states that “Mohammad and Turney developed a tool that can identify and measure a spectrum of emotions, such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust,” showing that this instrument is used to quantify specific emotional constructs in text.",

    "measured_by": "computational models implementing Moral Foundations Theory",

  {
    "measured_by": "computational models based on Morality-as-Cooperation theory",

    "justification": "The method section describes that each instruction was input into GPT-4 with the prompt asking, “How negative or positive is the action… on a 1–7 scale,” and that the resulting numbers (S_zero, S_half, S_all) were used, evidencing that GPT-4 ratings served as the measurement instrument for this sentiment construct.",
