    "justification": "“The scale used in the actual task had 50 levels per interval… The mouse x-position along the scale was recorded every 200 ms… contributing to the total amount of tokens participants were supposed to maximise,” indicating confidence was captured via a continuous wagering slider.",

    "justification": "“The influence that social information has on each dyad member can be quantified as the distance between their post-exchange confidence and pre-exchange confidence: δ C = Cpost − Cpre,” showing the construct is operationalised by this difference score.",
