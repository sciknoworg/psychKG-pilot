You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Cognitive flexibility is defined as the ability to adapt to changes in the environment by switching task sets, responses, or strategies 
(Cools, 2015)
. From a psychological perspective, it is often considered alongside related emergent control processes such as inhibition and updating 
(Miyake et al., 2000)
. Flexibility allows changing behaviour in response to environmental and internal cues. Individuals with greater cognitive flexibility have improved life outcomes, better social functioning and reduced cognitive decline with age 
(Burke et al., 2019;
Diamond & Lee, 2011;
Koesten et al., 2009)
. Difficulties in flexibility have also been observed in several mental health conditions, further highlighting the importance of research on the neural and psychological bases of flexible behaviour 
(Chamberlain, 2007;
Remijnse et al., 2006;
Yerys et al., 2009)
.
A full understanding of cognitive flexibility has proven challenging, in part because this is not a unitary construct 
(Dias et al., 1996)
. Various behavioural paradigms have been developed to measure flexibility in humans, each capturing intersecting but somewhat different aspects of this behaviour 
(Dajani & Uddin, 2015;
Milner, 1963;
Roberts et al., 1988
). Common paradigms encompass task-switching, attentional set-shifting and reversal learning 
(Brown et al., 2015)
. In task-switching procedures, the participant switches between two or more tasks, based on pre-defined stimulus-response sets 
(Manoach, 2009;
Monsell, 2003)
. Set-shifting tasks such as the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the CANTAB intradimensional/extradimensional test or the Dimensional Change Card Sort task 
(DCCS)
 measure the ability to transition between cognitive-attentional sets, in the case of the WCST by using external cues to learn about rules determining ongoing performance 
(Chamberlain, 2007;
Grant & Berg, 1948)
. Reversal learning, on the other hand, requires participants to adapt responding following the reversal of previously learnt reward-related contingencies 
(Izquierdo et al., 2017)
. The diversity within cognitive flexibility is exemplified by distinct Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind developmental trajectories for different tasks 
(Buttelmann & Karbach, 2017;
Kalkut et al., 2009;
Somsen, 2007;
Van Der Schaaf et al., 2011)
. In studies involving both task-switching and set-shifting paradigms, the salience and executive control networks (ECN) are consistently activated 
(Dajani & Uddin, 2015;
Uddin, 2021)
. Key nodes in the former include the anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) whereas the ECN includes the inferior frontal junction (IFJ), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) 
(Braun et al., 2015;
Hampshire & Owen, 2006;
Shine et al., 2016;
Vaghi et al., 2017)
.
Connectivity between the AI, dACC and thalamus, forming the cingulo-opercular network, in addition to the posterior parietal cortex is widely reported in task-switching 
(Dosenbach et al., 2006;
Liston et al., 2006;
Worringer et al., 2019)
. While the neural substrates of taskswitching and attentional set-shifting overlap, the former is associated with greater parietal and thalamic involvement and the latter with the default mode network (DMN) 
(Vatansever et al., 2016)
. Reversal learning, on the other hand, activates somewhat different circuits, including the striatum, amygdala, the medial PFC, and the lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) 
(Izquierdo et al., 2017;
Remijnse et al., 2005)
.
Cognitive control more generally has been increasingly recognised to employ proactive and reactive modes 
(Braver, 2012)
. Applying this distinction to cognitive flexibility may be useful with task-switching paradigms often focusing on reactive flexibility, with switching being triggered by explicit external signals. Proactive control, on the other hand, anticipates the need for control and is thought to be mediated in part by the lateral PFC (lPFC) 
(Braver et al., 2009;
Mäki-Marttunen et al., 2019)
. Both reactive and proactive control involve ventrolateral PFC and AI node activations, though only proactive control engages the DMN 
(Ryman et al., 2019)
. In contrast, reversal learning and attentional set-shifting paradigms characteristically capture both reactive and proactive flexibility, with shifting Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind being both prepared and elicited by feedback in participants 
(Rogers et al., 2000)
. There are additional key procedural differences between the common instantiations of these paradigms. For example, many task-switching procedures include similar proportions of switch and repeat trials, whereas most reversal learning and behavioural set-shifting procedures employ fewer shifts (see also 
(Dodds et al., 2011)
). Less frequent task relevant events elicit the salience network 
(Wager et al., 2004)
. Additional procedural distinctions include the extent of rule learning during the task and presentation of feedback or rewards to signal a need to change, both of which are less prominent in task-switching paradigms 
(Kiesel et al., 2010)
.
In daily life, flexibility often involves a change in behaviour being generated endogenously, but in situations where rule learning or set-shifting is not required. Here, we report results from a 'change your mind' task, where participants performed two-alternative forced choices and following spurious feedback, viewed and responded to the same stimulus again. Critically, they could repeat their previous response or change it, acting of their own volition. To our knowledge, no existing task provides participants with the opportunity to repeat their choice and assess whether they subsequently choose the 'road not taken'. We propose that the ability to change one's responses constitutes a form of mental flexibility not fully explored within current conceptual frameworks 
(Uddin, 2021)
. Here, forty healthy participants completed the task whilst undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. We expected subjects to change their second response when their first response was incorrect or when feedback was negative, and that any effects of spurious feedback would decrease with time. Based on previous studies, it was hypothesised that PFC salience and ECN nodes (i.e., AI, dACC, IFJ, IFG and dlPFC) would be active when participants volitionally 'changed their minds'.
Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind


Methods


Participants
Participants were 40 healthy volunteers (21 females), aged between 18 and 60 years (Mean=31.88, SD=10.03), recruited from adverts in the Cambridge community and from the University of Cambridge Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute volunteer panel.
None of the participants had any history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. All participants provided informed written consent and were reimbursed for their time and travel expenses, with ethical approval granted from the Cambridge Local Research Ethics Committee (08/H0308/65).


Task Procedure
Participants performed a two-alternative forced choice task, determining whether a target letter was 'T' or 'L' (see 
Fig. 1
). The task consisted of paired trials, each of which included an identical stimulus display following a fixation ('1' or '2') denoting whether this was the first or second of the pair. The target letter was embedded in a row of Xs and masked after a brief delay. Participants were informed that after the first of each pair the computer will provide feedback but that the feedback may not always be 100% accurate. Instructions stated that immediately after the feedback the same trial will be presented again and that they would have a chance to change their mind on the second display should they wish.
Unbeknown to participants, feedback was orthogonal to performance and was monitored so that it was negative on half of accurate trials and positive on half of the incorrect trials.
Participants completed 56 pairs of trials in each of three runs, 48 of which were difficult and 8 were easy. On each trial, following a 500 ms fixation period, the target was briefly presented within a row of eight Xs in grey in the centre of the screen. Following a predetermined delay, the target was replaced with an 'X'. Target location was Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind counterbalanced, appearing in one of the 6 or 4 central locations on difficult or easy trials, respectively. On difficult trials, a staircase determined target duration, initially set to 60 ms and decreasing by 10 ms following a correct response and similarly increasing following an incorrect response. On easy trials, target duration was fixed at 150 ms. The stimuli displayed for 2 seconds, and participants responded by pressing one of two buttons on a custom buttonbox with response mappings counterbalanced across participants. Following 1 to 3 seconds (duration randomly selected at 100 ms intervals), feedback appeared for 1 second ('+ correct +' in green or 'x wrong x' in red). After another interval (1-3 seconds), the second fixation appeared, followed by the same stimulus display and an intertrial interval (1-2.5 seconds).
This procedure allowed for 6.2 seconds on average between the two responses of each pair.
Participants completed 12 practice pairs before entering the scanner. Trial order per block was randomised and the experiment was programmed in Visual Basic. After responding, participants received feedback that was orthogonal to their performance.
Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind This was followed by an identical second stimulus presentation. The first and second of each pair were denoted by fixation appearing as the numeral '1' or '2'. Event durations are shown to the left of the task representation.


Neuroimaging Acquisition
Participants were scanned on a 3 Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Trio scanner at the 


Task Performance
The main measure of interest was mean change on response 2 (R2), with accuracy and reaction time (RT) as secondary measures. Linear mixed-effects models (LMEs) were fit with feedback (positive or negative), response 1 accuracy (R1: correct or incorrect), run (1-3) and all interactive terms as factors in R (R Core Team, 2017, version 4.0.4) using the lme4 package 
(Bates et al., 2015)
. Subsequent post-hoc pairwise comparisons of estimated marginal means with Tukey adjustment were conducted using the emmeans package 
(Lenth, 2018;
Pinheiro et al., 2021)
. Various LMEs were tested that included different random intercepts and were subsequently compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and log likelihood. The LME including a random Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind intercept for each subject and run had the lowest scores across all three measures and is thus reported here. The winning model was: Mean change R2 ~ feedback x R1 accuracy x run +
(1 + run | subject).


Imaging data


Pre-processing
Pre-processing of fMRI data was performed using FMRIB Software Library (FSL) 
(Smith et al., 2004)
 and FMRIPREP, a Nipype based tool 
(Esteban et al., 2018)
. Each T1weighted (T1w) volume was corrected for intensity non-uniformity using N4BiasFieldCorrection and skull-stripped using antsBrainExtraction with the OASIS template in the Advanced Normalisation Tools (ANTs) software 
(Tustison et al., 2010)
. Spatial normalisation to the ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c was performed through nonlinear registration with the antsRegistration tool using brain-extracted versions of both T1w volume and template 
(Avants et al., 2008)
. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast (FSL) 
(Zhang et al., 2001
). Functional MRI data was slice-time corrected using slicetimer (FSL) and motion corrected using mcflirt (FSL) 
(Jenkinson et al., 2002)
. Distortion correction was performed using field maps processed with fugue (FSL) 
(Jenkinson, 2003)
. This was followed by co-registration to the corresponding T1w image using boundary-based registration with six degrees of freedom, using flirt (FSL) 
(Greve & Fischl, 2009)
. The field distortion correcting warp, BOLD-to-T1w transformation and T1w-to-template (MNI) warp were concatenated and applied in a single step using antsApplyTransforms using Lanczos interpolation.
Frame-wise displacement was calculated for each functional run using the implementation of Nipype 
(Power et al., 2014)
. The first five volumes were discarded to avoid T1 saturation effects. The images were subsequently high-pass filtered (128 s) and spatially smoothed with a 6 mm full-width, half-maximum 3D Gaussian kernel. A canonical haemodynamic response function was modelled to the onsets of the explanatory event types.
Quality checks were conducted by checking successful registration, ensuring that none of the participants showed excessive motion using DVARS and framewise-displacement measures (excessive motion threshold being 10% of the total number of volumes) and by inspecting their respective carpet plots. All subjects passed these quality checks.


First-level model
A first-level fMRI linear model was fit using FEAT (FSL) 
(Woolrich et al., 2001
) for each run and included the following event types: (1) R1 correct, (2) R1 incorrect, 
3
 


Higher level models
A primary second level model averaged the first-level models for each subject across the three runs, whereas an additional model included the effect of run to assess changes over time. The contrasts above were subsequently examined in third-level mixed-effects wholebrain analyses involving one-sample t-tests with cluster thresholding with a Z-threshold of 3.1 and p<0.05 
(Woolrich et al., 2004)
. Figures of fMRI results were created using FSLeyes 
(Smith et al., 2004)
.
Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind


Connectivity analysis
To further investigate the circuits involved in changing or repeating a behaviour, a whole-brain psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was conducted in FSL. Four ROIs were created based on the findings from the first analyses, as well as areas reported to mediate proactive cognitive flexibility in previous studies. The regions that were selected for PPI analysis included the caudate nucleus, anterior insula (AI), orbitofrontal cortex 
(OFC)
 and superior frontal gyrus (SFG). A 5 mm sphere was placed in the respective region based on the Harvard-Oxford Atlas. Mean timeseries for each participant and each ROI were extracted.
A PPI analysis tests whether there is an interaction between the ROI timeseries and a cognitive process which accounts for the neural responses observed in other brain regions 
(Neufang et al., 2008)
. This was tested by including the extracted time series, the response to the cognitive process of interest (change vs repeat) and an interaction term between them.
Contrasts tested differences in connectivity in the change vs the repeat condition. One-sample t-tests for each seed-region were conducted and clusters above a z-threshold of 2.5 and p<0.05 were considered significant.


Multivariate Pattern Analysis
A Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) employing a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to predict whether participants would change their minds or repeat their response during R2. The MVPA was run on non-normalised and unsmoothed data to reduce distortions and conducted using nilearn and sklearn in Python 3.6 (Abraham et al., 2014; 
Pedregosa et al., 2011)
. The MVPA was based on the whole-brain individual beta maps obtained from the univariate analysis, more specifically, the beta maps for feedback, R1, and beta maps for the two categories were combined by concatenation. The SVM applied a linear Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind kernel using a fixed regularization parameter (C = 1). K-fold cross-validation was performed using a leave-one-out cross-validation. For each cross-validation iteration, the data were partitioned by run into smaller training and test datasets. Classifier performance was evaluated using: (1) the F1 score, (2) the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and (3) classification accuracy. Maps visualising decoder weights showed which areas contributed to classifying whether the subject would change or repeat their choice on the subsequent stimulus presentation.


Results


R2 performance affected by feedback and accuracy
Analysis of mean R2 change revealed that it was significantly affected by feedback (F(1,394)=31.15, p<.001, η 2 p=0.07) and R1 accuracy (F(1,394)=16.93, p<.001, η 2 p=0.04).
Mean R2 change was higher following negative feedback (M=0.39, SD=0.24) compared with after positive feedback (M=0.23, SD=0.22). Mean R2 change was also higher when R1 was incorrect (M=0.41, SD=0.24) compared with when R1 was correct (M=0.21, SD=0.19).
Additionally, a feedback x run interaction was evident (F(1,394)=3.96, p=0.047, η 2 p=0.01), as seen in 
Fig. 2
. Participants increasingly disregarding negative feedback with time (t(394)= -2.00, p=0.047 for negative feedback but t(394)=-0.40, p=0.69 for positive feedback). accuracy and R1 accuracy x feedback effects (F(1,394)=403.2, p<.001, η 2 p=0.51 and F(1,394)=63.28, p<.001, η 2 p=0.14, respectively). Mean R2 accuracy was significantly higher Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind following correct R1 compared with incorrect R1 (M=0.78, SD=0.19; M=0.40, SD=0.25, respectively). When R1 was correct, R2 accuracy was higher when feedback was positive (t(394)=-5.06, p<.001). However, when R1 was incorrect, R2 accuracy was lower when feedback was positive (t(394)=6.19, p<.001). Additionally, an analysis of mean RT2 revealed a decrease across runs 
(F(1,39)
=9.88, p=0.0032), and an interaction between feedback and R1 accuracy (F(1,394)=4.21, p=0.41), with faster responding when R1 was correct and feedback was positive (t(394)=5.23, p<.001). 
Fig. 3
 shows that the R2 change-repeat contrast revealed significantly greater activity in the paracingulate/cingulate gyrus, anterior insular cortex, superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri, superior and middle temporal gyri, orbitofrontal cortex, frontal pole, caudate as well as in the lateral occipital cortex and cerebellum when a participant changed their response 
(Table 1)
. Both repeating and changing a response were associated with significant activations in the superior frontal gyrus, paracingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus, insular cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, thalamus, frontal pole, intracalcarine and supracalcarine cortices and cerebellum.


Brain activations when changing versus repeating a response

Activations associated with the first response and feedback
Greater activity for incorrect vs correct R1 was found in the paracingulate, cingulate and superior frontal gyri and the right angular gyrus 
(Table S1
). Brain activations associated with R1, regardless of whether R1 was correct or incorrect, were observed in the cingulate and paracingulate gyri, superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri, insular cortex, lateral occipital cortex and superior parietal lobule. The BOLD response was greater for negative feedback in the superior frontal and superior temporal gyri, with no other differences between the two conditions 
(Table S2)
. Activations associated with feedback, positive and negative, were observed in the superior and middle temporal gyri, occipital cortex, and right frontal pole.


Dorsal and ventral striatum are associated with learning to disregard feedback
Exploratory analyses assessed whether activations associated with events of interest changed over the three runs. In both the R2 change and repeat conditions, activity in the occipital pole increased with run. Over time, activity to both positive and negative feedback in the left dorsal striatum increased 
(Fig. 4)
. With negative feedback, an increase in the frontal pole, occipital pole and cerebellum was also seen 
(Table 2)
. With correct R1, frontal pole and ventromedial PFC activations increased across runs. When R1 was incorrect, the dorsal striatum signal bilaterally decreased with time.
Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind Results were obtained via a mixed-effects whole-brain analysis involving one-sample t-tests with cluster thresholding with a Z-threshold of 3.1 and p<0.05. Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind compared to changing R2 
(Table 3)
. These areas include the lateral occipital cortex and occipital pole, lateralised to the left hemisphere. Similarly, there was stronger connectivity in the repeat condition between the OFC and occipital areas, such as the lingual gyrus, occipital pole, and occipital fusiform gyrus. Enhanced connectivity between the SFG and the left posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus cortex was found when changing compared to repeating R2 (see supplementary materials).

Multivariate Pattern Analysis: predicting changing one's mind
Using an MVPA approach, we tested whether it is possible to predict whether participants would change or repeat their response. R2 change could be predicted from brain activity during R1, presentation of feedback, as well their combination. Analyses using R1 beta coefficient maps yielded an accuracy of 0.64 predicting R2 change, and those using the feedback resulted in an accuracy of 0.74. When R1 and feedback were combined, performance was superior with an accuracy of 0.77. For comparability, LME model accuracy for behaviour was 0.70. contributing to classifying whether participants would repeat or change their response 
(Fig.   S4
). Based on R1 activity, voxels contributing to R2 classification encompassed the cingulate, caudate, putamen, inferior and middle frontal gyri, frontal pole, occipital cortex, with additional voxels distributed throughout the brain. When the feedback beta maps were used, areas involved in classification included the AI and OFC, as well as the SFG, paracingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus, caudate and frontal pole.

. Summary of performance metrics for the MVPA analysis.
Performance of three analyses is compared. In the first, classification was based purely on the beta maps from the first response. The second analysis uses the beta maps from the feedback conditions, and the last analysis combined the two by concatenating the beta maps.
Performance was measured using the accuracy, AUROC and F1 scores. Note. AUROC -Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve.


Discussion
This study investigated behavioural and neural correlates of proactive cognitive flexibility, where participants adjusted their behaviour voluntarily. Specifically, we assessed flexibility under conditions that did not involve trial-and-error rule-based learning or switching between multiple task-rules or attentional sets. Instead, participants were allowed a 'do-over', illuminating a perspective on flexibility not fully captured to date. Using paired trials in an uncertain environment, participants decided whether to change or repeat their response in the second of each pair. Accuracy of performance for the first of each pair was only slightly above chance, indicating that uncertainty was high. As expected, participants were more likely to change their response following presentation of the second stimulus when the first response was incorrect and when feedback was negative.
ACC activation during the first response, particularly when incorrect, is consistent with previous studies which identified this region along with the SFG as key structures involved in error and action monitoring 
(Bonini et al., 2014;
Botvinick et al., 1999;
Carter et al., 1998;
Lie et al., 2006;
Van Veen et al., 2001)
. Electrophysiological evidence from primates has shown that ACC neurons not only respond to errors, but also signal prior to adjustments following an error, thereby contributing to selection of the next movement 
(Shima & Tanji, 1998)
. Further, ACC neuronal activity reflects a behavioural shift on the subsequent trial in a reversal learning task 
(Kawai et al., 2015)
. Lesioning or inactivating this area impairs the ability to adjust choice behaviour after negative outcomes in both experimental animals and humans 
(Williams et al., 2004)
. Studies in humans have focussed on neural correlates of error signalling or detection 
(Ullsperger et al., 2014;
Van Veen & Carter, 2002)
. The present findings complement these by focusing on the subsequent behavioural adjustment, where strong ACC and SFG activations were detected, i.e., on the instantiation of flexibility through a change on the second response. This indicates the importance of the ACC during the implementation of behavioural adjustments, which has hitherto received less attention in humans 
(Ridderinkhof et al., 2004)
. The ACC and SFG involvement also demonstrate the inherent conceptual overlap between error monitoring and flexibility in some everyday situations, with the former leading to the latter.
In line with other studies of behavioural shifting, we report recruitment of PFC regions of the ECN and salience network (e.g., IFJ, IFG, AI, ACC and dlPFC) during response change 
(Braun et al., 2015;
Dajani et al., 2020;
Shine et al., 2016)
. The IFJ is thought to mediate response shifting by integrating multiple behavioural control processes and interactions with the dlPFC, vlPFC, AI and putamen, additional evidence for which is provided by our findings 
(Cole & Schneider, 2007;
Levy & Wagner, 2011;
Sundermann & Pfleiderer, 2012)
. The AI and IFG, on the other hand, are both important for response inhibition, and contribute in dissociable ways 
(Cai et al., 2014)
. The former is functionally coupled with the ACC and is important for salience detection of unexpected or infrequent events. Involvement of the AI is unlikely to be due to the detection of an unexpected stimulus as in the case of inhibition in stop signal or go/no-go tasks. Instead, given that changing was more infrequent than staying, it may be associated with the salience of an internally generated infrequent action. The IFG has stronger connectivity with the dlPFC as part of the ECN and facilitates appropriate behavioural control 
(Cai et al. 2014)
. The recruitment of both the AI and IFG may be attributable to inhibition of the first response, highlighting the intrinsic role of inhibition in purposeful flexible adjustment of behaviour. Unlike previous studies investigating flexibility, we also observed activity in the frontal pole in both change and repeat conditions, with greater activations during the former. This may represent a volitional component of our task, as this area has been associated with processing of internal states and self-generated responses 
(Christoff et al., 2003;
Ramnani & Owen, 2004;
Tsujimoto et al., 2010
).
Our psychophysiological interaction analysis provided additional insight into the brain circuits underlying repeating or changing a response. With the AI as the seed region, there was stronger connectivity to the lateral occipital cortex and occipital pole in the former condition. This was also the case for the connectivity from the OFC to the occipital pole, lingual gyrus, and occipital fusiform gyrus. Further, occipital pole activation increased over time during the second response. A recent automated meta-analysis of cognitive shifting, updating and inhibition highlighted not only the importance of prefrontal regions, but also the angular gyrus and visual cortex, whose role in cognitive flexibility is often overlooked 
(Uddin, 2021)
. Reports from multiple task-switching studies further confirm the involvement of occipital regions such as the lateral occipital cortex 
(Armbruster et al., 2012;
Dajani et al., 2020)
. In mice, ACC projection neurons to the visual cortex important for error monitoring have been directly linked to post-error behavioural adaptation through fibre photometry and optogenetic manipulations 
(Norman et al., 2021)
. In humans, a causal dependency between the frontal operculum and occipitotemporal regions in cognitive control has also been demonstrated using transcranial magnetic stimulation, suggesting top-down regulation of visual areas by the AI and frontal operculum 
(Higo et al., 2011)
. Whether occipital areas in our task were solely activated due to the stimuli being visual is unclear. Nevertheless, our findings support an involvement of the AI/OFC and connections to occipital regions in flexible cognitive control.
Over time, participants changed their responses less following negative feedback, suggesting they learnt it was unreliable. This was accompanied by increased activity over time in the dorsal striatum during feedback presentation, regardless of valence, in addition to the increased activity in the occipital cortex during the second response mentioned above.
These findings are compatible with the established role of the dorsal striatum in behavioural and cognitive control, decision-making under uncertainty and signalling ambiguity 
(Hsu et al., 2005;
Lopez-Paniagua & Seger, 2013;
Mestres-Missé et al., 2017)
. Thus, the dorsal striatum has been found to estimate outcomes and adjust behaviour when there are deviations from expectations 
(Mestres-Missé et al., 2014)
. Specifically, the dorsal striatum and its connections with cortical regions such as the CEN are necessary for overriding previous responses that are no longer useful; instead, implementing more appropriate responses given the current environmental context 
(Den Ouden et al., 2010;
Mestres-Missé et al., 2014
.
Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind Caudate nucleus activation has been shown to correlate with response selection, rather than feedback presentation 
(Hiebert et al., 2017)
. Here, the increased dorsal striatal activity during feedback presentation over time likely reflects its involvement in using ambiguous information to update the individuals' response selection, a finding that has not been reported in previous studies.
MVPA is increasingly used to increase the information gained from fMRI data 
(Weaverdyck et al., 2020)
. In the present study, when feedback was presented, the algorithm could predict the participants next action with an accuracy of 77%. As the prediction of behaviour from performance data in this tightly controlled situation was 70%, the BOLD voxel-wise approach enhanced the predictive properties of the data. Decoder weight maps highlighted voxels in the AI, OFC, frontal pole, SFG, cingulate gyrus and caudate as strongly contributing to predicting a change response on the subsequent stimulus presentation. These results indicate that brain activity prior to an action encode contributors to the decision that will be made, in our case, representing antecedents to changing one's mind.
This study created high uncertainty via brief stimulus presentation times and spurious feedback. Though effective in eliciting participants to change their minds, the task could not dissociate specific contributions of internal versus external sources of uncertainty. Future studies may disentangle these or explore alternate contributors to shifting representative of everyday situations. The task does assist with some difficulties encountered by the impurity problem, which makes it difficult to untangle joint and separable aspects of executive processes 
(Miyake et al., 2000;
Uddin, 2021)
. Namely, a challenge in studying cognitive flexibility has been to isolate it from working memory and attention demands. These processes were likely kept constant in the change vs repeat contrast, with the task having minimal spatial and rule learning requirements. Future studies could employ the same task with auditory stimuli to verify modality independent involvement of key PFC nodes.
Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind Moreover, this could reveal whether occipital region activation is due to the visual nature of most flexibility tasks 
(Niendam et al., 2012)
. Ultimately, the present findings widen our view of flexibility in everyday life by allowing a targeted assessment of volitional decisionmaking.

Wolfson
Brain Imaging Centre (Cambridge, UK). After the acquisition of a T1-weighted scan, Siemens standard echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence was used depicting blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, with TR 2000 ms, flip angle 78°, echo time (TE) 30 ms, in an interleaved ascending sequence. The field of view was 192x192 mm, with matrix 64x64, echo spacing 0.47 ms, and bandwidth 2442 Hz/Px. Volume number per run varied from 285 to 336. Each image volume comprised 32 slices of 3-mm thickness, with inplane resolution of 3x3 mm, orientated parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line.


positive feedback, (3) negative feedback, (5) R2 change and (6) R2 repeat. Equivalent event types for easy trials and six movement parameters (x, y, z, pitch, roll, yaw) resulting from the image realignment to control for movement artefacts were also included. Contrasts included only difficult trials and consisted of: (1) R1 incorrect vs correct, (2) negative vs positive feedback, and (3) R2 change vs repeat.


Figure 2 .

Effect of feedback and run on R2 change. The linear mixed-effects model for R2 change had significant feedback and feedback x run effects. Participants changed more following spurious negative feedback compared with after spurious positive feedback, though this effect was reduced across the three runs. Error bars represent standard error of the mean.Additional performance measuresMean R1 accuracy was 0.59 (SD=0.071, 95%CI[0.56,0.61]), indicating participants found the task challenging to complete. Mean R1 accuracy was significantly affected by run as subjects' performance improved (F(1,79)=4.35, p=0.040). Mean R2 accuracy was higher, at 0.64(SD=0.071, 95%CI[0.61,0.66]). An analysis of R2 accuracy indicated significant R1

Results summary of change vs repeat contrast. a) Axial slices (MNI z = -10 to -1) of the contrast highlighting key regions activated more when participants changed compared to when they repeated their responses. b) Sagittal view (MNI x=6 to 4) of the contrast highlighting key regions activated more when participants changed compared to when they repeated their responses. Activations detected with a whole-brain analysis involving one-sample t-tests with cluster thresholding with a Z-threshold of 3.1 and p<0.05. The colour bar represents the t-statistic.

Change in signal in response to feedback with run. a) Voxels that positively correlated with run, i.e., show an increased signal in response to positive feedback with each run. The voxels are in the left striatum (MNI coordinates: X=-13, Y=9, Z=13). b) Voxels positively correlated with run when negative feedback is presented. The voxels were found in the left striatum, occipital pole, and cerebellum (MNI coordinates: X=-19, Y=17, Z=3).
