You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
People often make decisions regarding whether to engage in cognitively effortful activities (e.g., taking on a challenging project at work), or instead, choosing a less effortful alternative (e.g., scrolling through social media). Indeed, when faced with the choice of whether to engage in a cognitively effortful activity, both the costs (e.g., how demanding is the activity) and benefits (e.g., how much it will advance one's goals) need to be weighed to come to a decision. As such, recent work has adopted a cost-benefit framework to better understand how individuals weigh the costs and benefits of engaging in effortful actions, and uncover the neural mechanisms that support these decisions 
(Kurzban et al., 2013;
Shenhav et al., 2017;
Westbrook & Braver, 2015)
. In particular, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has emerged as a prominent focus of study across both human and non-human studies of effort-based decisionmaking 
(Hosking et al., 2014;
Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021;
Müller et al., 2021;
Sayalı & Badre, 2019;
Shenhav et al., 2013;
Shenhav & Botvinick, 2015;
Vassena et al., 2017;
Westbrook & Braver, 2016)
. Nevertheless, there is much debate regarding the specific role the dACC plays in weighing the costs and benefits of engaging in effortful actions 
(Clairis & Lopez-Persem, 2023;
.
One such account suggests that the dACC encodes the difficulty of decisions, or the extent to which making a choice demands control 
(Shenhav et al., 2013;
. Indeed, there is a large body of work demonstrating the role of the dACC in encoding the conflict posed by competing choices 
(Botvinick, 2007;
Botvinick et al., 2001;
Pochon et al., 2008;
Shenhav et al., 2014;
Shenhav, Straccia, et al., 2016)
. Furthermore, prior work has also shown effects of decision difficulty reflected in dACC activity modulation during cognitive effort discounting of a working memory task 
(Culbreth et al., 2019;
Westbrook et al., 2019)
.
Collectively, these findings provide strong empirical support for the role of the dACC in signaling a demand for control when faced with making decisions between engaging in choice options varying in effort and reward.
Alternatively, other work suggests that activity in dACC is characterized by valuation comparison. More specifically, prior work has established that activity modulation in dACC is associated with the relative value of choices in effort-based decision-making across both physical and cognitive domains 
(Chong et al., 2017;
Klein-Flugge et al., 2016)
. In parallel, studies of foraging, where participants are asked to weigh the costs and benefits staying with the current option or searching for better alternatives, have found patterns of dACC activity modulation consistent with valuation comparison, with activity increasing when the value of the foraging option exceeds the current option 
(Boorman et al., 2013;
Kolling et al., 2012;
Wunderlich et al., 2009)
. Moreover, work using the rodent Cognitive Effort Task demonstrated an overall reduction in preference for the high-effort, high-reward option, relative to baseline, when the ACC was temporarily inactivated 
(Hosking et al., 2014)
. Together, these findings suggest that the dACC plays a role in helping to bias individuals away from prepotent, but suboptimal responses, via valuation comparison.
Here, we examined the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive effort-based decisionmaking using the Cognitive Effort Discounting paradigm (Cog-ED; 
Westbrook et al., 2013
Westbrook et al., , 2019
) with fMRI while participants made choices between options systematically varying in both subjective value and decision difficulty. Further, we used two versions of the Cog-ED across distinct cognitive domains (working memory, speech comprehension) to test for domaingenerality of the mechanisms supporting cognitive effort-based decision-making. Specifically, we pitted a pre-registered hypothesis that dACC would encode decision difficulty (with highest activity on trials in which choice options were close in subjective value) against the alternative hypothesis that dACC encoded value comparison (with highest activity on trials in which the prepotent response was suboptimal). To preview, we found clear evidence for the latter hypothesis, with further support for the domain generality of this phenomenon across distinct cognitive domains.


Materials and Methods


Participants
Participants were adults aged 18-40 years, recruited through Washington University School of Medicine subject recruitment registries. Study participation was subject to the following exclusion criteria: any history of head trauma, any significant medical condition, or any condition that would interfere with MRI (e.g., inability to fit in the scanner, claustrophobia, cochlear implant, metal fragments in eyes, cardiac pacemaker, neural stimulator, pregnancy, and metallic body inclusions or other contraindicated metal implanted in the body). Participants were also excluded if they reported a history of substance abuse, current tobacco use, alcohol consumption greater than eight ounces of whiskey or equivalent per week, use of psychostimulants (excluding caffeine) more than twice at any time in their life or at all in the past 6 months, or any psychotropic medication use in the last six months. Hearing was assessed using mobile audiometry (SHOEBOX, Inc.). All participants had normal hearing, defined by ≤ 25 dB HL thresholds in both ears. Better-ear tone averages across 1 kHz, 2kHz, and 4 kHz ranged from 10.0-13.3 dB HL. Pre-menopausal females had negative pregnancy tests on the day of the scan.
The final sample consisted of 26 participants (Mage=28.0, SDage=6.1; 18 females; 5 Asian, 4
Black or African American, 14 White, 3 more than 1 race; 2 Hispanic or Latinx). All experimental procedures were approved by the Washington University Human Research Protections Office prior to data collection. Participants provided informed consent and were compensated $50/hour for all study procedures, with the opportunity to gain up to an additional $20 bonus, based on the experimental tasks.


Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis
The present study is part of a larger pre-registered project that aimed to assess the neural mechanisms of domain-general cognitive motivation using the combination of simultaneous PET-fMRI neuroimaging during cognitive effort decision-making and the repeated sampling of decision-making in daily life contexts (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/Z5DSR). Here, we report pre-registered Hypothesis 1, as well as exploratory analyses that relate to the relationships between decision difficulty, value comparison (i.e., the relative difference in subjective value between choice options), choice behavior, and brain activity modulation during cognitive effort decision-making in brain regions implicated in these processes from prior work. All relevant study materials, code, and data used for these analyses can be found here: https://osf.io/4v68b/.
Forthcoming papers will report on other study components.


Behavioral Visit
Participants came to the lab in a first behavioral visit to complete a calibration session of the Cog-ED, with separate Cog-ED variants probing cognitive effort-based decision-making in two distinct cognitive domains (working memory, speech comprehension). This calibration session enabled participants to become familiar with the various tasks that they would later perform in the scanner as well as providing a baseline measure of each participant's cognitive effort costs (to be used in the neuroimaging visit). Each variant of the Cog-ED was performed separately and in a fixed order across participants; this decision was made to optimize the study for the investigation of individual differences. Namely, during the familiarization phase, all participants first performed the working memory version of the task and after a short break, they performed the speech comprehension version of the task. As a brief overview, in the Cog-ED, participants first experience performance of various demanding levels of a cognitive task (e.g., N-back, speech-in-noise) to become familiar with the cognitive effort required at each level. In the N-back task, working memory load was varied across four levels in different task blocks. In each block, participants were asked to indicate when the current stimulus (i.e., letter) matched the letter from N steps earlier in the sequence (target) or when the stimulus differed from the letter presented N steps earlier (non-target), with the value of N (1-4) varied across blocks.
Specifically, a higher value of N indicating increased working memory load, and accordingly, greater demands on cognitive effort engagement. In the speech-in-noise task, effortful speech comprehension was also varied across blocks 
(Figure 1a)
. Participants were asked to listen to spoken sentences through headphones and repeat back the sentence to the experimenters to the best of their ability, with the sentences presented in four levels of background noise (signal-tonoise ratios [SNRs]: 0 dB, -4 dB, -8 dB, -12 dB). In parallel with the N-back task, in the speechin-noise task, more negative numbers indicated an increased load on speech comprehension, and accordingly, greater demands on cognitive effort engagement 
(McLaughlin et al., 2021;
Peelle, 2018)
. Each level of the cognitive task (e.g., N-back, speech-in-noise) was assigned a color to avoid anchoring effects; consistent with our prior work, these color mappings were identical across both working memory and speech domains 
(Figure 1a
; 
Crawford et al., 2022)
.
Next, participants then completed a decision-making phase by performing the Cog-ED in each of the two domains (e.g., working memory, speech comprehension) separately. In the Cog-ED, participants were required to make a series of decisions between performing high-effort task levels (e.g., 2-4 back; -4, -8, -12 SNR) for high monetary reward or low-effort task levels (e.g., 1-back; 0 SNR) for a lower monetary reward value. The offer for the smaller reward was stepwise titrated across trials to determine the point of subjective indifference (i.e., the reward level at which they would choose either offer equally; 
Figure 1a
). These indifference points calibrated the "cost" of cognitive effort for each individual in each task (N-back, speech-innoise) and each difficulty level. In other words, the indifference points reflect the amount of money an individual is willing to forgo to avoid performing the more effortful task.


Neuroimaging Visit
Following the behavioral visit, participants completed the neuroimaging visit. When possible, the neuroimaging visit took place the day immediately following the behavioral visit; on average this visit took place 2.00 days after the initial behavioral visit. Participants were explicitly informed that they would later be asked to make decisions in the working memory or speech comprehension domains prior to starting each version of the task. During scanning, participants performed both the working memory and speech comprehension Cog-ED decisionmaking trials (in the same fixed order as in the behavioral session) using a previously published design adapted for neuroimaging contexts 
(Westbrook et al., 2019)
. This design systematically manipulated trial options according to individually estimated indifference points (obtained from the behavioral visit) with the goal of balancing choice biases equally towards the high and low effort options. To accomplish this, we manipulated the dollar amount of the low-effort option in relation to the estimated subjective value of the high-effort/high-reward option presented on that trial 
(Figure 1b)
. The scaling of this trial-wise manipulation was determined by the proximity parameter. The proximity parameter represents the subjective value of the low-effort option relative to the high-effort option being presented to the participant on a given trial. In other words, a proximity parameter of +0.1 indicates that the relative subjective value of the higheffort option is 10% above the subjective value of the low-effort option, which should bias the participant to choose the high-effort/high-reward option. On the other hand, a proximity value of -0.4 would indicate that the relative subjective value of the high-effort option is 40% below than the subjective value of the low-effort option, which should bias the participant to choose the loweffort/low-reward option. In addition, a small subset of trials (N= 18) had proximity parameters equal to either -1 or +1; these should strongly bias choices to either choose the low-effort (proximity = -1) or high-effort options (proximity = +1). The specific values of the trial-wise proximity manipulation were adapted from prior work 
(Westbrook et al., 2019)
, which aimed to equally balance choices between high-and low-effort options. As such, in this experiment, we used the same range of values, which included a mix of "easy" (proximity = |1|) and "hard" trials (proximity = -0.4 to -0.6 or +0.1 to +0.2). However, in contrast to the aforementioned work, we presented participants with randomly sampled values taken from the value ranges -0.4 to -0.6 and +0.1 to +0.2, rather than only using those exact values (as was done in the prior work), to provide greater variety of choice options presented to participants across all trials.
Each trial began with a valuation phase, during which only the high-effort/high-reward option was presented for six seconds, allowing estimation of its neural encoding. As such, participants were instructed to use the time period of the valuation phase to consider what the offer was worth to them. Specifically, participants were told that 'Two options will be shown, each specifying the dollar amount you will earn for completing the task one more time. First, one option will be shown for a fixed amount of time. Use this time to evaluate that option, considering what that offer is worth to you. Next, both options will be shown together. Use this time to select which of the two you prefer.' Following the valuation phase of the trial, participants chose between either a low-or high-effort offer accompanied by an associated monetary reward 
(Figure 1b)
. This reward indicated how much money they would be paid for performing a task block of that condition. Participants had six seconds to make a choice; if no choice was made, they would see the message "too slow" presented to them on the screen before moving onto the next trial. The intertrial interval was jittered at intervals of either four, six, or eight seconds. Like previously published behavioral versions of the Cog-ED 
(Westbrook et al., 2013
(Westbrook et al., , 2019
, participants were informed that a random subset of their choices would be used to select the tasks they would be asked to repeat at the end of the session, and the monetary rewards they would earn for doing so; in reality, however, participants were asked to perform all four load levels from each domain following the decision-making phase of the experiment. Participants completed three scanning runs of the Cog-ED in each domain (speech comprehension, working memory); this amounted to a total of 216 trials (108 trials/domain; 36 trials/scanning run).
Stimuli were presented using the MATLAB (MathWorks) Psychophysics toolbox v3.0.11 (RRID:SCR_002881; http://www.psychtoolbox.com; 
Brainard, 1997;
Kleiner et al., 2007)
. All responses were made with a button box provided to participants in the scanner.


fMRI Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
Scanning was performed on a Siemens 3T Biograph mMR, capable of simultaneous PET-MRI acquisition. A T1-weighed MPRAGE scan was acquired for each participant (TR = 2400 ms, TE =2.21 ms, Flip angle = 8 degrees, 192 slices, slice thickness = 0.9 mm, FOV = 256 × 256 mm). For each BOLD scanning run of the Cog-ED (3 working memory, 3 speech comprehension), 330 volumes were acquired with 4 mm isotropic voxels (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 28.0 ms, Flip angle = 70 degrees, 32 slices, interleaved order, slice thickness=4 mm, FOV = 256×256 mm, acquisition matrix 64×64 yielding an in-plane resolution of 4×4 mm).
Results included in this manuscript come from preprocessing performed using fMRIPrep 20.2.3 
(Esteban et al., 2019
(Esteban et al., , 2023
; RRID:SCR_016216), which is based on Nipype 1.6.1 
(Gorgolewski et al., 2011
(Gorgolewski et al., , 2017
; RRID:SCR_002502). The following paragraphs describe the key stages of fMRIPrep preprocessing.
The T1-weighted (T1w) image was corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU) with N4BiasFieldCorrection 
(Tustison et al., 2010)
, distributed with ANTs 2.3.3 
(Avants et al., 2008)
; RRID:SCR_004757), and was used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow. The T1wreference was then skull-stripped with a Nipype implementation of the antsBrainExtraction.sh workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs as target template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast (FSL 5.0.9, RRID:SCR_002823; 
Zhang et al., 2001
). Volumebased spatial normalization to one standard space 
MNI152NLin2009cAsym
 For each of the BOLD runs per participant (across all tasks), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. A B0-nonuniformity map (or fieldmap) was estimated based on a phase-difference map calculated with a dual-echo GRE (gradient-recall echo) sequence, processed with a custom workflow of SDCFlows inspired by the epidewarp.fsl script and further improvements in HCP Pipelines 
(Glasser et al., 2016)
. The fieldmap was then co-registered to the target EPI (echo-planar imaging) reference run and converted to a displacements field map (amenable to registration tools such as ANTs) with FSL's fugue and other SDCflows tools. Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, a corrected EPI (echo-planar imaging) reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using flirt (FSL 5.0.9; 
Jenkinson & Smith, 2001
) with the boundary-based registration 
(Greve & Fischl, 2009)
 cost-function. Co-registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9; 
Jenkinson et al., 2002)
. BOLD runs were slicetime corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI 20160207 
(Cox & Hyde, 1997)
; RRID:SCR_005927).
The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto each subject's native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for headmotion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as preprocessed BOLD in original space, or just preprocessed BOLD. The BOLD time-series were resampled into standard space, generating a preprocessed BOLD run in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the preprocessed BOLD: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD was computed using two formulations following Power (absolute sum of relative motions, 
(Power et al., 2014)
 and Jenkinson (relative root mean square displacement between affines; 
Jenkinson et al., 2002)
. FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in Nipype (following the definitions by 
Power et al., 2014)
. The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks.
Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (CompCor; 
Behzadi et al., 2007)
.
Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the preprocessed BOLD time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128 s cut-off) for the two CompCor variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 2% variable voxels within the brain mask. For aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM and combined CSF+WM) are generated in anatomical space. The implementation differs from that of 
Behzadi et al.
 in that instead of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD space, the aCompCor masks are subtracted a mask of pixels that likely contain a volume fraction of GM. This mask is obtained by thresholding the corresponding partial volume map at 0.05, and it ensures components are not extracted from voxels containing a minimal fraction of GM.
Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD space and binarized by thresholding at 0.99 (as in the original implementation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the k components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components' time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file.
The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each 
(Satterthwaite et al., 2013)
. Frames that exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm FD or 1.5 standardized DVARS were considered motion outliers. All resampling can be performed with a single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e., head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces).
Gridded (volumetric) resampling was performed using antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels 
(Lanczos, 1964)
.
Non-gridded (surface) resampling was performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer). The preprocessed BOLD runs were smoothed with an 8 mm FWHM kernel using 3dBlurtoFWHM from AFNI 
(Cox, 1996)
, as well as scaling using 3dTstat and 3dcalc from AFNI. Finally, the images were reoriented to LPI orientation using AFNI's 3dresample function.
Many internal operations of fMRIPrep use Nilearn 0.6.2 
(Abraham et al., 2014)
; RRID:SCR_001362), mostly within the functional processing workflow. For more details of the pipeline, see the section corresponding to workflows in fMRIPrep's documentation.


Behavioral Data Analysis
We extracted subjective value estimates from both the working memory and speech comprehension domains across all participants. To confirm that participants discounted cognitive effort across speech comprehension and working memory domains, as observed in our prior work 
(Crawford et al., 2022;
Westbrook et al., 2013)
, we entered task level, domain, and their interaction as fixed effects into a multilevel model with subjective value as the dependent variable: Subjective Value ~ Task Level*Domain + (1 | Participant); task level was contrast coded (2-back | -4 SNR = -1, 3-back | -8 SNR = 0, 4-back | -12 SNR = 1), whereas domain (working memory = 0, speech = 1) was dummy coded. Furthermore, to verify that participants' effort costs were domain-general, as also previously observed, we correlated participants' average subjective value estimates from each domain using the correlation package in R (Version 0.8.4; 
Makowski et al., 2020)
. Moreover, we undertook exploratory analyses to better examine participant choice behavior as it relates to the relative subjective value of choice options presented on a given trial. To accomplish this, we used a generalized linear mixed effect model with logistic regression (i.e., a binomial link function) to formally test for this relationship when controlling for other relevant variables (i.e., task load, reward amount, domain): Choice ~ Relative SV Difference + Task Level + Reward Level + Domain + (Relative SV Difference | Participant). All multilevel models were conducted with the packages lme4 (version 1.1-33.1; 
Bates et al., 2015)
 and lmerTest (version 3.1-3; 
Kuznetsova et al., 2017)
 and effects are reported as the estimate from the model with 95% confidence intervals and the corresponding test statistic and p-value. All analyses were conducted in R version 4.3.0 (RRID:SCR_001905; Team, 2023).


Neuroimaging Data Analysis
To test our pre-registered hypothesis that there would be an effect of decision difficulty on brain activity in control-related regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; dlPFC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; dACC, intraparietal sulcus; IPS, anterior insula, and amygdala) a general linear model (GLM) was applied to extract beta estimates and t-statistics for the event-related activity for each participant. Specifically, AFNI's 3dDeconvolve function was used to set up the GLM and build an input matrix with the hemodynamic regression model. In this pre-registered analysis, and consistent with prior work 
(Culbreth et al., 2019;
Westbrook et al., 2019)
, we used an assumed hemodynamic response (gamma) function (GAM) time-locked to the decisionmaking phase of the trial to contrast between "hard" trials, when the differences in SV of were small (|proximity| < 0.6), and "easy" trials, when differences in SV were large (proximity = -1.0 or 1.0). The ROIs were defined a priori using the Schaefer cortical atlas, with 400 parcels divided into 7 functional networks 
(Schaefer et al., 2017)
; subcortical regions were anatomically defined from FreeSurfer. Beta estimates were averaged for all voxels within each parcel using 3dROIstats from AFNI, with further averaging across parcels to form our a priori ROIs. To preview, these findings were not consistent with prior work conducted with the Cog-ED, which demonstrated greater activity modulation to "hard", as compared with "easy", decision trials in cognitive control-related regions, such as the dACC 
(Culbreth et al., 2019;
Westbrook et al., 2019
).
Consequently, we conducted exploratory follow-up analyses, aimed to better parse the relationship between the choice options presented to participants (i.e., manipulation of the relative subjective value of low-effort option) with their choice behavior and brain activity during effort discounting. To facilitate comparisons with prior work using this paradigm 
(Westbrook et al., 2019)
, we conducted these exploratory analyses using 6mm spheres centered around regions shown to be sensitive to Cog-ED choice behavior when the relative difference in subjective value was varied across participants' choice options. Namely, we used the dACC, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), left and right anterior insula (AI), left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) spheres, see 
Figure 4
. In other words, in these analyses we used the same exact ROIs as Westbrook et al., 2019. Furthermore, rather than using an assumed hemodynamic response function for these analyses, which could over-simplify the patterns of activity modulation in dACC and dmPFC in relation to choice behavior and trial-wise manipulations of subjective value, we extracted activity estimates for each trial's time course for each participant. To accomplish this, we normalized and detrended the time courses in each volume of preprocessed BOLD data with 3dDetrend in AFNI. Next, we averaged all activity estimates within each sphere ROI using 3dROIstats from AFNI, which yielded one time course for each participant, sphere ROI, and trial across all runs of the Cog-ED (both working memory and speech comprehension domains; i.e., six total runs). The onset of each trial was used to extract its corresponding time course frames, which were used in subsequent analyses. More specifically, for the trial-wise activity estimates, we defined periods of activity from both the valuation (5-9 s) and decision-making phase (11-15 s) of the trial, which consisted of averaged activity estimates across these time windows, relative to the trial onset. These estimates were used in multilevel models to further examine the relationships between the relative difference in 


Results


Effects of cognitive effort and decision difficulty on choice behavior
Replicating the pattern of results observed in our previous work 
(Crawford et al., 2022)
, we found that across both working memory and speech comprehension domains, participants discounted task load, such that more difficult levels of the task (e.g., purple; 4-Back, − 12 SNR) were discounted more, or had a lower subjective value, relative to easier task levels (1-back, 0 SNR): B = -0.22 
[-0.25, -0.18]
, t =-12.56, p < 0.001 ( 
Fig. 2a)
, during the calibration phase of the Cog-ED. Furthermore, participant choice behavior during the Cog-ED across both the domains in the scanner also replicated prior work 
(Westbrook et al., 2019)
. Namely, participants were slower to respond on "hard" trials (i.e., decision trials where the reward value is closer to an individual's subjective value) relative to "easy" trials in both the working memory (MEasy = 1.65, MHard = 1.83), t = 4.45, p < 0.001), and speech comprehension domain (MEasy = 1.55, MHard = 1.78), t = 5.64, p < 0.001 
(Fig. 2b)
. However, it is important to note that although choice reaction time reflected decision difficulty, overall, participants tended to prefer the high-effort, highreward option, relative to the low-effort option. In both the working memory (MProportionHigh = 0.71, SDProportionHigh = 0.21), t = 3.59, p < 0.001, and speech comprehension domain there was a preference for high-effort offers (MProportionHigh = 0.66, SDProportionHigh = 0.24), t = 2.89, p = 0.002.
These results suggest that aspects of participants' choice behavior (i.e., reaction time) reflect the relative difficulty of deciding between options that are "harder" (i.e., closer in relative value) versus "easier" (i.e., further apart in relative value).


Neural encoding of decision difficulty
Activity modulation at the time of choice in control-related regions did not scale reliably with decision difficulty, when evaluated with our pre-registered analyses and a priori ROIs (AI, amygdala, dACC, dlPFC, IPS). In particular, the fMRI activity data did not mirror the pattern observed in the behavioral choice RT data, with an "easy" < "hard" pattern. Instead, estimates in all ROIs had numerically higher values for "easy" trials relative to "hard" trials ( 
Table 1)
. In fact, in the left AI, B = 0.06 [0.02, 0.10], t = 2.83, p = 0.006, right AI, B = 0.07 [0.02, 0.11], t = 3.02, p = 0.003, and IPS, B = 0.07 [0.03, 0.10], t = 4.10, p < 0.001, the increased activity for "easy" relative to "hard" trials was statistically significant; all other ROIs demonstrated this same pattern, but the findings were not significant, ps > 0.172. These results are surprising in that they stand in contrast to the pattern observed two previous neuroimaging studies using the Cog-ED task 
(Culbreth et al., 2019;
Westbrook et al., 2019)
.
To investigate this discrepancy further, we conducted follow-up analyses using the exact ROIs taken from prior work, which demonstrated the role of the dACC/dmPFC activity modulation in relation to decision difficulty 
(Westbrook et al., 2019)
. Furthermore, to provide a more sensitive and specific test, rather than using a simple hard-easy contrast, with an assumed hemodynamic response function and trial-averaged data, in all subsequent analyses, we used single-trial estimates of decision difficulty and neural activity. We selected the squared-value of the proximity metric as a trial-by-trial index of decision difficulty. As can be seen in 
Figure 3a,
 this index peaks when the two option are equal in subjective value and is at the lowest value when proximity is +/-1 (i.e., "easy" trials).
Using this more precise metric of decision difficulty, we now did observe robust relationships with choice behavior and brain activity modulation in frontal and parietal regions identified in previous work. First, we used multilevel modeling to establish that the decision difficulty index (proximity-squared) does indeed successfully capture the behavioral findings regarding choice RT when the effects of task load, monetary reward, and domain are simultaneously entered into the model (B = -0.18 [-0.31, -0.05], t = -2.63, p = 0.009) ( 
Figure   3b
). Importantly, the relationships between the relative subjective value (i.e., value comparison account) and the relative subjective value squared (i.e., decision difficulty account) were clearly dissociable across models of choice behavior and reaction time. For choice behavior, the model testing the value comparison account was a better fit (AIC= 4017) relative to the model testing the decision difficulty hypothesis (AIC = 5444). However, when examining the relationships between the metrics indexing value comparison and decision difficulty on reaction time during decision making this pattern was reversed; the reaction time model with the decision difficulty term had a better model fit (AIC=14477) relative to the model with the value comparison term (AIC=14501 
; Table 2
). This suggests that value comparison and decision difficulty have clearly dissociable effects on choice behavior.
Moreover, now consistent with prior work using these ROIs, we found that decision difficulty was a reliable predictor of brain activity during the decision phase, even when controlling for reaction time, across the left AI, B = 0.006 [0.003, 0.009], t = 4.79, p < 0.001, right AI, B = 0.004 [0.002, 0.007], t = 3.74, p < 0.001, B = 0.02 [0.001, 0.003], t = 2.93, p = 0.004, left inferior frontal gyrus, B = 0.003 [0.001, 0.005], t = 2.36, p = 0.026, and the left IPL, B = 0.004 [0.001, 0.007], t = 2.85, p = 0.008 
(Figure 4)
. Critically, however, even with this metric we still did not observe significant difficulty effects in either the dACC, B = 0.001 [-0.002, 0.004], t = 0.81, p = 0.427, or dmPFC, B = 0.001 [-0.002, 0.004], t = 0.66, p = 0.513, with reaction time added as a covariate ( 
Table 3)
. As such, these results confirm that decision difficulty is reflected in the activity modulation of frontoparietal brain regions, in line with prior work, yet do not support a role for either the dACC or dmPFC in representing decision difficulty during decision-making.


Neural encoding of value comparison in dACC
We next explored whether dACC activity patterns were consistent with a role in value comparison. Here also, the proximity metric serves as a useful index of relative subjective value, in that is maximized (+1) when the high effort option has the highest relative subjective value and minimized (-1) when the low effort option has the highest relative value. Moreover, as can be seen in 
Figure 3a
, an attractive property of this index is that it is by definition orthogonal to the proximity-squared index of decision difficulty. As with decision difficulty, we first established that this index successfully captured trial-by-trial choice behavior. As the subjective value of the high-effort option increased relative to the low-effort option, so did the probability of participants choosing the high-effort option during decision making in the scanner, OR = 163.68 
[46.56, 575.45]
, z = 7.95, p < 0.001 
(Figure 3c)
, across both working memory and speech comprehension domains. Further, this finding reflects the relationship between choice behavior and the relative difference in subjective value when the effects of task load, monetary reward, and domain are simultaneously entered into the model, ps < 0.006. Finally, the pattern reflects the choice bias towards the high-effort option indicated above, as the indifference point (choice probability = 0.5) was well below the point at which the relative subjective value of the high and low effort options were estimated (based on the calibration session) to be equivalent (i.e., 0 on the x-axis).
We next tested whether trial-by-trial modulations in relative subjective value were encoded in the activity of the dACC ROI 
(Figure 4)
. We focused on both the valuation and decision periods, as clear peaks in activity can be seen in this region for both period 
(Figure 5a)
.
Across both working memory and speech comprehension domains, when the relative subjective value of the high-effort option was higher than the low-effort option, activity was decreased, B = -0.003 [-0.005, -0.001], t = -2.650, p = 0.008 
(Figure 5b)
. We also conducted the same analyses in a nearby dmPFC ROI. The same pattern was observed: when the subjective value of the higheffort option was greater than the low-effort option, activity tended to be decreased, relative to when the subjective value of the low-effort option was larger relative to the high-effort option, B = -0.004 [-0.006, -0.001], t = -3.099, p = 0.002. Domain and reaction time were included as covariates in both analyses. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for the role of dACC/dmPFC in value comparison, as activation in these regions provides an encoding of the relative value of cognitive effort. In particular, the dACC/dmPFC may reflect a role in overcoming prepotent biases in choice behavior, given that participants showed a propensity to choose the high-reward, high-effort option, unless it had relatively low subjective value.


Activity in dACC predicts choice behavior
Prior work in human and non-human animals has suggested that activity in dACC predicts choice behavior during effort-based decision-making 
(Cai & Padoa-Schioppa, 2021;
Klein-Flugge et al., 2016)
. We tested for such effects in the current dataset using single-trial analyses. Across both task domains, higher activity in the dACC during decision-making was associated with choosing the low-effort option, OR = 0.049 [0.003, 0.798], z = -2.119, p = 0.034 
(Figure 5c
). Importantly, this result reflects the unique effect of dACC activity on choice behavior, given that it was present even when relative subjective value was entered simultaneously in the model (along with task load, monetary reward, task domain, and reaction time as additional covariates). Unsurprisingly, all of these experimental variables were also significant predictors of choice behavior, ps < 0.012, in addition to dACC activity. Moreover, we observed the same pattern of results in the dmPFC whereby greater activity during decisionmaking was uniquely associated with choosing the low-effort option even with relative subjective value (along with task load, monetary reward, task domain, and reaction time entered) as additional covariates, OR = 0.030 [0.002, 0.502], z = -2.438, p = 0.015. Like the previously observed results in the dACC, each of these covariates were also significant predictors of choice behavior in addition to activity modulation in the dmPFC during decision-making, ps < 0.012. These results are consistent with a tight linkage between dACC and dmPFC activity modulation and participants' choice behavior during cognitive effort-based decision-making.
An important additional question is whether evidence for relative value encoding in the dACC exists even prior to choice. To address this question, we included activity values from the valuation phase of the trial, as this phase provides a relatively pure measure of encoding of the subjective value associated with the high-effort, high-reward option. Interestingly, we found that in the dACC, activity modulation during the valuation phase explained additional variation in choice behavior over and above the activity modulation occurring during decision-making.
Specifically, when trial-by-trial activity estimates from both the valuation and decision periods of the trial are entered into model to predict choice behavior, dACC valuation-related accounted for additional variance in participants' choice behavior 
(OR = 14.530 [1.088,
194.105]
, z = 2.024, p = 0.043), with higher levels of activity to the high-effort high-reward option predicting choice of that option. It is important to note that the direction of this effect was opposite to that occurring during the decision-period, in which higher activity predicted choice of the low-effort lowreward option. Interestingly, this pattern of dACC activity modulation is consistent with a value encoding that is reflected in terms of prediction error: when the newly presented option (i.e., high-effort high-reward during the valuation phase, low-effort low-reward during the decisionphase) was higher than expected, it predicted that this option would be chosen. Alternatively, these differences could reflect differential weighting of rewards and outcomes across different phases of the trial. Of further note, this pattern observed in the dACC was highly selective, since in the dmPFC the parallel effect was not significant 
(OR = 5.319 [0.402,
70.432]
, z = 1.268, p = 0.205).


The domain-general nature of value comparison in cognitive effort-based decision-making
Importantly, the above analyses included data aggregated across distinct versions of the Cog-ED (i.e., working memory, speech comprehension). Yet by examining the pattern observed in each version separately, it can be tested more directly whether the mechanisms underlying cognitive effort-based decision-making are domain general. We first tested for consistency in choice behavior across the two Cog-ED versions. Replicating our previous work 
(Crawford et al., 2022)
, we found that individual differences in average cognitive effort costs (i.e., subjective value estimates) were highly correlated across working memory and speech comprehension domains, r = 0.55 [0.21, 0.77], t = 3.26, p = 0.003 
(Figure 6a)
. To provide an even stronger (i.e., trial-by-trial) test of domain generality, we re-ran the generalized linear mixed effects model that estimated the effect of trial-by-trial variation of relative subject value in predicting choice behavior, but now for each task domain separately. From these models we correlated the slope and intercept estimates for each participant across domains. In such models, the slope parameter reflects individual differences in how a change in relative subjective value impacts choice behavior (i.e., how sharply participants shift from preferring the low-effort to the high-effort option), whereas the intercept reflects the overall bias to prefer one option over the other. We tested the hypothesis that these individual differences would be correlated across the two Cog-ED versions, reflecting a domain-general decision-making mechanism. Indeed, we found that both the slopes, r = 0.40 [0.02, 0.68], t = 2.15, p = 0.042 
(Figure 6b)
, and intercepts, r = 0.44 [0.06, 0.70], t = 2.37, p = 0.026, were correlated across domains. Together, these results provide evidence for the domain general behavioral mechanisms supporting the role of value comparison in cognitive effort-based decision-making.
We next sought evidence that the domain generality of cognitive effort-based decisionmaking may be reflected in terms of dACC activity. Again, we re-ran the linear mixed effects models of relative subjective value in predicting activity modulation in the dACC during the decision-making phase of the trial, but separately for each COG-ED version. We then extracted the slope and intercept estimates for each participant in each domain and tested for correlations.
Indeed, we found that for the dACC, individual differences in both the slopes, r = 0.49 [0.12, 0.74], t = 2.73, p = 0.012 
(Figure 6c)
, and intercepts, r = 0.92 [0.83, 0.96], t = 11.57, p < 0.001 
(Figure 6d)
, were correlated across domain. The same set of analyses were conducted with the dmPFC ROI. Although we did not find strong evidence for the correlation between slope estimates across domain in the dmPFC ROI, r = 0.36 
[-0.04, 0.65]
, t = 1.87, p = 0.073, there was a strong correlation between the intercepts across domain, r = 0.89 [0.76, 0.95], t = 9.41, p < 0.001. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for the domain-general role the dACC (and to a lesser extent the dmPFC) in representing value comparison across distinct cognitive domains during cognitive effort-based decision-making.


Discussion
Decisions involving whether to engage in cognitive effort are central to daily-life decision-making 
(Crawford et al., 2023;
Culbreth et al., 2020)
. However, it is unclear how and where the costs and benefits of engaging in cognitive effort are weighed in the brain and how such processes impact decision-making behavior. In this study, we used fMRI as participants made decisions between performing high-effort, high-reward versus low-effort, low-reward tasks across two distinct cognitive domains-working memory and speech comprehension-to monitor activity modulation in the dACC and other control-related regions during cognitive effort valuation and decision-making. Our results provide evidence for a domain-general valuation comparison mechanism located in medial prefrontal regions, as activity in both the dACC and the dmPFC were found to track the relative difference in subjective value across choice options, and further predicted participants' trial-by-trial choice behavior. Further, the results point to a relatively selective role in effort-based decision-making. Specifically, these medial prefrontal regions were not sensitive to decision difficulty, as indexed by the similarity in subjective value of the two choice options, even though similarity to this type of difficulty was observed in other frontoparietal regions.
The pattern of results observed in this study adds to an existing body of work in both human and non-human animals which suggests that dACC activity reflects a value comparison mechanism engaged during cost-benefit decision-making regarding both physical and cognitive effort 
(Chong et al., 2017;
Klein-Flugge et al., 2016)
. Furthermore, our finding that dACC activity modulation during decision-making scales reliably with the relative value of the choice options is remarkably consistent with that observed in other neuroeconomic choice paradigms, such as when comparing valued vs. non-valued items 
(Izuma et al., 2010)
, or explore-exploit decisions during foraging 
(Boorman et al., 2013;
Kolling et al., 2012;
. Additionally, the pattern of findings that we observed in human decision-making were strongly consistent with work in rodents, which suggest that the ACC is an evolutionarily important neural locus involved in integrating the costs and benefits associated with effort engagement 
(Endepols et al., 2010)
. Moreover, this brain region appears to play a critical role in guiding behavior towards maximizing returns, when weighing the costs versus benefits of engaging in cognitive effort 
(Hosking et al., 2014)
. Together, these results provide strong evidence for the role of the dACC in signaling when the value of choice options switches to favor of the less-preferred option, potentially as a form of prediction error signaling, which serves to guide choice behavior towards the option that maximizes benefits relative to the costs.
It is notable that our results did not confirm our initial pre-registered hypothesis or reflect some of the key findings described in the extant literature 
(Culbreth et al., 2019;
Westbrook et al., 2019)
. This prior work predicts that activity modulation in the dACC should scale reliably with decision difficulty during cognitive effort-based decision-making. Yet our findings are not completely discrepant, as we did observe evidence of the involvement of other control-related frontoparietal regions previously found to reflect decision difficulty in prior studies of the Cog-ED, including the anterior insula and the IPS 
(Culbreth et al., 2019;
Westbrook et al., 2019)
. Also, it is important to note that the current study using the Cog-ED, although similar to the prior work, had some design differences in how relative subjective value of options were manipulated across trials (e.g., more reward-load pairings, wider range of subjective value differences), and may have also engaged a different sample population (e.g., the prior work pre-screened participants to ensure maximal variability in behavioral subjective value estimates), which could help to explain the discrepancies across the current and previous Cog-ED studies. Similarly, the current design of the Cog-ED, decision difficulty is confounded with a need to override the "default" behavior of choosing the higheffort, high-reward option, which could help to explain the absence of decision difficulty effects in the dACC.
Given the heterogeneity of findings pertaining to dACC activity modulation as is relates to decision-making , it is important to contextualize the results of the current study within the broader literature. Namely, the present findings are not obviously consistent with theoretical accounts suggesting a key role for dACC in determining the expected value of control (EVC; 
Shenhav et al., 2013)
. In other words, we did not find evidence that the dACC reliably encoded decision difficulty, as would be predicted by the EVC account, although this pattern was observed in fronto-parietal regions. In contrast, the results more clearly support accounts in which dACC plays an important role in value comparison across choice options during effort-based decision-making 
(Chong et al., 2017;
Klein-Flugge et al., 2016)
 and other decision-making paradigms in both humans 
(Izuma et al., 2010;
Kolling et al., 2012)
 and non-human animals 
(Fouragnan et al., 2019)
 . Moreover, in a prior study that was designed to de-confound value comparison from decision difficulty, in order to stringently test these competing accounts, unique evidence was for a value comparison role of the dACC 
(Kolling et al., 2018
).
An important direction for further investigation of the role of dACC in domain-general effort-based decision making would be to utilize task paradigms that enable direct comparison of cognitive and physical effort domains 
(Bustamante et al., 2023)
. Such a study could further elucidate the specific role of the dACC in effort-based decision-making; specifically, potential double dissociations across cognitive and physical domains could be used to provide support for value comparison vs. EVC accounts. However, it should also be stressed that value comparison and decision difficulty hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive of one other and may reflect, as some have recently suggested, differences in the anatomical definition of the dACC across studies 
(Clairis & Lopez-Persem, 2023)
.
The current findings also point to the potential utility of investigating the neural mechanisms of cognitive effort-based decision-making in populations that may exhibit changes in such process. Our prior work suggests that the Cog-ED may be a particularly useful tool for investigating the neurobiological substrates underlying cognitive effort-based decision-making in both healthy older adults and those at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), finding evidence for reduced motivation to engage in cognitive effort within both populations 
(Aschenbrenner et al., 2023;
Crawford et al., 2023)
. The present study suggests the possibility that such effects might result from age-related changes in dACC functioning. Indeed, prior work has already pointed to the dACC as a particularly vulnerable structure to age-related pathological incursions, across both amyloid and tau 
(Holroyd, 2015;
Therriault et al., 2021)
; conversely, both structural and functional preservation of the dACC is linked to successful cognitive outcomes in older adults 
(Arenaza-Urquijo et al., 2019;
Pezzoli et al., 2023)
. As such, it is possible that age-related changes in cognitive effort-based decision-making result from early-stage pathological processes impacting medial prefrontal structures (e.g., dACC, dmPFC). Future work that combines behavioral and fMRI measures of cognitive effort discounting with PET measurements of agerelated pathology (i.e., characterizing the pathologic burden to the dACC specifically) will be best suited to disentangle the relationships across these variables and quantify the impact of agerelated pathological insults on dACC function and cognitive effort-based decision-making.
Although the current study had several strengths, including the assessment of decisionmaking across two distinct cognitive domains, enabling the quantification of domain-general neural mechanisms cognitive effort-based decision-making, there are some notable limitations.
As mentioned previously, the design of the Cog-ED, specifically regarding the separate valuation phase in which the high-effort, high-reward option was always presented first, may have inadvertently biased participants to choose the high-effort option. Future studies could evenly balance presentation of high and low-effort options during the valuation phase to mitigate this possibility. Additionally, the current study only used ROI-based analyses from regions used in prior work with the Cog-ED. Nevertheless, it is possible that with whole brain analyses there could be patterns consistent with the encoding of decision difficulty in other frontoparietal control regions or in medial prefrontal regions adjacent to the a priori ROIs we utilized to define the dACC. The ROI-based analyses of the current study were motivated by its limited sample size and statistical power. This constraint was primarily due to the technical challenges and greater expense of acquiring simultaneous PET-fMRI data. Offsetting this constraint is that our collection of such data provides the potential to link BOLD measures of neural activity with PET measures of dopamine receptor binding, which will form the basis of a future report.
Despite its limitations, the present study provides some of the first data demonstrating a domain-general value comparison role for the dACC during human cognitive effort-based decision-making. Importantly, activity modulation in this region predicted the likelihood of an individual choosing to engage with the task associated with higher cognitive effort. As such, these findings provide a useful launch point for future studies aimed investigating the potential role of dACC in mobilizing actions towards effortful behaviors in both health and disease, and across the lifespan, particularly in populations for which apathy is a clinical marker (e.g., pathological aging).

The color of each task level corresponds to the label that level of the task is given to avoid anchoring effects (e.g., 2-Back = "red"). 2) After task familiarization, participants complete the discounting phase in each domain separately during which they make a series of decisions about whether to repeat performance of a higher load-level of the task or instead perform the easiest load level. The offer amount for the low-effort option is stepwise titrated until the indifference point is reached. B) During neuroimaging participants are first presented with a valuation phase (six seconds) in which only the high-effort, high-reward option is shown. Following this, participants begin the decision-making phase of the trial (six seconds) in which two options are presented to them and they are instructed to choose the option they prefer. There is a jittered intertrial interval before the next trial begins. Importantly, the subjective value (SV) of the low-effort, low-reward option is systematically manipulated on each trial to bias participants to choose the low-("easy" = -1; "hard" = -0.2 to -0.1) and high-effort options ("hard" = 0.4 to 0.6; "easy" = 1) equally.

These models used single-trial RTs as a covariate to statistically control for effects of decision difficulty. For ease of interpretation, we transformed the values of the relative difference in subjective value in all multilevel models, such that positive values indicate higher subjective value for the high-effort, relative to the low-effort option.
