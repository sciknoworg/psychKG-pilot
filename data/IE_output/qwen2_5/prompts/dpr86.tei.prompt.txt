You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Threatening stimuli receive prioritized processing by our perceptual system, allowing them to "pop out" within noisy contexts compared to non-threatening ones 
(Hansen & Hansen, 1988;
LoBue, 2010;
LoBue & DeLoache, 2008;
Öhman, Flykt, et al., 2001;
Yang et al., 2007)
.
This prioritization is believed to be due to the access of threatening signals to an evolutionarily conserved subcortical route, commonly referred to as the "low road" 
(LeDoux, 1996)
. This subcortical pathway is thought to be faster than the cortical route to the amygdala, enabling the rapid bottom-up passaging of fearful information 
(Burra et al., 2019;
LeDoux, 1996;
Morris et al., 1998;
Vuilleumier et al., 2001
Vuilleumier et al., , 2003
. The classic dual-pathway model is in line with the basic emotion theory 
(Ekman, 1999)
, providing an explanation of how threatening stimuli effortlessly capture our attention. However, threatening stimuli often occur in contexts where we anticipate them and are therefore attentive to such context-relevant information. Indeed, recent evidence supporting the constructivist view of emotion 
(Barrett, 2006;
Barrett, 2017)
, highlights the influence of top-down factors on threat-related perceptual decision making 
(Glasgow et al., 2022;
Imbriano et al., 2020;
Sussman, Jin, et al., 2016)
. A critical question emerges when considering both bodies of literature, that is whether fearful signals from the low road plays an important role in fear perception when attention is endogenously focused on fear or emotion in general. Elucidating the cognitive and computational processes of this fundamental affective function is pivotal to inform ecologically valid models of emotion.
The determinant in accessing the low road is spatial frequency (SF) of the visually presented stimuli. According to the dual-pathway model, the low road consisting of primarily magnocellular neurons is sensitive to low spatial frequency (LSF) but not high spatial frequency (HSF) visual signals. Neuroscience research has supported the low road hypothesis 
(Carretié et al., 2007;
Ruiz-Soler & Beltran, 2006;
Vuilleumier et al., 2003)
. Notably, a study utilizing human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) demonstrated that LSF fearful faces elicited shorter latency reactivity in the amygdala compared to the fusiform face area (FFA), specifically for fearful faces 
(Méndez-Bértolo et al., 2016)
. Similarly, non-invasive neuroimaging and psychophysiology studies examining the effects of SF on threat detection have supported the low road in expediting the passage of threat-related information 
(Azevedo et al., 2018;
Carretie et al., 2007;
Vuilleumier et al., 2003)
. However, fast access to the amygdala does not warrant a reliance on LSF signals for threat perception. Contrary to neuroimaging findings, behavioral evidence regarding the importance of the low road in threatrelated perceptual decision making remains inconclusive (e.g., 
Smith and Schyns (2009);
Stein et al. (2014)
). In fact, no behavioral differences between LSF and HSF stimuli were found in the neuroimaging studies showing prioritized amygdala response to LSF fearful signals 
(Mendez-Bertolo et al., 2016;
Vuilleumier et al., 2003)
.
Furthermore, a crucial but understudied aspect of perceptual decision making regarding fearful stimuli is that they are rarely encountered suddenly, without any forewarning or prior knowledge. Instead, they often arise in familiar contexts where other environmental cues are present, and the observer has prior knowledge. For example, a speaker presenting to a group of notoriously critical experts would expect to see stern facial expressions when scanning the audience. Preexisting contextual knowledge aids observers in anticipating and detecting such threats. One way in which prior information influences threat detection is by endogenously directing attention towards anticipated signals, and as a results, the perceptual sensitivity of the attended object or feature is being sharpened 
(Jiang et al., 2013;
Summerfield & Egner, 2016)
.
A growing body of literature has shown that attention, when purposefully and voluntarily directed towards fearful (compared to neutral) targets, enhances fear-related perceptual decision making 
(Glasgow et al., 2022;
Imbriano et al., 2020;
Mohanty et al., 2023;
Sussman, Szekely, et al., 2016;
Sussman et al., 2017;
Szekely et al., 2017)
. On a neural level, this endogenous fearful-guided compared to neutral-guided attention evoked greater late positive potential (LPP) activity 
(Weinberg et al., 2012)
, indicating enhanced emotion processing.
Moreover, this fearful-guided attention increased amygdala responsivity to subsequently presented fearful stimuli 
(Sussman et al., 2017)
. These recent findings, in stark contrast to the classical model focusing on the bottom-up stimulus-driven pathway, have evidenced the modulation effect of top-down endogenous attention.
Effects of top-down modulation in emotion processing is consistent with the predictive processing framework, which suggests that the brain predicts relevant and likely information based on the context, and a percept is formed when top-down predictions align with bottomup sensory signals 
(Friston, 2010;
Mesulam, 1998;
Summerfield & Egner, 2009)
. Therefore, threat perception is influenced by both the physical characteristics of the stimulus and the endogenous attention that shapes top-down predictions. In this framework, LSF and HSF signals may play distinct roles in the interplay between bottom-up and top-down information processing. LSF signals are thought to carry coarse information to higher-order brain regions, which generate hypotheses about the visual objects within a context. Subsequently, HSF signals are used to test these hypotheses and reach a final conclusion about the identity of the visual objects 
(Bar, 2004)
. This suggests that if attention is already directed towards a specific target in a top-down manner and prediction is formed, LSF information may not be necessary, and only HSF information would be relevant for hypothesis testing.
To date, the behavioral consequences of the low-road hypothesis under emotion-guided attention remains unexamined. Consequently, it is unknown how different SF signals affect perceptual decision making under endogenous emotion-guided attention. Two competing hypotheses naturally arise when considering the low-road hypothesis under the predictive processing framework. The first hypothesis (hypothesis 1) is that the top-down fear-guided attention leverages the low road, such that LSF signals, instead of HSF signals, would drive the fear-related perceptual decision making. This would lead to a better behavioral performance of LSF than HSF fearful stimuli, especially under fear-guided attention. Alternatively (hypothesis 2), under endogenous fear-guided attention, the brain may directly employ HSF signals to determine whether the fearful target is present, which would lead to a better performance of HSF than LSF stimuli. In terms of the computational mechanism, it has been demonstrated that endogenous fear-guided attention enhances the efficiency of evidence accumulation (drift rate) and shifts the starting point to facilitate perceptual decision-making 
(Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008)
. Based on these findings, we further hypothesize that 1) fearguided attention compared to neutral-guided attention may enhance the drift rate of LSF fearful than HSF fearful signals, and shift the starting point of LSF than HSF signals towards a fearresponse decision, supporting hypothesis 1 , and 2) alternatively, fear-guided compared to neutral-guided attention may enhance the drift rate of HSF fearful than LSF fearful signals, and shift the starting point of HSF signals towards a fear-response decision, supporting hypothesis 2. We conducted four behavioral experiments to test these two hypotheses and to unveil the computational mechanisms. Below we presented a novel paradigm to examine perceptual decision making regarding emotional (fearful and happy) and neutral stimuli manipulating the SF content of the stimuli and endogenous attention (
[F]earful-, [H]appy-, [N]eutral-attention).
If the first hypothesis was supported, we would expect to see better performance in decisions about LSF than HSF stimuli, particularly for fearful stimuli under F-attention. If the second hypothesis was supported, we would expect to see better performance of HSF than LSF stimuli under F-attention. We then applied drift diffusion modeling (DDM) to examine the computational process leading up to the decision. Furthermore, given that the low road is supposed to be unique to fearful signals, and does not apply to positive signals, throughout our investigation, we also examined whether fear-related findings were unique by including happy-related decisions as a control. Finally, we ruled out alternative explanations of our main findings (Experiments 2-4).


Results
In Experiment 1, young adult participants (N = 53, female = 73.1%, mean age = 23.4 years old, SD = 5.3) viewed briefly presented HSF, LSF and broad (B)SF images of fearful (ff), neutral (nf) and happy (hf) faces ( 
Figure 1B)
. Their task was to decide whether presented faces were "fearful or not" in F-attention condition, "neutral or not" in N-attention condition and "happy or not" in H-attention condition. Such "A or Not A" design has been established in eliciting endogenous object-or emotion-guided attention 
(Summerfield et al., 2006;
Sussman et al., 2017)
. In addition, participants rated trial-by-trial confidence regarding their decisions.


Figure 1 | Experimental paradigms. A. Task description for the four experiments.
In Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, top-down endogenous attention is manipulated towards Fearful (F), Neutral (N), and Happy (H) emotion by asking participants to make decisions about whether faces are 'fearful or not' in the fearful-attention blocks, 'neutral or not' in the neutral-attention blocks, and 'happy or not' in the happy-attention blocks by pressing the 'YES' or 'NO' response keys as accurately and quickly as possible. In Experiment 3 participants decide whether the presented face is fearful or neutral, in Experiment 4 whether it is male or female, by pressing the 'F' or 'N' and 'M' or 'F' key, respectively. B. Stimuli space. 3 x 3 design for stim SF : Broad Spatial Frequency (BSF), High Spatial Frequency (HSF), and Low Spatial Frequency (LSF) and stim emo : fearful face (ff), neutral face (nf), and happy face (hf). For Experiment 4 happy stimuli are removed. C. Sample trial timeline. A fixation cross was presented for 1000 ms followed by the face stimulus for 100 ms, which is sandwiched between forward and backward visual masks for 300 ms each followed by a fixation cross. Participants are then asked to rate their confidence about the prior decision on a four-point scale from low to high confidence.  
(Figure 2A)
, people performed the worst in detecting LSF fearful targets.
Specifically, detecting LSF ff was worse than detecting HSF and BSF ff (t(52) = 10.71, p < .001 for HSF, t(52) = 15.59, p < .001 for BSF) and was also worse than rejecting LSF nontargets (nf and hf) (t(52) = 12.81, p < .001 for ff vs nf and t(52) = 13.83, p < .001 for ff vs hf).
In contrast to LSF, both HSF target and non-target stimuli were well decided (t(52) = 1.63, p = .996 for ff vs nf and t(52) = 4.43, p = .011 for ff vs hf  
Figure 1B)
. In contrast, no differences were found among attention conditions for HSF trials (all ps > .674). Similar to HSF, differences across attention conditions for d' were more attenuated for BSF trials (t(52) = 4.45, p = .001 for F vs H, t(52) = 1.50, p = .851 for F vs N, t(52) = 2.09, p = .494 for H vs N).


Emotion-guided attention induces conservative bias about LSF but not HSF information
As revealed in the decision criterion (c) of SDT, endogenous emotion-guided attention biased decision-making, an effect particularly strong for LSF (F(2.83, 147.05) = 55.60, p < .001, = .52, 
Figure 2C
). Overall, for LSF stimuli, participants endorsed a "no, not target" decision for both F-and H-attention but not N-attention, a pattern even more pronounced for Fcompared to H-attention (t(52) = 4.41, p = .002 for F vs H, t(52) = 8.31, p < .001 for H vs N).
The differences in c-criterion across attention conditions were again attenuated for HSF trials (t(52) = 4.80, p < .001 for F vs H, t(52) = 4.40, p = .002 for N vs H, t(52) = 0.40, p = 1.000 for F vs N) and BSF trials (t(52) = 4.89, p < .001 for F vs H; t(52) = 3.65, p = .016 for N vs H, t(52) = 0.76, p = .997 for F vs N). Also, under F-attention and H-attention, decisions were most conservative for LSF stimuli (all ps < .001), while more liberal decision-making for LSF compared to BSF and HSF was observed under N-attention (ps < .019).


Low confidence is reported for decisions about LSF stimuli
In addition to objective measures of performance, we also assessed subjective perception of decision-making performance using self-report measures. There was an interaction between stim emo and stim SF (F(2.97, 154.49) = 53.53, p < .001, = .507).
Consistent with accuracy and d', confidence was noticeably lower for LSF than HSF (all ps < .001), which in turn was lower than BSF (all ps < .01) across all attention and stim emo conditions.
For LSF conditions, the confidence ratings were lower overall, with minor differences among attention conditions (see Supplementary). For HSF, confidence was higher for emotional (ff and hf) than neutral (nf) stimuli and was not affected by endogenous attention (ps < .001). BSF showed a similar trend to HSF, as emotional were generally rated with higher confidence than their neutral counterpart (ps < .001). Overall, people showed consistently low confidence for decisions regarding LSF images, regardless of attention status and whether the presented stimulus was a target or non-target. Next, we used a hierarchical drift diffusion model (HDDM) approach 
(Wiecki et al., 2013)
 to examine the computational mechanisms underlying the behavioral results. Given the behavioral findings, it was expected that drift rate would be faster for HSF than LSF towards the "yes" decision under F-attention and H-attention, an effect dampened or nonexistent for Nattention. By comparing three models fit to the reaction time (RT) and decision data, we tested this computational hypothesis against alternative hypotheses that endogenous attention affects decision making by inducing a starting point bias (M2) and decision-threshold reflected in boundary separation (M3). For all models, we allowed drift rate to vary by stim SF (see
Methods).
Model convergence for the best fitting model was assessed visually and quantitatively (the Gelman-Rubin % statistic showed that all values were close to 1 and did not exceed 1.1, indicating the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains for all group-level and subjectlevel posterior parameter values converged successfully 
(Ulrichsen et al., 2020)
).
Supporting our DDM hypothesis, model comparison 
(Spiegelhalter et al., 2002)
 showed that the best-fitting model (M1) had drift rate vary as a function of attention, stim SF and trial type (represented in congruency: target-present decisions as "congruent" vs targetabsent decisions as "incongruent") (  Note: Three models (M1 -M3) were tested. Drift rate, v, represents the speed or efficiency of evidence accumulation in reaching either of the two decision boundaries. Starting point bias, z, represents the initial amount of bias in favor of either of the two decision choices, either "yes, this is the target face" or "no, this is not the target face". Boundary separation, a, reflects the distance or discriminability between the two subjective decision boundaries. Congruency: trial type property, based on actual stimulus emotion within attention blocks, resulting in "congruent" and "incongruent" trials. SF = Spatial frequency. DIC = Deviance Information Criterion, lower values indicate better model fit.
For all three attention conditions, the posterior parameter estimates of the best fitting model revealed that drift rates were the slowest for LSF compared to HSF and BSF trials for  We depict the evidence accumulation process supported by the winning model. Note that the drift rates for LSF target-presents trials were negative ( 
Supplementary Table 1
), hence they are directed to the lower boundary as indicated by an asterisk (*). The bias against detecting LSF emotional target cannot be explained by imbalanced


trial frequency
The ratio of target-present to target-absent trials was 1:2 in Experiment 1 to ensure an equal number of trials across stim emo . However, this may raise the question of whether the low detection rate of LSF emotional targets and the drift rate results were due to a response bias, although the imbalanced trial numbers applied to HSF and BSF trials as well. In Experiment 2
(N = 31, female = 74.2%, mean age = 24.8, SD = 9.9), the target-present and target-absent trials were equalized. The primary results for decision accuracy, model comparison, and drift rates of the winning model were strikingly similar to Experiment 1 ( 
Figure 4A, B
 and 
Supplementary Table 3
-5), reinforcing our findings.  LSF fearful information is misperceived as neutral.
Given the results of Experiments 1 and 2, it is possible that the low detection rate for LSF emotional targets was due to a response bias of making a "no" decision because LSF images were simply difficult to detect. Experiment 3, therefore, asked participants (N = 55, female = 74.5%, male = 23.6, non-disclosed = 1.8, mean age = 22.71, SD = 5.72) to focus on the emotion of the stimuli, this time making a "fearful or neutral" decision ( 
Figure 1A)
. As shown in 
Figure 4C
, the accuracy for LSF ff was significantly lower than HSF (t(54) = 10.18, p < .001) and BSF (t(54) = 13.47 p < .001). More importantly, the accuracy for LSF nf was much higher than LSF ff (t(54) = 8.09, p < .001) and the detection rate of the LSF ff was comparable to Experiments 1-2. These results supported that the low detection rate of LSF ff in our main experiment were not explained by a simple response bias towards "no". Instead, LSF ff stimuli were more likely to be perceived as neutral.


Inferior performance for LSF than HSF does not occur in gender-related decision making
Finally, to examine whether the inferior processing of LSF emotional information was specific to emotion-related decision making, Experiment 4 asked participants (N = 60, female = 75.0%, male = 23.3%, non-disclosed = 1.7%, mean age = 23.08, SD = 5.27) to make a gender identity decision, deciding whether a face was "male or female" using the same trial set as in Experiment 1 
(Figure 1A)
. Our results were consistent with existing literature 
(Vuilleumier et al., 2003)
, showing an overall comparable accuracy between HSF and LSF stimuli, except for hf stimuli 
(Figure 4D
, t(59) = 0.14, p = 1.00 for ff, t(59) = 0.53, p = 1.00 for nf, and t(59) = 4.02, p = .005 for hf). This indicates that the poorer performance of LSF compared to HSF is specific to emotion-related decision-making.


Discussion


Threat-related perceptual decision-making under emotion-guided attention does not rely on the low road.
Given its evolutionary salience, processing threat-related information has been of persisting interest in affective science research. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms is crucial in improving theories of emotion. The role of the low-road has been proposed to explain how threatening signals are prioritized and has also been debated in the past two decades 
(Maior et al., 2011;
Maior et al., 2012;
Öhman et al., 2007;
Pessoa & Adolphs, 2010;
Shang et al., 2015;
Tamietto & De Gelder, 2010;
Van Le et al., 2013;
Wei et al., 2015)
. Contrary to the rich neuroscience literature, behavioral studies directly examining the importance of the proposed low-road has been sparse, and the findings are inconclusive 
(McFadyen et al., 2017;
Stein et al., 2014;
Vuilleumier et al., 2003)
. Importantly, existent neural and behavioral studies have mostly focused on the bottom-up process, wherein identifying the emotion is not the task at hand. However, basic and affective science research has shown that sensory information processing is heavily influenced by top-down factors, such as endogenous attention and goals 
(Cohen & Maunsell, 2009;
Gilbert & Sigman, 2007;
Hopfinger et al., 2000)
. Thus, the present study sought to investigate the impact of the purported low road on perceptual decision making when identifying the emotion is the focus of attention.
To our knowledge, the current study is the first empirical work directly comparing HSF and LSF channels under endogenous emotion-related vs non-emotion-related attention conditions. We found no evidence supporting signals from the low road driving perceptual decisions under emotion-guided attention. Instead, when participants attended to fear, HSF fearful targets were detected with drastically lower accuracy (lower than chance), poorer perceptual sensitivity and more conservative response bias compared to LSF fearful targets.
Moreover, participants tended to misperceive LSF fearful stimuli as neutral. This indication is further supported by the subjective confidence rating being substantially lower for LSF trials.
We also ruled out the alternative explanations of imbalanced ratio of target present to target absent trials (Experiment 2), and pure "no" response bias due to inability to discriminate between emotional and neutral stimuli (Experiment 3). Results showed that this inferiority of LSF signals is specific to emotion but not gender identification task (Experiment 4). Using computational modeling, we found that when attending to fear, evidence accumulation for LSF is less efficient towards the fear-present decision, but more efficient towards the fear-absent decision compared to HSF.
Our results support previous research showing a bias for HSF images over LSF images in tasks that require identification of whether facial stimuli are expressive or not expressive 
(Schyns & Oliva, 1999)
 and require emotion identification between smiling and grimacing faces 
(Deruelle & Fagot, 2005)
. While prior research had suggested possible roles of HSF in emotion processing and emotion perception 
(De Cesarei & Codispoti, 2013;
Pessoa & Adolphs, 2010)
, the computational mechanisms remained unclear 
(Vuilleumier et al., 2003)
. The current findings clearly showed that when making emotion-related perceptual decisions, participants were less sensitive to emotional signals carried in LSF compared to HSF, impairing their evidence extraction which resulted in impaired emotion-related decision making.


When does endogenous attention facilitate emotion-related perceptual decision making?
For the BSF trials, fear-guided attention did not lead to better perceptual decision making or faster evidence accumulation than neutral-and happy-guided attention, which appears to be inconsistent from the recent literature 
(Ozturk et al., 2023;
Sussman et al., 2017
 Generalization to positive emotions.
While the low road seems to be specific to threatening stimuli 
(Méndez-Bértolo et al., 2016;
Öhman, Lundqvist, et al., 2001;
Öhman & Mineka, 2001
), the present study showed that poor detection of LSF emotional targets under endogenous attention is also occurs for happy stimuli. This suggests detecting emotional targets, threatening or happy, when endogenous attention is guided towards emotion, relies on HSF signals. In contrast to the two high-arousal emotions, when attention is guided towards neutral, people are more readily to endorse a neutral decision if the signals are in LSF 
(Experiments 1-3)
. In other words, LSF emotional signals are more likely to be perceived as non-emotional under emotion-guided attention. This suggests a potential functional dissociation of the two pathways such that the low road appears to be specific to bottom-up threatening information processing whereas HSF information carries both positive-and negative-valenced emotional information for top-down modulated processing. This is in line with prior research showing that distinct neural substrates have been evident for the processing of emotional stimuli depending on the relevance of the emotional content to the task 
(Critchley et al., 2000;
Keightley et al., 2003;
Lange et al., 2003;
Scheuerecker et al., 2007)
, implying that different brain regions and, thus, different modes of processes are recruited.


Reconceptualizing the dual-pathway model in emotion-related perceptual decision making under predictive processing
Our results demonstrate that LSF emotional information processing is suppressed under emotion-guided attention, leaving HSF emotional information to drive the perception. In light of the current findings and considering previous research supporting the low road hypothesis, it is plausible that when humans are not paying attention to emotion, threatening object captures attention via sending the "gist" through the low road, relying on the LSF information 
(De Cesarei & Codispoti, 2013;
Vuilleumier et al., 2003)
. Here, the amygdala may serve the function of saliency detection, responding to the LSF threatening signals by broadcasting the salient information to higher-order brain regions (e.g., prefrontal and temporal regions 
(Méndez-Bértolo et al., 2016;
Pessoa & Adolphs, 2010)
, leading to re-orientation of attention to the salient object through the attention network 
(Adolphs, 2008;
Vuilleumier, 2005)
. A topdown hypothesis about what the object might be is likely generated in the prefrontal regions (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been shown to carry the top-down perceptual set 
(Summerfield et al., 2006)
). HSF signals in the occipital-temporal areas are then needed to confirm such predictions 
(Bar, 2004;
Vuilleumier et al., 2003)
. When endogenous attention is already on emotion, higher order brain regions can directly use the finer HSF signals for emotion identification. Previous neuroimaging research has shown that BSF fearful faces evoked stronger amygdala response under top-down fear-attention 
(Sussman et al., 2017)
, which may be driven by HSF fearful signals, post processing of ventral face-sensitive regions.
From a predictive processing perspective, the saliency of an unexpected threat can be carried out by a large prediction error, signaled by the amygdala, as shown in the classic low road findings 
(Méndez-Bértolo et al., 2016;
Vuilleumier et al., 2003)
. Under emotion-guided endogenous attention, the brain focuses on the HSF signals to drive the perceptual decision, suppressing the LSF signal processing to save energy. Such flexibility in top-down modulated bottom-up information processing aligns well with the constructivist view of emotion 
(Barrett, 2006;
Lindquist et al., 2016)
.


Limitations and future directions
We do not claim from the current study that the magnocellular-mediated low road is inactive under top-down emotion guidance. It remains an empirical question whether LSF threatening stimuli still evokes an earlier and/or stronger amygdala response under emotionguided endogenous attention. If LSF-preferred amygdala response is not present, it would indicate that the top-down modulation happens either at the amygdala or earlier stages, blocking the low-road threat-related information to the amygdala. Future neuroimaging research is needed to examine these possibilities. In addition, future research may investigate whether other top-down factors, such as probability-or context-induced expectations show similar or distinctive influences. Another limitation is the nature of the stimuli used. Human facial expression is a widely used type of stimuli to study emotion perception. It is also particularly well-suited for studying the low-road hypothesis, as these faces contain evolutionary saliency 
(Vuilleumier et al., 2003)
. However, future research using other types of intrinsically threatening stimuli, such as snakes and insects, is needed for testing the generalizability of the current findings. Finally, our participants are largely Asian with the majority of them being female. Future research investigating the generalizability of the current findings to other demographic populations is needed.
Our findings have important implications for emotion-related psychopathology, such as seen in anxiety disorders, which are characterized by hypersensitivity to detecting threats 
(Bar-Haim et al., 2007;
Bradley et al., 1999;
Cisler & Koster, 2010)
. Attentional biases towards threat have long been a focus of anxiety psychopathology research. However, such biases have been largely studied using the bottom-up, stimulus-driven approach. This is antithetical to the cognitive behavioral models of anxiety, which highlight top-down anxious apprehension 
(Engels et al., 2007;
Nitschke et al., 1999)
. Recently, individual differences in using threat attention to guide subsequent threat-related perceptual decision making has been linked to clinical anxiety 
(Glasgow et al., 2022)
. Based on the current findings, individuals with hypersensitivity of threat may have impairments dampening the reliance on LSF channels under top-down guidance. Future studies shall examine whether this variance is related to anxiety sensitivity or anxious apprehension.


Conclusions
Perception of the emotional nature of an object is a primitive in emotional experience 
(Russell, 2003)
. Building on the bottom-up stimulus-driven, and top-down attentionmodulation literatures, the current study investigated the psychological and computational mechanisms of threat-related perceptual decision making under endogenous attention guidance and expanded the examination to include positive emotion. Findings from this study do not support the classic low road hypothesis in perceptual decision making under emotion-guided attention and are in line with the predictive processing framework and the constructivist view of emotion 
(Barrett, 2017)
. These findings provide important insights into the cognitive processes of emotion perception, cast novel questions for future affective neuroscience research, and will help theorization of psychological emotion processing.


Methodology


Participants
For all four experiments, a separate independent young adult sample was recruited via mass email, study posters, and word-of-mouth at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and the surrounding community. Participants were required to have good command of the English language (the educational language of HKU). Exclusion criteria included history of traumatic brain injury, gross cognitive impairment, active psychotic episodes, neurological illnesses, active pregnancy, or actively using substances. Given that no prior studies have used the same paradigm, an a priori sample size of 35 participants was determined based on a power analysis using G*Power 3.1 
(Faul et al., 2009;
Faul et al., 2007)
 to detect a medium effect size (f = 0.25), based on a .05 level of significance and .95 statistical power.
Participants were excluded from analyses if poor quality of performance was suspected (e.g., distraction or sleepiness) during data acquisition. Furthermore, data was excluded if more than 40% of trials had confidence ratings which were endorsed as randomly presented.
Accordingly, behavioral and computational modelling analyses were conducted for 53 participants in Experiment 1 (women = 73.1%, men = 26.9%, mean age = 23.4 years old, SD = 5.3 years old), 31 participants in Experiment 2 (women = 74.2%, men = 25.8, mean age = 24.8, SD = 9.9), 55 participants in Experiment 3 (women = 74.5%, men = 23.6%, non-disclosed = 1.8%, mean age = 22.7, SD = 5.7), and 60 participants in Experiment 4 (women = 75.0%, male = 23.3%, non-disclosed = 1.7%, mean age = 23.1, SD = 5.3).
Participants provided written informed consent and were compensated (HK$ 50 / US$ 6.40) for taking part in the study. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) at HKU.


Emotion-related Perceptual Decision-Making Experiments
Stimuli. Facial images consisting of fearful (ff), neutral (nf), and happy (hf) face expressions (i.e., stim emo : ff, nf, hf) were selected from the HKU Face Database 
(Chuk et al., 2017
) consisting of two female and three male identities (ID). These fifteen color images (5 IDs x 3 stim emos ) were first processed using Adobe Photoshop to create 300 x 300-pixel jpeg grayscale images cropped to include eyebrows and lips and exclude hair, which were touched up manually. Using a proprietary MATLAB (R2020b) script, each of the fifteen grayscale images was normalized for luminance and contrast (root-mean-square contrast, RMS = 0.25).
Using Fast Fourier Transform to equalize all images, the average amplitude spectrum of all fifteen broad spatial frequency (BSF) images and the phase spectrum of each individual image were obtained. Using second-order Butterworth filters, the 15 BSF images were filtered into 15 low spatial frequency (LSF) images using a cut-off of 6 cycles/image and 15 high spatial frequency (HSF) images using a cut-off of 24 cycles/image as represented by the sample stimuli space in 
Figure 1B
. Forward-and backward-masks were created by randomly rotating BSF images by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees or 360 degrees and adding phase perturbed noise patterns using a random von Mises distribution to the individual phase spectrum. Stimuli presented subtended 9.8° of visual angle, which resulted in spatial frequency (SF) cut-offs of 2.44 and 0.61 cycles per degree for HSF and LSF images respectively.
Attention-guided emotion-related perceptual decision-making task (Experiment 1-2). In Experiment 1 participants completed a novel computerized perceptual decision-making task delivered using PsychoPy version 3 
(Peirce et al., 2019)
. Endogenous attention was manipulated at the block level by instructing participants to decide whether each face presented in the block was "fearful or not" in the fearful (F)-attention blocks; "neutral or not" in the neutral (N)-attention blocks; or "happy or not" in the happy (H)-attention blocks 
(Figure 1A)
.
Each trial began with a fixation cross for 1000 ms, followed by a forward-mask for 300 ms, the face stimulus for 100 ms, and a backward-mask for 300 ms. Upon stimulus onset, participants responded as quickly and accurately as possible by pressing one of two adjacent keys, marked by "yes" (is the target emotion) and "no" (not the target emotion), on a qwerty keyboard using the index and middle fingers of their dominant hand. Next, participants rated how confident they were about the preceding decision from low to high on a four-point scale using a slider on the screen 
(Figure 1C)
. Their initial decision, response time (RT), and confidence rating (1 -4, on a 4-point scale) were recorded.
Each block consisted of 27 trials (three trials per stim SF and stim emo condition). Stimuli presentation was pseudo-randomized such that the same stimulus emotion (ff, nf, hf) and the same SF (BSF, HSF, LSF) were not presented consecutively more than two times. Each set of blocks consisted of one F-attention block, one N-attention block and one H-attention block, with the exact same trial sequence. There were five sets, resulting in 15 blocks and 405 trials in total. The sequence of attention-block presentation was counterbalanced across participants.
Prior to actual data collection, participants completed three practice blocks consisting of six trials each.
For Experiment 2, the same stimuli and block pattern was used as in Experiment 1, with the differences being that the ratio of target-present to target absent trials was equalised and confidence ratings were removed.
Simple emotion discrimination task. Experiment 3 consisted of two stim emo (ff, nf) and three stim SF (BSF, HSF, LSF), with happy face (hf) images removed from the stimuli space ( 
Figure 1A)
. Participants made a "fearful or neutral" decision by pressing one of two adjacent keys marked with "F" and "N" respectively. The task consisted of six blocks of 30 trials.
Gender-discrimination task. In Experiment 4, participants decided whether a face was "male" or "female" by pressing one of two adjacent keys marked by with "M" and "F" ( 
Figure   1A
). The stimuli space was the same as in Experiment 1 and 2, apart from that two identities per gender were used. This task consisted of 10 blocks with 36 trials each.


Equipment
A calibrated Dell (Latitude 3500) laptop computer attached to a keyboard and mouse were set atop an adjustable riser on a table. Prior to use, the 15.6-inch laptop screen monitor (1920 x 1080 pixels) was calibrated using a Konica-Minolta Photometer (CS-100A) to measure luminance values and apply gamma correction to linearize the monitor response. For each participant, the adjustable riser was positioned to ensure that the center of the monitor screen was at the eye-level of the participant. Participants were seated 60 cm from the monitor screen.


Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics, correlations, dependent t-tests and repeated measures analysis of variance (rmANOVA) were conducted using Jamovi version 2.2.5 (Jamovi project, 2022). All significance tests were evaluated at p = .05.


Accuracy and Signal Detection Theory (SDT).
Three-way and two-way rmANOVAs were conducted including stim SF (BSF, HSF, LSF) x stim emo (ff, nf, hf)), and, if appropriate x attention (F, N, H). RmANOVAs were conducted for accuracy, and confidence ratings of all trials. Perceptual sensitivity (d') and response bias (c) were measured using Signal Detection Theory (SDT) with equal variance Gaussian assumptions 
(Green & Swets, 1966)
. Two-way attention x stim SF rmANOVAs were conducted for (d'), (c), hit rate (HR), and false alarm rate (FAR).
Hierarchical Drift Diffusion Model (HDDM) Analysis. After establishing the behavioral findings, we used the drift diffusion model (DDM) to investigate the hidden computational processes in Experiment 1-2. DDM has been used to model the cognitive processes that describe a 'simple, relatively fast, single-stage, two-choice' decision task 
(Evans & Wagenmakers, 2020;
Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008)
. In contrast to the SDT measures, which only considers choice data, DDM uses the composite of choice and RT data to evaluate the perceptual decision-making process. According to the DDM theory, decision choices result from comparing and accumulating evidence in favor of one or another alternative until the evidence accumulated surpasses the subjective decision boundary of one of the two options.
The duration of the encoding and response stages are combined and captured by a single nondecision parameter, often denoted as Ter. The decision-choice comparison stage is usually parameterized by three variables: drift rate, denoted as v; starting point bias, denoted as z; and boundary separation, denoted as a. Drift rate reflects the speed or efficiency of evidence accumulation in reaching either of the two decision boundaries. Starting point bias reflects the initial amount of bias in favour of one option. Boundary separation reflects the distance or discriminability between the two subjective decision boundaries. The speed of any decision trial, given by RT, comprises the duration of the above stages 
(Ratcliff, 1978;
Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008;
Ratcliff & Tuerlinckx, 2002)
.
The experimental paradigm was formulated such that the upper decision boundary represented the "Yes" decision and the lower decision boundary represented the "No" decision.
Based on this setup, a positive drift rate would indicate evidence accumulation towards the "Yes" boundary and a negative drift rate would indicate evidence accumulation towards the "No" boundary. A starting point located equidistant between the upper and lower decision boundaries would indicate no starting point bias. In contrast, a starting point located closer to the upper decision boundary would indicate a starting bias favoring the "Yes" decision, while a starting point located closer to the lower decision boundary would indicate a starting bias favoring the "No" decision.
For DDM analysis only, individual trials with RTs greater than 4000 ms were excluded (trials excluded = 181, 0.8% for Experiment 1, and trials excluded = 74, 0.44% for Experiment 2), yielding across all participants a total of 21,284 valid trials for Experiment 1, and 16,740 valid trials for Experiment 2. Some studies using HDDM have excluded fast trials less than 150 ms to 300 ms and slow trials greater than 2500 ms to 5000 ms 
(Lawlor et al., 2020;
Son et al., 2019)
. However, this choice is somewhat arbitrary 
(Ratcliff, 1985;
Ratcliff & Tuerlinckx, 2002;
Ratcliff et al., 1999)
. We chose a compromise, noting that a lower cut-off at 150 ms would have excluded 8 trials (0.04%) for Experiment 1 and 53 trials (0.32%) for Experiment Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods to fit a given model to the choice and RT data by generating the joint posterior distributions for the estimated parameters. For each model tested, 2,000 samples were drawn from the posterior distributions of v, z, a, and Ter with 1,000 burnin samples for chain stabilization and thinning at 5 using the hddm.HDDM function. To ensure robustness against outliers, all models assumed 5% of trials were outliers from a uniform distribution, not generated from the DDM process 
(Ulrichsen et al., 2020)
. Convergence of MCMC was assessed graphically using trace and autocorrelation plots; and quantitatively using the Gelman-Rubin % statistic on five chains to ascertain all values below the recommended threshold of 1.1, which indicates proper convergence 
(Brooks & Gelman, 1998)
. After ensuring that MCMC was converged, model fit was assessed for each model using the Deviance Information Criteria 
(DIC, Spiegelhalter et al. (2002)
), which assesses goodness-of-fit while penalizing model complexity. Model selection of the best-fitting model was performed by
comparing DIC values and identifying the model with the lowest DIC value.
Three DDM models were tested (see 
Table 1
). Since the focus of this study pertained to the decision-choice comparison stage in decision-making, all models specified in the analysis were constrained using a subject-level estimate for Ter across all conditions. Models 1-3 reflected our hypotheses regarding what decision-making components were influenced by emotion-guided attention, stim emo , and stim SF . Drift rate is known to be affected by the quality of the stimulus (e.g., difficulty) and the match between the signal and the internal representation or template 
(Ratcliff, 1978;
Ratcliff et al., 2004)
. As the task required participants to decide whether sensory signals match the target of the attention, we allowed drift rate to vary by trial type (target-present or target-absent) for all models. We then further considered the following aspects for hypothesis testing. For Model1 (M1), the following factors were considered. If the top-down prediction had a preferred stim SF , then splitting drift rate by stim SF would yield a good fitness of the model. Also, based on previous research showing that attention sharpens perceptual sensitivity 
(Summerfield & Egner, 2016)
 We further evaluated the best-fitting model by conducting a posterior predictive check (PPC), comparing the actual data and the simulated data generated by the best-fitting model (see 
Supplementary Table 2
). We investigated whether the actual statistics fall within the 95% credible interval based on Bayesian hypothesis testing.

both target-present and target-absent conditions (all posterior probabilities > .996), indicating an overall inferior evidence accumulation efficiency for LSF signals. Furthermore, within LSF, compared to N-attention, F-attention and H-attention showed slower evidence accumulation towards the target-present ("yes") decision (posterior probabilities > .999) but faster evidence accumulation towards the target-absent ("no") decision (posterior probabilities > .999). This indicates a biased evidence accumulation against making a target-present decision but favoring a target-absent decision when emotional information is carried in LSF. For HSF, drift rate was faster for H-attention than F-attention and N-attention towards the target-present decision (posterior probabilities > .999), while, for the target-absent decision, drift rate for H-attention was slower compared to N-attention (posterior probability = .994), but not compared to Fattention (posterior probability = .217), indicating faster evidence accumulation towards detecting hf targets. These DDM results provided a computational mechanistic explanation for behavioral findings, supporting that emotion-guided attention biased against accumulating LSF emotional evidence. Also, under emotion-guided attention, emotion-related evidence accumulation relies on HSF instead of LSF signals.

, we hypothesized that attention would further affect drift rate. As such, M1 was formulated to allow the drift rate to vary as a function of trial type (target-present and target-absent), stim SF (LSF, HSF, and BSF) and attention (F, N, and H). Compared to M1, Model 2 (M2) tested whether endogenous attention affected the starting point bias instead of the drift rate. The rationale was that detecting a fearful or happy target contains evolutionary saliency. Thus, it is possible that under F-and H-attention the starting point was biased towards a "Yes" decision boundary compared to under N-attention condition. Consequently, M2 was formulated to allow the drift rate to vary as a function of trial type and stim SF and starting point to vary as a function of attention. Finally, Model 3 (M3) tested whether endogenous attention affected boundary separation. Boundary separation is affected by the speed-accuracy trade off. It is possible that people needed less evidence to make a decision under F-and H-attention compared to under N-attention due to their salience. Thus, attention might affect boundary separation instead of starting point or drift rate. As such, M3 was formulated to allow drift rate to vary as a function of trial type and stim SF and boundary separation to vary as a function of attention. Model comparison would provide empirical evidence delineating the roles of stimSF and emotion-guided attention in decision-making. Specifically, comparing among Models 1, 2 and 3 would provide empirical evidence on whether attention was best conceptualized as affecting evidence accumulation efficiency, inducing a starting point bias, or changing the amount of evidence needed.

Their aim was to isolate the top-down effect when the bottom-up signals of fearful and neutral faces are perceptually equalized. The current study was instead focused on how endogenous attention interacts with physical stimulus features to influence perceptual decision making. Therefore, the present study did not equalize the perceptual thresholds between fearful and neutral, or between different SF levels. Our contrast level was fixed and equalized across stimuli and subjects. Combining the current findings with the existing literature indicate that the facilitatory effect of fear-guided attention on fear-related perceptual decision making may be pronounced only when the stimuli are degraded, and the processing of bottom-up signals is equalized at the subjective perceptual level. When physical properties are equalized objectively, there may not be a stronger facilitatory effect for fear-guided attention compared to neutral-guided attention.
).
A key difference in design may help explain this discrepancy. Sussman et al. (2017) presented
fearful and neutral face stimuli at each participant's perceptual threshold obtained using a
staircasing procedure. This means that different participants saw stimuli at different contrast levels, and within subject the fearful and neutral faces were presented at possibly different contrast levels.
