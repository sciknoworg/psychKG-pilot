You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
The perception of space and time has recently become a major focus among cognitive and behavioral neuroscientists 
(Eichenbaum, 2017;
Green, Myerson, Mcfadden, 1997;
Whelan & Mchugh, 2009)
. One area of intersection between these two dimensions is in the discounting of large, delayed rewards for more immediate, smaller ones. In the time domain, this is known as temporal discounting, in which the subject will favor a smaller reward if it is provided sooner instead of a larger reward for which the subject must wait longer. In the space domain, known as spatial discounting, subjects favor a smaller, closer reward over a larger, farther reward. In either dimension, subjects discount progressively farther rewards, with the value of the larger reward as an intermediary factor. While much previous research exists on temporal discounting, very few studies have investigated spatial discounting or the joint effects of spatial and temporal discounting.
Research on spatial and temporal discounting has suggested that the perception of space and time are not independent constructs, and that humans are unable to ignore spatial information when estimating duration. Similarly, recent research suggests time is mentally represented as a spatial construct and does not function independently of space 
(Oliveri, Koch, & Caltagirone, 2009;
Bonato, Zorzi, & Umiltà, 2012;
Xuan, Zhang, He, & Chen, 2007)
. Yet, other studies have shown an asymmetrical relationship between the two dimensions, where the perception of space is dependent on temporal information, but the perception of time can be evaluated without spatial information 
(Casasanto and Boroditsky, 2008)
. This effect is also present in children 
(Casasanto, Fotakopoulou, & Boroditsky, 2010)
. These results are in line with other studies that have concluded that while spatial and temporal dimensions are surely interrelated, they are divisible dimensions. 
(Bottini & Casasanto, 2013;
Riemer, Shine, & Wolbers, 2018;
Garner, 1976;
Lakoff and Johnson, 1999)
 Given the existing breadth of knowledge on the interaction between spatial and temporal perception, work by O'Connor and colleagues (2013) sought to determine whether a monetary reward would be discounted when the spatial distance to attain the reward increased. The researchers created a task in which subjects were required to indicate if an object presented on a 3D display was a sphere or a cube. The objects presented on the screen were manipulated to appear in either close or far space. The perception of distance for the objects was maintained by displaying stimuli within the context of the Ponzo Illusion. Due to object size being used to simulate proximal distance, a second spatial task was also employed. The results concluded that subjects responded faster to high reward objects but only when those objects were located closer in space with no difference in response speed when the object was presented farther in space. Further, these authors found that response to rewards that were equal in monetary value were influenced by spatial distance, with the speed with which the reward items were chosen decreasing with increasing spatial distance.
Additional research conducted by 
Stevens and colleagues (2005)
 found that the perception of spatial and temporal discounting relied on context specific information in two species of monkeys, and this context heavily relied on ecological and adaptive contexts that are specific to each species. Still, the distance to a larger reward significantly affected the decision to choose the reward across both species.
While both of these studies provide evidence of the effects of spatial discounting on reward valuation and decision making, the study conducted by O'Connor and colleagues 
2013
utilized reaction time to account for the influence of the temporal domain on spatial discounting wherein participants were required to press a preassigned key to select their reward. This design, while useful in determining how quickly a participant will make a choice based on spatial location of a reward, may not encompass the subjective effects of needing to wait or travel a temporal interval to attain a reward, making the participants reaction time for choosing the reward largely due to the spatial proximity and still leaving open the question of whether spatial and temporal domains are perceived as distinct.
While previous research has provided an abundance of evidence for the relationship between the temporal and spatial dimensions individually, spatial and temporal discounting has rarely been jointly assessed in humans. In addition to the above disparities, a confound arises in previous studies of spatial discounting where the distance to reach a target is linked with the time it will take to reach it. That is, participants may not be discounting spatial distance at all and only take into account the duration. Motivated by these discrepancies and possible alternatives, the current study investigated spatial and temporal discounting with the use of virtual reality in order to investigate spatial discounting in which individual differences in perception of space may affect a participant's choice of reward when the rewards are presented at varying distances. Our intention was to first establish if temporal and spatial discounting were a distinct or shared aspect of delay discounting as a whole, or if these were separable components, and then determine if spatial discounting could be disentangled from temporal discounting.


Method


Subjects
A total of 60 subjects, ages 18-35 years old, were recruited from the student population of George Mason University. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment and all protocols were approved by the University Institutional Review Board. All subjects were right-handed, healthy individuals without any history of neurologic or psychiatric illness. The sample size for all three experiments used a comparable sample size to previous studies on this topic, including the study conducted by O'Connor and Colleagues (2013) which helped form our motivation for the current study.


Presentation
Stimuli for the experiment were presented in a virtual-reality (VR) environment created using Vizard software, versions 4.0 (Exp 1 & 2) and 5.0 (Exp 3) (Worldviz). Both the design of the VR environment and the discounting task were modeled after the environment from our previous work 
(Wiener, Michaelis, & Thompson, 2016)
 and by 
Petzschner and Glasauer (2011)
. The VR environment resembled a desert with a textured ground, 20 scattered rocks in the distance, and a clear, sunny sky ( 
Figure 1)
. The sky was a simulated 3D dome included in Vizard software, a black and white noise image was used to create the ground texture, and a single rock was modified and imported from SketchUp 3D (Trimble Navigation) and replicated within the VR script. The construction of the VR world was such that environmental distance cues were either absent or unreliable: the initial location of the viewpoint and the position and orientation of each of the rocks was randomized at the start of every trial, and the 3D sky was such that the horizon always appeared to be a constant distance away. Participants controlled the movement of the viewpoint with a joystick (Exp 1 & 2) or a hand-held gaming controller (Exp 3; Xbox, Microsoft); the eye height of the VR viewpoint was set to the approximate eye height of the participant. For all temporal and spatial discounting tasks described below, participants were choosing between monetary rewards of different value. In order to ensure motivation, participants were informed that they would be given one of their chosen rewards at random at the end of the session. 


Experiment 1: Temporal and Spatial Discounting


Method
A total of 20 participants participated in Experiment 1. All participants were asked to attend one experimental session, in which they were required to make judgments about monetary rewards and delays. A temporal discounting and spatial discounting task were administered, with order of presentation counterbalanced between subjects. For the temporal discounting task, subjects were presented with two boxes on the screen with a monetary reward and asked to choose between the two. One reward, always the smaller of the two, was kept constant ($0.03) while the other, larger reward varied between trials in five, logarithmically spaced steps ($0.07, 0.22, 0.64, 1.87, 5.50).
In addition, the delay for receiving each reward varied, with the short reward always lasting 5.3s and the larger reward varying over five log-spaced intervals 
(6.21s, 9.79, 16.1, 33.4, 75.75)
. These intervals were chosen to match the intervals presented in the spatial discounting task (see below). The values for each reward were shown for 2s and then removed. Subjects indicated which choice they wanted to pick with a button press, and were then required to hold down that button for the presented period of time. Upon selection, all stimuli were extinguished from the screen and subjects were presented with instructions to wait with button depressed for the chosen amount of time. When the required interval had elapsed, the trial ended and subjects were presented with a 2s inter-trial-interval while viewing a fixation cross. The side of presentation of each reward was randomized between trials for each participant.
For the spatial discounting task, subjects were placed in the VR environment as described above. Two 3D boxes were again presented to the subject, but at variable distances.
Similar to the temporal discounting task, the closer box was always set at the lower reward, and at a fixed distance (5m). The larger reward location varied away from the subject at five log-spaced distances 
(8.5m, 12, 20.9, 42.6, 96)
. At the start of a trial, both reward values were presented to the subject for 1s before extinguishing. Subjects were then required to move the viewpoint via the joystick until they collided with their chosen reward. Upon collision, the trial would end and subjects were presented with a fixation cross on a black screen for an intertrial-interval of 2s. Movement in the VR environment occurred at a constant speed (1.3m/s).
For both temporal and spatial discounting tasks, participants performed a total of 100 trials each, with 20 trials for each of the five values; within each value, each duration/distance was presented four times.


Results
We began by analyzing behavioral responses according to theories of temporal and delay discounting 
(Green & Myerson, 2004)
. Specifically, we modeled choices as a hyperbolic discounting function of the form:
= 1 +
Where the subjective value (V) of any reward can be characterized by a two-parameter function of the delay (t). In this function, the parameter K serves as a discounting constant, with lower values indicating a greater propensity to choose the larger, delayed reward and higher values indicating a greater likelihood of choosing the smaller, closer reward, whereas the parameter A is the value of the reward. Fitting was accomplished using Maximum Likelihood estimation of single-trial responses 
(Peters, et al. 2011;
Lau, 2013;
van den Bos, et al. 2015)
.  The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated that subjects are capable of performing temporal or spatial discounting to a similar degree. Further, they revealed no major differences in how subjects discount time or distance for monetary rewards on the suprasecond scale.
However, one limitation of the above design is that, in the spatial discounting task, subjects walked to chosen rewards at a fixed speed; while this ensured that the durations were wellmatched between temporal and spatial discounting conditions, one possibility is that, in the spatial discounting task, subjects were not incorporating distance into their judgments of value at all, but were instead relying on an estimate of time to reach each reward. Although recent work suggests that subjects underestimate the time it will take to reach a target location , the fact that discounting rates did not differ between both suggests either separate mechanisms for discounting time and space that produce a single metric, or a unitary mechanism that only takes time, and not space, into account. To address this, we conducted a second experiment in which subjects performed only the spatial discounting task, but with the walking speed as an additional variable between trials.


Methods
A total of 20 participants participated in Experiment 2. All were naïve to the experimental design and none had participated in Experiment 1. All participants were presented with the spatial discounting task as described above. The values and distances were once again all the same. In addition, we covaried the walking speed between trial at five logspaced values (0.7m/s, 1, 1.4, 1.9, 2.6). Each participant performed two blocks of 125 trials, for a total of 250 trials; 50 trials were run for each of the five speeds, with 10 trials of each of the five distances and two trials of each value within each distance. All participants were again provided one of their chosen rewards at random at the end of the session.


Results
We repeated the above analysis as described, except that separate discounting functions were fit for all five speed values, yielding five discounting constants (K). One subject produced values of K that were beyond three standard deviations from the mean, and was removed from further analysis. Additionally, we observed for some subjects, for some speeds, negative values of K (7%). In this case, negative values represent an output of the model fitting procedure when a subject only ever chooses the farther reward, resulting in a flat discounting function.
To accommodate these values, we transformed all negative values of K to zero; we note that an additional analysis, in which negative values were removed entirely, provided the same results. A repeated measures ANOVA with speed as a within-subjects factor revealed a significant effect of movement speed [F(2.077,37.384) 1* =6.215, p = 0.004, h 2 =0.257],
demonstrating that, as the walking speed increased, values of K decreased, with subjects being more likely to choose the farther reward 
(Figure 3a)
. While the above finding demonstrated that faster speeds did engender less discounting of the farther reward, it does not alone demonstrate whether subjects were discounting time and distance separately. To address this question, we examined the distribution of walking speeds, distances, and the times taken to reach the farther reward. Because we parametrically varied walking speed and distance, there would be different distances that could be reached in the same amount of time. Thus, if distance were a factor, independent of time, participants should discount a farther reward, even if it takes the same amount of time to reach it. We binned walking times into 8 intervals for which multiple distances existed that would be reached in the same interval 
[4.2s, 7, 9.6, 14.08, 20.6, 32.4, 46.5, 64.7]
 
(Figure 4)
. 
Figure 4
 -Binning of intervals by distance. Both matrices display the various durations to reach each of the farther rewards, depending on the distance and speed to reach that reward. Displayed values are the intervals in seconds. The colors of each cell represent the bins those intervals were placed in for subsequent analyses; the white cells in the upper right corner were not similar to any other interval and so were not included in additional analyses.
We began by first analyzing each bin separately, to see if within each interval subjects were less likely to choose the longer reward with increasing distance. For those bins with three or more distances we conducted separated repeated measures ANOVAs with distance as a within-subjects factor; the remaining two bins with two distances within were compared via Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests. A Bonferroni correction was applied to maintain a testwise alpha of 0.05 at a corrected threshold of 0.00625. Results of this analysis are displayed in 
Table 1
 and displayed in 
Figure 5a
. We observed a significant impact of distance within each of the first five intervals, but no effect for the remaining three intervals, demonstrating that, Experiment 2 Experiment 3
within these intervals, when the distance of the larger reward increased, subjects were less likely to pick that reward, even if it took the same amount of time to reach it as a closer reward.


Table 1
To address the possibility that our above analysis was driven by multiple tests or our binning strategy, and to further investigate if a link between distance and discounting exists independent of duration, we also conducted a linear mixed effects analysis of mean choice data. Here, we regressed the average proportion of picking the farther reward across tested values with the distance and duration (un-binned) to reach that reward as separate fixed effects and subject as a random effect. Here, when controlling for duration, we also found a significant fixed effect of distance [b = -0.0029, 95% confidence interval: -0.0037 --0.002, t(457)= -6.442, p<0.001] again suggesting that subjects were less likely to choose the farther reward when the duration was held constant. Here, an effect of distance is also observed, but not for very short intervals, suggesting that when the speed to reach a farther reward is very fast, and the distances are close, disparities in distance have little impact on discounting. Error bars represent SE.


Experiment 3: Immersive VR and Spatial Discounting
For experiment 3, we anticipated that the use of virtual reality would provide us with a superior measure of testing spatial and temporal discounting at different walking speeds by displaying the task in an immersive environment where space and time can be simulated in the same fashion as if subjects were walking across an open space in real time. The use of virtual reality to measure distance perception has recently become more popular as researchers are taking advantage of this technology 
(Bischof & Boulanger, 2003;
Dolins et al., 2014;
Kelly, 2006)
. Additionally, the lack of an effect for the last three intervals in Experiment 2 -those greater than 32.3s -suggests that when the duration to reach the farther stimulus is very long, then participants will care less about the distance and become less likely to choose the farther reward overall. However, the distances for those binned intervals above 32.3s were also very far (>20m), and so an alternative explanation is that subjects did not choose them simply because they were far away. To address this, we also used a new set of walking speeds, such that the time to reach the farthest rewards was now twice as fast.


Methods
A total of 20 subjects participated in experiment 3. The task design was similar to the previously mentioned design in which the participants were presented with two boxes in a virtual world, each with a monetary reward. The larger reward was located farther away in space while the smaller reward was located closer in space. The virtual environment was presented to the subject using an Oculus Rift headset. Prior to each participant beginning the task, the participant was fitted appropriately for the Oculus Rift virtual reality head gear and was scanned for their head position in space through the Oculus programming setup to ensure proximal presentation of objects in the virtual world were realistic for each participant's eye height. 
(Figure 1
)
The participants were instructed to use an Xbox controller to walk toward the reward of their choice. The distance of the larger and smaller rewards were varied on each trial as was the speed at which the participants were able to walk. The reward values ranged from $0.03 to $5.50 and the speed at which the participants were able to travel was manipulated for each trial. The larger monetary reward was located at five different distances from the participant 
(8.495, 12.0482, 20.878, 42.5927, 96)
. Walking speed covaried at five levels, faster than in Experiment 2 (1.25m/s, 1.85, 2.74, 4.05, 6).


Results
Our analysis of Experiment 3 proceeded similar to that of Experiment 2. As before, we initially calculated separate values of K for each speed. Overall, values of K were lower than in Experiment 2, (mean K = 0.07 vs 2.33). This finding was expected, as subjects were more likely to choose the farther reward due to the faster walking speeds. Despite these lower values, we again observed a parametric effect of walking speed 
(Figure 5b)
, with lower values of K for progressively faster speeds [F(2.928,55.629) = 4.371, p = 0.003, h 2 = 0.187],
indicating that subjects were less likely to choose the farther reward when the walking speed was slower. We additionally observed a larger number of K values across subjects that produced negative values (25%); once again, we reduced these values to zero, but found similar results when they were removed from the analysis.
We again analyzed the mean proportion of trials on which subjects chose the farther reward across all values, but binned into eight intervals for which multiple distances could be reached in the same amount of time 
[1.8s, 3.2, 4.7, 7, 10.5, 16.1, 23.4, 34
.5] ( 
Figure 5
).
Results of this analysis are presented in 
Table 1
. Similar to the above results, subjects were overall more likely to choose the farther reward in Experiment 3 than Experiment 2, likely driven by the increased walking speeds. Concordantly, we observed that for very short intervals no effect of distance was present; yet, as the interval increased subjects became more likely to show a linear impact of increasing distance 
(Figure 5b
).
Notably, unlike in Experiment 2, we observed an effect of distance for the longest distances in our stimulus set. This finding suggests that the lack of an effect for these far distances in Experiment 2 came from the very long interval necessary to reach them, rather than the distance itself, as the interval to reach these same distances was effectively halved in Experiment 3. Similar to Experiment 2, we also conducted a linear mixed effects model without binning distances by duration. We again found a significant fixed effect of distance when controlling for duration [b = -0.0017, 95% Confidence Intervals -0.0022 --0.0012; t(457)= -6.568, p<0.001].


Discussion
In the current study, three separate experiments were conducted. In experiment one, a temporal and spatial discounting task showed no significant differences in how subjects discount time or distance for monetary rewards. That is, subjects perceived spatial and temporal discounting similarly. Due to the possible limitation of both temporal and spatial discounting tasks having a fixed walking speed, a second experiment was conducted. In experiment two, only a spatial discounting task was administered in which the walking speed was manipulated.
The results of experiment two revealed that even when the duration to a farther reward was the same as the duration to the close reward, subjects were still less likely to choose the farther reward. However, this effect was only present for the first five intervals and revealed no effect for the last three intervals that were greater than 32.3 seconds. To address this lack of effect for the last three intervals, a third experiment was conducted with a new set of walking speeds so that the time to reach the farthest rewards was twice that of experiment two.
While the results of experiment three replicated the results of experiment two, one significant difference was observed for experiment three in which we saw an effect for the farthest distances suggesting that the lack of effect for distance in experiment two stems from long intervals needed to reach the farthest monetary rewards, rather than the distance itself.
What neural regions may contribute to the observed difference in temporal and spatial discounting? Morison and Colleagues (2014) looked at the underlying neural mechanisms involved in proximate reward bias, in which humans and animals exhibit a preference for rewarding objects that are located closer to them in space. Neural signals located in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) were all implicated in proximity bias and contain dopaminergic pathways that motivate movement towards proximate rewards.
The authors found that in rats, the NAc has a proximity signal that not only drives impulsive behavior toward nearby rewarding objects, but also this signal competes with decision making and evaluative processes. This was evidenced by animals choosing the smaller reward that was in close proximity, even when that reward was suboptimal to a larger reward that was located farther in space. The researchers concluded that this proximate reward bias is driven by impulsive choice and impulsive action, both of which are highly manipulated by dopamine in the NAc in which the proximity signal is encoded by a dopamine signal that increases as the distance to a reward decreases.
While research on animals has provided insight into the neural mechanisms underlying reward discounting, previous research in humans has largely focused on temporal discounting, most commonly with long intervals, in which the subject must consider a large reward that is days, weeks, or months away. 
Kable and Glimcher (2007)
 employed this method for human participants in conjunction with fMRI and also found that activity in the ventral striatum, medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex increased as the reward value increased and decreased as the time to gain the reward increased. Additional fMRI studies such as work conducted by 
McClure and colleagues (2004)
 have examined the spatial and temporal processing regions associated with choosing rewards with long and short delays and found both combined and separate neural systems. Specifically, while the lateral prefrontal and associated parietal areas were activated during all necessary intertemporal choices, the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex showed extensive activation during intertemporal choices with immediate rewards. Given the results from these studies, we suggest that these brain regions are likely involved in our study.
Regarding the previous research on the asymmetry between perceptions of time and space and the results from the current study, a previous study conducted by 
Gijssels and colleagues (2013)
 sought to test whether perceptions of space and time interact at encoding and if activity in the inferior parietal cortex (IPC) displays a symmetrical or asymmetrical activation through fMRI while subjects completed four separate tasks, a spatial reproduction task, a temporal reproduction task and two control tasks. The researchers found neural asymmetry in which the IPC was more active during the temporal reproduction task than the spatial reproduction task. A possible alternative explanation for these results is that time and space are independently represented in different parts of the brain and the IPC serves as a context dependent integrative mechanism between the two domains.
The results from the current study are the first that we are aware of to clearly demonstrate a spatial discounting mechanism in humans that is distinct from temporal discounting. These findings suggest a neuronal coding of reward distance that is distinct from the time taken to travel to the reward, evidenced by participants moving in a more realistic, virtual environment 
(Schultz, 2010)
.
These findings also match recent advances in our understanding of so-called hippocampal place and time cells. Animal studies that have looked at place and time cells in the hippocampus during tasks involving spatial navigation and velocity have shown that some cells exclusively respond based on an animal's position in space while others respond to temporal intervals 
(Kraus, et al. 2013)
.
Importantly, some hippocampal cells respond to both distance traveled and elapsed duration. 
(Deuker, et al. 2017;
Ekstrom & Ranganath, 2017;
Eichenbaum, 2017;
Javadi et al., 2017;
Howard & Eichenbaum, 2015)
.
These results also have important implications for understanding decision making in humans and environmental policy as well as geographical and economic validity as it is understood that temporal discounting influences the impact of future changes on current behavior, spatial discounting likely influences the impact of geographically distant changes on our local decisions 
(Issacs, 2001;
Perrings & Hannon, 2001;
Jafarpour & Spiers, 2016;
Frederick, Loewenstein, O'Donoghue, 2002. )
 In summary, we found that human subjects performed spatial and temporal discounting of rewards to a similar degree, and that when speed was included as a manipulation, subjects
were less likely to choose a farther reward than a closer one even when the duration was held constant. Additionally, subjects exhibited a tendency to discount larger rewards for the longest distances in the stimulus set, suggesting that subjects were taking into account the temporal interval necessary to reach the larger reward than the distance. These findings provide support for independent representations of time and space in delay discounting, supporting a multiplexing role for both dimensions in decision making 
(Eichenbaum, 2017)

Subjects performed both the temporal and spatial discounting task well, exhibiting a range of discounting constant values (Figure 2; Mean Temporal K = 0.818, ± 0.315 SE; Mean Spatial K = 0.96 ± 318). Notably, no significant difference was observed between discounting values for temporal and spatial discounting tasks [Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test: Z = -0.485, p = 0.656, 10,000 permutations]. We additionally observed a significant correlation between Temporal and Spatial discounting values [Spearman's Rho = 0.602, p = 0.005], a permutation procedure based on resampling 10,000 permutations to produce confidence intervals confirmed that this finding was not due to chance [95% confidence intervals: 0.41 --0.38].
