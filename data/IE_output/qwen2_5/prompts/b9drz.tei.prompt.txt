You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Replication and extension of 
Mellers, Hertwig, and Kahneman (2001)
 The conjunction fallacy is one of the most well-known judgment errors in the judgment and decision making (JDM) literature. The fallacy consists of judging the conjunction of two events as more likely the any of the two specific events, violating one of the most fundamental tenets of probability theory that postulates that probability of a conjunction of two events can never be higher than the probability any of the two individual events.
Kahneman and colleagues initially reported the conjunction effect as a bias, and that resulted in an intense debate in the academic community (e.g., 
Fiedler, 1988;
Gigerenzer, 1996
Gigerenzer, , 2005
Hertwig & Chase, 1998;
Hertwig & Gigerenzer, 1999)
. One view opposing conjunction effect as a bias was by Hertwig and colleagues that argued that conjunction effect is not at all a fallacy, demonstrating that the effect arises out of semantic ambiguity, in that participants' understanding of natural language words such as "probability" and "and" diverged from that of experimenters (e.g., 
Hertwig & Gigerenzer, 1999)
. Daniel Kahneman and Ralph Hertwig engaged in an adversarial collaboration to which Barbara Mellers served as an arbiter. They all then jointly examined the potential semantic ambiguity of "and" conjunction to try and explain the conjunction effect reported in the Kahneman and Tversky's study 
(1996)
. The article has been influential with over 430 citations according to Google Scholar at the time of writing.


Chosen study for replication: Outline of Mellers et al (2001)
Mellers et al. 
(2001)
 conducted examined frequency estimates of personality sketches.
They tested two personality sketches in three experiments, one about Linda and the other about James.
For example, the Linda story read as:
Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.
Participants read the scenario and estimated how many of a 100 people like Linda fit a particular target description. The target descriptions varied between experimental conditions: likely (feminists), unlikely (bank tellers), semantic "and" ( bank tellers and feminists), and semantic "and are"' (bank tellers and are feminists). Kahneman argued that the conjunction effect would occur despite frequency estimation was used, reflected from the average frequency estimates of the conjunction conditions "and" and "and are" higher than the unlikely item condition. Hertwig proposed that conjunction phrase "bank teller and are feminists" would not yield support for conjunction effects. The results for the Linda scenario supported Kahneman's prediction across two out of three experiments conducted as part of the adversarial collaboration, whereas, with the James scenario just one experiment supported the prediction.
We summarized findings in the original article in 
Table 1
. The divergence of findings reported across the three experiments made it hard for readers to assess the overall effect size, and we, therefore, conducted a mini meta-analysis summary of their effects across experiments, summarized in

Note. Linda story can be concluded as a successful replication. James replication is a likely failed replication. In addition, there was no support found for semantic ambiguity (comparing "and" and "and are"). In the original article, effect sizes (ES) were not reported; we computed Cohen's d and confidence intervals based on the mean estimates and standard errors of the mean estimates of the outcome variables of the original study (see full tables in supplementary). The effect sizes of the original study presented in the table are based on the mini-meta analysis of Experiment 1, 2, and 3 of 
Mellers et al. (2001)
, as the study is closest for direct comparison for replication summary. The replication summary directly based on LeBel et al., (2019) category, see details in "evaluation criteria for replication design and findings".


The need for replication
Since the first demonstration of the conjunction effect, there have been attempts to develop a theory to explain the phenomenon. Semantic ambiguity remains the strongest counterargument to the demonstration of conjunction effects. With the recent growing recognition of the importance of reproducibility and replicability in psychological science (e.g., 
Brandt et al., 2014;
Open Science collaboration, 2015;
van't Veer & Giner-Sorolla, 2016;
Zwaan, Etz, Lucas, & Donnellan, 2018)
, we felt it was important to establish the replicability of the findings noted in the 
Mellers et al. (2001)
.
We, therefore, embarked on a well-powered preregistered very close replication of 
Mellers et al. (2001)
 employing the most current psychological science methods, which would allow to test for both the presence and possible absence of an effect.


Present investigation
We had several goals. First, we set out to revisit the original experimental design and assess the replicability of the original findings. With power analyses and higher power, we aimed at detecting weak effects that may not have been possible in the original study. Secondly, we complemented the traditional analyses in the original article with equivalence tests and Bayesian analyses to also allow for quantifying evidence in support of the null hypothesis. Third, we added extensions to examine further lay perceptions of provided statistical information that may explain some of the differences found in the original findings.


Context: Large replication effort of judgement and decision-making findings
The current replication was part of a large-scale pre-registered replication project aiming to revisit well-known research findings in the area of judgment and decision making (JDM) and
to examine the reproducibility and replicability of these findings. In this project, all replications are conducted by students in undergraduate courses and undergraduate and masters guided thesis at the University of Hong Kong psychology department. Four students in two separate courses were randomly assigned to the current replication. Working independently, the students conducted an in-depth analysis of the target article, wrote pre-registrations with power-analyses, conducted data analysis on the collected data, and then wrote manuscripts for journal submission.
In each student pair, students conducted peer review on one another to optimize design and analysis. A teaching assistant (6th author) and the corresponding author supervised and gave feedback in each step of the replication process. The corresponding author conducted all preregistrations on the OSF and online data collection. More information on the process is provided in the supplementary, and further details and updates on this project can be found on:
https://osf.io/5z4a8/ (CORE, 2020).


Method


Pre-registration, power analysis, and open-science
We pre-registered the experiment on the Open Science Framework (OSF), and data collection was launched later that week. Pre-registration with power analyses and all materials used in the study are available in the supplementary materials. All measures, manipulations, and exclusions are reported, and data collection was completed before analyses. OSF pre-registration review link for the study: https://osf.io/gb7pk . 
Data
 
Please note the pre-registration crowdsourcing process involved   four students who worked independently to analyze the original article, document hypotheses and
 tests in the original study, propose analyses for testing predictions, calculate original effects, conduct a power-analysis, and propose extensions. We note the differences and similarities across four pre-registration documents in the supplementary materials (for details see 
Table S12
-S14), and we followed the combination of all of those in our analyses.
We aimed to detect smallest the effect size of d = 0.20 at a power of 0.80 one-tail comparing two conditions, despite the reported effects in the target article and original findings being much higher. This was meant to allow us the possibility of detecting effects not found in the target article for one of the two scenarios (details below).


Participants
A total of 1032 participants were recruited online through American Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) using the TurkPrime.com platform (Litman, Robinson, & Abberbock, 2017) (Mage = 38.77, SDage = 12.07; 550 females). We identified four responses to be excluded based on the exclusion criteria we recorded in the pre-registration due to their self-reported lack of seriousness or English proficiency, yet exclusions had no impact on the findings and so our main report focuses on the full sample.


Procedure
Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental conditions (likely, unlikely, "and", and "and are"). All participants read two personality profiles, one of Linda and the other of James, exactly as in the original study. Each profile consisted of one short description of a character, and frequency estimation questions.
All descriptions and questions were taken from the original article 
(Mellers et al., 2001
).
The presentation order of the two profiles was randomized. Linda profile description was as follows:
Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. Participants answered questions based on two scenarios, one for Linda and one for James, according to their randomly assigned condition (indicated in brackets in the scenarios above).
The dependent variable was the estimated frequency of the described personality in the scenario measured on a scale from 1 to 100. The supplementary details the experimental instructions, scenarios, and response variables.


Extension
Following the replication materials, participants proceeded to the next page and answered six additional questions. Depending on their assigned condition participants were asked to estimate the percentage of people, females, and males in the United States that match the target item (likely, unlikely, "and", "and are"), and they did so for both profiles. For example, participants in the likely condition estimated the percentage of people, females, and males in the United States that are 1) feminists, 2) artists.
We had several aims with this extension: 1) assess whether the conjunction effect would show for the generalized population without the specific descriptions of James and Linda, and 2) examine possible gender differences in the estimations of the items used in the James and Linda descriptions.


Data analysis plan
Our analyses matched the original article's hypotheses, as follows:
Hypothesis 1: The frequency estimate for the "and" conjunction phrase will be higher than the phrase describing unlikely target alone.
Two sets of competing hypotheses suggested by Hertwig and Kahneman:
Hypothesis 2a: The frequency estimate for the "and are" conjunction phrase will be higher than the phrase describing unlikely target alone.
Hypothesis 2b: The frequency estimate for the "and are" conjunction phrase will not be higher than the phrase describing unlikely target alone.


Hypothesis 3a:
The frequency estimate for the "and are" conjunction phrase will be lower than the frequency estimate for 'and" conjunction phrase.
Hypothesis 3b: The frequency estimate for the "and are" conjunction phrase will not be lower than the frequency estimate for 'and" conjunction phrase.
A comparison of the three experiments in the original article and the current replication is provided in 
Table S4
 of the Supplementary Materials. In 
Table S5
, we briefly note the reasons for the chosen differences between original studies and the replication attempt. In the replication attempt, we did not include filler items, because when filler items are present, the responses are inherently comparative and therefore drive the conjunction effect observed 
(Hertwig & Chase, 1998)
. Supporting this view, the results of both Study 1 and Study 3 of the original study that included filler items found support for conjunction effect-for both "and" and "and are" conjunction phrases. Given the possibility of different psychological processes between comparative and non-comparative responses, we excluded filler items, that allow for the test of competing predictions from Kahneman and Hertwig theorized to be essentially non-comparative in nature. More importantly, with the current focus on testing the main argument if the conjunction effects are driven by semantic ambiguity of natural language term "and" in a frequency representation.
We chose to focus on "and" and "and are" as the conjunction phrases and implement a between-subjects design which would allow for a clearer test of the competing predictions between Kahneman and Hertwig. For instance, Hertwig argued that the frequency judgments are possibly driven by the understanding that "and" is a union operator, and the use of a more restrictive "and are" phrase would take away the conjunction effect. Kahneman argued that judgments were driven by a match between a personality description and porotype of a category; therefore, both "and" and "and are" phrases would likely yield conjunction effects.
Following the analyses in the target original, we first conducted Welch (based on recommendations of 
Delacre, Lakens, & Leys, 2017)
 one-tail independent samples t-test, a nullhypothesis significance testing (NHST) method. When NHST analyses were non-significant, we complement NHST analyses with equivalence testing to compare effects against a minimal effects considered meaningful (TOSTER package; 
Lakens, 2017;
Lakens, Scheel, & Isager, 2018)
 and Bayesian analyses to quantify support for the null hypothesis given a prior 
(Kruschke & Liddell, 2018;
Vandekerckhove, Rouder, & Kruschke, 2018)
 using BayesFactor R package (Version 0.9.12-4.2; Morey & Rouder, 2015). These were minor adjustments we made to the preregistration data analysis plan, summarized in 
Table S6
. 
Table S7
 provides a classification of the replications using the criteria by LeBel,


Evaluation criteria for replication design and findings
McCarthy, Earp, Elson, and Vanpaemel (2018) criteria (see 
Figure S2)
. We summarize the current replication as a "very close replication".
To interpret the replication results we followed the framework by LeBel, Vanpaemel,
Cheung, and Campbell (2019). They suggested a replication evaluation using three factors: (a) whether a signal was detected (i.e., confidence interval for the replication Effect size (ES) excludes zero), (b) consistency of the replication ES with the original study's 
ES, and (c)
 precision of the replication's ES estimate (see 
Figure S1
).


Results
Descriptive statistics are detailed in 
Table 1
 and statistical tests and effect-size findings are summarized in 
Table 2
.


Conjunction effects
We first looked for the conjunction effect for each profile, by comparing frequency estimates for both "and" and "and are" conditions with the "unlikely" condition. Considering the Linda scenario, "and" condition (n = 252, M = 18.80, SD = 21.62) were greater than for the show that frequency estimates for "and" condition were lower than "unlikely" condition, although the difference was not statistically significant. Therefore, the results of the James scenario failed to support H1. Similarly, the contrast between "unlikely" and "and are" conditions (Md = −2.83, t(510.69) = −1.76, p = .960; ds = -0.15, 95% CI [-0.33, 0.02]) show that frequency estimates for "and are" condition were lower than "unlikely" condition, though with a weak effect not statistically significant. In essence, the results support H2b.

The density of the violin plots represents the density of the data at each value, with wider sections indicating higher density. Note that the p-values for the contrast effects are for two-tail tests, different from the one-tail tests. Plots were generated using ggstatsplot R package (Patil, 2018(.


Semantic ambiguity?
To examine whether the semantically ambiguous word "and" had an effect on participants' judgment, we conducted a one-tail Welch t-test comparing frequency estimates of "and" and "and are" conditions for each of the personality scenarios. As predicted by H3a, we found no support for differences for the Linda profile (Md = −0.75, t(505.55) = −0.37, p = .646, ds Furthermore, we conducted one-tail Bayesian t-tests with a prior set at 0.707 with a null region of (0, ∞) such that the results against null (i.e., against mu = 0) would quantify support the semantic ambiguity hypothesis suggested by Hertwig and colleagues. For the Linda profile, we found BF10 = 0.08 (or BF01 = 13.32), which indicates that, given the data, the null-hypothesis is over 11 times more likely than the one-sided alternative. Similarly, for the James profile, BF10 = 0.08 (or BF01= 12.06), which indicates that given data, the null-hypothesis is over nine times more likely than the one-sided alternative.
= -0.03,


Additional analyses
The James profile may have been less representative of an artist in comparison to the Linda profile as representative of a feminist. To test this aspect, we compared the average frequency estimations for James and Linda story within 'likely' experimental condition, in which participants rated the extent to which Linda and James were representative of a feminist and an artist, respectively. Frequency estimations for the "likely" condition for Linda profile  
-0.56, -0.30]
). This pattern of the observed difference between Linda and James across "likely" and "unlikely" conditions is consistent with the previous work that found that the occurrence of conjunction effects, for example, depends on the probabilities of A (Linda is a bank teller) and B (Linda is active in the feminist movement). In particular, there is a higher chance of conjunction effect when people perceive lower the probability of the less probable constituent P(A), and P(B) was high, in comparison to cases where P(A) and P(B) were both low or both high 
(Fisk & Pidgeon, 1996;
Wells, 1985)
.
The study included additional variables that mirrored the outcome variables but asked the participants to rate the percentage of males and females in the population that fit the description. 


Summary of replication findings
The evaluation of the replication findings is summarized in 
Table 2
. Our replication for the Linda profile was in support of the confirmatory predictions based on the conjunction effects.
Whereas, the results for the James profile were inconsistent. Importantly, the original study reported that in frequency estimate for "and" condition is higher than Unlikely condition. This prediction forms the basis for testing the absence or presence of semantic ambiguity in predicting the conjunction effects. The replication results for this prediction are in the opposite direction, i.e., we found frequency estimates were lower for Unlikely condition than "and" condition.
Therefore, the results of the James scenario are inconclusive in teasing apart the semantic ambiguity associated with "and" conjunction term.


Extension
Descriptive results for the extension are provided in 
Table S8
, and plots are provided in 
Figures S3
 to S6.
We first tested whether the conjunction effect occurred for any of the three items (people, male, females; within design) for each of the profiles (Linda and James, between design) and their assigned condition (likely, unlikely, "and", "and are"). As expected, we found no support for a conjunction effect for general population females with the Linda profile items (feminist and bank teller) yet without the Linda description. Similarly, we found no effect for males with the general population James profile items (Republicans and artist) yet without the James description. These findings should be interpreted with caution, yet these are in support of the conjunction effect demonstrated with the Linda and James problems as being affected by the description of Linda and James in a way that makes conjunction items more salient than the unlikely. Meaning, that the conjunction effect may be dependent on the representativeness heuristic 
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1982)
 and the preceding described profile.
Yet, we found support for a conjunction effect for the Linda items for the estimation of people overall (feminist: M = 29.36, SD = 17.13; bank teller: M = 8.56, SD = 12.2; "and": M = 11.01, SD = 14.01). It remains to be explored why there would be support for a conjunction effect for evaluation of people overall, but not for females or males, yet it does point out that the conjunction effect may sometimes occur without the representativeness heuristic description, and with a within-subject design. At the very least, this suggests that the conjunction effect is contextsensitive, as is also indicated in the differences in effects we found between the Linda and the James problem.
There were also patterns indicating statistical flaws, such that given a population gender split of 50%-50% for females-males, participants indicated means for the general population that were far from the average of the estimation for females and the estimation of males (e.g., people
who are bank teller: M = 8.56, SD = 12.2; females who are bank tellers: M = 21.46, SD = 28.64;
males who are bank tellers: M = 9.93, SD = 15.40). This is despite the within-subject design and the three questions being presented together. If participants indeed understood these questions correctly, this may be indicative of elicitation of estimate separately for each of the questions irrespective of the context or priors, and/or an inability to process or report percentages.
Further findings regarding gender effects for the items in the two profile is provided in Tables S10 and S11.


Discussion
We conducted a preregistered well-powered replication of the main design across the three studies of 
Mellers et al.'s (2001)
.
Our findings regarding the Linda profile demonstrate support for conjunction effects for both "and" and "and are" connectors. The findings of the Linda scenario are not supportive of the alternative view that that conjunction effects observed in the Linda story are a manifestation of semantic interpretation of "and" term by participants as union instead of the intersection. The semantic ambiguity arguments predicted that "and are" experimental condition will fail to provide support for conjunction effects, and participants' frequency estimate in "and are" experimental condition will be lower than "and" experimental condition. Furthermore, in reference to Linda story, we compared if the frequency estimates in the "and are" condition was lower than "and" condition. Equivalence testing and Bayesian analyses indicated support for null differences. These findings are in support of the Kahneman view of conjunction effects with frequency estimates.
Our findings for the James profile were not in support of either the Kahneman or the Hertwig hypotheses and previous findings. Firstly, the comparison between "and" and "unlikely" condition was not in support of a conjunction effect. Secondly, we found no support for differences between frequency estimates between "and are" an unlikely condition. Further, similar to Linda story the planned comparison that tested if the frequency estimates in the "and are" condition was lower than "and" condition supports the view that differences between conditions were statistically equivalent to zero. Failure to find empirical support for conjunction effects with James story suggests that conjunction effects are context specific. Conjunction effects are commonly demonstrated using the Linda profile, yet the findings regarding other scenarios are less clear 
(Costello & Watts, 2017)
. Thus, it is quite possible that James and Linda scenarios are qualitatively different.
A closer examination of the original findings showed that the effects of the James scenario varied considerably across the experiments from weak effects in Experiment 1 ("and" and unlikely: d = 0.21; "and are" and unlikely: d = 0.13) with no indication of semantic ambiguity (d = 0.05) to mixed effects in Experiment 2 ("and" and unlikely: d = 1.11; "and are" and unlikely: d = 0.01) indicating strong semantic ambiguity effect (d = 1.08). The mini meta-analytic effect we computed for the three original studies seemed to indicate differences in effect size between the Linda and the James scenarios, especially in regards to semantic ambiguity.
Additional analyses we conducted suggested that the personality sketch of James was less representative of an artist in comparison to Linda's personality sketch of a feminist. The observed difference is consistent with view Kahneman's argument that conjunction effects arises through the substitution of representativeness estimates for probability estimates. This may have been one of the reasons why the current study does not find support for conjunction effect for James story even when then comparison was between the unlikely and the "and" conditions, which was supported in Study 2 and 3 of the original paper.
The current replication effort supports the 
Tversky and Kahneman's (1983)
 assertion that conjunction effects, when those occur, are a probabilistic error due to representativeness and availability heuristic. More precisely, the results of the current study for Linda story are supportive of the view that frequency estimates do produce conjunction effects that rely on judgmental heuristic and are not driven by semantic ambiguity of the conjunction terms. The results for the James profile were inconclusive to likely failure.
Overall, we found some support for conjunction effects, but that those may be less robust than initially expected. These findings indicate the importance of further conducting well-   


Power analyses
As 
Mellers, Hertwig & Kahneman's (2001)
 found no differences few of the contrasts (e.g., "and are" vs. unlikely condition in Experiment 2). We aimed to detect a weak effect size of d= 0.2 or above at 80 % power. Therefore, using G*Power alpha = .05, one-tail (direction of hypothesis known), d = 0.2 and power .80 we required a sample size of 310 participants in each condition, and a total sample size of 1240 participants. The final sample was 1028. Please refer to details of the power analysis described below.


Details of the power analysis


Data of the original article
-Power analysis of the current replication will be based on relevant conditions, which are "Likely Target", "Unlikely Target", "and" and "and are" conditions.
-Average frequency estimates for the experiments are shown below, with standard errors and calculated standard deviations. 


Linda's Problem: Unlikely items condition; "And" Condition


Sample Size Calculation
The calculated effect size is plugged in. The calculated sample size will be based on a power of 0.95. -No conjunction effect was found in James scenario in the original study -The current replication hypothesized a very small effect size, Cohen's d = 0.2, between "unlikely item" condition and "and" condition, as well as between "unlikely item" condition and "and are" condition for sample size calculation.


Sample Size Calculation
To ensure the effect size of the original study is captured, a more conservative sample size which require at least 310 participants in each condition is considered. It makes a total of 1240 participants.


Project Process Outline
The current replication is part of the mass pre-registered replication project, with the aim of revisiting well-known research findings in the area of judgment and decision making (JDM) and examining the reproducibility and replicability of these findings.
The current replication followed the same project outline as noted below. For each of the replication projects, researchers completed full pre-registrations, data analysis, and APA style submission ready reports. Each of these four researchers (second to fifth author) independently reproduced the materials and designed the replication experiment, with a separate pre-registration document. The researchers then peer-reviewed one another to try and arrive at the best possible design. Then, then last two authors reviewed the integrated work and the last corresponding author made final adjustments and conducted the pre-registration and data collection.

We conducted Equivalence tests and Bayesian analysis were performed in addition to null-hypothesis significance tests (NHST).
Both Equivalence test and Bayesian analysis are useful in testing for and quantifying an absence of an effect
With the additional tests along with NHST tests, we are not only able to falsify predictions about the presence of effects, but also declare the absence of meaningful effects.

Procedure
Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions, and in each condition, read two personality descriptions ( Linda and James' ). The survey followed the following sequence:
 Participants signed the consent form. Then were given instructions, and then were randomly assign to one of the four conditions, and in each condition read Linda and James Stories one by one. Then rate the frequency for each of the story they read.  Demographics questions.  After that, participants filled the funnelling section that checked if they are seriously filling in the survey, and if they can guess the purpose of the study.


Exclusion criteria
In the pre-registration we included the following: "We will focus on our analyses on the full sample. However, as a supplementary analysis and to examine any potential issues, we will also determine further findings reports with exclusions. In any case, we will report exclusions in detail with results for full sample and results following exclusions (in either the manuscript or the supplementary).
General criteria:
1. Participants indicating a low proficiency of English (self-report<5, on a 1-7 scale) 2. Participants who self-report not being serious about filling in the survey (self-report<4, on a 1-5 scale). 3. Participants who correctly guessed the hypothesis of this study in the funnelling section. 4. Have seen or done the survey before 5. Participants who failed to complete the survey. (duration = 0, leave question blank) 6. Not from United States" Instructions and experimental material All participants first read the instruction:
We are interested in the judgment and inferences that people make about other peoples' profession, politics, and hobbies. In each of the following problems, we will tell you about a person. We will then ask, of 100 people like the target person, how many would fit a particular description of a job, political persuasion, or hobby?
There will be two scenario and questions. Please read the introduction and the items carefully. There are no right or wrong answers; please answer to the best of your understanding.
After that, participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions and in each condition read Linda Story and James story. The order of Linda and James story was randomized. Linda story read:
Please read the following description and answer the questions stated below:
Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.
Participants then proceed to read the James Story:
James grew up in a Bohemian family. His father was a musician, and his mother was a painter. They lived together for 40 years and never got married. James was a very talented child with a special gift for comedy, but he turned into a rebellious troublemaker in his youth. He dropped out of college after two years and travelled to Asia to learn crafts. James is now 35 years old.
They then answered the question in a text box (validated to answer in frequency). In each condition, respondents answered two questions, exactly as they did in the original study. After submitting the answers and they proceeded to the next page to answer 6 additional questions.


Experimental condition: likely target
Dependent variables (two questions same as the original study): Finally, participants were asked to fill in demographics and were debriefed. No filler items were included.

Calculation of smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) for equivalence test procedure
For calculation of SESOI we choose Experiment 2 of 
Mellers et al.'s (2001)
 as the reference as this particular experiment is closest to the current replication design. The average number of participants per condition in Experiment 2 of 
Mellers et al.'s (2001)
 study = 96 participants.
With an N of 96 in each condition, 
Mellers et al. (2001)
 had 33% power to detect an effect size of 0.22 based on the calculation using the G*power software. The screenshot below demonstrates the details of the calculation:
Estimates of the occurrence of in the populations
To probe into understanding possible reasons for variations in the results between Linda and James story, we conducted exploratory analysis based on the responses to additional variables that were not part of the original study. One way to way to disentangle differences in the results to check for assessment of the lay-perceptions of the occurrences of the prototypes of a category (e.g., feminist bank teller, republican artist) in the population, and to see whether these somehow differ for the two scenarios that may explain the divergence in responding to the two scenarios.
We looked for the possibility of gender as a factor of influence that may have brought about differences in the results between the two scenarios. 
Table S3
 presents the results of various comparisons that asked participants the percentage of men and women who take up the described roles (e.g., feminists, bank tellers, republicans, artists) in the society. Results of the comparison show that women are significantly more likely to be feminists and bank tellers than men. There was no support for gender difference for the role of artists. However, participants rated that men are significantly more likely to be Republicans than men.
The more appropriate comparison checks if there was a difference in the mean scores of occurrence for "females how are Bank tellers and feminists" and "males who are Republicans and are Artists." Because, the original study mainly tested the extent to which personality sketches of Linda and James are representative of "females how are Bank tellers and feminists" and "males who are Republicans and Artists," respectively. The results show that there is no significant difference in the participants' ratings of general occurrences between "females how are Bank tellers and feminists" and "males who are Republicans and Artists." To summarize, do not indicate support for the gender effects that possibly explain the difference in results between Linda and James story.
Furthermore, 
Table S4
 presents the results comparing the population level occurrences of the roles of the personality sketches (e.g., feminists, republicans, artists, bank teller, feminist bank teller, republican artist).

Notes. The authors who proposed testing 'Extension' and 'Comparing Linda and James Scenario' related hypothesis noted in the 
Table S13
 suggested correlational analysis as a way to test these predictions. However, while writing up the manuscript we came to the conclusion that the proposed analysis methods were not appropriate or simple wrong.

Similarly, frequency estimates of "and are" condition (n =258, M = 19.55, SD = 23.74) were greater than "unlikely" condition (n = 258, M = 9.87, SD = 14.15; Md = 9.69, t(419.21) = 5.63, p < .001, ds = 0.50, 95% CI [0.32, 0.67]). Thus, results lend support toward H1 and H2a in the Linda scenario.

("feminists", n = 260, M = 58.43, SD = 28.93) were greater than for James profile("artists", M =   36.20, SD = 26.08; Md = 22.22, t (259) = 11.99, p < .001, ds = 0.81, 95% CI [0.61, 0.88]).
Whereas, a similar comparison between Linda and James story within the unlikely condition show that frequency estimate for Linda ("Bank teller", n = 258, M = 9.87, SD = 14.15) was lower than James ("Republicans", M = 18.38, SD = 19.03; Md = −8.52, t (257) = −6.87, p < .001, d = - 0.50, 95% CI [


For example, participants in 'and' condition after reading Linda story answered "Try and estimate, what percentage of females in the U.S. are Bank Tellers and Feminists?", and after reading James story answered "Try and estimate, what percentage of males in the U.S. are Republicans and Artists?". We looked at the contrasts between the outcome variables and these additional variables across experimental conditions to ascertain if the ratings on the outcome variable were driven by profile description, rather than Linda by virtue of the name being female and similarly James being male. For Linda story across three experimental conditions Linda was rated higher on the outcome variable in comparison to the percentage of females in society(likely   < .001; d = 0.27, CI [0.12, 0.37]). Similarly, for the James story, across conditions we found that James was rated higher on the outcome variable in comparison to thepercentage of males in society (likely condition: Md = 19.10; t (259) = 11.15, p < .001; d = 0.87, CI ]0.56, 0.83[; 'and' condition: Md = 3.81; t (251) = 3.36, p = .001; d = 0.23, 95% CI [0.09, 0.34[; 'and are' condition: Md = 2.58; t (257) = 2.39, p = .018; d = 0.15, 95% CI [0.03, 0.27]).

Linda Scenario


The OSF page of the project contains one Qualtrics survey design used for data collection with four pre-registration documents submitted by each of the researchers. In the manuscript, we followed the most conservative of the four pre-registrations.Verification of AnalysesInitial analyses were conducted by the independent researchers, who were used JAMOVI (JAMOVI project, 2018) in the analyses. In preparing this manuscript, the lead and corresponding authors verified the analyses in R. T-tests were conducted using base R package, point estimates and confidence intervals for Cohen's d were calculated using 'esc' or 'effsize' R package. We aggregated the effect sizes across the studies using 'meta' R package.

Chi Long Fong
Linda Scenario H1: The frequency estimate for the "and" conjunction phrase will be higher than the phrase describing unlikely target alone.


Yes Yes Yes Yes
H2a: The frequency estimate for the "and are" conjunction phrase will be higher than the phrase describing unlikely target alone.


Yes Yes Yes Yes
H2b: The frequency estimate for the "and are" conjunction phrase will not be higher than the phrase describing unlikely target alone. H3a: The frequency estimate for the "and are" conjunction phrase will be lower than the frequency estimate for 'and" conjunction phrase.


Yes Yes
H3b: The frequency estimate for the "and are" conjunction phrase will not be lower than the frequency estimate for 'and" conjunction phrase. Yes James Scenario


H1:
The frequency estimate for the "and" conjunction phrase will be higher than the phrase describing unlikely target alone.


Yes Yes Yes
H2a: The frequency estimate for the "and are" conjunction phrase will be higher than the phrase describing unlikely target alone.


Yes Yes Yes
H2b: The frequency estimate for the "and are" conjunction phrase will not be higher than the phrase describing unlikely target alone. H3a: The frequency estimate for the "and are" conjunction phrase will be lower than the frequency estimate for 'and" conjunction phrase.


Yes Yes
H3b: The frequency estimate for the "and are" conjunction phrase will not be lower than the frequency estimate for 'and" conjunction phrase. Yes
Comparing Linda and James Scenario The higher the frequency of the likely target will have higher probability in committing conjunction fallacy. Yes
Did the pre-registration propose the extension noted below?


Extension
Depending on their assigned condition participants were asked to estimate the percentage of people, females, and males in the United States that match the described person the scenario. Yes
