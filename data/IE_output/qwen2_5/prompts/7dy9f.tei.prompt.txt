You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has long been linked to processing social information and to economic decision-making 
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
 . Several studies have suggested that dorsal portions of mPFC (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dmPFC) are involved in processing social information 
[5]
[6]
[7]
[8]
[9]
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
[14]
 , while ventral parts (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, vmPFC) are relatively more specialised in processing information pertinent to the self 
7,
[15]
[16]
[17]
[18]
[19]
[20]
[21]
[22]
 . However, these conclusions have often been based on functional neuroimaging studies, which are correlational by nature, and the specificity of these different regions in social and economic processing is a topic of several ongoing debates 
23
 .
Another perspective on the role of mPFC in decision-making is that there is a spatial gradient along the ventral-dorsal axis purportedly distinguishing between self-referential (non-social) and other-regarding (social) processing. However, this division between self and other has also faced both theoretical and empirical challenges 
[23]
[24]
[25]
 . The vmPFC, including areas 
11,
13
 and 14, which is purported to be involved in processing self-relevant information (e.g., reflection about one's own personality traits 
26
 ), has been shown to play a role in learning others' economic preferences 
27
 , making choices for others based on their own preferences 
23 ,
 integrating subjective values of self and others 
28
 , and tracking the association between agents and objects for others 
29
 . On the other hand, the dmPFC (including area 9), presumed to be pivotal for social cognition, has been observed to engage in merging self-and other-related information 
14,
30
 and representing one's own subjective values of choices during decisionmaking processes 
[31]
[32]
[33]
 . One interpretation of the results of these neuroimaging studies is that neither the vmPFC nor the dmPFC are specifically activated by social or non-social information. Causal evidence in large samples is strongly needed to reveal the necessity of mPFC and its subdivisions in social cognition and economic decision-making.
Social and economic decision-making can be evaluated in parallel using paradigms such as the delegated inter-temporal choice task 
23,
27,
34,
35
 . Humans and other animals differ significantly in their preference for immediate versus delayed rewards 
36,
37
 . Some people are impulsive and have a strong preference for immediate rewards, even when they are smaller than those available in the future. In a temporal discounting task, participants are asked whether they prefer smaller sooner over the larger later rewards 
38
 . By varying the values of these different rewards and fitting computational models we can precisely parametrise people's economic preferences for impulsivity vs patience. Strikingly, recent evidence suggests that such idiosyncratic preferences for future rewards can also be readily transmitted through social influence. When participants are tasked with making inter-temporal choices on behalf of someone else (i.e., delegated inter-temporal choices), they often adjust their own preferences to align with those of the other person 
23,
27,
34,
35
 . This tendency to be influenced by others is a case of social influence or social contagion 
5,
12,
[39]
[40]
[41]
 .
Existing work on the neural basis of social influence suggests regions of the mPFC may be crucial. A coordinate-based meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies suggested that activation of mPFC (especially dorsal posterior parts) predicts people's conformity to a majority opinion 
42
 . Another neuroimaging study that evaluated the role of mPFC in processing social information and economic decision-making linked activation of the dmPFC to conforming to a social norm, and activation of the vmPFC to social conformity and economic decision-making 
10
 .
Finally, the process of shifting one's own preference to that of others could be driven by the plasticity of value representations in the dmPFC. Indeed, a repetition suppression study showed a region in the dmPFC where activity predicted susceptibility to social influence 
27
 .
However, the causal necessity of mPFC remains unknown.
Moreover, other studies instead point to the mPFC being involved in non-social decisionmaking. For example, activity of the mPFC 
43
 and its functional connectivity with other regions 
44
 have been shown to correlate with temporal discounting decisions. A handful of lesion studies have shown that damage to the mPFC had a null effect on temporal discounting 
45
 or led to an increase in temporal discounting 
[46]
[47]
[48]
 . Nevertheless, these lesion studies were conducted in fewer than 10 participants, and for neuroimaging studies it is well-known that ventral portions of the mPFC are prone to considerable signal dropout due to their adjacency to bone and air sinuses, which might compromise the accuracy of functional localisation within this area 
49,
50
 .
Taken together, these studies highlight the importance of using suitable causal approaches in large lesion samples to isolate if mPFC integrity is necessary for social influence and economic decision-making.
Here, we assessed the causal role of mPFC in people's temporal discounting preferences and susceptibility to social influence, focusing on the nature of influence (i.e., being more impulsive or patient). We compared an unusually large group of rare participants with focal lesions to mPFC (N = 33; 
Figure 1a
) against two other control groups: participants with brain damage elsewhere (lesion controls, LC; N = 17; 
Figure 1b
) and age-and gender-matched participants without any brain damage (healthy controls, HC; N = 71). All participants first participated in a temporal discounting task designed to measure their baseline individual temporal discounting preferences. After completing this task, they were introduced to the preferences of two other people, being ostensible and unknown to the participants. The decisions of these two other people were in fact simulated based on a hyperbolic discounting model. One of these others was manipulated to have preferences that were more impulsive and the other as more patient, relative to the participants' estimated baseline preferences. Finally, participants completed the same temporal discounting task again (see Methods and 
Figure 2a
) to examine whether learning the others' preferences resulted in social influence on their own discounting preference. To accurately estimate participants' temporal preferences and quantify their changes in preferences, we used a novel computational neurology approach fitting models to the data using hierarchical Bayesian modelling, and using the resulting parameters in lesionsymptom mapping.
We show that damage to the mPFC increases susceptibility to social influence. Crucially, those with mPFC lesions are more likely to be influenced by impulsive others compared to healthy controls, and more susceptible to social influence overall than lesion controls. Lesionsymptom mapping reveals that damage to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, including area 9), and not to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), is associated with an increase in susceptibility to impulsive social influence. Additionally, damage to both mPFC and damage elsewhere leads to greater baseline discounting compared to healthy controls. This heightened temporal discounting was associated with vmPFC (areas 13 and 25) and ventral striatum damage. Together, these findings reveal that the dmPFC is causally involved in social influence whereas the vmPFC is associated with temporal impulsivity. 


Results
To test the causal role of mPFC in people's susceptibility to social influence and economic decision-making, we analysed data from three groups: 33 participants with focal mPFC damage (mean age = 56.88; 17 females), 17 lesion control (LC) participants with brain damage not involving the mPFC (mean age = 56.24; 12 females), and 71 healthy control (HC) participants without any brain lesion (mean age = 60.73; 41 females). All participants first engaged in an inter-temporal choice task to assess their baseline individual discounting preferences. Following this, they were introduced to the preferences of two other players who they were informed had participated in the same temporal discounting task previously. They were instructed to learn these players' preferences through a trial-and-error process based on the feedback they received. In fact, these players were modelled to contrast with the participants' own tendencies (see Methods). One person was more impulsive, and one was more patient, relative to the participants' estimated baseline preferences (see 
Figure 2b)
. The decisions of the two other players were presented in a counterbalanced order across participants (see 
Figure 2a
 and Methods for more details). They also completed a series of neuropsychological tests, self-report measures of depression and apathy, and self-reported their perceived similarity to both impulsive and patient others at the end of the experiment.
The three groups were closely matched, displaying no significant differences in terms of age, gender, visual attention, and executive function. Additionally, the two lesion groups showed no differences between each other in education, depression, or apathy (see Methods and 
Table S1
). Controlling for depression or apathy did not change any of our key results regarding group differences in temporal discounting or susceptibility to social influence (Supplementary


Note 1, Supplementary Tables S2-S3).
Participants received feedback on their decisions, which allowed them to learn about the intertemporal preferences of the other people (see below Simulation of the other people's choices). The correct choices were characterised as those with greater estimated values from the hyperbolic model, based on a given discount rate. Due to the adaptive nature of the task, two HC participants and two mPFC participants had two others with 'more patient' preferences.
Data from these participants was therefore not available for analyses involving others with (a) The trial structure in Self and Other blocks. During Self trials, participants were instructed to choose between two options: one offering an immediate smaller reward (smaller-and-sooner option, SS), and the other promising a larger reward after a variable delay period (larger-and-later option, LL). They were encouraged to express their genuine preferences by being informed that one of these choices would be randomly selected at the end of the study and serve as their bonus payment. During Other trials, participants were tasked to learn about the preferences of the other two people, with the information that these choices had been previously made by different participants. Participants were given feedback on their decisions, allowing them to grasp the intertemporal preferences of the other people. The experiment consisted of five blocks of 50 trials each (Self1, Other1, Self2, Other2, Self3), with a selfpaced break after every 25 trials within each block, resulting in 250 trials overall. The order of the other people's preferences (more impulsive vs more patient) was counterbalanced across participants. (b)
Illustration of simulated hyperbolic discounters. The decisions of the other people were generated using a simulated hyperbolic discounting model (preference-temperature KT model, see Methods), where the discount rate k was adjusted to be either plus one (more impulsive) or minus one (more patient) from the participant's own baseline k in the first experimental block. (c) Participants with brain damage can accurately learn others' preferences. All three groups of participants (healthy controls, mPFC lesions, and lesion controls) were capable of learning in this task (right-tailed exact binomial tests against 50%, all ps < 0.001).

Participants with brain damage can accurately learn others' preferences
To confirm participants were able to complete the task, our first analysis assessed their capacity to learn about the preferences of the other people who exhibited different discounting behaviours 
(Figure 2c
 proportions = 1.00, ps < 0.001). This suggests participants with brain damage, whether within the mPFC or elsewhere, were capable of learning others' preferences.
Next, we examined whether learning performances differed based on others' preferences among the three groups using a linear mixed-effects model (LMM 
; Table S2
). Overall, regardless of whether those preferences were more impulsive or patient, healthy controls demonstrated higher accuracy in learning others' preferences compared to the mPFC lesion group (main effect HC vs mPFC, b [95% CI] = 3.22 
[1.03 5.42]
, p = 0.004), while lesion controls performed similarly to the mPFC lesion group, with substantial Bayesian evidence of nonsignificant difference (main effect LC vs mPFC, b [95% CI] = -0.66 [-3. 
71 2.38]
, p = 0.67, BF01 = 3.32). In addition, healthy controls were also more accurate in learning others' preferences than lesion controls (post-hoc comparison HC vs LC estimate = 3.89, SE = 1.39, t = 2.81, p = 0.006). Therefore, participants with brain damage to the mPFC could learn others' preferences with high accuracy, although overall accuracy was lower than in healthy controls and equivalent to lesion controls.


mPFC lesions increase impulsivity but not uncertainty at baseline
After validating that all participants could successfully complete the task, we applied computational models of hyperbolic discounting 
52
 , a widely used approach for indexing temporal discounting behaviour. We utilised a previously validated Bayesian hyperbolic preference-uncertainty (KU) model to quantify participants' temporal impulsivity and choice uncertainty 
(Figure 3a
, see Methods). The KU model proposes that participants' discounting preferences are best represented as a distribution, rather than a singular, fixed value 
34
 . The model was fitted through hierarchical Bayesian modelling 
51,
52
 and verified using parameter recovery. The free parameters in the chosen model, km (temporal impulsivity) and ku (preference uncertainty), representing the mean and standard deviation of the participant's discounting distribution, exhibited excellent parameter recovery (all rs > 0.87; 
Figure S1
).
Additionally, the posterior predictive prediction successfully replicated the key patterns observed in our behavioural data (see Methods and 
Figure S2)
. We therefore used this model to estimate participants' baseline discounting preference, and to determine whether these parameters varied between groups 
(Figure 3b)
.  


Damage to mPFC enhances susceptibility to impulsive social influence
After assessing participants' initial temporal preferences amongst groups, we proceeded to examine their susceptibility to social influence using signed KL divergence (DKL) (see Methods). DKL quantifies the difference between two probability distributions 
35,
53
 . This metric evaluates the entire probability distribution, rather than solely focusing on summary statistics or point estimates derived from those distributions. We used DKL to formally quantify the shift of model parameters (i.e., km and ku) due to social influence (see Methods).
Throughout our analysis, we signed DKL to indicate the direction of shifting in the discounting distributions relative to the baseline. Positive signed DKL values signify a shift towards the discounting preferences of others (i.e., becoming more similar to others), whereas negative values indicate a divergence from them compared to baseline preferences.
We examined whether there were group differences in susceptibility to social influence when exposed to information about impulsive and patient others using an LMM 
(Figure 4
, 
Table    S3
). Given differences in people's baseline impulsivity amongst the three groups, this LMM included participants' baseline km (continuous covariates, centred around the grand mean) and its interaction with fixed effects of group (HC, mPFC, and LC), other's preference (patient vs impulsive), and their interactions as fixed terms, along with a random subject-level intercept.
Strikingly, we found that participants with mPFC damage were more influenced by impulsive relative to patient others, compared to healthy controls (group × others interaction HC vs mPFC: b [95% CI] = 0.28 [0.03 0.54], p = 0.031). Post-hoc tests uncovered that this interaction was primarily driven by the mPFC lesion group being more susceptible to impulsive social influence compared to healthy controls (HC vs mPFC estimate = -0.46, SE = 0.17, t = -2.70, p = 0.007). In contrast, there was no statistical difference between participants with mPFC lesions and healthy controls in their susceptibility to patient social influence (HC vs mPFC estimate = 0.08, SE = 0.19, t = 0.41, p = 0.683, BF01 = 4.01). The mPFC lesion group were also overall more susceptible to social influence compared to lesion controls (main effect LC vs mPFC, b [95% CI] = -0.41 [-0.77 -0.05], p = 0.026). Additionally, we re-ran the analysis to confirm that results remained the same accounting for the order of others' preferences (see 
Table S4
), and no significant correlation was found between impulsive and patient signed KL divergence in any group (ps > 0.49, 
Table S5
), suggesting that the order effect could not explain the group differences observed here. Furthermore, an exploratory control analysis that accounted for baseline preference uncertainty did not change the interaction results reported above ( 
Table S6
), suggesting that the group differences in susceptibility to social influence were not attributed to individual differences in preference uncertainty. Importantly, although participants with mPFC lesions were relatively more susceptible to impulsive social influence, they did not report feeling more similar to impulsive others (main effect patient others vs  
Table S7
) or with their perceived similarity to others (ps > 0.12, 
Table S8
), suggesting these group differences were not driven by possible individual differences in learning ability or perceived similarity to others. Taken together, these results demonstrate that brain damage specifically to the mPFC enhanced people's susceptibility to social influence, with impulsive social influence particularly affected. (post-hoc p = 0.007, follow-up of a significant LMM interaction). In contrast, the mPFC lesion group did not significantly differ from healthy controls in their susceptibility to patient social influence (post-hoc p = 0.683, BF01 = 4.01). Participants with mPFC lesions also showed heightened susceptibility to social influence overall, regardless of whether the influence was more impulsive or more patient, when 


Damage specifically to dmPFC is associated with heightened susceptibility to impulsive social influence
Next, we used voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) to examine whether subregions within mPFC were linked to group differences in susceptibility to social influence. The VLSM analysis pinpoints voxels where participants with damage at that voxel, compared to participants with damage elsewhere, show differences in susceptibility to impulsive relative to patient social influence (i.e., signed impulsive DKL minus signed patient DKL; N = 26 where both patient and impulsive others were present, see Methods). VLSM assesses whether the lesion in each voxel predicts an individual's behaviour by generating a map of the t-statistics 
54
 . We included voxels where damage was present in at least five participants 
55
 . We used the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) 
56
 to conduct permutation-based VLSM with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) 
57,
58
 . The combination of permutation testing with TFCE allowed us to achieve an optimal balance between sensitivity to true effects and reducing the risk of identifying small, potentially spurious effects 
54,
57
 . Significance was reported at permutationbased TFCE p < 0.025 (permutation-based TFCE p < 0.05 Bonferroni-corrected across two behavioural regressors). As a control analysis, we first confirmed that there was no significant association between the overall degree of damage (i.e., total lesion size) and susceptibility to social influence (see Methods).
The VLSM analysis revealed only one region, in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) incorporating parts of area 9 ( 
Figure 5
, peak MNI coordinate 
[2,
40,
20]
, cluster size k = 282), that correlated with the behavioural difference in susceptibility to social influence. To further examine this correlation between this dmPFC area and increased susceptibility to impulsive social influence, we repeated our analysis incorporating lesion controls with damage outside of the mPFC (N = 42 in total). This analysis confirmed the involvement of an overlapping region within the dmPFC (area 9; 
Figure S3
, peak MNI coordinate 
[2,
40,
20]
, k = 1) identified in our prior analysis. These results highlight that damage to an area within the dmPFC, rather than ventral portions, made people more susceptible to influence by impulsive versus patient others. 


Damage to vmPFC and ventral striatum is associated with increased temporal impulsivity
Finally, we used another VLSM to test whether there were any mPFC subregions where damage underpinned the behavioural increase in temporal impulsivity, that is how much participants discounted the reward value over time (i.e., km parameters; N = 33 for mPFC lesion participants) (see Methods). Again, there was no significant association found between the overall degree of damage (i.e., total lesion size) and temporal impulsivity (see Methods).
We found no significant correlation between mPFC damage and heightened baseline temporal impulsivity at our threshold criteria (permutation-based TFCE p < 0.025). Subsequently, we adopted an exploratory approach, examining whether any regions were significantly associated at uncorrected levels after permutation testing (p < 0.05). This analysis revealed that lesions in two distinct clusters, one encompassing the ventral portions of mPFC corresponding to area 13 ( 
Figure 6
, peak MNI coordinate 
[16, 14, -18]
, cluster size k = 6) as well as area 25 (peak MNI coordinate 
[6, 18, -8]
, cluster size k = 2), and another in the most ventral parts of the striatum putatively corresponding to the nucleus accumbens (peak MNI coordinate 
[12, 14, -12]
, cluster size k = 2). In these areas damage was associated with increased temporal impulsivity, as evidenced by increased km parameters.
To provide further evidence for the robustness of this exploratory analysis, we repeated our analysis including lesion controls with damage outside of the mPFC (N = 50 in total). Here, we again found a portion in the vmPFC area 25 ( 
Figure S4
, peak MNI coordinate 
[6, 12, -10]
, cluster size k = 3) and ventral striatum (peak MNI coordinate 
[14, 22, -4]
, cluster size k = 3)
where damage was correlated with enhanced baseline temporal impulsivity.

The underlying data and code used to generate this figure can be found at https://osf.io/qzurp/.

Discussion
Several lines of evidence implicate the mPFC as crucial for processing social information and for economic decision-making 
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
 . However, theoretical and empirical accounts of mPFC function have been mixed, with studies claiming a role in economic or social processing, or both, and precise contributions of distinct mPFC subregions often overlooked. Here, by integrating an economic decision-making task measuring susceptibility to social influence in parallel with temporal discounting and leveraging Bayesian computational models, we demonstrate mPFC is causally involved in social influence. Moreover, heightened susceptibility to impulsive social influence is attributed to specific damage to the dmPFC. We also observed that mPFC damage was associated with increased baseline temporal discounting compared to healthy controls, with this heightened temporal impulsivity linked to damage in vmPFC and ventral striatum in exploratory analyses. Together, these results demonstrate the fundamental role of the dmPFC in social influence.
Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested that the dmPFC processes social conformity by detecting misalignment between one's own and other's opinions 
1,
12,
42,
59,
60
 , with its activity associated with the extent of subsequent conformity under social influence 
[61]
[62]
[63]
[64]
[65]
[66]
 . A functional neuroimaging study on the social contagion of risk preferences also found that the dmPFC, along with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL), was involved in belief updating when participants learnt about others' risk preferences 
67
 . In addition, in both humans 
68,
69
 and macaque monkeys 70 , the dmPFC has been shown to track the reliability of social information and to moderate the integration of self and social information based on their respective levels of certainty. This belief updating mechanism holds significance in understanding social conformity. However, following this line of research, one might expect that damage to the dmPFC would lead to decreased susceptibility to social influence, rather than an increase 
71,
72
 . Instead, we found that damage here increased susceptibility to social influence.
One putative function of the dmPFC is in maintaining self-other distinction 
73
 , differentiating signals attributed to oneself from simulated signals attributed to another person 
74,
75
 . Achieving successful self-other distinction is essential for effective social interaction, including optimal display of social conformity. Recent studies have suggested that the dmPFC facilitates distinguishing the abilities of others from one's own 
30
 , and that applying continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over the dmPFC disrupts this self-other distinction 
14
 . Moreover, another study found that disrupting the dmPFC activity through transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) led macaque monkeys to exhibit suboptimal reliance on unreliable social information over non-social (self) information . Similarly, a recent study found that downregulating the dmPFC activity using cTBS impaired learning performance during observational action-based learning by disrupting the predictability of the demonstrator's actions 
76
 . Therefore, one possibility is that damage to dmPFC could blur the self-other distinction and hinder the effective use of social information, prompting people to excessively depend on others for information, thereby increasing susceptibility to social influence. This process may drive the asymmetry we observed in susceptibility to impulsive vs patient social influence in those with dmPFC damage. Although they did not report feeling more similar to impulsive others, their similarity to impulsive others could drive an implicit process where they were particularly susceptible to being influenced by others who also displayed impulsive choices.
Another perspective on the mechanisms behind social conformity is related to reinforcement learning 
64,
66,
77
 . In the reinforcement learning framework, learning is driven by prediction errors, the discrepancy between expected and actual outcomes 
78
 . When people's own preferences differ from those of others, such social expectancy prediction errors are encoded in the dmPFC 
27,
61,
[64]
[65]
[66]
79
 . People use this error signal to reduce the difference between self and others by either learning from or conforming to others 
61,
[64]
[65]
[66]
 . In situations where people are unable to fully know the preferences or intentions of others, but still consider others' choices to be informative, they must infer other's mental states to optimise their own actions. In such scenarios, they need to evaluate the reliability of others' choices, emulate others' intentions, and integrate the inferred social information with their own, all of which entail the involvement of the dmPFC 
68,
80
 . Therefore, given the central role of the dmPFC in reinforcement learning within social contexts, damage to the dmPFC may result in atypical social prediction errors which heighten social conformity. Future studies could probe these alternative explanations further. Notably, learning accuracy of others' preference was intentionally high in the current paradigm to ensure all groups were able to learn others' preferences so they could be influenced by them. Future paradigms could explicitly measure the effects of dmPFC damage on social learning in paradigms where learning accuracy is more variable such as whilst assessing mentalising 
81
 , vicarious learning 
13,
69,
82
 , or other social behaviours. In non-social decision-making, theories of mPFC suggest that it may contextualise learning by providing a 'task space' or map that allows learning to be constrained to certain 'states' 83 -for example, mPFC may prevent learning when generalising to irrelevant contexts. Perhaps maintaining self-other distinction during learning could be regarded as a specific case of this.
It is somewhat surprising that people adjust their own preferences to align with others, even when such alignment could reduce their bonus payment. In our experimental design, participants were incentivised to prioritise their own outcomes and were explicitly informed that their decisions for others had no consequences for anyone involved, which highlights the robustness of the observed effects. It suggests that these preference shifts are not merely a byproduct of external factors, but instead reflect deeper cognitive or motivational processes 
27,
34
 .
The question of whether the brain has specialised regions and circuits for social behaviour is central to social neuroscience 
8,
[84]
[85]
[86]
 . Previous work has identified how social specificity may be realised at different levels of explanation . Our task had many features to enhance its ability to capture social processes, including two different social others with different preferences, informing participants the choices they observed were from real others, and carefully probing for any disbelief in the social manipulation. Furthermore, existing studies including control conditions that match the same stimuli and actions, but do not require social simulation, failed to replicate changes in participants' discounting preferences 
27
 . This suggests that simulation of other agents' mental states -a central aspect of social interaction 86,87 -is essential for the observed changes in people's preferences, which highlights the importance of social component of the influence effect. To fully address whether shifts in people's own preferences occur in the absence of social influence, future studies could consider including a non-social control targeting different levels of explanation for social specificity. This additional control condition could reveal the cognitive boundaries and specific neural systems that underpin social influence and whether they are common or distinct from non-social processes.
Our findings show that damage to mPFC results in heightened preferences for immediate reward options over delayed ones, aligning with prior findings suggesting the significant involvement of the mPFC in temporal discounting 
43,
44,
[46]
[47]
[48]
[88]
[89]
[90]
[91]
[92]
[93]
 . In addition to showing these robust effects at the group level, we exploratively localised heightened impulsivity to the vmPFC, putatively in areas 13 and 25. Prior studies have suggested that the vmPFC plays a crucial role in inter-temporal decision-making, with damage to vmPFC (in smaller samples) typically resulting in increased temporal discounting 
[46]
[47]
[48]
93
 . A recent study also showed that individual differences in temporal discounting preferences could be predicted by specific patterns of brain activity involving the vmPFC 
94
 . One possible explanation for people's preference for immediate rewards over future ones is the less tangible and more abstract nature of future rewards 
95,
96
 . It has been reported that vividly imagining prospective events (i.e., episodic future thinking) reduces temporal discounting 
97,
98
 , supporting the assertion that future rewards are less favoured due to their perceived intangibility. The integrity of the vmPFC may be crucial in episodic future thinking 
47,
[99]
[100]
[101]
[102]
 .
We also found that damage to the ventral striatum, previously linked to processing value and reward 
15
 , was associated with steeper temporal discounting. These findings are important as they provide initial causal evidence for the role of striatum in inter-temporal decision-making where its function is highly debated. While several human neuroimaging studies have linked the ventral striatum to encoding the subjective value of delayed rewards 
17,
103,
104
 , reflecting the difference in subjective value between delayed and immediate rewards 
105
 , as well as tracking the objective magnitude of delayed rewards 106 , other evidence suggests that the ventral striatum may exhibit increased activation in response to immediate rewards compared to delayed ones

 . Moreover, some studies have demonstrated that ventral striatum activity is positively associated with temporal impulsivity 
43,
109
 , whereas others have found that its activity tracks participants' choices for delayed rewards 
105
 . Due to the anatomical location of the ventral striatum, there have been limited lesion studies or non-invasive stimulation studies in humans. Intriguingly, research in rodents has revealed that damage to the ventral striatum core results in a reduced probability of selecting delayed rewards 
110,
111
 , which fits with our finding here. Future studies could use new brain stimulation techniques, such as focused ultrasound, to dynamically module ventral striatum response during temporal discounting.
In addition to these novel findings, our study also has limitations. Whilst we were able to recruit a relatively large sample over several years, there were fewer participants with damage covering ventral striatum and only exploratory evidence for a role of this area. Further studies in larger samples are needed to confirm the precise role of ventral striatum in temporal discounting. Second, we measured a specific type of social influence in terms of economic preferences. It would be important for future work to map the wider types of social influence that are associated with dmPFC function. For example, the dmPFC and adjacent perigenual cingulate cortex have been linked to tracking confidence in several neuroimaging studies 
112,
113
 .
Whilst we did not observe any group differences between those with mPFC lesions and healthy controls in processing uncertainty at baseline, it would be interesting to evaluate the role of confidence in being influenced by other people. In contrast, healthy controls differed from both lesion groups in their baseline temporal discounting preferences. However, we controlled for baseline discounting preferences in our statistical models, and the two others that participants learnt about were modelled to be more impulsive or patient relative to participants' own baseline. The two lesion groups also did not differ, despite having brain damage in distinct areas. This ensured that differences in initial temporal discounting, before social influence, were accounted for. Additionally, while we have used advanced lesionsymptom mapping with a relatively large cohort of patients to establish a causal link between the mPFC and susceptibility to social influence, there could be alternative explanations for some associations. For example, there could be shared causes that make brain lesions and impulsivity more likely to co-occur. However, the lesion control group was designed to control for effects that simply correlate with having brain lesions. Moreover, our choices of patients who predominantly had aneurysmal haemorrhages, which are stochastic events with relatively weak causal associations with impulsivity, also reduced the chance of a confounding variable influencing our findings. Future research would ideally take a multi-centre longitudinal approach to be able to provide even stronger causal evidence.
In conclusion, we show that participants with damage to the mPFC are more prone to social influence. This increased susceptibility to social influence was linked to specific damage to the dmPFC when such influence was impulsive. Furthermore, lesions to mPFC were associated with elevated baseline temporal discounting compared to healthy controls. This heightened temporal impulsivity was linked to lesions in the vmPFC and ventral striatum in exploratory analyses. Taken together, these results reveal that the mPFC plays a causal role in social influence with damage specifically to the dmPFC crucial for being influenced by others.


Materials and Methods


Participants
Three groups of participants were recruited: the lesion group with focal damage to the mPFC, The majority of patients had suffered subarachnoid haemorrhages from rupture of an aneurysm (anterior communicating artery aneurysm in mPFC patients). Four had frontal meningiomas resected, and one had an ischaemic stroke. The participants were carefully screened and selected to ensure there were no discrepancies in terms of gender ( (") " = 1.67, p = 0.433) or age (ps > 0.20). In the mPFC group, 13 were on antihypertensives, two were taking amitriptyline, one was on pregabalin, and one was taking levetiracetam, with no other neurological or psychiatric medication. In the lesion control group, four were on antihypertensives, two were on citalopram and one was on paroxetine, one was on pregabalin, one on pregabalin, and one was on lamotrigine plus levetiracetam. ; p = 0.014) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory 116 ; p = 0.033) compared to the HC group. There was no significant difference between these measures when comparing the mPFC group to the LC group (ps > 0.15).
One participant from the HC and mPFC groups had incomplete data on the self-report questionnaire measures, leading to their exclusion from the relevant analyses. In the final sample, as a result of the task's adaptive nature, two HC participants and two mPFC participants had two others with 'more patient' preferences. Data from these participants were unavailable for analyses regarding others with 'more impulsive' preferences (i.e., learning accuracy and susceptibility to social influence). Likewise, eight HC participants, five mPFC participants, and one LC participant had two others with 'more impulsive' preferences. Their data was unavailable for all analyses related to others with 'more patient' preferences (i.e., learning accuracy and susceptibility to social influence).

Lesion identification


Procedure
Participants took part in a one-time on-site test that began with a clinical assessment with a neurologist (SGM). Following this, participants completed the delegated inter-temporal choice task 
35
 , in addition to three separate experimental tasks (being reported elsewhere) and a series of other questionnaires. Participants received compensation of £10 per hour and were informed they would earn an extra bonus determined by a trial randomly selected from the task: the bonus would be awarded following a designated delay period, unless immediately.
Actually, participants received a bonus that varied between £1 and £10 chosen randomly on the day they were tested and were notified that a trial had been selected.
Delegated inter-temporal choice task. Participants engaged in a delegated inter-temporal choice task where they learnt about the preferences of impulsive and patient others after making their own temporal discounting choices 
(Figure 2a)
. During the task, participants were asked to choose between two options: one was a smaller amount of money delivered immediately (today), while the other was a larger amount of money delivered after a variable delay period. The amount of reward ranged from £1 to £20, and the delay period varied between 1 and 90 days (this was subject to dynamic adjustments in the Self blocks). Both the immediate and delayed options were displayed simultaneously, with their positions on the screen being randomised across trials. The whole experiment consisted of five blocks of 50 trials (Self1, Other1, Self2, Other2, Self3), with a self-paced break halfway through each block, resulting in 250 trials in total. Participants were told that the decisions they would learn about during the task were those made by prior participants of the study. However, in reality, these decisions were generated by a simulation algorithm (see Methods). None of the participants reported disbelief regarding the authenticity of these decisions being from actual people during or after the task to the experimenter. We further probed whether they had any disbelief in a post-study survey by asking if they had any questions or concerns about the task they
completed. Both checks further demonstrated the validity of our task.
During the trials within the Self blocks (i.e., the first, third, and fifth blocks), participants were instructed to choose the option that genuinely reflected their own preferences, as they believed that one of these chosen options would be actualised as their bonus payment. During the trials within the Other blocks (i.e., the second and fourth blocks), participants were instructed to learn about the decisions made by two others, under the belief that these choices reflected the decisions of previous participants.  Delegated inter-temporal choice task-specific questionnaires. Participants were presented questions to assess their perceived similarity to others in the task. They provided their ratings using a sliding scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very similar). All self-report measures were collected via the Qualtrics platform (https://www.qualtrics.com/).


Statistical analysis
We  


Computational modelling
Participants' decisions in each experimental block were separately used to estimate their discount rates using a standard hyperbolic discounting model 123 :
$$ = $$ 1 + (1)
where VLL represents the subjective value of a larger-and-later option, MLL denotes the objective magnitude of that reward, D is the delay before receiving the reward, and K is the hyperbolic discount rate specific to each participant, which quantifies the devaluation of largerand-later options by time. The subjective value (VSS) of a smaller-and-sooner option is always equivalent to its objective magnitude (MSS) because the delay period for this reward is zero.
Previous studies indicate that the parameter, k = log10(K), usually follows a nearly normal distribution in the population 
27,
34
 . Therefore, all the analyses presented are based on k, which is the log-transformed measure of K. As k → -∞, people generally do not discount delayed options, evaluating an offer purely on its objective magnitude. When k → 0, people grow more sensitive to delay periods and tend to discount delayed options more steeply.


Preference-temperature (KT) model
In the course of the experiment, the preference-temperature (KT) model was applied to approximate participants' behaviours in the Self1 block and to simulate the choices made by the other people. The KT model posits that each participant has a unique, inherent discount rate. Within this framework, the following softmax function was utilised to transform the difference subjective values of the two options (VLL -VSS) on each trial into the probability of selecting the delayed option:
$$ = 1 + %&(' !! %' "" ) (2)
where T represents the inverse temperature parameter specific to each participant, characterising the variability or randomness in a person's decision-making process. A lower value of T leads to increased non-systematic fluctuations around the point of indifference, which is the point where both options are equally favoured. During the Self1 block of the experiment, the free parameter k was assigned values ranging from -4 to 0, while the log10(T) parameter (denoted as t) had its value set within a range from -1 to 1.


Preference-uncertainty (KU) model
Contrary to the KT model described earlier, the preference-uncertainty (KU) model suggests that participants' discount rates should be viewed as a distribution, rather than a single definitive value 
34
 . On each trial, participants draw a k value from a normally distributed discounting distribution that is specific to each participant and is updated after every trial:
( = ( ; , " )
(3)
where free parameters km and ku correspond to the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution, respectively. Derived from the Eq (1), participants will only choose the delayed option under the condition that k < log10[(MLL / MSS -1) / D]; the probability of selecting the delayed option, given a single sampled value from the discounting distribution specified in Eq (3) is:
$$ = Ψ(log )* [( $$ / ++ − 1)/ ]; , " )
(4)
where Ψ represents the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution. Model fitting was conducted using R 117 (v4. Our study focused on testing the involvement of mPFC in people's susceptibility to social influence. Building upon our previous work 126 , we employed the established KU model as our analytical framework to assess data from these lesion participants. We successfully recovered all the parameters in the KU model (all rs > 0.87, 
Figure S1
) as well as confirming excellent posterior predictive accuracy of the modelled parameters ( 
Figure S2)
.


Model fitting
We used R (v4. 
∼ ? , , , " B
(5)
where , and , represent the group-level mean and standard deviation, respectively. The group-level parameters were defined using weakly-informative priors: , followed a normal distribution centred around 0, with a standard deviation that was adjusted based on free parameters. Concurrently, , was modelled using a half-Cauchy distribution, with its location parameter set at 0 and its scale parameter adjusted in accordance with free parameters. In the preference-temperature (KT) model, the parameter k was subjected to a negative constraint, whereas t was constrained to lie within the range of [-1, 1]. In the preferenceuncertainty (KU) model, the parameter km was negatively constrained, whereas ku was constrained positively. To facilitate more conservative estimation of all free parameters, priors were reset at the start of each experimental block. Hierarchical Bayesian modelling was applied separately for the groups of healthy controls, mPFC lesion patients, and lesion controls, with identical weakly-informative priors used across groups to promote conservative parameter estimation 
127,
128
 .
All free parameters at both the group and individual levels were simultaneously estimated through Bayes' theorem by integrating behavioural data. We fitted each model with four independent HMC chains, where each chain included 2,000 iterations following an initial 2,000
warm-up iterations. This process generated a total of 8,000 valid posterior samples. The convergence of HMC was assessed both visually by examining trace plots, and quantitatively by using the Gelman-Rubin D statistics. In the chosen model, the D values for all free parameters were close to 1.0, indicating that convergence was achieved satisfactorily.


Parameter recovery
Following model fitting, we verified the identifiability of parameters through parameter recovery. Let denote a generic free parameter in the selected model. We randomly drew a set of group-level parameters from the identical weakly-informative prior group-level distribution that was used in model fitting. Here, , and , represent the mean and standard deviation at the group level, respectively:
, ∼ (0, 3) , ∼ ℋ (0, 2)
(6)
where ℋ refers to the half-Cauchy distribution. Next, we generated data for 120 synthetic participants by deriving their parameters from this set of group-level parameters. For these 120 synthetic participants, their individual-level parameters, denoted as -, were drawn from a normal distribution using the corresponding group-level parameters:
-∼ ? , , , " B.
(7)
Subsequently, we employed the chosen model as a tool to generate simulated behavioural data for our social discounting task. Specifically, we simulated decisions across 50 trials for each synthetic participant, using the choice pairs derived from the generative method (see the below Optimisation of choice pairs). Then, we applied our selected model to the simulated data following the same procedure we used for the actual participant data. Particularly, we fitted the KU model to the individual simulated data using HMC through Stan. This process resulted in posterior distributions for the free parameters at both group and individual levels.
Finally, we calculated Spearman's Rho correlations to compare the simulated and recovered parameters at the individual level. We repeated the entire parameter recovery process 20 times, averaging the Spearman's Rho correlation coefficients through Fisher's Ztransformation.


Posterior predictive checks
We used posterior predictive checks to assess how well the posterior estimates from our winning model replicated key aspects of participants' behaviour, such as their ability to learn others' preferences. Specifically, we employed a post-hoc absolute-fit approach 
51
 , which took into account participants' actual decisions and option pairs, to generate predictions using the entire set of posterior Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples from the winning model.
We generated synthetic decisions repeatedly, matching the number of MCMC samples (i.e., times) for each trial and each participant, using individual-level posterior parameters obtained from model estimation. We then analysed the synthetic data with the same methods applied to the actual data, using a linear mixed-effects model (LMM). This LMM included fixed effects of group (healthy controls, mPFC lesions, and lesion controls), other's preference (patient vs impulsive), and their interactions, along with a random subject-level intercept.


Optimisation of choice pairs
To accurately estimate participants' preferences for discounting, choice pairs in all Self blocks were generated by switching between two methods: For all Other blocks and parameter recovery processes, choice pairs were exclusively generated using the generative method. The choices given to participants were specifically structured to match the indifference points of 50 hypothetical participants, whose k values were evenly spread from -4 to 0.


Simulation of the other people's choices
The behaviours of the two other people were modelled based on the participants' baseline discount rates, which were determined through the KT model during the Self1 block. More specifically, the decisions of the other people were generated by a simulated hyperbolic discounting model, where the discount rate k was adjusted to be either plus one (more experimental block. Importantly, the decisions made by the simulated hyperbolic discounter were subject to an extent of randomness. This randomness arose from the process of converting the subjective value of options into a choice probability through a softmax function with the inverse temperature parameter t = 1. The order of the other people's preferences (more impulsive vs more patient) was counterbalanced across participants.


Signed Kullback-Leibler divergence
The Kullback-Leibler divergence (DKL), which quantifies the difference between two probability distributions 
53
 , was used to measure the variation in participants' discount rates (k) after learning about the other people. DKL is defined as follows:
.$ ( || ) = L ( )log )* O ( ) ( ) Q ∞ %∞
(5)
where P and Q represent the distributions of a continuous random variable over a sample space, , and p and q denote the respective probability densities of P and Q. In our study, we used DKL to quantify the divergence between the posterior distributions of k at the end of two successive Self blocks. DKL was signed for subsequent analyses 
35
 . Positive signed DKL values indicate a shift in participants' discounting preferences towards those of the other people,
whereas negative signed DKL values suggest a move away from the other people's preferences, relative to the baseline discounting preferences: 
Signed .$ = ⎩ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎧ .$ , other, -− self, ) self, -9) − self, ) > 0 − .$ , other, -− self, ) self, -9) − self, ) < 0
(


Voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM)
Two behavioural regressors of interest were selected for VLSM based on our a-priori hypotheses:
1. Contrast between susceptibilities to impulsive and patient social influence (i.e., signed impulsive DKL -signed patient DKL) 2. Self baseline discount rates (i.e., self km in the Self1 block)
The examination of the contrasts between susceptibilities to impulsive and patient social influence aimed to determine if damage to specific subregions of the mPFC was responsible for the increased susceptibility to impulsive social influence observed in the between-group analysis. This analysis only included participants who had both patient and impulsive others
present. Additionally, we tested whether the heightened temporal impulsivity observed in the mPFC lesion group, compared to healthy controls, was linked to distinct subregions of the mPFC.
We utilised FSL 56 (v6.0.7.6)'s randomise function to conduct a permutation-based VLSM analysis 
57,
58
 , which compares lesion participants with damage at each voxel to all other lesion participants. FSL has been validated for performing VLBM analyses and is widely utilised, as highlighted by its adoption in several recent lesion studies 
[131]
[132]
[133]
[134]
[135]
 . FSL implements the latest advancements in brain-based analysis, maintaining regular updates, and remaining open source. FSL also supports the use of threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE), which maximises power and uses non-arbitrary definitions of cluster size 57 . This feature is not currently available in other lesion-mapping toolboxes, such as LESYMAP and NiiStat. To increase power, we mirrored the lesion participants' lesion maps, as we did not have specific hypotheses about laterality of mPFC function 
134,
135
 , resulting in symmetrical masks. Voxels were included in the VLSM analysis only if at least five participants had some degree of damage in that voxel. Each behavioural regressor of interest was ranked to correct for skewness in the residuals distribution 
58
 and then z-scored, in accordance with the requirements of FSL to align with the nature of our experimental design, before being input into the FSL design files.
P values were generated through permutation-based TFCE in randomise with 5,000 permutations and FSL's default TFCE settings, which are optimised for this type of data 
57,
58
 .
Permutation testing repeats the same analysis multiple times with the randomly shuffled data to calculate voxel-wise P values, which estimate the probability that the observed effect could be attributed to random noise. This approach therefore more accurately reflects the nature of the data, relies on fewer assumptions compared to other methods, and can be combined with the advantages of TFCE 
58
 . Permutation testing is widely recognized as the 'gold standard' for addressing multiple comparisons in VLSM studies 
136
 . By combining permutation testing with TFCE, we effectively balanced sensitivity to true effects while minimizing the likelihood of detecting small, potentially spurious effects 
54
 . To ensure even greater stringency, we further applied a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons across the two behavioural regressors of interest (p < 0.025) to the uncorrected maps from the permutation-based TFCE results. For the purpose of visualisation, we applied binarized masks of the significant areas from each analysis to the t-values.      S1

). All three groups of participants (HC, mPFC, LC) demonstrated learning performances surpassing the chance level when learning about impulsive (HC mean [SE] = 81% [0.8%], mPFC = 79% [1.1%], LC mean = 78% [1.8%]; right-tailed exact binomial test against 50%, all proportions = 1.00, ps < 0.001) and patient others (HC = 85% [0.7%], mPFC = 80% [1.4%], LC = 80% [2.1%]; right-tailed exact binomial test against 50%, all


Comparing the temporal impulsivity parameter (i.e., km) between groups revealed a main effect of group (one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA]: F(2, 118) = 6.36, p = 0.002, η 2 [95% CI] = 0.10 [0.02 0.20]; Supplementary Note 1). We found that brain damage, whether within the mPFC or outside of it, resulted in increased temporal impulsivity compared to the healthy control group (post-hoc comparison mPFC vs HC estimate = 1.30, SE = 0.40, t = 3.23, p = 0.002; LC vs HC estimate = 1.17, SE = 0.52, t = 2.27, p = 0.03). There was no significant difference in terms of temporal impulsivity between the two lesion groups (mPFC vs LC estimate = 0.13, SE = 0.57, t = 0.22, p = 0.824, BF01 = 3.29). Additionally, comparing the preference uncertainty parameter (i.e., ku) between groups also showed a main effect of group (one-way ANOVA: F(2, 118) = 9.55, p < 0.001, η 2 [95% CI] = 0.14 [0.04 0.25]; Supplementary Note 1). While lesion controls demonstrated higher uncertainty in their own discounting preferences compared to healthy controls (LC vs HC estimate = 0.58, SE = 0.13, t = 4.37, p < 0.001), participants with mPFC lesions did not exhibit this behavioural pattern (mPFC vs HC estimate = 0.10, SE = 0.10, t = 0.95, p = 0.343, BF01 = 2.81). Even upon directly comparing the two lesion groups, lesion controls still showed greater preference uncertainty compared to those with mPFC lesions (LC vs mPFC estimate = 0.48, SE = 0.15, t = 3.28, p = 0.001).Notably, this increased preference uncertainty was not explained by total lesion size (correlation ku vs lesion size within the LC group: rs(15) = -0.07 [-0.54 0.42], p = 0.779, BF01 = 3.24). These findings suggest damage to the mPFC increases temporal impulsivity but not preference uncertainty.

the lesion control (LC) group with lesions outside of mPFC, and the age-and gender-matched healthy control (HC) group. The lesion participants were selected from a database of 453 individuals with neurological conditions, while the healthy controls were recruited from university databases and the community. The mPFC lesion group consisted of 33 patients with mPFC damage (age range = 37-76, mean = 56.88; 17 females). The LC group consisted of 17 participants with lesions in areas outside the mPFC (age range = 28-74, mean = 56.24; 12 females). The HC group consisted of 71 participants without any brain damage (age range = 24-76, mean = 60.73; 41 females), leading to a total sample of N = 121 for behavioural analyses. Classification of lesion location was performed from MR imaging or CT scans by a clinical neurologist (SGM). All participants gave their written consent to participate in the study, which has been ethically approved by the Medical Sciences Interdivisional Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford (Approval number: 18/LO/2152). The study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.


114 (TMT), which includes two parts, is designed to be completed as swiftly and accurately as possible. In TMT-A, participants are tasked with sequentially drawing lines to connect 25 numbers scattered randomly on a paper in ascending order (i.e., 1-2-3-4, etc.), serving as a test of visual attention. TMT-B requires participants to alternate between numbers (1-13) and letters (A-L) in their connections (i.e., 1-A-2-B-3-C, etc.), which is considered a measure of executive function. The time taken to finish each part of the test is recorded as the score.


The linear mixed-effects models were set up as follows (note that each participant contributed a single parameter data-point and therefore these models could not contain random slopes):LMM1a: Accuracy ~ Group * Preference + (1|ID) LMM1b: Accuracy ~ Group * Preference + BDI + (1|ID) LMM1c: Accuracy ~ Group * Preference + AMI + (1|ID) LMM2: Similarity ~ Group * Preference + (1|ID) LMM3a: Signed KL divergence ~ Group * Preference * Self baseline impulsivity + (1|ID) LMM3b: Signed KL divergence ~ Group * Preference * Self baseline impulsivity + BDI + (1|ID) LMM3c: Signed KL divergence ~ Group * Preference * Self baseline impulsivity + AMI + (1|ID) LMM3d: Signed KL divergence ~ Group * Preference * Self baseline impulsivity + order + (1|ID) LMM3e: Signed KL divergence ~ Group * Preference * Self baseline impulsivity + Self baseline preference uncertainty + (1|ID)Simple group comparisons were conducted using either independent parametric (t-test) or non-parametric (Wilcoxon two-sided signed rank test) methods. To assess non-significant results, Bayes factors (BF01) were calculated using either paired and independent Bayesian ttests ('ttestBF' function from the {BayesFactor} package v0.9.12-4.4) or through linear models ('lmBF' function from the same package) with the default prior. BF01 measures how much more likely that the data is under the null hypothesis of no difference, as opposed to the alternative hypothesis of a difference.

generative and adaptive methods, within the context of the KT model framework. The generative approach entailed creating every possible pair of amounts and delays for the choice options. Within each Self block, 25 trials (i.e., half of the trials in each Self block) were selected to closely match the indifference points of 25 hypothetical participants. These participants had k values that were uniformly distributed across the range from -4 to 0. This method provided an efficient yet somewhat imprecise estimation of participants' discounting parameters. The other 25 trials in each Self block were created through an adaptive approach, utilising a Bayesian framework to achieve precise estimates of the discounting parameters 129,130 . Previous studies have shown that this technique can generate more reliable estimates of the k value with fewer trials needed. The participant's initial prior belief about k was defined as a normal distribution with a mean of -2 and a standard deviation of 1, and t was fixed at 0.3. After every decision by the participant, their belief distribution of k was updated according to Bayes' theorem. Following this update, choice pairs were generated to test our estimate of the participant's indifference point, derived from the expected value of k's current posterior distribution.

Where km represents the mean of the discount rate distribution as estimated by the KU model, and the subscript i indicates the number of Other blocks (i.e., either 2 or 4). For instance, if a participant's discounting preference becomes more negative (i.e., more patient) following exposure to the discounting preference of a more patient other person, this change would be reflected by a positive signed DKL value. On the other hand, negative signed DKL values indicate that the participant's discounting preferences have diverged from those of the other people.

The behaviours of these two people were simulated based on the participants' own decisions from the Self1 block. Participants received feedback on their decisions, which allowed them to learn about the intertemporal preferences of the other people (see below Simulation of the other people's choices). The correct choices were characterised as those with greater estimated values from the hyperbolic model, based on a given discount rate. Two names, either gender-matched or randomly selected for participants who did not indicate their gender, were chosen to present the other two people.The participants were made aware that their selections on behalf of others were not relayed to those people and had no consequences for either themselves or the other people. The task was displayed using MATLAB 2012a (The MathWorks Inc) and the Cogent 2000 v125 graphic toolbox, a software developed by the University College London, which was formerly accessible at www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/Cogent/. The Apathy Motivation Index 115 , a scale consisting of 18 items, was used to assess participants' apathetic traits. This scale measures three dimensions of individual differences in apathy-motivation: behavioural activation, social motivation, and emotional sensitivity. Participants rated their agreement with each item on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 4. Each item's score is reversed, meaning that higher scores indicate increased levels of apathy.
Beck Depression Inventory. Symptoms of depression were assessed through the 21-item
Beck Depression Inventory 116 (BDI). Each item was rated by participants on a 4-point Likert
scale from 0 to 3, with higher cumulative scores signifying increased severity of depressive
symptoms.
Apathy Motivation Index.Trail Making Test. The Trail Making Test


used R 117 (v4.2.1) along with RStudio 118 (v2023.06.2+561) to analyse the data. Behavioural data and fitted model parameters (see below) were analysed using linear mixedeffects models (LMM; 'lmer' function from the {lme4} package 119 v1.1-33) or linear regression ('lm' function from the {stats} package 117 v4.2.1).Linear mixed-effects models (LMM) were used to predict participants' learning accuracy, signed KL divergence, and self-report perceived similarity. These models incorporated fixed effects for group (healthy controls, mPFC lesions, and lesion controls), other's preference (patient vs impulsive), and their interaction, as well as a random intercept at the subject level.Considering the differences in temporal impulsivity at the baseline among the three groups, the LMM for signed KL divergence also included participants' baseline temporal impulsivity (km; continuous covariates, centred around the grand mean) and its interaction with groups and other's preferences (including the three-way interaction) as fixed terms. Additionally, control analyses of accuracy and signed KL divergence separately included the Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI) scores and Apathy-Motivation Index (AMI) scores as a fixed term,
without interacting with the other terms (see below). A further control analysis was performed
to examine the effect of the order of others' preferences on the signed KL divergence. An exploratory control analysis was conducted to account for individual differences in baseline preference uncertainty (ku; continuous covariates, centred around the grand mean). Simple linear regressions were used to compare the group differences in their age, education years, BDI scores, AMI scores, and Trail Making Test scores. One-way analyses of variance were used to compare the temporal impulsivity (km) and preference uncertainty (ku) parameters across groups. As control analyses, analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) that separately included BDI scores and AMI scores were conducted to control for the effects of depression and apathy levels.


2.1), Stan (v2.32), and the RStan package (v2.21.7) for model fitting. Stan makes use of Hamilton Monte Carol (HMC), an exceptionally efficient Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampling method, to perform full Bayesian inference and accurately determine
the true posterior distribution. We applied hierarchical Bayesian modelling to analyse
participants' decisions on a trial-by-trial basis. In hierarchical Bayesian modelling, the
individual-level parameter, denoted by , was sampled from a group-level normal distribution,
as follows:
