You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
A large body of work in personality psychology reveals two important points about personality: first, personality traits are stable, heritable, and consistently predict behavior even across cultural or environmental variation 
(Black et al., 2010)
; second, personality represents fundamental responses to biological challenges encountered across human evolution 
(Heine & Buchtel, 2009)
. It is not surprising, then, that different cultures, which face distinct structural and ecological challenges, vary in personality 
(Schmitt et al., 2007)
.
No personality trait is unconditionally optimal 
(Nettle, 2006)
; any universally beneficial trait would quickly become a universal. Instead, each personality trait represents a fundamental behavioral tradeoff. For example, extraversion seems to confer a swath of important benefits-more sexual & reproductive opportunities 
(Nettle, 2005;
Whyte et al. 2017;
Whyte et al. 2019)
, greater social support 
(Franken, Gibson, & Mohan, 1990)
, and (in some cultures) life satisfaction 
(Kim, Schimmack, Oishi, & Tsutsui, 2018
). Yet social interaction is not without risk, and extraversion is likely to be a liability when pathogen loads are high. Accordingly, exposure to pathogens is associated with reductions in both extraversion and agreeableness 
(Mortensen, Becker, Ackerman, Neuberg, & Kenrick, 2010;
Schaller & Murray, 2008)
. Similarly, agreeableness may facilitate cooperation and trust among group members 
(White et al., 2012)
 7 -yet excessive trust and regard for the interests of others can lead to exploitation or may cause individuals not to advocate for their own interests 
(Nettle, 2006
).
These personality traits are thought to facilitate adaptive behavior that aids in cooperation or disease avoidance-but do extraverted people and nations actually fare worse when a pandemic arrives? Do agreeable and conscientious people actually cooperate more when the stakes are high? The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to test these theories of personality, disease threat, and cooperation hold using real-world data impacting people socially, emotionally, and cognitively 
(Psychological Science Editorial, 2020)
.
In the present investigation, we examine whether the Big 5 personality traits 
(Mccrae & Costa, 1999;
Costa & McCrae 1999)
, at both national-and individual-levels, are associated with compliance to mobility restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that mobility that mobility is partly an issue of compliance or conformity but is also largely an act of cooperation. Given previous work on personality and pathogen threats 
(Mortensen et al., 2010;
Schaller & Murray, 2008;
Schaller & Park, 2011)
, we expect several broad trends. First, we expect extraverts to value social interaction more highly, and thus to discount the risks faced by social mobility; thus, nations and people high in extraversion will be less likely to reduce their mobility than more introverted nations and people, particularly in domains associated with optional social behavior. Second, given that conscientiousness is associated with reduced risktolerance and a future-oriented mindset, and agreeableness with empathy and cooperation, we expect conscientiousness and agreeableness to be associated with greater reductions in mobility, perhaps especially when restrictions are required by law.
In Study 1, we combine Google mobility data (Google LLC, 2020) and nation-level personality data to examine whether national differences in personality traits are associated with reductions in social mobility. Results vary depending on domain of mobility (e.g., school vs. social gatherings), but we broadly find that agreeableness and (less consistently) conscientious regions show greater reductions in mobility, whereas regions with greater openness to experience show smaller reductions. Extroverted nations also show smaller reductions in mobility, but this effect disappears when controlling for other personality traits.
In Study 2, we seek to replicate these findings at the individual level, using data from the International Survey on Coronavirus 
(Fetzer et al., 2020)
, which includes personality and demographic variables for 113,083 individuals across 164 countries collected in March and April of 2020. We again find that conscientiousness and agreeableness (but only for women) are associated with the likelihood of staying home; contrary to regions-level results, individuallevel openness to experience and neuroticism are both positively associated with staying home.
The only personality trait that negatively predicted staying at home was extraversion.


General Method
In this study we will use both dynamic mobility data at the regional or national level as well as cross-sectional individual mobility data based on large-scale international survey. We run random effects models when exploring Google regional mobility data (study 1) and employ logit or OLS regression when working with the international survey data (study 2). Analyses were performed in Stata 16 (Version 16.1 MP).


Study 1
To begin analysing how personality traits influence social mobility looking at regional and cross-country data over time. Daily data provide the opportunity to link the social mobility data with different stages of the pandemic and allows to take into account the dynamic nature of the pandemic and how responses occurred at different periods. The different stages of responses also hold different implications for the expected level of norm compliance (e.g., recommended versus mandatory social distancing).


Data
Mobility Data. We use mobility measures on a country and regional level from the COVID-19 Controls. From the OxCGRT database, we also obtain the daily record of the number of Covid-19 related deaths and confirmed cases, taken from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and from the JHU CSSE data repository. We derived the number of days since or before the first confirmed death in the country and number of confirmed cases (in natural log) as controls. We also include country-level variables: population density (people per squared km of land area), urban population (%), share of population over 65, GDP per capita (constant 2010 USD, in log), and unemployment rate (% of total labour force) obtained from the latest World Development Indicators. In terms of household composition, we control for the average household size and the percentage of households whose head is aged between 20-64 years; this data is obtained from the United Nations Household Size & Composition, 2019. We also include a binary variable denoting whether the day is a weekend according to the each country's definition 10 . Lastly, we also control for the average temperature (tenths of degrees C), recorded on a daily basis at the regional level, obtained from the Global Historical Climate Network Daily database (see Supplemental Material for details).
Descriptive statistics for the variables used in Study 1 are reported in 
Table S2
 in the Supplemental Material. Correlations between personality traits are reported in 
Table S3,
 showing high-levels of correlations between the five personality traits (based on our sample countries).

Method
First, we model the relationship between mobility changes and personality traits with random effects (variance components) model, given the panel structure of the data where mobility is measured daily across the entire sample period at the regional level. 
Table S1
 lists the number of regions for each country in the sample with mobility measures 11 . In each regression, we include all control variables to control for mobility changes due to heterogeneity in social and population structure, the severity of the situation, containment policies across countries, and temperature across geographic areas 12 . Due to the high correlation between traits, we conduct our analysis examining one trait at a time. For robustness, we also present the result including all five traits in a single specification. Then, we examine whether such relationships are more salient after the WHO declares COVID-19 as a world pandemic by including an interaction term between trait and the declaration variable. To understand how different personalities respond to each confinement policy, we also show the changes to mobility with respect to each personality trait at different levels of strictness for each policy. We conduct all analyses with interaction terms for each trait separately.


Results
Our random effects regression reveal changes in mobility are significantly predicted by openness (Î² = .0725, SE = .0313, 95% CI = [.0112, .134], p = .0205) and agreeableness (Î² = -.0511, SE = .018, 95% CI = [-.0864, -.0158], p = .00454) (see 
Fig. 1
). Regions with one standard deviation higher in openness are associated with a .1 SD increase in overall change in mobility;
11 For 7 out of 31 countries, mobility measures are recorded at the country level. 
12
 In general, we estimate the following model = + Trait + + , where denotes mobility changes in region i at time t and Trait is the personality trait of focus of region i.
is a vector of control variables (e.g., daily record of COVID19 cases) that can include factors invariant across time (e.g., population structure) and is a conventional idiosyncratic error term. Estimates are obtained with the generalized least squares (GLS) estimator, with the standard error of the estimate clustered at the regional level.
likewise, regions with one SD higher in agreeableness have .05 SD decrease in mobility change. Extraversion seems to be positively associated with mobility change (Î² = .0592, SE = .0306, 95% CI = [-.000829, .119], p = .0533) but the effect is not precisely estimated when other personality traits are controlled for (Î² = .0593, SE = .0583, 95% CI = [-.0549, .174], p = .309). On the other hand, conscientiousness is only negative and significant when all five traits are included in the model (Î² = -.0459, SE = .0239, 95% CI = [-.0928, .000927], p = .0547).
The results in 
Fig. 2
 show that the effects of extraversion (Ï‡ 2 = 5.35, p = .021), openness (Ï‡ 2 = 11.86, p < .001), and agreeableness (Ï‡ 2 = 18.72, p < .001) on mobility change are more prominent in the period after COVID19 was declared as a global pandemic (the pre-declaration slope is not significantly different from 0, except for openness (at 10%)). Although the interaction term for conscientiousness is significant (Ï‡ 2 = 5.44, p = .02), the post-declaration slope is significantly different from 0. To be clear, the results in 
Figure 2
 represent regression coefficients, not absolute levels of mobility. Thus, the fact that openness and extraversion are more highly associated with mobility after pandemic declaration does not mean that people high on these traits increased movement, but only that these traits were more diagnostic of mobility in the post-declaration period.  
(Table S4
). Error bars represent 99.9%, 99%, 95%, and 90% confidence intervals, respectively.

Table   S10
 and S11.  
Table S6
 and S7.
In 
Fig. 3
 we see regions that are higher in extraversion and openness are more likely to increase school related mobility when only "recommended closures" are in place. Together with 
Fig. 4
, the results show that mobility incorporating public transport, workplaces and residential confinement reduces significantly and uniformly for all traits (at all levels) once policies restricting movement are put in place. Interestingly, for mobility relating to domestic travel (internal movement) and public events (see 
Fig. 5 and 6
), regions high in openness and extraversion appear to behave in a counter-compliant way once movement restrictions are put in place. Environments high in openness and extraversion appear to see an increase in citizen mobility relating to domestic travel (internal movement) and public events. Overall, higher levels of agreeableness compared to other traits lead to stronger mobility responses when recommendation are in place or when restrictions are loose. On the other hand, more extravert and more open societies are less likely reducing their mobility due to enforcements.


Study 2
In Study 2 we complement Study 1 by utilising individual-level data on psychological traits and social mobility, controlling for both individual and unique regional based characteristics.
Utilising participant variables such as age, gender, marital status, years of schooling, household size, self-rated health, as well as country specific data (population density, climate, GDP per capita, age distribution) and national COVID information (total number of confirmed cases, number of days since first death, government response) we are able to provide a more nuanced analysis of the role of personality in norm compliance (e.g., recommended versus mandatory restrictions on social mobility).


Data
Individual-level Data. In study two we utilise micro-level data from the International Survey on Coronvirus 
(Fetzer et al., 2020
) (N=113,083 from 164 countries between 20 March to 16
April 2020, 
Table S13
 shows the list of countries with more than 300 respondents) 13 . 48,894
(43.62%) Male (Mage=39.39; SDage=12.9); 63,193 (56.38%) Female (Mage=38.45; SDage=13.05); 0.88% (n=996) selected other (Mage=37.25; SDage=17.1) (see 
Fig. S1
 and 
Table   S14
 for summary statisticson respondents' charateristics).
Personality trait. Based on the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) 
(Gosling, Rentfrow, Swann, 2003)
. The Cronbach alphas (scale reliability coefficient) were .67, .3, .54, .65, and .4
13 Study 2's data were obtained from the International Survey on Coronavirus, an independent study conducted by 
Fetzer et al. (2020)
. We include a description of their methodology in the supplemental material.
for the Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Openness to Experience scales, with inter-item correlation of .5, .18, .37, .49, and .25, respectively. The Cronbach alphas results are quite similar to the original version 
(.68, .40, .50, .73, and .45, respectively;
Gosling et al. 2003)
. Personality trait measures are calculated as the average of the two-items (and are reverse coded). The resulting scales are standardized across individuals; 
Table S15
 shows the summary statistics and correlations of the five personality traits.
Mobility. We took the responses (self-rated from 0=Does not apply at all to 100=Applies very much) to questions regarding near past behaviour: "To what extent do the following statements describe your behavior for the past week?" (1) "I stayed at home" (M=80.53, SD=24.57) and
(2) "I did not attend social gatherings" (M=90.95, SD=23.35) as indicating mobility in the past. Propensity to leave home in the near future is captured by the binary response 
(Yes or No)
 to the question: "Do you need to leave your home in the next 5 days?" (59.82% indicated Yes).
The correlation between participants' tendency to stay home in the past week and need to leave home in the next five days is -.274 (P < .001, N = 113,083). Participants were also asked the reasons for leaving home where respondents chose multiple response options. Summary statistics and correlations of mobility responses are presented in 
Table S16
.
Reasons to leave home. We use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of reasons to leave home (excluding the option Other) into three factors with Eigenvalue above 1 (see 
Table S17
) 
14
 . The first factor (psychological needs) has high factor loadings on reasons such as Getting bored (.73), Getting tired of being inside of the house (.7), Exercising my freedom (.66), and Meeting friends or relatives (.5); the second factor (deemed basic necessity) has high factor loadings on Procuring food for yourself or family (.76) and Doing physical activity (.65) (with loadings just below 0.5 for Going to work (.43) and Walking a pet (.48)); the third factor (deemed medical 
14
 Results from parallel analysis and scree plot also suggest three factors to be retained from the PCA 
(Fig. S2)
. necessity) has high factor loadings on Going to the pharmacy (.62), Going to the hospital / receiving medical treatments (.69), and Taking care of dependents (.5). The reason Getting some adrenaline (from breaking the law) does not have high factor loading in any factors but is relatively high for factor 1 (.36).


Method
We regress the two outcome mobility measures, past behaviour and future propensity, on participants' five personality traits using an ordinary least squares model and logit model, respectively. For mobility measures of past behavior and personality traits, we standardized the variables for ease of interpertation of effect size. For logistic model concerning future propensity mobility, we report the odds ratios. In each regression model, we control for respondents' demographic characteristics such as age, gender (male, female, or other), marital status (married/co-habiting or single/divorced), years of schooling, and household size. A squared term for age is also included to assess non-linearity of the age effect. We also control for participants' self-rated health and self-reported number of comorbid conditions (e.g., cardiovascular diseases or diabetes). Additionally, we controlled for the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases (in logs) in the country where the respondent resides on the day of survey completion, the number of days since the first nationwide Covid-19 related death, and a set of government response indicators relating to social movement restrictions (e.g., school, workplace, or public transport closures) recorded daily. Finally, we include country fixed effects (i.e., inclusion of country dummies to control for country-level heterogeneity) 
15
 . We analysed the data with three model specifications, 1) without sampling weights, 2) employing sampling weights constructed by 
Fetzer et al. (2020)
 according to representation of income, 
15
 We model past mobility or future propensity to leave home of individual i be explained by: = + Trait + + , where is the personality trait of individual i and z is the vector of control variables which can include individual specific variables (e.g., gender), country specific time varying variables (e.g., case statistics or government policy at the time of survey completion), and the country fixed effects (set of dummy variables). education, and age and gender structure in the population in each country, and 3) sampling weights, which also take into account the size of the population of each country. In addition, we presents the findings without any controls in 
Table S18
 with qualitiatively similar results.


Results
Extroverts report lower likelihood of staying home in the previous week (Î² = -.025, SE = .005, model 1 in 
Table 1
). Individuals with higher openness (Î² = .038, SE = .005) and or agreeableness (Î² = .012, SE = .004) report the opposite, and are more likely to stay home in the previous week. Those lower in openness report report being less likely to to leave home in the next five days (OR = 0.97, SE = 0.006, model 4 in 
Table 1
). However, these effects of personality traits on mobility are quite small in general 
16
 . Strong age and gender effects are evident in our control measures. Younger, and older respondents are more likely to have stayed home and less likely to leave home in the near future. Females (compared to males) are also more likely to have stayed home previously (Î² = .037, SE = .015), and continue to stay at home in the future (OR = .79, SE = .044). Finally, the number of confirmed cases in the country is negatively correlated with the tendency to have stayed home in the past week (Î² = .19, SE = .079). For participatns who said they need to leave home in the next five days, we do not find a strong link between personality traits and specific reasons to leave home 
(Table S19
) with the exception that participatns with higher neuroticism are more likely to leave home due to psychological needs (Î² = .088, SE = .045, model (3) Table S19). Interestingly, males (as opposed to females; Î² = -.21, SE = .085) or those who rate their themselves heaither (Î² = .13, SE = .06) are also more likely to report needing to leave home because of psychological needs.
We also observe a strong non-linear age effects (inverted U-shape) on needing to leave home due to basic necessity.  
(Fig. 7)
. For both mobility variables we see a clear pattern that younger and older people are more likely to remain at home. Interacting the Big 5 traits with sex shows a strong statistically significant gender effect difference for agreeableness ( 
Fig. 8
) but not on other traits. More agreeable women respond substantially stronger with a reduction in mobility than more agreeable men.
This effect holds for both mobility variables (Stayed home past week: Î² = .019, p = .004; Need to leave home in the next five days: OR = .955, p = 0.047). We further explore whether the sex differentiated effect of agreeableness on mobility can be explained by division of labour in the households. Specifically, we find the sex difference in the effect of agreeableness only visible for participants living in households with two or more members but not for single-member household where division of labour is not possible

Discussion
Living in modern developed economiesparticularly in dense urbanised populationprovides significant advantages to the human species; for example, legal and economic advantages such as assigned property rights, economies of scale for commerce, healthcare and education, public infrastructure, and many different forms of government support services.
There are also personal, inter-personal and social advantages, such as increased marital and reproductive opportunities, exposure and access to science and the arts, the luxury of sporting endeavours, and religious and political freedoms. However, these potential gains come with risks and costs. Societies are often structured in ways that reflect these particular tradeoffssome aspects of culture may, for example, prioritize order over creativity 
(Jackson et al., 2019)
.
Rule of law dictates that populations must behave in a rational, organised and uniform way. A "herd mentality", whereby each individual's reciprocal agreement and compliance with not just the law, but also the social norm, results in both individual and socially optimal outcomes. A health epidemic presents a unique problem for society in that a potentially life threatening exogenous shock may cause some individuals to question whether they should continue to make decisions in line with what is best for themselves, or for society, especially when the outcomes for each may differ. A global pandemic is even more unique in that the micro and macro behaviours of specific regions or countries can systematically impact other societies and environments. Exploring whether country level psychological trait analysis can explain regulatory compliance (mobility behaviour) is not just important for the current global COVID19 crisis, but may also provide vital insight into a host of current and ongoing transnational issues and behaviours such as global trade, public health and education, armed conflict, climate change, and human rights or disasters and high stress life events in general 
(Gomez et al., 1999;
Kopala-Sibley et al., 2016;
Savage et al., 2020)
. The degree to which societies and individuals are impacted by their personality type, how they cope with stress 
(Monroe & Simons, 1991;
Blatt & Zuroff, 1992;
Ingram & Price, 2010)
 and the coping mechanisms they choose to employ based on those types (see 
Chung et al. 2005
) is less clear.
The current study explores how psychological traits can be utilised to understand and explain domestic mobility behaviour during the COVID19 pandemic. Our study repeatedly finds statistically significant relationships between particular traits and regulatory compliance (mobility behaviour) both before and after region specific legislative interventions, and the global announcement of the pandemic. Our random effects analysis indicates that societies higher in openness to experience less mobility decrease compared to the average, both pre and post the pandemic announcement, while regions higher in agreeableness showed a stronger decreased mobility compared to the average. When exploring specific reasons for personal movement changes such as work attendance, public transport and residential isolation, our study reports somewhat uniform behaviours across all traits. More specific analysis of individuals' willingness for domestic movement (internal travel) after the implementation of movement restrictions indicates that regions high in openness and extraversion appear to behave in a counter-compliant way, in fact increasing their social mobility which societies with higher levels of agreeableness show already cooperate behaviour when recommendations are lighter enforcements are in place.
Our micro level analysis in study 2 re-iterates our study 1 findings; i.e. higher extraversion is
shown as a predictor of increased mobility, both through previous behaviour, and future intended movement. Interestingly our age and gender analysis indicate that younger and older individuals (compared to middle aged (30-60 years old)), and females (compared to males) are more likely to reduce mobility. Higher agreeableness in females (compared to males) results in an increased likelihood of staying home previously, and an increased likelihood to stay home in the future. However, as these sex differences are only visible for those living in households with two or more people(not for single person households), such findings may allude to a simpler explanation of division of labour. Such findings also mirror a body of scientific research findings identifying women as less risk seeking, more altruistic, and more cooperative or compliant 
(Andreoni & Vesterlund 2001;
Seguino et al. 2006;
Jianakoplos & Bernasek 1998;
Hasseldine 2002;
Croson & Gneezy 2009;
Vugt et al. 2007;
Torgler & Valev 2010
, Kastlunger et al. 2010
BraÃ±as-Garza et al. 2018)
.
The current study is not without limitations. Firstly, the BIG 5 personality traits, while
shown to be globally present across cultures, are not a measure of the level of individuality or collectivism of a nation or group. As several traits directly impact a person's perception of their own individuality, the relevance of the BIG 5 are arguably diminished in more collectivistic cultures. This may be because people in collectivistic countries may rely less on traits when understanding themselves and others, compared to those from more individualistic societies 
(Heine & Buchtel 2009, p. p.369)
.
Secondly, personality is not uniform inside any population. Arguably, and for future research, a country's sense of nationalism may be more homogenous across a population, and may be extremely influential on human behaviour, particularly in developed economies. But again, this becomes scientifically problematic as both domestic and international perceptions of national character are more likely generalised stereotypes that serve a function of nationalistic identity 
(Terraciano et al. 2005)
 which is why it is important to note that an abundance of symmetry in the personality profiles of a particular population may not equate to casual findings of any particular behaviour, rather, just provide a reflection of similar cultural standards for a particular in-group 
(Heine & Buchtel 2009)
.
Finally, it is important to acknowledge some differences in results between Study 1 and 2, primarily that the Study 1's findings for openness are reversed for Study 2. And that further, standardised beta coefficients and effect sizes are small, for both agreeableness and openness.
Such differences may stem from the self-selected sample used in Study 2.
Regional level personality trait analysis is an innovative way to understand human behaviour in the context of large-scale exogenous health shocks such as the current COVID19 pandemic. And while the specific life threatening health issue of the novel coronavirus may be overcome by medical science in the not too distant future (in the form of a vaccine), scientific research that seeks to understand how individuals and groups react to societal level emergencies and the ensuing government regulatory responses is of critical importance. In fact, in the absence of such vaccinating silver bullets for this or future epidemics and pandemics, behavioural interventions may be humanity's best and only option.
Community
Mobility Reports (Google LLC, 2020), accessed on May 12, 2020 (see also Chan et al. 2020). The data are anonymized and aggregated based on Google users who have opted in to their location history service. Mobility measure records the percent change in total number of visitors to places classified as Retail & Recreation, Grocery & Pharmacy, Parks, Transit Stations, Workplaces, and percentage change to duration of stay at Residential places within the geographic area, from 15 February to 5 May 2020, compared to the median value of the same day of the week between 3 January and 6 February 2020. We use principal component analysis to extract the first principal component from the six (standardized) mobility measures to form our outcome variable. The first principal component has an eigenvalue of 4.83, explaining 80.45% of the total variance of the partial mobility to each of the six localities 8 . The corresponding eigenvectors are 0.438 (Retail & recreation), 0.404 (Grocery & pharmacy), 0.31 (Parks), 0.433 (Transit stations), 0.420 (Workplaces), and -0.429 (Residential), which serve as the component loadings of the mobility measure. The sample includes 586 geographical units from a total of 31 countries, with 24 countries at the subnational region levels (579 regions) and 7 countries at the national level (see Supplemental Material for details on region classification). For privacy reasons, Google censored values if the traffic volume is not high enough to ensure anonymity. Personality traits. Big Five personality traits at the country level are based on Terracciano et al. (2005). The study explored whether national character is reflected in personality trait levels looking at 49 cultures. The five factors are standardized to unit variance. COVID-19 Response Indicators. We explore an indicator variable denoting period before and after the WHO declared a world-wide pandemic on 11 March 2020. A set of government response indicators (recorded daily on a country level) on closures and containment relating to schools, workplaces, public events, private gatherings, public transport, residential confinement, and domestic travel, are obtained from the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). Each indicator categorises the level of strictness of the respective policy on an ordinal scale 9 .
