You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Author note: This version of the letter was accepted in PNAS on May 27, 2022. The previously (accepted) version used the original data, this one uses the corrected data. Differences are minor. Also, this version has been copy-edited. A reply to this letter from the authors of the original paper (Mertens et al.) is forthcoming.

Raincloud plots of individual effects by domain and all effects. The rain is the reported effects from papers, jittered vertically, and the cloud is the smoothed distribution of effects. The short wide vertical gray lines on each cloud depict the corresponding meta-analytic mean. The single tall thin vertical gray line is an effect size of zero.


Table 1 . Normality of effects and representativeness of meta-analytic effects

Representativeness was tested by quantifying the estimated 31 proportion of effects below meaningful thresholds (7); here, 32 the meta-analytic means. A perfectly representative (meta-33 analytic) mean would have 50% of values below it.
remaining domains only have a handful of effects slightly below
21
zero. A plausible mechanism for this left "cliff" is suppression
22
of unfavorable results (5). Most domains also exhibit long
23
right-tails-a limited number of effects with large and very
24
large magnitudes. This pattern of left-truncation and long
25
right-tails strongly indicates that publication bias is greater
26
than moderate.

All domains exhibited asymmetry, and all but one (Other)
35
had some overestimation in pooled effects. That is, a greater
36
than expected proportion of effects below their meta-analytic
37
mean. Despite left-truncation of effects, nearly two-thirds of
38
all effects were still below the overall meta-analytic mean.
39
Funnel plots can often be difficult to interpret (8), and
40
typically all effects are plotted together; thus, the severity and
41
nature of the non-normality in effects, especially by domain, 42
may not have been apparent in Mertens et al. (1). Here, 43
we evaluate effects by domain; therefore, our results cannot
44
be solely attributed to the heterogeneity and non-normality
45
potentially caused by combining domains.
27 Second, we evaluate non-normality and the representative-28 ness of pooled effects by domain (see Table 1). Normality29 was assessed using Egger's regression test for asymmetry (6).3034*For Pro-Social, the proportion of effects below is underestimated because 12 effects with a Cohen's |d| < 0.04 out of 58 effects were removed due to estimation problems.46 J.Z.B. and L.R.M. wrote the paper and performed the analyses.
