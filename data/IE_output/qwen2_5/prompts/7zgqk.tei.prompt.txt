You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Background
The framework of predictive processing conceptualizes perception as an inferential process combining priors with sensory information 
(1)
. Priors represent probabilistic predictions about the causes of sensory information that are derived from the brain's internal model of the world 
(2)
. Priors for perceptual inference may reflect long-term learning about regularities in the sensory environment (3) but may also be based on information from the more recent past. For instance, short-term priors may emerge from the recent perceptual history, as suggested by a large body of evidence showing serial dependencies in perceptual decision-making tasks 
(4,
5)
.
While such serial dependencies are typically formed implicitly, that is, in the absence of subjective awareness or control by the observer, short-term perceptual priors can also be induced by providing explicit information about upcoming sensory stimuli.
Changes in the brain's inference mechanisms have been proposed to play a key role in pathological mental states. For example, Bayesian accounts of psychosis suggest that psychotic symptoms may originate from a reduced weighting of perceptual priors relative to sensory information 
(6,
7)
. Importantly, and in line with the continuity view of psychosis 
(8,
9)
, the weighting of perceptual priors may not only be altered in individuals living with psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia) but may also vary as a function of psychosis proneness in the general population. Indeed, previous work investigating serial dependencies in perceptual decision-making showed a reduced influence of previous on current perceptual choices, a phenomenon often referred to as choice history bias, in psychosis-prone healthy individuals 
(10)
. The same pattern has also been observed in domains other than perception. For example, in working memory tasks, patients with psychotic disorders exhibit diminished serial dependencies 
(11,
12)
. The available evidence thus points to a reduced weighting of implicit short-term perceptual priors in psychotic and psychosis-prone individuals.
In contrast, the role of explicit perceptual priors in psychosis is less clear.
Hierarchical predictive processing accounts of psychosis have suggested differential roles for implicit and explicit priors, which are thought to be implemented at low and high hierarchical levels, respectively 
(6,
13,
14)
. In contrast to a reduced weighting of low-level, implicit priors in psychosis, evidence points to an increased weighting of high-level, explicit priors, potentially as a compensatory mechanism 
(15)
. This latter assertion, however, may only hold for long-term beliefs regarding stable characteristics of the sensory environment, but not for perceptual priors induced in the short term, e.g., by cues that provide explicit information about an upcoming sensory stimulus. While such explicit short-term priors induced by probabilistic cues were indeed previously found to have a reduced effect on perceptual decisions in a visual task in psychosis-prone individuals 
(16)
, a more recent study investigating both visual and auditory perceptual decision-making remained inconclusive regarding the relationship between psychosis proneness and cue-induced perceptual priors 
(10)
.
The question thus arises whether psychosis is generally characterized by a reduced weighting of any form of short-term perceptual priors, irrespective of whether they are implicit or explicit in nature. To address this outstanding issue, we performed two online behavioral experiments that aimed to replicate previous findings indicating a reduced influence of implicit short-term perceptual priors in perceptual decision-making in psychosisprone individuals and test whether this effect generalizes to explicit short-term perceptual priors as well ( 
Figure 1
). Our participants performed variants of an auditory two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) discrimination task. In experiment 1, the weighting of implicit short-term perceptual priors in auditory discrimination behavior was assessed by estimating the influence of the previous choice on the current choice ( 
Figure 1A)
. In experiment 2, participants performed the same task but were additionally presented with probabilistic cues indicating the correct choice at the onset of each trial, to induce explicit short-term perceptual priors ( 
Figure 1B
). Thus, in experiment 2, we were able to simultaneously investigate the weighting of both implicit and explicit priors in auditory perceptual inference. In the light of recent evidence for changes between different states of perceptual inference over time and their potential role in psychosis (17-21), we additionally explored temporal fluctuations in perceptual decision-making strategies and their association with psychosis proneness.


Results
Data from 99 and 98 participants were included in the final analyses of experiments 1 and 2, respectively. The participant characteristics are presented in 
Table 1
. In both experiments, participants performed an auditory 2AFC discrimination task in which they were presented with short, irregular click trains via stereo headphones and had to indicate on which ear they perceived a higher number of clicks. The difference in the number of clicks between left and right ear was varied from trial to trial to modulate discriminability and thus task difficulty. In addition, the repetition probability of trials with left-and right-dominance varied in a blockwise fashion between 0.5 (neutral blocks, N) and 0.8 (repetitive blocks, R). Experiment 2 was identical to experiment 1, with the exception that each stimulus was preceded by a probabilistic cue indicating the target ear (i.e., the ear to which the higher number of clicks was presented) with 75% validity. Mean performance in experiment 2 was higher than in experiment 1 (W=3807.5, p=.009), likely due to the presentation of the probabilistic cues in experiment 2. 


Choice history bias is modulated by psychosis proneness only in the absence of cues
Overall, there was an attractive choice history bias in both experiments, that is, perceptual choices were biased towards the choices in preceding trials. This is illustrated by the psychometric fits showing that the in curves of trials in which the previous choice was "left", the probability to choose "left" again was higher 
(Figure 2A
 and B). To corroborate the finding of an attractive choice history bias statistically, we computed mixed logistic regression models estimating the effects of various predictors on the perceptual choice in each trial ("left" or "right") per experiment. 


Psychosis proneness modulates the weighting of the cue
In experiment 2, perceptual choices were strongly influenced by the preceding probabilistic cuet (β=0.486, p<.001). In addition, the logistic regression model yielded a significant negative cuet -by-psychosis proneness interaction (β=-0.117, p<.001),
indicating a reduced weighting of the cue in individuals with high psychosis proneness ( 
Figure 2D
). 


Stimulus weighting is influenced by psychosis proneness
Given the evidence for a reduced weighting of prior information in psychosis proneness (choice history in experiment 1, cue in experiment 2), we asked whether perceptual choices in individuals with high psychosis proneness were instead more strongly driven by the available stimulus evidence. Indeed, the 3-way interaction between stimulust, discriminabilityt, and psychosis proneness was significant in both experiments (experiment 1 β=0.077, p<.001, experiment 2 β=0.116, p<.001, 
Figure    2C
 and D). In line with this result, performance correlated positively with psychosis proneness, indicating better performance in individuals with higher psychosis proneness in both experiments (experiment 1 rs=.378, p<.001, experiment 2 rs=.254, p=.012).  We assigned the states resulting from the two-state HMMs to the external and internal state based on the difference between the weights for current stimulus st and previous choice yt-1, respectively ( 
Figure 3A
 and B).


Relationship between psychosis proneness and dynamics over time
The overall prevalence of the external state was higher than the prevalence of the internal state in both experiments (experiment 1: V=3141.5, p=.02, experiment 2:
V=3069.5, p=.023). As expected, choice behavior followed the stimulus evidence more closely in the external state, demonstrated by a higher weight for stimulus st in external compared to internal state (experiment 1: V=4518, p<.001, experiment 2:
V=4611, p<.001). This effect was illustrated by steeper psychometric curves ( 
Figure    3C
 and D). Accordingly, the performance was better in the external state (experiment 1: V=4572, p<.001; experiment 2: V=3872, p<.001). The previous choice yt-1 weights demonstrating the choice history bias were increased in the internal state compared to the external state (experiment 1: V=1180, p<.001, experiment 2: V=1607, p=.004).
This stronger attractive choice history bias was also illustrated by the larger offset between the psychometric curves in the internal state ( 
Figure 3C
 and D).
In both experiments and both states, the stimulus st weight correlated positively with psychosis proneness. In experiment 1, the previous choice yt-1 weight in the internal state correlated negatively with psychosis proneness ( 
Table 2
). The proportion of time spent in the external state was not related to psychosis proneness.
However, in experiment 1, the number of state changes and the mean duration of internal state periods were negatively related to psychosis proneness 
(Table 2)
. 


Discussion
We is gradually contradicted by subsequently presented evidence 
(29,
30)
. In contrast to the belief manipulations used in these studies, the probabilistic cue shown before the stimulus in our experiment 2 did not induce a stable belief but rather provided shortlived probabilistic information, the relevance of which was limited to a single stimulus presentation. Our findings thus suggest that psychosis proneness is associated with a reduced weighting of short-term perceptual priors that are generated ad hoc based on information that is available within the current task context, irrespective of whether these priors are implicit or explicit.
Our results on increased weighting of sensory information in psychosis proneness align with previous evidence in the literature 
(7,
31,
32)
. For instance,
Weilnhammer and colleagues 
(7)
 found increased sensitivity to disambiguating sensory information in individuals with paranoid schizophrenia presented with graded ambiguous visual stimuli. Similarly, Goodwin et al. 
(32)
 used a perceptual decisionmaking task in combination with Bayesian modeling and found that psychosis proneness was associated with an overweighting of sensory information relative to prior expectations. However, there are also conflicting results indicating reduced sensory precision in schizophrenia 
(33)
, which recently has been linked to aberrant prediction-error signaling due to cortical hyper-excitability 
(34)
. In a delayed tonematching task, patients with schizophrenia had increased thresholds compared to controls. This effect was not explained by auditory distractibility supporting the idea of cortex-level dysfunction 
(35)
. However, in the hierarchical framework of predictive processing, our results align with the postulated increased sensory and reduced prior weighting at sensory processing stages 
(15)
.
The exploratory analysis of temporal fluctuations did not show that the increased weighting of sensory information is related to a state shift, i.e., we found no increased external state prevalence in individuals with high psychosis proneness.
One explanation could be that the difference between external and internal states under our experimental conditions may be relatively subtle, as even during states that were assigned to internal state the current choice was still strongly influenced by the external stimulus information. In contrast, previous studies using graded ambiguous stimuli observed more pronounced differences between internal and external states 
(18,
21)
. It seems therefore likely that the degree to which perceptual inference fluctuates between external and internal states may differ between perceptual uncertainty and perceptual ambiguity. Notably, in experiment 1 without cue, we found greater state stability (fewer state transitions) and reduced mean duration of the internal state in individuals with increased psychosis proneness.
However, these findings are preliminary and await replication by future studies. 


Conclusion


Experiments
The online experiments were auditory 2AFC discrimination tasks and had a duration of 45 min approximately. The experiments were created using lab.js 
(36)
 and
presented via sosci survey on a secure university server (https://sosci.scicore.unibas.ch/).


Stimuli and task structure
The task design was adopted from experiment 1 in Eckert and colleagues 
(10)
. In both experiments of the present study, two different trains of click sounds were presented simultaneously to the two ears via headphones. Irregularly spaced click sequences with a duration of 2500ms were generated in Python. The cumulative number of clicks across both ears was 50 as opposed to 40 in the previous study 
(10)
, to increase task difficulty (task performance was at 80.1% correct trials in this previous study). Clicks were spaced in a way that they did not overlap. There were six levels of discriminability, determined by the difference in the number of clicks between the left and right ear channels, ranging from 24 vs. 26
clicks (lowest discriminability level) to 19 vs. 31 clicks (highest discriminability level).
The different discriminability levels were randomly and equally distributed across trials within each block of the experiment.
In experiment 1, each auditory stimulus presentation was preceded by a short pause with a jittered duration of 2250±1000ms ( 
Figure 1A)
. In experiment 2, a probabilistic cue that indicated the target ear of the subsequent auditory stimulus (i.e. the ear to which more clicks were presented) with an accuracy of 75% was presented within this pause ( 
Figure 1B)
. These cues were either visual or auditory ( 
Figure 1B)
 and were presented for 750ms. The visual cue showed a headset with the respective side marked in red and an arrow pointing to it. The auditory cue was a voice that said "left" or "right" to indicate the respective side. Before and after the cue presentation, a short pause was presented for 750±500ms (jittered) each. Eckert et al. 
(10)
 used a gamified experiment including a cover study and to use the cue information some transfer was required. As it was suggested that this transfer might interfere with the expected effects, the current experiment was not gamified and the presented cue was more direct.
Immediately after the end of the presentation of the auditory stimuli, participants were instructed to indicate via mouse click the ear to which more click sounds were presented within 2000ms 
(Figure 1)
. A response screen was displayed after the stimulus presentation on which two boxes were arranged on a vertical and central axis. The position of each of the boxes ("left" or "right") was orthogonalized trial-wise to preclude motor confounds. If no response was given within 2000ms, the experiment continued.
In total, the experiments consisted of 384 trials each, split into eight blocks à 48 trials. There were two types of blocks. In neutral blocks (N) the repetition probability of the target ear, namely the ear to which more clicks were presented, was 50%. In repetitive blocks (R), the repetition probability of the target ear was 80%.
Block sequences (NRRNRNNR or RNNRNRRN) were counterbalanced across participants. Participants were not aware of this block structure.
Before the start of the experiment, participants were asked to adjust the volume of their headphones. To start, they were instructed to set the sound volume to 25% of the max volume and increase the volume until it was comfortable and clearly discernible while a test tone was played. Afterwards, participants performed a headphone check 
(37)
. Sequences of three tones were presented and participants were asked to identify the tone with the lowest volume. These tones were inaudible through the computer's loudspeakers or in noisy environments. Participants were excluded from proceeding to the experimental part of the study when they failed two out of six trials. This ensured that only those with functioning headphones in a quiet setting participated. The correct headphone position was verified by playing tones to one ear and asking participants to indicate the side. Afterward, the experiment was explained and a short training period started including 10 easy trials.
Throughout the experiment, attention checks were implemented. A voice instructed the participants to press a specific button (e.g. 'press k', 'press q') on the keyboard. Participants had to pass 20 out of 24 checks distributed over the eight blocks or were otherwise excluded from any analysis. Upon completing the experimental task, participants received performance feedback and in experiment 1, they were also debriefed on the cue validity.


Questionnaires
Psychosis proneness was assessed using the Peters Delusion Inventory (PDI) 
(38)
 and the Cardiff Anomalous Perception Scale (CAPS) (39) after completing the experiment. We calculated a weighted sum score of both scales to generate a global psychosis proneness score. Higher scores indicate higher psychosis proneness.


Data analysis
We excluded participants from the analysis if their performance was below 60% correct choices. This cut-off was selected in line with a previous study 
(10)
 to ensure that only data from participants who were sufficiently engaged in performing the task were included. All analyses were conducted in R (version 4. We scaled all predictors to be able to compare the estimates between predictors. For all analyses, the first trial in each block and trials without choices were removed from the data set. The lme4 (43) package was used to fit the model; optimization by quadratic approximation was applied (BOBYQA) with 100,000
iterations. Standardized residuals were created and interpreted using the DHARMa package 
(44)
. We computed the explained variance for both models 
(45)
 and VIF 
(46)
 to test for multicollinearity of predictors. As additional analysis, spearman rank correlations between psychosis proneness and performance (% of correct choices)
were computed.


Exploratory analysis of temporal fluctuations
An exploratory analysis was conducted using hidden Markov models (HMM)
as implemented in the SSM Python library 
(47)
. HMM enable the identification of a defined number of latent states, which in our study represented the decision-making strategies. We adopted a restrictive approach, limiting the model to a maximum of two states, as previously applied by Weilnhammer et al. 
(20,
21)
. The GLMs predicted the current choice yt from the input vector xt containing the weighted stimulus st, previous choice yt-1, and, in experiment 2, also the cue ct, based on the weights wk.
Initially, a one-state model at the group level was fitted (hyperparameter: transition α=1, prior σ 2 =10) using 100 iterations. The mean observation parameters were stored to initialize a group-level two-state model. The GLM-HMM predicted the latent state zt for each trial, with alternations between states governed by a 2 x 2 transition matrix, which specified the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another at each trial. The weights of independent GLMs define each state zt.
( = 1 | , ) = 1 1 + −x * w * = * , + −1 * ℎ, (+ * , )
The one and two-state models were compared using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Next, the observation parameters of the two-state group-level model were used to initialize individual two-state models. For each participant, 10 iterations were conducted and the one with the maximum likelihood was selected. We extracted the posterior weights for stimulus βs, previous choice βh, and in experiment 2 for cue βc and the dynamic posterior probabilities per state for further analysis in R.
The assignment of the states was defined based on the difference of the predictor weights (st weight -yt-1 weight) per state. States with a larger difference were assigned to the external state. Trials were categorized as external state if the external posterior probabilities were >0.5, otherwise internal. The predictor weights, performance, and prevalence were compared between both states using paired nonparametric Wilcoxon tests. Psychometric curves were computed across participants per state and split for previous choices ("left" or "right") to visualize the effects 
(40)
.
The relationships between psychosis proneness on the one hand and posterior weights, proportion of the states, individual number of state changes, and mean duration of states on the other were tested using non-parametric spearman correlations. Due to the exploratory nature of these analyses, no corrections for multiple testing were applied.

To investigate fluctuations of decision-making strategies over time, an exploratory analysis was conducted using hidden Markov models (HMM). HMMs enable the identification of a defined number of latent states in time-series data. We defined general linear models (GLM) that predicted the current choice from the stimulus weighted by the available stimulus evidence (st), previous choice (yt-1), and, in experiment 2, additionally the cue (ct). Based on previous work (20-22), we compared a one-state vs. a two-state HMM using Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The two-state HMM showed superior model evidence in both experiments (experiment 1: BIC one-state HMM 40065.9, two-state HMM 39398.59, experiment 2:BIC one-state HMM 37172.89, two-state HMM 35997.81). Previous work has suggested that perceptual inference fluctuates between external and internal states, in which perceptual choices are more strongly driven by the current stimulus evidence and previous perceptual choices, respectively

investigated how psychosis proneness modulates the weighting of implicit and explicit short-term priors in perceptual decision-making under uncertainty in healthy individuals. Implicit perceptual priors were assessed by quantifying the influence of preceding on current perceptual choices, while explicit perceptual priors were induced by probabilistic cues. We found a significant positive effect of preceding choices and a negative modulation of this choice history bias with psychosis proneness, but only in the absence of probabilistic cues. In their presence, we found significant effects of both choice history and probabilistic cues on participants' perceptual choices, but only the latter correlated negatively with psychosis proneness. Additionally, psychosis-prone individuals showed a stronger weighting of sensory information with higher levels of psychosis proneness. In the exploratory temporal dynamics analysis using HMMs, we found no conclusive evidence for a modulation of fluctuations between external and internal decisionmaking states by psychosis proneness.Thus, replicating earlier work (10), choice history biases were reduced with increasing psychosis proneness, suggestive of weakened weighting of implicit perceptual priors in psychosis-prone individuals. This observation is consistent with predictive processing accounts of psychosis
(6,
23)
. Importantly, however, we show that this effect depends on experimental context, as it was only observed in the absence of probabilistic cues (experiment 1). This is in contrast to the previous study by Eckert and colleagues
(10)
, which found a modulation of previous choice weighting by psychosis proneness even when probabilistic cues were presented. This discrepancy may be due to differences regarding the way the probabilistic cues were presented in the two studies. Eckert et al. used a gamified task including a cover story. Due to this gamification, some transfer was required to integrate the information provided by the presented cue. The cue in our second experiment was more direct in this regard (i.e., clear auditory or visual information toward the target side) and produced a stronger positive effect on the choice behavior. This strong cue effect may have overshadowed a psychosis proneness modulation of the choice history bias in experiment 2.Previous experimental work has pointed to either increased or decreased weighting of priors relative to the sensory evidence ('strong priors' vs. 'weak priors') in psychotic or psychosis-prone individuals (for a recent review, see
(15)
). As a potential explanation for these contradictory findings, hierarchical predictiveprocessing models have been suggested, in which a reduced weighting of implicit priors implemented at low hierarchical levels might be compensated by an enhanced weighting of more explicit priors implemented at higher levels of the hierarchy
(6,
13,
15)
. Our current finding of a negative modulation of the cue effect by psychosis proneness contradicts the idea that the critical distinction in this regard is between implicit and explicit priors. Instead, our results indicate that psychosis proneness is associated with a reduced weighting of both implicit and explicit perceptual priors if they are generated ad hoc based on information that is available in the short term. In contrast, previous work that has pointed to an overweighting of high-level, explicit priors in relation to psychosis proneness relied on the experimental induction of abstract and potentially more stable beliefs. For example, earlier work by Schmack et al.
(24,
25)
 used a cover story in combination with a learning condition to induce the belief that special goggles worn by the participants would alter the appearance of an ambiguous visual stimulus
(26)
. The results showed that this belief had stronger perceptual and/or neural effects in psychosis-prone individuals and those diagnosed with schizophrenia compared to healthy individuals
(24,
25)
. Similarly, explicit beliefs induced by instructed fear learning and evaluative conditioning had stronger and more stable effects on the perception of face stimuli in high compared to low psychosis-prone healthy individuals
(27,
28)
. Finally, it is well established that psychosis-prone and psychotic individuals show a pronounced bias against disconfirmatory evidence in experimental scenarios in which an initially induced belief


Taken together, our findings support predictive processing models of psychosis by demonstrating that individuals with increased psychosis proneness rely less on both implicit and explicit short-term priors and more on sensory information during auditory discrimination. This pattern of results suggests a shift of perceptual inference away from perceptual priors and towards sensory information in psychosisprone individuals, which might contribute to the formation of delusional ideas and other psychotic experiences. Future research should aim to further elucidate these perceptual changes in relation to clinically manifest psychosis, which may lead to the development of mechanism-based markers for the prediction and treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders.MethodsSampleParticipants were recruited via a local online platform (https://markt.unibas.ch/) and a study platform for psychology students at the University of Basel. Participants were required to be at least 18 years old and to have no hearing impairments. Apart from needing a quiet place and a computer with headphones, no additional inclusion or exclusion criteria were specified. In total, 105 participants completed experiment 1 and 123 participants experiment 2. From the total samples, 24 participants from experiment 1 and seven participants from experiment 2 were excluded from data analysis due to low performance (<60%). Participants gave informed consent prior to data acquisition and received CHF 15.00 or course credit for compensation after completing the study. In total, the completion of the study took approximately 60 min.


4.2) and RStudio. To visualize the stimulus and previous choice effects, psychometric functions were computed using the quickpsy package
(40)
. Quickpsy fits psychometric functions by direct maximization of the likelihood using a cumulative normal function
(41,
42)
. Curves were fitted for each block type (neutral, repetitive), across participants and separated for previous choices ("left" or "right"). The stimulus evidence was scaled resulting in 12 levels; large positive values indicate strong evidence for the left side.For the main analysis, we used a mixed logistic regression model with the choice in the current trial (0=right, 1=left) as the dependent variable. Predictors were the current and previous stimulus (0=right, 1=left), discriminability of the current and previous trial (∆clicks, 6 levels), previous choice (0=right, 1=left), block type (0=repetitive, 1=neutral blocks), psychosis proneness (continuous variable), and in experiment also the current cue (0=right, 1=left). The interaction of stimulus and discriminability was included to estimate the influence of the stimulus in dependence of the discriminability. Furthermore, interactions with psychosis proneness were added to identify the modulatory effect of psychosis proneness on the weighting of the predictors. A random intercept including the blocks and subjects was included in
