You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
In today's world, we are increasingly flooded with ever more choices, from what to cook for dinner to which career to pursue. Globalization and the internet have given us access to an ever-increasing array of options to choose from, creating vast decision spaces. Regardless of our expertise or experience, there will always be many unexplored choice options left. Importantly, individuals differ in how to go -or not go -about exploring these options. Autism 1 , in particular, has been related to an intolerance of uncertainty 
(Vasa et al., 2018)
, and reduced flexibility 
(Geurts et al., 2009)
. However, to our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the relation between autism diagnosis or autism traits and exploration in vast decision spaces.
Reinforcement learning provides a framework to understand decision-making as a process of optimizing outcomes from different choice options 
(Sutton & Barto, 2018
). An agent's goal is to identify which choices will lead to the highest rewards. To do this, they must balance exploitation -selecting the option that will yield the highest reward -with exploration -trying uncertain options in the hope of finding even higher rewards or learn more about the environment 
(Cogliati Dezza et al., 2017;
Dubois et al., 2021;
Steyvers et al., 2009;
Wilson et al., 2014;
C. M. Wu et al., 2018)
. Both strategies are necessary for adaptive decision-making 
(Cohen et al., 2007;
Gershman, 2018)
. However, in vast decision spaces, such as choosing what to eat or which TV show to watch, the number of options is too large to fully explore. Therefore, these situations require informed generalization and strategic exploration. Vast decision spaces offer a multitude of ways to explore, which not only allows us to study if and when people explore, but also where they explore, how they generalize, and what guides them in their exploration (C. M. .
Previous studies have investigated how individuals with autism approach decision-making tasks, but only in small decision spaces and with mixed findings. Some evidence suggests that people with autism show less flexible decision-making, especially in variable environments 
(Crawley et al., 2020;
Goris et al., 2021;
Luke et al., 2012)
. Others show evidence for an increased tendency towards exploitation of familiar choice options, together with a decrease in risk-taking or exploration 
(Farmer et al., 2017;
South et al., 2014
). Yet other studies suggest the opposite trend, i.e. more exploration in autism 
(Rogge, 2022;
Yechiam et al., 2010)
 and in individuals with elevated autism traits 
(Poli et al., 2024)
. However, all these studies used designs where participants could only choose between a maximum of three choice options. In contrast, real-life choices usually occur in larger decision spaces 
(Rasanan et al., 2024)
, raising questions about the generalizability of these findings.
Larger decision spaces not only mirror real-life scenarios more accurately but also allow for the study of generalization, as they enable learning relationships between rewards of different choice options.
It is well-documented that individuals with autism have difficulty generalizing newly learned skills (e.g. social skills 
(Carruthers et al., 2020)
) and stimuli 
(Froehlich et al., 2012)
 across contexts. These difficulties can be explained in terms of weak central coherence theory 
(Frith, 1989)
, which states that people with autism show a less global, more local focus when processing information 
(Van der Hallen et al., 2015)
. In line with studies showing reduced generalization during learning 
(Church et al., 2015;
Klorfeld-Auslender et al., 2022)
 and less flexible modulation of local predictions 
(Goris et al., 2018)
, we hypothesized that people with autism or more autism traits would also exhibit less generalization when learning about many different choice options.
Another limitation of previous studies on learning in autism is that they investigated either the role of autism traits or autism diagnosis, but rarely both simultaneously (but see, e.g., 
Van de Cruys et al., 2018)
.
It can be convenient to study autism through the measurement of autism traits in the general population 
(Clutterbuck et al., 2022;
Goris et al., 2021;
Poli et al., 2024)
. However, elevated autism traits may still critically differ from autism as a diagnosis, as the latter also requires that these elevated traits lead to an experience of impairment that is not present in the general population 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013)
. Generally, the extent to which documented relations with elevated autism traits in the general population replicate in autism populations remains an important topic of debate 
(Abu-Akel et al., 2019;
Barbeau et al., 2009;
Sasson & Bottema-Beutel, 2022;
Sucksmith et al., 2011)
.
Here, we studied differences in generalization and exploration in vast decision spaces between adults with autism (n=77) and adults without autism (n=473), as well as within the group of adults without autism (n=509) to study the correlation with autism traits, which were measured using well-validated selfassessment questionnaires. In our truffle task (a gamified version of the task first introduced by C. M. , participants could accumulate rewards by taking on the role of a truffle farmer, where they had to select locations on a square grid to send their truffle pig to dig for truffles (see 
Figure 1b)
. Each location yielded a specific number of truffles, and participants' goal was to accumulate as many truffles as possible. More precisely, the grid was a spatially correlated multi-armed bandit 
(Schulz et al., 2018;
C. M. Wu et al., 2018)
, where each location is an arm of the bandit, with a mean reward belonging to it. Due to the spatial correlations between the choice options, nearby locations yielded similar rewards. This allowed for generalization based on previously observed rewards. 
Figure 1c
 shows exemplary reward structures.
We measured exploration behavior using various behavioral metrics, and by leveraging a computational model to dissociate generalization strategies, uncertainty-guided exploration, and random exploration.
Our preregistered hypotheses were that people diagnosed with autism or people with more autism traits would sample more locally, show less uncertainty-guided exploration and less generalization (see OSF


Registries | The Relation between Uncertainty-Guided Exploration in Decision Making, Autism and Other
Traits for preregistration). Screenshot of a trial procedure of the truffle task, where participants had to click on cells to dig for truffles.
Participants could freely choose between 121 cells, placed on an 11 by 11 grid. On each trial, participants clicked a cell of the grid with their mouse (pointer replaced by a truffle pig when hovering above the grid). After clicking, the reward (number of truffles) was revealed by displaying a number and a corresponding color value inside the chosen cell. Darker red corresponds to higher rewards. On every round (i.e., different area of a forest), participants could sample (i.e., "dig") 25 times. c) Examples of fully revealed grids. d) Novel clicks are clicks where the participant selects a cell that has not been opened yet in the current round. e) High-value clicks are clicks where the participant selects a cell that has been opened in that round, and that has a reward that is at least 90% of the highest observed reward.
For this trial, the highest observed reward is 54, so all cells higher than 48.6 (= 90% of 54) are high-value cells. All high-value cells have a green border for this illustration. f) The distance between consecutive clicks is the Manhattan distance between the current and previous (here illustrated as the cell with a yellow border) click.

Results
People with an autism diagnosis or elevated autism traits do not respond less optimally
We first evaluated whether autism or autism traits showed a relation to the main goal of this task: accumulating rewards. The average reward of all participants was 56.7 ± 4.9. The control group's average reward, 56.5 ± 5.0, did not differ from the autism group, with an average of 57.5 ± 4.5, t(109.46) = -1.72, p = .09, d = -0.96, 95% CI (-2.06, 0.15). Moreover, self-reported autism traits did not correlate with average reward, r(507) = -.01, p = .799, ρ = -.02, p = .658. In sum, autism or autism traits did not affect how well participants performed on our task.
To evaluate whether meaningful variations in task performance could be established, we also evaluated the relation with broader cognitive abilities, as measured with the International Cognitive Ability Resource 
(ICAR, Condon & Revelle, 2014)
. Interestingly, people's scores on the ICAR did correlate with reward rate, r(583) = .37, p < .001, ρ = .36, p < .001. Previous studies (e.g., 
Giron et al., 2022)
 found that participants sample closer after observing higher rewards. We hypothesized that participants with higher ICAR scores would show this adaptive index of decision making more pronouncedly. Indeed, the strength of this relationship between previous reward magnitude and sampling distance was increased in people with higher ICAR scores, b = -0.10 ± 0.02, t = -4.41, p < .001 (see 
Table A
.1). Importantly, however, ICAR was not a critical predictor of autism, b = 0.27 ± 0.20, z = 1.37, p = .171, or autism traits, b = 0.02 ± 0.04, z = 0.54, p = .588 (see Tables A.2 and A.3).


People with autism explored fewer novel locations and exploited more known locations
Next, we investigated exploration behavior across various behavioral measures. We preregistered that people with an autism diagnosis or elevated autism traits would sample more locally, and explore less, but did not specify which behavioral measure we would use to assess this. Therefore, we tested this hypothesis using four different behavioral measures. Although we report the results without a correction for multiple comparisons, the same statistical conclusions were reached after correction for multiple comparisons. First, we evaluated the number of novel clicks each participant made, which occur when a cell is clicked of which no reward has been revealed yet (see 
Figure 1d)
. We observed that people with autism used fewer novel clicks, b = -0.41 ± 0.14, z = -2.89, p = .004, indicating that they explored less than people without autism (see 
Table B
.1). The number of novel clicks gradually declines within a round (see 
Figure 1h
). Generally, participants engage in more exploration at the beginning of a round. Consistently, many studies have observed that exploration decreases with a decreasing number of choices left (e.g., 
Wilson et al., 2014;
C. M. Wu et al., 2018)
. In our task, this decrease in exploration (novel clicks) was also modulated by group (autism versus control). Specifically, people in the autism group showed progressively fewer novel clicks over time (within a round), relative to the control group, b = -0.23 ± 0.07, t = -3.24, p = .001 (see 
Figure 2a
). This suggests that people with autism were faster to turn from exploration (more novel clicks) to exploitation (fewer novel clicks) than people in the control group. When evaluating this effect in the control group, we did not see a decrease of novel clicks for elevated autism traits, b = 0.02 ± 0.11, z = 0.17, p = .867, or a steeper decrease of novel clicks over time (within a round), b = -0.08 ± 0.06, z = -1.26, p = .207 (see 
Table B
.2). This suggests that elevated autism traits in undiagnosed people were unrelated to selecting more or less novel options longer throughout a round (see 
Figure 2b)
.
Importantly, for all our analyses, we controlled for other subclinical traits known to covary with autism or autism traits (depression, ADHD, and alexithymia), as they also did in our dataset (see 
Table A
.2 and A.3). While we preregistered to do this, some have argued that including these covariates can complicate the interpretation by controlling for traits that are intrinsic to autism 
(Miller & Chapman, 2001)
, and most previous studies on the relation between autism traits and reinforcement learning similarly did not control for these other traits (e.g., 
Goris et al., 2021;
Poli et al., 2024)
. Therefore, we also evaluated the effect of autism traits without controlling for other subclinical trait variables. However, if anything, this analysis showed evidence for more, not less, novel clicks with elevated autism traits, b = 0.17 ± 0.08, z = 2.07, p = .038. Typically, participants used more novel clicks as a round progressed, and this trend was affected by the group (c) but not the autism traits (d) of participants. Here, the slopes represent model estimates of the interaction effects between trial and autism traits or groups, the bands represent the 95% confidence intervals.
As an inverse measure of exploration (i.e., exploitation) we also studied the number of high-value clicks. We define a high-value cell as an already revealed cell for which the observed reward is either the highest or less than 10% smaller than the highest out of all observations (see 
Figure 1e
). People with autism sampled more high value clicks, b = 0.48 ± 0.16, z = 3.00, p = .003, indicating that they engaged more in exploitation than people without autism (see 
Table B
.3). As expected, the number of high-value clicks increased within a round (see 
Figure 1i
). Interestingly, this increase was again related to autism diagnosis, but not autism traits. We saw a steeper increase in selecting high-value cells for participants with autism, b = 0.27 ± 0.08, t = 3.48, p < .001, further indicating that people with autism switch faster from exploration to exploitation in comparison to undiagnosed participants (see 
Figure 2c
). In contrast, participants in the control group with more autism traits did not show more or a faster increase of highvalue clicks, b = -0.01 ± 0.12, z = -0.01, p = .999 and b = 0.08 ± 0.07, t = 1.20, p = .231 (see 
Figure 2d
 and 
Table B
.4). Interestingly, we rather see fewer high-value clicks for elevated autism traits, when we do not control for other subclinical trait variables, b = -0.17 ± 0.09, z = -1.84, p = .066, again hinting at less exploitation (and more exploration) for more autism traits in non-diagnosed people.
People with autism sample more locally
In our task (i.e., spatially correlated multi-armed bandit), the cells' rewards were correlated, with stronger correlations between nearer cells (see Methods for further explanation). Concretely, an observed reward is not only informative for the cell it belongs to but also for the neighboring cells. As a result, clicking close to a high-value observation is a less explorative choice than clicking further away. To pick up on this aspect of our task, we further defined exploration as clicking far from a high-value cell. If we operationalize the level of exploration as the smallest distance from a high-value cell (see 
Figure 1g
), exploration is no longer a binary measurement. We believe this measure provides a more direct (inverse) index of how locally participants sampled, which we expected people with an autism diagnosis or more autism traits to do more. Generally, we observed that this distance decreased within a round, again showing that participants explored more at the beginning of a round by sampling further away (see 
Figure   1k
). Similar to the other behavioral measurements discussed before, we observed that this slope depended on the group participants were in. To better fit the behavioral data, which visually resembles a power law, we modeled linear slopes on the logarithm of both the trial number and the distance.
Indeed, participants with autism sampled closer to high value cells, b = -0.03 ± 0.01, t = -3.40, p = .001 (see 
Table B
.5). The slope was also steeper for the autism group, b = -0.02 ± 0.01, t = -3.48, p < .001, in comparison to the control group, suggesting they stopped exploring sooner relative to control participants (see 
Figure 3a)
. We again saw no such effect in non-diagnosed people with elevated autism traits, p > .602 (see 
Table B
.6). These effects were also true when defining exploration as sampling further away from the previous click (see 
Figure 1f
). Also there, we noticed smaller distances, b = -0.29 ± 0.08, t = -3.50, p = < .001, and steeper decreases in distance within a round for the autism group than the control group, b = -0.14 ± 0.04, t = -3.21, p = .001 (see 
Table B
.7), while not seeing smaller distances or steeper decreases for elevated autism traits, p > .671 (see 
Table B
.8). If anything, we see hints of an inverse effect when we do not control for other subclinical trait variables, where participants with elevated autism traits sampled further away from their previous click, b = 0.08 ± 0.05, t = 1.66 , p = .097. 


Autism diagnosis is associated with less uncertainty-guided exploration, but not generalization or random exploration
To understand the reasons behind these behavioral differences in exploration, we leveraged a computational model that models different potential underlying mental processes driving people to explore. The Gaussian Process -Upper Confidence Bound model (GP-UCB model, see Methods for model information) formalizes how people learn to generalize observed rewards, and can further distinguish between two types of exploration: random exploration, and uncertainty-guided exploration (C. M. . Because the cells' rewards are spatially correlated, observed rewards from one cell are informative about the rewards of neighboring cells (examples of this can be seen in 
Figure 1c
). Via visual examples presented during task instructions, participants were made aware of this correlation and were encouraged to use this to predict unexplored cells of the grid. First, the GP-UCB model estimates the strength of generalization parameter (for length scale), with stronger generalization indicating stronger and longer-ranged correlations between the cells' rewards (see also Methods for more information). In our preregistration, we hypothesized that participants with autism or with more autism traits would have more difficulties in picking up the correlations in the reward distribution, leading to lower generalization . This hypothesis aligns with the weak central coherence theory of autism 
(Frith, 1989
) because it reflects a less global focus. Second, uncertainty-guided exploration is aimed at reducing the uncertainty of the environment. The uncertainty-guided exploration parameter β measures the importance of reducing this uncertainty. Our second preregistered hypothesis about the model parameters was that participants with autism or with more autism traits would use less uncertainty-guided exploration β as a way to avoid unpredictability. Finally, random exploration τ measures undirected exploration, not informed by uncertainty or generalization strategies. Instead, it is a form of exploration where choices are selected at random, without consideration of their potential outcome. Less random exploration τ relates to more deterministic sampling. We had no hypothesis about this parameter and its relation to autism.
To disentangle the influence of generalization, uncertainty-guided exploration, and random exploration, we used a General Linear Model to study which parameter can best predict autism or autism traits. Specifically, while the dependent variable was autism diagnosis or autism traits, these three parameters were used as independent parameters to compete against each other while controlling for other individual differences (age, gender, depression, ADHD, and alexithymia). We found that only uncertainty-guided exploration β predicted autism diagnosis, b = -0.41 ± 0.16, z = -2.54, p = .011, but not random exploration τ, b = -0.21 ± 0.17, z = -1.24, p = .216, or generalization , b = -0.10 ± 0.16, z = -0.66, p = .506, with the probability of autism diagnosis decreasing with increasing β (see 
Table C
.1). These results support our hypothesis that people with autism used less uncertainty-guided exploration β, but equal levels of generalization . When repeating these analyses on autism traits, however, no significant effect of any of these three parameters was observed (all p > .585; see 
Table C
.2).
Differences between people with and without an autism diagnosis with similar numbers of autism traits
Our study allowed to systematically compare the effects of an autism diagnosis and elevated autism traits. The above results also suggest that both aspects may lead to diverging exploration strategies during decision-making and that only people with an autism diagnosis showed reduced exploration behavior.
However, people with autism also have elevated autism traits. Therefore, to further evaluate whether there was a differential effect of an autism diagnosis, we created two separate groups matched on number of autism traits (see Methods). Even for these two groups that did not differ in number of autism traits, t(95.901) = 1.01, p = .316, d = 0.14, 95% CI (-0.13, 0.40) (see 
Figure 4a
), we again observed that the group with an autism diagnosis produced fewer novel clicks, t(94.91) = -2.89, p = .005, d = -34, 95% CI(11, 58) (see 
Figure 4b)
, and more high-value clicks, t(95.153) = 2.88, p = .005, d = 35, 95% CI (11, 59) (see 
Figure   4c
), than the matched control group. Also in the modeling results, we saw that people with an autism diagnosis used less uncertainty-guided exploration β, t(95.998) = -2.65, p = .009, d = -0.46, 95% CI (-0.81, -0.12) (see 
Figure 4d
), while the level of generalization and random exploration τ did not significantly differ, respectively t(94.732) = -1.49, p = .  distributions as violin plots, and boxplots ranging from first to third quartile. Boxplots' whiskers contain all data points within 1.5 x inter-quartile range of the box' ends, and the black line through the black dot in the boxplot shows the median.


Discussion
In this study, we tested the effect of autism and autism traits on exploration during value-based decision-making in vast decision spaces. Adults with (n = 77) and without (n = 511) an autism spectrum diagnosis were asked to accumulate rewards in a spatially correlated multi-armed bandit task. Across multiple behavioral measures, we observed that people with autism explored less. Surprisingly, however, people without autism did not show less exploration with elevated autism traits. Moreover, by applying a computational model of learning and decision making to the data, we further observed that people with autism used less uncertainty-guided exploration than those without, while both groups did not differ in their degree of generalization or random exploration.
Although no previous studies looked at the relation between autism and exploration strategies in vast value-based decision-making scenarios, our findings relate to other studies in the literature. For example, in gambling tasks, people with autism have been shown to be more risk-averse than control participants 
(Gosling & Moutier, 2018;
H.-C. Wu et al., 2018)
. As exploration is typically riskier than exploitation, our group differences fit with an interpretation that people with autism refrain from exploring because of increased risk aversion 
(South and colleagues, 2014)
. H.-C. 
Wu and colleagues (2018)
 also found an increased tendency towards repetitive behavior in gambling, which is in line with our findings of increased exploitation.
Our study also allowed for a direct comparison between the effect of an autism diagnosis and the effect of elevated autism traits in a non-diagnosed sample, within the same paradigm. Interestingly, in contrast to the effects of autism diagnosis, non-diagnosed adults showed less of a difference in explorative behavior with elevated autism traits. If anything, without controlling for the covarying traits of ADHD, depression, and alexithymia, people with more autism traits showed more, rather than less, exploration.
This analysis and finding is in line with a recent study by 
Poli and colleagues (2024)
, who similarly reported that a neurotypical student population explored more at later stages of learning when autism traits were elevated. However, 
Dubois and Hauser (2022)
 also investigated decision making in small decision spaces within a general population (not controlled for autism diagnosis) and found no association between autism traits and exploration. Notably, however, our measures also differ from theirs in that we examined the effect of exploration over time (within a round).
At first sight, our results are surprising as they suggest that autism leads to less exploration while more autism traits did not (or even to more exploration). However, elevated autism traits meaningfully differ from an autism diagnosis, as a diagnosis requires that these traits lead to impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). We believe our findings may result from the autism-related above-average preference for predictability (e.g., 
Goris et al., 2020;
Stark et al., 2021
; but see 
Bervoets et al., 2021)
, and show that people's adaptive strategy to fulfil this preference could be diagnostic of developing autism spectrum disorder. In our task, the initial reward landscape is highly unpredictable, as it is hidden under unrevealed cells. Participants do not know which cell will yield the highest reward, and even after sampling, they can never be sure, as the highest reward is different each round. Due to the vastness of the decision space, there is always a large number of uncertain choice options, even at later stages of a round. There are two potential pathways to deal with these unpredictable choice options (e.g., 
Poli et al., 2024)
. A first strategy can be to steer away from these uncertain options by sticking to what is known, and thus exploit more while engaging less in uncertaintydriven exploration (uncertainty-avoiding pathway). A second strategy is the exact opposite; by trying out more uncertain cells, one can reduce the uncertainty of the environment (uncertainty-reducing pathway).
In doing so, one gains valuable knowledge about the reward landscape and ultimately also avoids the unpredictability of the grid.
Our modeling corroborates the idea that people with an autism diagnosis show more uncertainty avoidance by engaging less in uncertainty-guided exploration. We believe that this uncertainty-avoiding strategy may be a direct reaction to, and thus reflect, a preference for predictability and dislike of unpredictability. In our study, we saw this translated to more local sampling, in areas with more certainty.
Similarly, people with autism have also been found to lower the uncertainty of a current decision first, by gathering more information before committing to the decision 
(Brosnan et al., 2014;
Vella et al., 2018)
.
People without an autism diagnosis but with elevated autism traits, too, typically show a preference for predictable information (e.g., 
Goris et al., 2020)
. However, they may have developed a more adaptive uncertainty-reducing strategy to deal with this preference, and therefore actively reduced the uncertainty of the grid. To summarize, we postulate that a higher preference for predictability can help explain our behavioral and modeling findings, and how one acts on this preference in our task may be diagnostic of autism spectrum disorder. Future studies should evaluate how the strategies observed in the truffle task map onto real-world behavior and the importance of seeking professional screening and diagnosis.
Subclinical groups are often used as a 'proxy' to study autism because they are easier to recruit (e.g., 
Clutterbuck et al., 2022;
Goris et al., 2021;
Poli et al., 2024)
. However, our findings emphasize the need to consider both trait levels and their impact on daily functioning to fully understand the autism spectrum (e.g., 
Sasson & Bottema-Beutel, 2022)
, and therefore support a categorical rather than continuum structure of autism 
(Frazier et al., 2010
(Frazier et al., , 2023
Haslam et al., 2020;
James et al., 2016)
. While studies on autism traits offer valuable insights, our results caution against extrapolating findings from trait studies to autism populations.
While our study provides valuable insights into how autism or autism traits are related to different decision-making patterns, a few limitations should be noted. First, although we had no prior hypotheses about the effect of autism on average reward, we emphasize that neither autism nor autism traits lead to suboptimal value-based decision-making in our task. This could not be attributed to a general insensitivity to optimal behavior, as the obtained reward rate in our task was strongly related to individual differences in broader cognitive abilities (here measured with ICAR). However, the here-observed differences in explorative behavior seemed to reflect general strategic differences that could still lead to similar levels of reward. This sensitivity to different exploration strategies without directly punishing participants for supposed suboptimal behavior can at the same time be considered a strength of this paradigm. However, future work should explore whether these differences can also be more directly related to the real-world difficulties experienced by individuals with autism. Second, because our data was collected online, we had to rely on self-reported autism diagnoses and questionnaire scores. We took additional precautions during preprocessing and found converging evidence for their diagnosis among their online profile, self-reports in our study, and the questionnaire scores. Nonetheless, as is also the case for most lab-based studies, people with autism partaking in these online experiments may not be representative of all (highfunctioning) people with autism.
We also believe that there are two important nuances to our analysis of autism traits. First, differences in task behavior could not be attributed to any of the three model parameters. Potentially, the model may have lacked statistical sensitivity or may not be tapping into the cognitive mechanism that drives these differences in decision making. Second, the relation between autism traits and exploration behavior was never significant after controlling for three, preregistered subclinical traits (ADHD, depression, and alexithymia). When loosening this constraint on our models, we did occasionally capture significant effects of autism traits on exploration behavior, but we must remain careful in relating these to autism more directly.
In conclusion, our study highlights important differences in exploration strategies between individuals with autism and people with elevated autism traits. Our findings can be understood from a perspective that emphasizes different behavioral strategies to a shared need for more predictable environments or reduced uncertainty. While our findings suggest reduced uncertainty-guided exploration in autism, future research is needed to determine the adaptive or maladaptive nature of these strategies in various environments. Furthermore, longitudinal studies that include both clinical and subclinical populations will be essential to unravel how these preferences and strategies develop. Psychoeducation about these alternative strategies for dealing with uncertainty or unpredictability may provide a useful tool for improving well-being in individuals with autism.


Methods


Participant information
663 people took part in our experiment (111 of which were recruited by only opening the experiment to those who self-report to have been diagnosed with autism), which was part of a larger online data collection effort using Prolific, on context-sensitive cognitive flexibility in autism . We defined inconsistent autism diagnosis responders as those who, on the one hand, did (not) indicate on Prolific to have autism spectrum disorder, to be in the process of receiving a diagnosis, or to identify as being on the autism spectrum, but, on the other hand, gave a different response in our study when asked about having a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. All mentioned exclusion criteria were preregistered. Since we are interested in measures of autism traits, we additionally omitted participants without valid responses on the autism questionnaires (N=8). After exclusion, we had a total sample of 588 participants (511 undiagnosed and 77 diagnosed).


Questionnaire data; measuring autism and autism traits
Following our preregistration protocol, we evaluated autism in three different ways. First, to find people for the autism group, we only opened the experiment to those who self-reported in the user's profile on Prolific to have an autism diagnosis. Second, we used a multiple-choice question to query participant's formal mental health diagnoses. Third, we also applied two self-assessment questionnaires that measure autism traits. The first is the commonly used Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) 
(Baghdadli et al., 2017;
Baron-Cohen et al., 2001)
, where participants answered the 50 questions with 'definitely/slightly (dis)agree'. Second, we also use the Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI) 
(English et al., 2021)
, which is a novel questionnaire better equipped against undervaluing autism traits of women. The questionnaire contains 42 questions with 5 response options.
Since the AQ can be used for screening autism, with scores less than 26 indicating that an autism diagnosis can effectively be ruled out 
(Baron-Cohen et al., 2001
), we only allow participants with a formal ASD diagnosis with AQ scores ≥ 26 in the autism group. Analogously, since 80% of people with autism score 32 or higher 
(Baron-Cohen et al., 2001)
, only undiagnosed participants with scores ≤ 32 are included in the control group (see also, 
Baron-Cohen et al., 2001;
Goris et al., 2018
Goris et al., , 2022
Woodbury-Smith et al., 2005)
. Following this preregistered procedure, the between-group comparison contains 552 participants: 77 in the autism group (Mean age = 26.79 (4.94) years; 24 female, 42 male, 11 other), and 475 in the control group (Mean age = 29.27 (4.34) years; 242 female, 227 male, 8 other). To study the relationship between (the full scope of) autism traits and exploration, we include all undiagnosed participants (N = 510) independent of their AQ scores for the within-group comparison.
In this study, we also use questionnaire data on intelligence, depression, ADHD, and alexithymia.
Intelligence is measured via the International Cognitive Ability Resource (ICAR) 
(Condon & Revelle, 2014)
, for which the test contains four items in each of four subtests (verbal reasoning, letter and number series component, matrix reasoning, mental rotation). Depressive traits are assessed via the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) 
(Zung, 1965)
, ADHD traits via the Adult ADHD-Self Report Scale Symptom Checklist (A-SRS) 
(Kessler et al., 2005
(Kessler et al., , 2007
, and alexithymia traits via the Perth Alexithymia Questionnaire (PAQ) 
(Preece et al., 2018)
. To compute one measure of autism traits, we conducted a principal component analysis on the two scores of the two autism traits questionnaires (AQ and CATI) and used the first principal component. Questionnaire scores were scaled before analysis. The preregistered first principal component loads 92.5% of all information and strongly correlates with CATI, r(586) = .96, p < .001, ρ = .96, p < .001, and AQ, r(586) = .96, p < .001, ρ = .95, p < .001, and was used as our measure of autism traits for all analyses.


Behavioral task
The participants conducted the truffle task (see 
Figure 1b)
, in which they were instructed to assume the role of a truffle farmer and guide their truffle pig to the best location in a forest to dig up truffles. The goal was to accumulate as many truffles as possible, by clicking on locations (cells) in an area (grid) of the forest (shown in the background). At the bottom of the screen, participants could see on each trial the average number of truffles accumulated in this area thus far, and the number of digs (trials) and areas remaining. Participants did 10 rounds, each time in a new area, in each of which they could dig 25 times (see 
Figure 1a)
. Every area had 11 x 11 locations to choose from, making this a 121-armed bandit. At the beginning of a round, one random location was revealed. Participants could choose freely at which location to dig, including already revealed cells. After each dig, a reward was revealed and the cell's color changed corresponding to the sampled reward, with darker red indicating higher rewards (i.e., more truffles). The observed reward was drawn from a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1, giving slight variations in the observed reward of re-clicked locations. For repeat clicks, the latest reward was shown numerically, while the color of the cell corresponded to the mean of all observations for this cell.
To avoid reward observations below 0, the minimum mean reward was 5, and the maximum mean reward was between 65 and 85, randomized over rounds to avoid easy identification of global optima.
The rewards are generated by a reward distribution over all cells; specifically, they are sampled from a Gaussian process, meaning that each collection of cells has a multivariate Gaussian distribution, with the covariance matrix between the cells defined by a radial basis function kernel (see below) with l = 2. Before the experiment, 100 reward distributions were created (of which 3 are shown in 
Figure 1c)
, and each participant could explore 10 randomly selected (without replacement) distributions. The experiment included an instruction round where, among other instructions, two fully revealed reward distributions were shown as an example.
Based on the total average of collected truffles (rewards), the participants earned an additional bonus of up to £1.20. Participants who accumulated an average of = 75 truffles or more per round received this maximum; participants with an average of = 5 or less received the minimum bonus (£0).
More precisely, the bonus payment was the following function of the accumulated average reward : To identify if autism diagnosis or autism traits affect exploration, we used (General) Linear Mixedeffects Models -(G)LMMs-to study the main and interaction effects of autism (traits), while controlling for confounding factors. We use fixed effects to model consistent trends of factors such as age and autism (traits) over participants, and random effects to capture the variability between different participants. In line with our preregistration, we always used gender, age, depression (SDS), ADHD (A-SRS), and alexithymia (PAQ) as fixed effects defining the subject, and trial and round number as fixed effects that could vary within a subject. Out of all questionnaire measurements, we selectively focused on depression, ADHD, and alexithymia due to their known co-occurrence with autism (e.g. 
Mayes et al., 2012;
van Heijst et al., 2020)
 (see also preregistration). Although we preregistered to additionally control for ICAR scores (as a measure of IQ), we eventually opted to omit this term from the behavioral and modelling analysis to keep model complexity minimal, but also because including IQ-related measures as covariates in cognitive tasks is not without controversy 
(Dennis et al., 2009)
, and, perhaps most importantly, because we observed no relation between ICAR and autism group or autism traits in our sample (in contrast to all other abovementioned control variables; see also, 
Table A
 
.2 and A.3)
. Concretely, the formula used for the behavioral analyses of the number of novel and high value clicks is:
( ) =
ℎ ℎ ~ ( + + + + ) 2 + + + (1 + | ),
where the ^2 indicates that all fixed factors (between brackets) are both studied as main effects and as two-way interaction effects. The last term allows for individual (per participant) random intercepts and random slopes. The term reflects the group of the participants (binary) or the autism traits (continuous) for the between-or within-group comparison, respectively. Categorical predictors were coded using sum-to-zero contrasts and continuous predictors were scaled. For this analysis in particular, we used a binomial link function to model the binary nature of novel or high value clicks. Moreover, although we first also added the factor round to these models, we had to remove this factor from the model because it did not reach convergence. This was not a problem for our (non-binary) distance measures. For the behavioral analyses of the distance measures, we used an LME model where we additionally included the effect of round:
log ~ ( + + + + + ) 2 + + + (1 + * | ).
For the estimated model parameters, we assessed whether these predict group and trait effects via a Generalized Linear Model (GLM), where we let the three model parameters (for generalization , uncertainty-guided exploration and random exploration , all in logarithmic format for meaningful scaling) compete against each other as main effects on group or autism traits while controlling for the same individual differences as in the behavioral models:
~ ( + + ) 2 + + + + + .
Finally, to allow for model convergence, and because we had disproportionally low numbers in these categories, we added participants selecting "Other" or "Prefer not to say" to the "Female" gender (minority) group for all statistical models. Analyses where we removed these subjects or could add them as a separate group showed similar results for the effects of interest.


Identifying the underlying processes guiding exploration
We use a model of reinforcement learning to model learning, exploration, and decision-making. The GP-UCB model combines Gaussian Process (GP) regression with Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling.
It has been shown that this model can account for human value-based decision-making behavior across a variety of tasks 
(Giron et al., 2022;
Meder et al., 2021;
Schulz et al., 2019;
. We will explain the different steps of the model, for each of which an example is shown in 
Figure 5
.
Gaussian Process regression is employed for value generalization. This non-parametric Bayesian framework for function learning enables us to map the cells onto real-valued scalar outputs (representing reward expectations). To do so, the Gaussian Process employs a Bayesian inference method, starting with the definition of a prior distribution over functions, assumed to follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution:
( ( ), ( , ′ )),
with ( ) the prior mean signifying the expected output of cell , and ( , ′ ) the kernel function determining the covariance between two cells. We set the prior mean to the median reward of the truffle task, ( ) = 40. We use a radial basis function kernel ( , ′ ) to describe how observations from one cell x generalize to another cell ′ as a function of the distance between these cells || − ′ ||:
( , ′ ) = e − || − ′ || 2 .
Concretely, this kernel assures that cells with small distances have high covariances and therewith strongly correlated rewards, with an exponential decay of the similarity (i.e., correlation) for increasing distance.
The rate of this decay is parameterized via the generalization parameter , with larger values corresponding to slower decays, longer-range generalizations, stronger spatial correlations, and smoother reward landscapes. As → 0, then → 0 , and no spatial correlations remain. In that case, learning happens per cell individually, thus with no generalization. Since is a free (to be estimated) model parameter, the GP-UCB model informs us if people generalize and how strongly.
The Gaussian Process regression starts with a set of observations up to trial , = { , }, containing 1 , . . . as the noisy observed rewards of option 1 , . . . , for which each choice option 's reward ~( ( ), 2 ) is sampled from the underlying reward function ( ) with noise 2 = 1 (see 
Figure 5a)
. The Gaussian Process computes a posterior distribution for a new input * as a Gaussian with mean and variance defined as:
( * | ) = * , ( , + 2 ) −1 , ( * | ) = * , * − * , ( , + 2 ) −1 * , ,
with * , = ( ( 1 , * ), … , ( , * )) T the covariance between each observed input up to and new input * , and , = ( , ) between observed inputs.
Briefly, Gaussian Process regression generalizes observed rewards on a (partially revealed) grid by outputting normally distributed posteriors. The mean and standard deviation of the posteriors represent the expected reward ( ) and uncertainty ( ) = √ ( ), respectively (see 
Figure 5b
 and c). Using the Upper Confidence Bound, we can express the value for each cell ( ) as follows:
( ) = ( ) + ( ),
with a free model parameter that captures uncertainty-guided exploration (see 
Figure 5d
). Higher values of correspond to valuing the reduction of uncertainty more (exploration), lower values to valuing high reward more (exploitation). Intuitively, the Upper Confidence Bound can be understood as optimistically inflating the values of expectations with their uncertainty to address the explorationexploitation tradeoff.
In the localized version of the model, we assume that choice decisions are also likely to stay near the previous choice (e.g., . To account for this, we weigh the reward value ( ) of a cell by its inverse Manhattan distance from the previous choice ':
( ) = ( ) || − ′ || .
When = ′ , we set the weight to 1. Concretely, the localized value ( ) lowers the value of distant cells, accounting for a local sampling bias (see 
Figure 5e
). This non-parametric transformation is an optional step of the GP-UCB model, creating an alternative variant of the original model, which needs to be motivated through model comparison (see further).
To translate the (localized) values of the cells to choice probabilities ( ) , we use the Softmax decision rule:
( ) ~ ( ( ) ),
with , the softmax temperature, capturing random exploration (see 
Figure 5f
). Higher temperatures correspond to more noisy policies. As → 0, the policy becomes purely deterministic, and the probability of choosing the cell with maximum value approaches 1. To assess how well the model explains the data, we compute a cross-validated likelihood. Per participant, we estimate model parameters iteratively on a subset of the data (training set) by omitting a single round and using negative log-likelihood minimization. We use Sequential Least Squares
Programming as an optimization algorithm. SLSQP is primarily a gradient-based optimization method, which can also incorporate gradient-free techniques for situations where gradients are not readily accessible or too costly to compute. The optimization algorithm is given a fixed starting point ( , , ) = (2, 0.5, 0.01), which is a set of 'average' parameter values, given the literature 
(Giron et al., 2022;
Meder et al., 2021;
C. M. Wu et al., 2018
. To ensure the optimization does not converge on unrealistic parameter values, we add a bias (regularization) term to decrease the likelihood of too small/large parameter values. This bias term is distributed according to a Gaussian distribution per model parameter, with, for ( , , ) respectively, mean (10, 0.5, 0.01) and standard deviation (8, 0.2, 0.2) .
Both the starting point and the bias term distribution were chosen for optimal parameter recovery (see further). One way to think of this bias term is that it transforms likelihood into posterior optimization.
After parameter optimization on the training data, the fit for this subset is tested based on the negative log-likelihood of the out-of-sample round, given the estimated model parameters. This is repeated for all 10 rounds. After this cross-validation procedure, the median of each model parameter is reported, and the total negative log likelihood, summed over all 10 out-of-sample rounds.
We report model fits in terms of a pseudo-R 2 , which compares the out-of-sample negative loglikelihood for a model to that of a random model:
2 = 1 − ℒ( ) ℒ( )
, where the random model selects every choice option with equal likelihood. For 2 > 0, model is a better fit to the data than a random model, with higher values of 2 signifying stronger evidence for model .
We compared the fit of the original (unlocalized) model with the localized variant. The 2 value of the original model (.31) was lower than that of the localized variant (.38), signifying that the variant that accounts for local bias was better at explaining our behavioral data, consistent with earlier model comparisons on this task (C. M. . Therefore, we only report the modeling results of the winning (localized) model.
Parameter recovery was performed to ensure that each free model parameter in the localized GP-UCB model robustly captures distinct and separate processes. We generated data according to the model, with model parameters (distributions) reflecting observed parameter estimates. The parameter estimation then recovered the model parameters. The generating and recovered parameter estimates correlated with Spearman's rank correlation coefficients of .87, .64, and .95 for , and , respectively.
See also 
Figure 6
. we use generated parameters sampled from the distribution of the cross-validated participant parameter estimates.
Estimated parameters are the result of the cross-validated procedure to estimate model parameters given the data.
The black line shows a linear regression on the data and the text reports the Spearman's rank correlation and p-value.
Although all data points are used to calculate the correlations, outliers are omitted from these figures by limiting the axes to 1.5 IQR for the generated or estimated parameter estimate, depending on which yields the largest range.


Creating matching groups on autism traits
To study the differences between diagnosed and undiagnosed participants, independent of their number of autism traits, we created two groups of equal size, with similar number of autism traits. We did this by searching, iteratively for each of the autism group members, for a unique match in the control group. We defined a pair to match if their autism traits differed by less than 4% on the total autism traits scale. We iterated through the participants without replacement. Only autism group members for whom we were able to identify a match were included in the matched analysis. In doing so, we matched 49

Effects of group and autism traits on the number of novel and high-value clicks. A novel click occurs whenever a cell is opened for the first time that round. a and b show the number of novel clicks as a function of the (centralized) trial number in a round. Typically, participants used fewer novel clicks as a round progressed, and this trend was affected by the group (c) but not the autism traits (d) of participants. Whenever a participant selects the cell with a reward that is either the highest observed reward or within a 90% range of the highest reward, we call this click a high-value click. c and d show the number of high-value clicks in function of the trial number in a round.

Group and autism traits effects on the sampling distance. Within a round, the sampling distance typically decreased over trials. This decrease was modulated by the group (a and c), but not by traits (b and d). To allow for linear fitting, we use the logarithm of both the distance measures and the trials. Slopes represent model estimates of the interaction effects between trial and autism traits or groups, bands represent the 95% confidence intervals. a and b show the distance defined as the Manhattan distance to the closest high-value cell. c and d are the Manhattan distance between two consecutive clicks.

preregistration see OSF Registries | Context-Sensitive Cognitive Flexibility in Autism). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Psychological and Pedagogical Sciences of Ghent University and all participants gave their informed consent. Participants had to complete five experimental tasks, the International Cognitive Ability Resource (ICAR), and 20 questionnaires, across three days. The truffle task discussed in this paper, occurred during the second session, together with two other cognitive tasks (in randomized order), and the ICAR at the end of the session. Participants were only paid and included if they completed all three sessions with usable data on at least five of the seven tasks (ICAR, questionnaires, and five experimental tasks). For the second session, they were rewarded £9.2, and they could increase their total earnings with bonuses (average bonus of £9). In line with our preregistration, we excluded participants who were not paid (N = 0), who were older than 35 (N = 1), failed 3 or more attention checks (N = 8) or any attention checks for the autism questionnaires (N = 44), or had inconsistent autism diagnosis responses (N = 14)
