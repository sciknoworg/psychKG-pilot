You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

short, trait impressions from faces are primarily based on perceived resemblances to emotional expressions.
If trait impressions from faces are largely based on resemblances to emotion expressions, then people might more readily perceive personality traits that are more strongly associated with facial expressions of emotions. Functionalist accounts of emotion expressions highlight that their primary function is to coordinate social interactions 
(Crivelli & Fridlund, 2018;
Shariff & Tracy, 2011;
Van Kleef, 2010)
. From this perspective, emotion expressions are a tool for navigating social relationships-a skill which forms the basis for evaluations of an individual's sociability 
(Landy et al., 2016)
. Thus, emotional expressiveness may be seen as particularly indicative of a person's sociability (vs. morality or competence). Evidence from several studies support this idea. 
Goodwin and colleagues (2014)
 surveyed a wide range of trait adjectives to test which traits best distinguish between judgments on the three dimensions. Dispositional happiness emerged as a defining feature of sociability judgments. In a similar vein, smiling (as opposed to displaying a neutral facial expression) has a positive effect on a wide range of trait judgments, but effects tend to be strongest for sociability judgments 
(Krumhuber et al., 2007;
Mehu et al., 2007)
.
If perceptions of (resemblances to) emotional expressions are (a) a key determinant of trait impressions from faces and (b) especially relevant for judging an individual's sociability, then people might more readily perceive sociability (than morality or competence) in faces.
Results of previous studies provide preliminary evidence in favor of this hypothesis. After attractiveness, sociability and happiness were the most frequently mentioned traits when participants could freely describe faces 
(Oosterhof & Todorov, 2008
; see also 
Sutherland, Liu, et al., 2017)
.


The Current Studies
Here, we examine whether the extent to which people rely on facial appearance depends on which trait dimensions they are evaluating targets on. Specifically, we hypothesize that facial appearance is seen as particularly relevant for judging a person's sociability (vs. morality or competence). We test this hypothesis in five studies (N = 1,936, four preregistered).
First, we examine lay beliefs in the diagnostic value of facial appearance. In Study 1 (n = 338, preregistered), we measure physiognomic beliefs for sociability, morality, and competence.
That is, we explicitly ask participants to what extent they believe that each of the three traits is reflected in a person's facial appearance. We predict that people hold stronger physiognomic beliefs for sociability (vs. morality or competence).
Next, we investigate the mechanism underlying this effect 
(Study 2,
n = 162,
preregistered)
. Emotional expressions differ in how diagnostic they are for different traits. This not only applies to broad trait dimensions (e.g., sociability vs. morality), but also to specific traits within each dimension. We test whether people hold stronger physiognomic beliefs for sociability traits that are more readily expressed through facial expressions of emotions (e.g., enthusiastic, funny) than for sociability traits that less readily expressed through facial expressions of emotions (e.g., forgiving, humble; 
Goodwin, 2015;
Goodwin et al., 2014)
.
Finally, we examine the consequences of the belief that facial appearance is more indicative of a person's sociability. We hypothesize that facial cues exert a stronger influence on judgments and decisions in situations in which evaluating a person's sociability (vs. morality or competence) is central to the perceiver's goal. In short, we predict that facial cues are more influential when a target's sociability is relevant. In Study 3, we examine people's confidence in the accuracy of their impressions (n = 527, preregistered). Participants view photographs of emotionally neutral faces, provide impressions of sociability, morality, and competence, and indicate how accurate they think their judgments are. We predict that people are more confident in the accuracy of their impressions when judging sociability (vs. morality or competence).
We also examine reliance on facial appearance in an applied settings. We focus on the personnel selection context, as previous studies have shown that hiring decisions are influenced by the facial appearance of job candidates 
(Bóo et al., 2013;
Gomulya et al., 2017;
Ling et al., 2019)
. In Study 4 (n = 390, preregistered), we test whether the perceived diagnostic value of facial appearance for making hiring decisions varies as a function of the desired personality traits of job candidates. We predict that facial photographs are valued more when looking for a sociable (vs. moral or competent) employee. In Study 5 (n = 519, preregistered), we test whether people evaluate human resource managers who rely on facial appearance to make hiring decisions differently, depending on which personality trait the manager is looking for in candidates. Again, we predict that reliance on facial appearance is seen as more appropriate and more effective when looking for a sociable (vs. moral or competent) employee.
All data, analysis scripts, materials, and preregistration documents are available at the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/cbsmw/). We report how our sample sizes were determined, and mention all data exclusions and measures for each study.


Study 1: Physiognomic beliefs
In Study 1, we measured physiognomic beliefs for different personality traits. We predicted that participants would believe that sociability is more reflected in facial appearance than morality or competence.


Methods


Participants.
A total of 346 first-year psychology students from a Dutch university completed the study in return for partial course credit. The final sample size was determined by how many students participated in the study in two weeks. Eight participants with missing data were excluded from analysis, leaving a final sample of 338 participants (Mage = 19.78, SDage = 3.37; 84.02% female).
Materials and procedure. We measured physiognomic beliefs for sociability, morality, and competence with the physiognomic belief scale 
(Jaeger et al., 2020)
. Participants were prompted to "imagine seeing the passport photo of a stranger". Beliefs for the three trait dimensions were measured with three traits for each dimension (sociability: warmth, likeability, and friendliness, McDonald's ω = .90; competence: competence, intelligence, and skillfulness ω = .90; morality: trustworthiness, honesty, and sincerity ω = .89; 
Brambilla et al., 2011)
.
Participants dragged a slider to indicate how accurately they think they can judge each trait just from looking at a person's face. Slider values range from 0 (not accurate at all) to 100 (extremely accurate). 1 Dutch participants completed the study in Dutch while non-Dutch participants completed the study in English.
Sensitivity analysis. We conducted sensitivity analyses for our main effects of interest.
We determined the smallest difference in physiognomic beliefs we were able to detect with 80% power (and α = 5%). A sensitivity analysis in G*Power 
(Faul et al., 2007;
Giner-Sorolla et al., 2020
) showed that we had 80% power to detect an effect of d = 0.18. Thus, we had sufficient power to detect even small differences in physiognomic beliefs.


Results and discussion
We compared physiognomic beliefs across the three dimensions to test whether people believe that sociability is more reflected in facial features than morality or competence. Paired ttests showed that physiognomic beliefs were significantly stronger for sociability (M = 41.43, SD = 23.96) compared to morality (M = 22.64, SD = 21.50), t(337) = 21.10, p < .001, d = 0.82, and competence (M = 21.73, SD = 20.19), t(337) = 20.41, p < .001, d = 0.87 (see 
Figure 1
). There was no significant difference between morality-specific beliefs and competence-specific beliefs, t(337) = 1.14, p = .25, d = 0.04. Thus, in line with our hypothesis, we found that sociability was believed to be more reflected in facial appearance than morality or competence. 
1
 In line with previous work 
(Jaeger et al., 2020)
, we also measured general physiognomic belief without referring to any specific personality traits with three questions (e.g., "I can learn something about a person's personality just from looking at his or her face"; ω = .76). When assessing beliefs for specific characteristics, we also included three additional characteristics not related to a person's personality (gender, age, and attractiveness).

Study 2: The Role of Emotional Expressions
Study 1 showed that physiognomic beliefs were stronger for sociability-related traits than for morality-related or competence-related traits. We hypothesized that this is because people primarily rely on resemblances to facial expressions of emotions to form personality impressions and emotional expressions are seen as more diagnostic of a person's sociability. In other words, we would predict that the extent to which people believe that a certain trait can be accurately inferred from facial appearance depends on how much the trait is expressed through facial expressions of emotions. In Study 2, we tested this hypothesis more directly. Rather than comparing physiognomic beliefs across the three person perception dimensions (sociability, morality, competence), we examined differences in physiognomic beliefs for different sociability-related traits. Specifically, we examined sociability traits that are more readily expressed through facial expressions of emotions (e.g., enthusiastic, funny) and sociability traits that less readily expressed through facial expressions of emotions (e.g., forgiving, humble; 
Goodwin, 2015;
Goodwin et al., 2014)
. We refer to these as emotionally expressive sociability and non-emotionally expressive sociability, respectively. We predicted that people hold stronger physiognomic beliefs for traits that are more readily expressed through facial expressions of emotions.


Methods
This study was preregistered.
Participants. An a priori power analysis showed that a sample size of 162 participants is required to detect a small difference between conditions (d = 0.2) with 90% power (and α = 5%).
We therefore recruited 162 US American crowd workers via Prolific (Mage = 32.70, SDage = 12.41; 56.17% female, 40.74% male, 3.09% other).
Materials and procedure. We measured physiognomic beliefs for 16 traits that are indicative of a person's sociability 
(Goodwin, 2015)
. Participants were prompted to "imagine seeing the passport photo of a stranger". They then dragged a slider to indicate how accurately they think they can judge each trait just from looking at a person's face. Slider values range from 0 (not accurate at all) to 100 (extremely accurate). We selected eight traits that are more readily expressed through facial expressions of emotions (warm, easy-going, happy, sociable, playful, agreeable, enthusiastic, funny; ω = .95) and eight traits that are less readily expressed through facial expressions of emotions (kind, grateful, empathetic, helpful, humble, giving, forgiving, cooperative; ω = .95). 2 Sensitivity analysis. We conducted sensitivity analyses for our main effects of interest.
We determined the smallest difference in physiognomic belief (comparing emotionally expressive and non-emotionally expressive traits) we were able to detect with 80% power (and α = 5%). A sensitivity analysis in G*Power 
(Faul et al., 2007;
Giner-Sorolla et al., 2020
) showed that we had 80% power to detect an effect of d = 0.18. Thus, we had sufficient power to detect even small differences in physiognomic beliefs.


Results
We predicted that people would show stronger physiognomic beliefs for traits that are more readily expressed through facial expressions. In line with this hypothesis, a paired t-test showed that physiognomic beliefs were significantly stronger for emotionally expressive traits 2 A pretest with 100 participants recruited from Prolific (Mage = 33.87, SDage = 10.62; 54% female, 45% male, 1% other) showed that facial expressions of emotions were indeed seen as more relevant for inferring the eight emotional sociability traits (M = 5.05, SD = 0.77) than the eight non-emotional sociability traits (M = 4.10, SD = 0.95), t(99) = 12.44, p < .001, d = 1.07.
(M = 23.08, SD = 20.17) compared to non-emotionally expressive traits (M = 14.50, SD = 15.52), t(161) = 9.71, p < .001, d = 0.44 (see 
Figure 2A
).
Additional analyses. One of the eight emotionally expressive sociability traits that we examined also describes an emotional state with a clear facial expression ("happy"). However, even when omitting this trait from our analysis, we found that physiognomic beliefs were stronger for emotionally expressive traits (M = 22.12, SD = 19.98) compared to non-emotionally expressive traits (M = 14.50, SD = 15.52), t(161) = 8.97, p < .001, d = 0.39.
We also examined the relationship between the extent to which a trait is expressed through facial expressions of emotions (assessed in our pretest) and physiognomic beliefs (assessed in our main study) at the trait level. For each trait, we computed the average rating across all participants. There was a strong correlation between both variables, r(14) = .91, p < .001, showing that participants indicated stronger physiognomic beliefs for traits that are more readily expressed through facial expressions of emotions (see 
Figure 2B
).

Discussion
Study 2 provided additional insights into why people think that facial features are particularly relevant for judging sociability (vs. morality or competence). We hypothesized that people show stronger physiognomic beliefs for sociability because trait impressions from faces are primarily based on resemblances to facial expressions of emotions 
(Jaeger & Jones, 2021)
 and sociability-related traits are more likely to be expressed though facial expressions of emotions than morality-or competence-related traits. This view predicts that people are more confident in inferring traits from faces that are more readily expressed through emotional expressions. Results of Study 2 provided support for this hypothesis. We found that physiognomic beliefs were stronger for sociability-related traits that are more readily expressed through facial expressions of emotions (e.g., enthusiastic, funny) than for sociability-related traits that are less readily expressed through facial expressions of emotions (e.g., forgiving, humble). In short, our findings suggest that facial appearance is seen as more relevant for judging traits that are more strongly associated with emotional expressions.


Study 3: Confidence in Face Judgments
In Study 3, we measured physiognomic beliefs for different personality traits. We predicted that participants would believe that sociability is more reflected in facial appearance than morality or competence. We also asked participants to judge targets based on facial photographs and measured their confidence in the accuracy of their impressions. We measured perceptions of sociability, morality, and competence and predicted that participants would be more confident in their sociability judgments than their competence or morality judgments.
Previous work has shown that confidence in personality inferences from faces is positively related to the extremity and speed of judgments 
(Ames et al., 2010;
Willis & Todorov, 2006)
.
We therefore controlled for extremity and speed when comparing judgment confidence across personality dimensions.


Methods
This study was preregistered.
Participants. A total of 533 first-year psychology students from a Dutch university completed the study in return for partial course credit. The final sample size was determined by how many students participated in the study in two weeks. In line with our preregistered exclusion criteria, data from five participants who always indicated the same rating across all trials were excluded from analysis, leaving a final sample of 527 participants (Mage = 19.60, SDage = 2.09; 81.21% female, 18.60% male, 0.19% other). 
3
 The majority of participants were Dutch (73.62%) or German (13.28%).
Materials and procedure. We randomly selected ten Caucasian emotionally neutral images from the Chicago Face Database (five male, five female). Targets were photographed from a fixed distance in front of a uniform white background with a camera that was adjusted to their eye level and images were cropped to a size of 400 × 400 pixels. All participants viewed the images against a white background on a 22-inch Dell P2210 TFT monitor (1680 × 1050 resolution, 80 Hz refresh rate). The face stimuli were 112.8 mm high and 90.2 mm wide at an approximate viewing distance of 600 mm, subtending a visual angle of 10.7˚ × 8.6˚. We asked participants to rate targets on three dimensions: sociability (warmth, friendliness, likeability), morality 
(trustworthiness, sincerity, honesty)
, and competence 
(competence, intelligence, skillfulness)
. Participants separately rated each image on each dimension in a random order on a scale from 1 (not at all [dimension]) to 9 (extremely [dimension]). Thus, participants completed a total of 30 trials. Next to recording rating scores, we also recorded rating speed (the time it took participants to make a rating) and rating extremity (the absolute distance of the assigned score to the midpoint of the scale). After each judgment, participants indicated their confidence in the accuracy of their judgment on a scale from 1 (not at all confident) to 9 (extremely confident).
Finally, participants completed the physiognomic belief scale as in Study 1 (sociability: ω = .93, morality: ω = .95, competence: ω = .93).
In line with our preregistered exclusion criteria, we excluded response times from 305 trials (1.91%) that were three standard deviations below or above the mean. Response times were log10-transformed due to their right-skewed distribution. Dutch participants completed the study in Dutch while non-Dutch participants completed the study in English.
Sensitivity analysis. We conducted sensitivity analyses for our main effects of interest.
We determined the smallest difference in judgment confidence between the sociability, morality, and competence dimensions we were able to detect with 80% power (and α = 5%). We used the simr package 
(Green & Macleod, 2016)
 in R (R Core Team, 2021) to assess our design's sensitivity for detecting differences in confidence. The package provides power estimates for fixed effects in multilevel regression models. We varied the effect of interest in our model and calculated power at each level. This showed that our sample size allowed 80% power to detect a 0.067-point difference in confidence between sociability judgments and morality judgments and a 0.069-point difference in confidence between sociability judgments and competence judgments (on our nine-point scale). Thus, we had sufficient power to detect even small differences in physiognomic beliefs and confidence.


Results
Descriptive statistics. On average, participants took 6.31 s (SD = 2.50 s) to make a judgment and the mean confidence rating was 5.27 (SD = 1.65, on a scale that ranged from 1 to 9). We computed intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to estimate consensus in judgments across participants 
(Shrout & Fleiss, 1979
 Confidence. Our main goal was to test whether participants' confidence in their trait judgments depended on which trait they were judging. We predicted that participants would be more confident in their sociability judgments (vs. competence or morality judgments). To test this prediction, we estimated a multilevel regression model with random intercepts per participant and face, in which we regressed confidence on a variable indicating which dimension was judged (sociability vs. morality vs. competence; see 
Figure 3
). In line with our hypothesis, participants were more confident when judging sociability than when judging competence, β = 0.093, SE = 0.023, t(15272) = 4.13, p < .001, or morality, β = 0.158, SE = 0.023, t(15272) = 7.02, p < .001. Participants were also more confident when making competence (vs. morality) judgments, β = 0.065, SE = 0.023, t(15272) = 2.89, p = .004.
We explored whether differences in confidence across the three dimensions would still emerge when controlling for the extremity and speed of judgments. Regressing confidence on a dummy variable indicating which dimension was judged, as well as judgment extremity and speed showed a positive effect of extremity, β = 0.383, SE = 0.010, t(15069) = 39.16, p < .001, and a negative effect of speed, β = -0.161, SE = 0.010, t(15123) = 15.34, p < .001. More importantly, there was still a significant effect of personality dimension: Participants were more confident when judging sociability than when judging competence, β = 0.079, SE = 0.021, t(14967) = 3.70, p < .001, or morality, β = 0.094, SE = 0.021, t(14968) = 4.40, p < .001. There was no difference in confidence between competence and morality judgments, β = -0.005, SE = 0.021, t(15272) = 0.22, p = .83.
Additional analyses. We also tested whether we could replicate the findings of Study 1.
We compared physiognomic beliefs across the three dimensions to test whether people think that sociability is more reflected in facial features than morality or competence. Paired t-tests showed  
Figure 1
). Moralityspecific beliefs were slightly stronger than competence-specific beliefs, but this difference was less pronounced and only marginally significant, t(526) = 1.78, p = .075, d = 0.20.
Although our main goal was to test for differences in judgment confidence across trait dimensions, we also investigated the link between individual differences in physiognomic belief and confidence. We calculated participants' average confidence in their judgments across the three trait dimensions. Participants who more strongly believed in physiognomy were also more confident in the accuracy of their judgments, r(525) = .292, p < .001 (see the Supplemental Materials for more detailed results).

Discussion
We found that participants were more confident in the accuracy of their sociability impressions than their morality or competence impressions. Differences in confidence across the three dimensions still emerged when controlling for the extremity and speed of judgments, which were both related to confidence. Replicating the results of Study 1, we again found differences in physiognomic beliefs across the three dimensions: Sociability was believed to be more reflected in facial appearance than morality or competence.


Study 4: Diagnostic Value of Facial Appearance
Results of Study 3 showed that sociability is not only believed to be more reflected in facial appearance than morality or competence, participants were also more confident in the accuracy of their sociability judgments. Going beyond impressions formation based on facial photographs, Study 4 examined the perceived diagnostic value of facial appearance in a more applied setting. Previous studies have shown that hiring decisions are influenced by the facial appearance of candidates 
(Bóo et al., 2013;
Gomulya et al., 2017;
Ling et al., 2019
). In the current study, we tested if the diagnostic value of facial appearance in a personnel selection context depends on which personality trait people are looking for in job candidates. As sociability is believed to be more reflected in faces than morality or competence, we predicted that people would view information on a candidate's facial appearance as more useful if they are looking for sociable (vs. moral or competent) employee. We also measured physiognomic beliefs to test if the finding that sociability is believed to be more reflected in facial appearance than morality or competence replicates in a sample of participants from the United States.


Methods
This study was preregistered.
Participants. An a priori power analysis showed that a sample size of 130 participants per condition is required to detect a small-to-medium-sized difference between conditions (d = 0.35) with 80% power (and α = 5%). We therefore aimed to recruit a total of 390 participants.
We recruited 430 US American MTurk workers who completed the study in return for $0.50 each. In line with our preregistered exclusion criteria, data from 2 participants (0.47%) who indicated poor or basic English proficiency and from 38 participants (8.84%) who failed an attention check at the end of the study were excluded from analysis, leaving a final sample of 390 participants (Mage = 34.64, SDage = 9.88; 42.56% female).
Materials and procedure. We asked participants to imagine that they are working in the HR department of a company that hosts various events and that they were tasked with hiring a new event planner. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions, which determined which personality trait they were looking for in candidates (sociability, morality, or competence). For instance, in the sociability condition, participants read: "In the past, your company has received complaints about planners who were unfriendly and dismissive to guests.
Therefore, you are looking for someone who is warm, friendly, and likeable".
To measure the perceived value of facial photographs, participants saw a list of five typical components of a job application (photograph, experience, recommendation letter, education level, grades) in a random order and were asked to rate how useful each component is for making the hiring decision on a scale from 0 (not at all useful) to 100 (extremely useful). The usefulness ratings of the applicant's photograph represented our key dependent variable. Finally, participants completed the physiognomic belief scale (sociability: ω = .93, morality: ω = .95, competence: ω = .95) and three attention check items. Participants were first asked to rate several preferences on a nine point scale (e.g., "I prefer to get bonuses over steady income"), but were later instructed to indicate a specific response pattern. Participants who did not specify the correct response for any of the three questions were excluded from analysis. Sensitivity analysis. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis for our main effect of interest (differences in photo usefulness ratings between the sociability, morality, and competence conditions), using G*Power 
(Faul et al., 2007;
Giner-Sorolla et al., 2020)
. This confirmed that we had 80% power to detect an effect size of d = 0.35 when comparing ratings between conditions. For examining differences in physiognomic belief, a sensitivity analysis showed that we had 80% power to detect an effect of d = .22. Thus, our design had sufficient power to detect even small differences between personality dimensions. To test our main hypothesis, we examined whether usefulness ratings of the photo depended on which personality trait participants were looking for in candidates. We predicted that they would rate photos as more important for more making hiring decisions when they were looking for a sociable (vs. moral or competent) candidate. A one-way ANOVA showed that usefulness ratings of photos significantly varied across the three conditions F(2, 378) = 37.42, p < .001 (see 
Figure 4)
. In line with our hypothesis, participants perceived photos as a more useful cue when looking for a sociable candidate (M = 48.27, SD = 27.42) than when looking for a Additional analyses. We again compared physiognomic beliefs across the three personality dimensions to test whether people think that sociability is more reflected in facial appearance than morality or competence (see We also examined whether individual differences in physiognomic belief were related to the perceived usefulness of personal photos for making hiring decisions, irrespective of which personality trait participants were looking for in applicants. Across the three conditions, participants who more strongly believed in physiognomy viewed personal photos as more useful for making hiring decisions, r(388) = .631, p < .001 (see the Supplemental Materials for more detailed results). 


Results


Discussion
Personal photos were seen as more useful when participants were looking for a sociable (vs. moral or competent) employee. In other words, facial cues were seen as more important when judging sociability was relevant to a perceiver's goal. We again replicated the finding that sociability is believed to be more reflected in facial appearance than morality or competence.


Study 5: Appropriateness and Effectiveness of Relying on Facial Appearance
Studies 1 and 2 provided insights into how much people value facial cues when judging different personality traits. An important question is whether these differences are driven more by beliefs about the efficacy or the moral appropriateness of relying on facial cues. In other words, do people rely on facial cues when evaluating traits related to sociability because they believe that they are more likely to form accurate impressions? Or do they believe it is problematic to try to infer other traits (i.e., traits related to competence and morality) based on superficial facial cues? To answer this question, Study 5 extended our analyses to a third-party perspective. Specifically, we tested whether attitudes towards appearance-based discrimination vary depending on which personality trait is inferred from facial appearance. If sociability is believed to be more reflected in faces than morality or competence, then people should find reliance on personal photos more acceptable and more effective when the goal is to hire a sociable (vs. moral or competent) employee.


Methods
This study was preregistered.
Participants. An a priori power analysis showed that a sample size of 173 participants per condition is required to detect a small-to-medium-sized difference between condition (d = 0.35) with 90% power (and α = 5%). We therefore aimed to recruit a total of 519 participants.
We recruited 621 US American MTurk workers who completed the study in return for $0.50 each. In line with our preregistered exclusion criteria, data from 7 participants who indicated poor or basic English proficiency and from 93 participants who failed at least one of two attention checks were excluded from analysis, leaving a final sample of 521 participants (Mage = 35.78, SDage = 10.93; 45.11% female, 54.51% male, 0.38% other).
Materials and procedure. We asked participants to imagine a manager who is working in the HR department of a company that hosts various events. The job of the manager is to hire event planners. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions, which determined which personality trait the manager is looking for in candidates (sociability, morality, or competence). For instance, in the sociability condition, participants read:
In the past, the company has received complaints about planners who were unfriendly and dismissive to guests. Therefore, the manager is looking for someone who is warm, friendly, and likeable. Since the manager is receiving many applications, he always selects a few promising candidates that are then invited for an interview. When deciding whom to invite, he looks at the candidates' photos and picks the ones that look very warm, friendly, and likeable to him.
To measure attitudes towards discrimination based on facial photographs, we asked participants to evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the manager's practice. We measured perceived appropriateness with three items (appropriate, moral, ethical; ω = 0.95) which were evaluated on a scale that ranged from -50 (e.g., extremely inappropriate) to 50 (e.g., extremely appropriate). We measured perceived effectiveness with three items (effective, successful, likely to achieve goal; ω = 0.97) which were evaluated on a scale that ranged from -50 (e.g., extremely ineffective) to 50 (e.g., extremely effective). The order of the two measures and the order of items within each measure was randomized. Finally, participants completed the physiognomic belief scale. As in Study 4, we measured general physiognomic belief (ω = .90) and specific physiognomic beliefs for sociability (ω = .94), morality (ω = .94), and competence (ω = .94). Participants also completed the same attention check.
Sensitivity analysis. We conducted a sensitivity analysis for our main effects of interest (differences in effectiveness and appropriateness ratings between sociability, morality, and competence), using G*Power 
(Faul et al., 2007;
Giner-Sorolla et al., 2020)
. This showed that we had 80% power to detect an effect size of d = 0.30 when comparing effectiveness and appropriateness ratings between conditions. For examining differences in physiognomic belief, a sensitivity analysis showed that we had 80% power to detect an effect of d = 0.19. Thus, our design had sufficient power to detect even small differences in effectiveness ratings, appropriateness ratings, and physiognomic beliefs.


Results
Appropriateness and effectiveness ratings. On average, the manager's strategy to make hiring decisions based on photos was seen as relatively inappropriate (M = -15.54, SD = 26.24), t(520) = 13.52, p < .001, d = 0.59, and ineffective (M = -14.36, SD = 25.18), t(520) = 13.02, p < .001, d = 0.57, when compared against 0 (i.e., the midpoint of the scale which denoted neither appropriate nor inappropriate and neither effective nor ineffective). Appropriateness ratings and effectiveness ratings were strongly correlated, r(519) = .738, p < .001.
We tested whether appropriateness and effectiveness ratings of the manager's strategy depended on which personality trait the manager was looking for in candidates. We predicted that participants would view reliance on photos as more appropriate and effective when the manager is looking for a sociable (vs. moral or competent) candidate.
A one-way ANOVA showed that appropriateness ratings significantly varied across the three conditions F(2, 518) = 11.00, p < .001 (see 
Figure 5
, left panel). In line with our hypothesis, participants perceived relying on photos as a more appropriate strategy when looking for a sociable candidate (M = -9.77, SD = 26.24) than when looking for a competent candidate (M = -22.48, SD = 24.51), t(340) = 4.66, p < .001, d = 0.50. However, the difference in appropriateness ratings between the sociability and morality condition (M = -14.04, SD = 26.49) was not significant, t(341) = 1.50, p = .14, d = 0.16. Participants perceived relying on photos as a more appropriate strategy when looking for a moral (vs. competent) candidate, t(347) = 3.10, p = .002, d = 0.33.
A one-way ANOVA showed that effectiveness ratings also varied significantly across the three conditions F(2, 518) = 16.35, p < .001 (see 
Figure 5
, right panel). In line with our hypothesis, participants perceived relying on photos as a more effective strategy when looking Additional analyses. We again compared physiognomic beliefs across the three personality dimensions to test whether people think that sociability is more reflected in facial appearance than morality or competence (see 
Figure 1
). Paired t-tests showed that physiognomic 4 Differences in perceived appropriateness still emerged when controlling for perceived effectiveness and vice versa. Ratings of effectiveness and appropriateness were strongly correlated. We conducted an exploratory factor analyses for the six items used to measure the two constructs and both the visual scree test and the parallel analysis suggested that a one-factor solution fit the data best. As we found slightly different results for effectiveness and appropriateness ratings, we also report separate results for each measure. When analyzing the composite score for all six items measuring effectiveness and appropriateness, a one-way ANOVA showed that composite scores significantly varied across the three conditions F(2, 518) = 14.72, p < .001 (see 
Figure 5
, left panel). Ratings where higher when the recruiter was looking for a sociable candidate (M = -7.77, SD = 23.76) than when they were looking for a moral candidate (M = -15.35, SD = 23.18), t(340) = 2.99, p = .003, d = 0.32, or a competent candidate (M = -21.37, SD = 23.14), t(342.9) = 5.40, p < .001, d = 0.58. Ratings in the morality condition were also significantly higher than in the competence condition, t(349.8) = 2.44, p = .015, d = 0.26. We also examined whether individual differences in physiognomic belief were related to the perceived appropriateness and effectiveness of relying on personal photos to make hiring decisions, irrespective of which personality trait participants were looking for in applicants.
Across the three conditions, participants who more strongly believed in physiognomy perceived relying on personal photos as more appropriate, r(519) = .530, p < .001, and more effective, r(519) = .659, p < .001 (see the Supplemental Materials for more detailed results). 


Discussion
Results of the current study showed that the appropriateness and effectiveness of relying on facial appearance for making hiring decisions depends on which personality trait people are looking for in applicants. Even though participants perceived reliance on facial appearance as less appropriate and less effective than reliance on other information (e.g., recommendation letters), attitudes differed depending on which personality trait recruiters were looking for in candidates. Specifically, reliance on personal photos for making hiring decisions was seen as more appropriate when looking for a sociable (vs. moral or competent) employee. Reliance on personal photos for making hiring decisions was also seen as more effective when looking for a sociable (vs. competent) employee (differences between sociability and morality were not significant). We again replicated the finding that sociability is believed to be more reflected in facial appearance than morality or competence.


General Discussion
Many people believe in the central idea of physiognomy that a person's facial appearance is indicative of their personality 
(Suzuki et al., 2017)
. Here, we asked whether some personality traits are believed to be more reflected in facial appearance than others. Trait impressions are, to a large extent, based on the resemblance of facial cues to emotional expressions 
(Adams et al., 2012;
Said et al., 2009)
. As emotional expressiveness is a central component of sociability 
(Kring et al., 1994;
Roger & Nesshoever, 1987)
, we hypothesized that people would more readily perceive sociability in faces than morality or competence. In line with this hypothesis, we found that sociability is believed to be more reflected in facial appearance than morality or competence and this effect emerged consistently in four large samples of Dutch 
(Studies 1 and 3)
 and U.S. American participants (Studies 4 and 5). Study 2 confirmed that this pattern of results was in fact due to the greater relevance of emotional expressions for judging sociability (vs. morality or competence). When examining physiognomic beliefs for various traits indicative of sociability, we found that physiognomic beliefs were stronger for traits that are more readily expressed through facial expressions of emotions (e.g., enthusiastic, funny) than for traits that are less readily expressed through facial expressions of emotions (e.g., forgiving, humble). In short, our findings suggest that facial appearance is seen as more relevant for judging traits that are more strongly associated with emotional expressions.
We also examined whether this pattern across personality dimensions is reflected in the influence of facial cues on judgment and decision-making. In particular, we investigated whether facial cues are more influential when a person's sociability (vs. morality or competence) is relevant. Across three studies, we manipulated which trait was relevant for participants' judgments or decisions. Study 3 showed that participants were more confident in the accuracy of their sociability judgments (vs. morality or competence judgments). In Study 4, we examined how much people value information on a person's facial appearance (i.e., a facial photograph) in a hiring context. While photographs of candidates were seen as less diagnostic than other cues (e.g., recommendation letters or past experience), photographs were valued more when looking for a sociable (vs. moral or competent) employee. A similar pattern of results was found in Study 5. Participants viewed a manager's strategy to rely on facial appearance when making hiring decisions as relatively ineffective and inappropriate. However, reliance on facial appearance was seen as more effective when looking for a sociable (vs. moral or competent) employee. Reliance on facial appearance was also viewed as more appropriate when looking for a sociable (vs. competent) employee (the comparison with morality was not significant). Together, we find converging evidence for the notion that facial appearance is seen as particularly important for judging a person's sociability.


Theoretical Implications
People often rely on facial appearance even when more diagnostic information is available 
(Jaeger et al., 2019;
Olivola et al., 2018)
. Overreliance on facial cues is problematic because it can lead to worse outcomes for the decision-maker 
(Olivola & Todorov, 2010b)
 and to systematic biases against people with a certain facial appearance 
(Eberhardt et al., 2006;
Wilson & Rule, 2015)
. To explain the widespread influence of facial appearance, previous studies have mostly focused on individual characteristics of perceivers, examining who relies more or less on facial appearance 
(Ewing et al., 2015;
Suzuki, 2016;
Suzuki et al., 2017)
. The present findings suggest that the extent to which facial appearance influences decision-making outcomes not only depends on who is making the decision, but also in what context the decision is being made.
People may be more likely to rely on trait impressions from faces when a person's sociability (vs. morality or competence) is relevant for their decision.
It should be noted that our results do not imply that people only rely on facial appearance when others' sociability is relevant. When investigating effects of facial appearance on decisionmaking, prior studies have mostly focused on impressions of trustworthiness and competence, which have been shown to predict voting 
(Olivola & Todorov, 2010a;
Todorov et al., 2005),
 hiring 
(Gomulya et al., 2017)
, and sentencing decisions 
(Jaeger et al., 2020)
. Our results do not stand in conflict with these findings, as we consistently find that people see some value in facial appearance as an indicator of targets' morality and competence. However, the current results do suggest that the perceived diagnostic value of facial appearance is even larger for judging targets' sociability.
Going beyond differences across trait dimensions, our results also extend recent work on individual differences in reliance on facial appearance. Similar to Suzuki and colleagues (2017), we find that many people believe in the core tenet of physiognomy-that personality traits are reflected in facial cues. Our analyses showed that individuals who more strongly endorsed physiognomic beliefs were more confident in the accuracy of their trait impressions (Study 3), valued personal photos more for making hiring decisions (Study 4), and viewed reliance on facial appearance to make hiring decisions as more appropriate and more effective (Study 5).
Thus, individual differences in physiognomic beliefs may explain why some people rely more on trait impressions from faces than others.
Studies in the field of social perception often highlight the efficient and automatic way in which people form trait impressions from faces 
(Bonnefon et al., 2013;
Engell et al., 2007;
Willis & Todorov, 2006)
. However, these findings should not be interpreted as evidence for procedural uniformity in impression formation. In fact, recent studies have shown that there are various topdown influences on social perception 
(Freeman & Ambady, 2010;
Hehman et al., 2019)
. For instance, lay beliefs about the conceptual overlap between specific personality traits (e.g., whether trustworthiness correlates with sociability) predict the extent to which face-based impressions of the traits overlap (e.g., whether trustworthiness impressions correlate with sociability impressions; 
Stolier, Hehman, Keller, et al., 2018)
. In a similar vein, our results show that the extent to which people think about and rely on facial cues in judgment and decision-making depends on both individual differences (i.e., endorsement of physiognomic beliefs) and situational differences (i.e., which trait dimension targets are evaluated on).


Limitations and Future Directions
Why is facial appearance seen as especially diagnostic for judging sociability (vs. other personality traits)? We suggested that this is due to the fact that trait impressions are primarily formed based on emotion cues (i.e. facial cues that resemble emotion expressions). As emotional expressiveness is a central component of sociability, people more readily perceive sociability in faces. An alternative (albeit non-mutually exclusive) explanation holds that people rely more on facial appearance when judging sociability because sociability can be more accurately inferred than other personality traits. Previous research using stranger rating paradigms-in which participants make personality judgments based on limited information-suggests that judgment accuracy is highest for extraversion (which is conceptually similar to sociability) compared to other Big Five personality traits 
(Kenny & West, 2008)
. However, the evidence is less clear for judgments based on static images of emotionally neutral faces. While some studies found that the accuracy of extraversion impressions is above chance 
(Borkenau et al., 2009;
Kramer & Ward, 2010;
Naumann et al., 2009;
Penton-Voak et al., 2006)
, others did not 
(Ames et al., 2010;
Jones et al., 2012;
Shevlin et al., 2003)
. In general, there is no clear evidence that extraversion judgments are more accurate than other trait judgments. More research is needed to determine the accuracy of different personality trait judgments from facial appearance and to what extent this pattern is reflected in people's beliefs about the accuracy of their own trait judgments.
Previous findings on the meta-accuracy of trait impressions from faces also speak against the idea that people rely more on sociability judgments because they are actually more accurate than judgments of other personality traits. This would require people to know how accurate their judgments across various trait dimensions are. However, people are generally not aware of how accurate their judgments are-that is, they show poor meta-accuracy 
(Ames et al., 2010;
. People who are more confident in the accuracy of their impressions are on average not more accurate (i.e., inter-personal meta-accuracy is poor) and people's confidence does not seem to track their accuracy across judgments (i.e., intra-personal meta-accuracy is poor).
Together, these findings cast doubt on the idea that people rely more on facial appearance when judging sociability because sociability impressions are more accurate.
More research is also needed to examine whether the present findings replicate in more externally valid contexts. For example, previous studies have investigated the effect of facial appearance on organizational decision-making by examining the outcomes of real-life hiring procedures 
(Gomulya et al., 2017;
Ling et al., 2019)
. Future studies could take a similar approach and test if candidates' facial appearance is more consequential when their sociability is more relevant for the position in question. Reliance on facial appearance and beliefs about the appropriateness of this strategy may also vary across different countries. For example, in some countries, people are prohibited from including a photograph in their job application. Finally, Study 3 showed that people were more confident in the accuracy of their impressions when judging sociability, but these results were based on a relatively small and demographically homogenous sample of targets. Future studies should examine how the goal of impression formation (i.e., on which dimensions targets are judged) shapes the impressions formation process using larger and more diverse samples.
Another promising avenue for future research is a more thorough investigation of the structure, antecedents, and consequences of physiognomic beliefs. Lay beliefs shape many aspects of social perception and behavior. For example, research on lay personality theory has shown that people hold beliefs about the basis 
(Haslam et al., 2004)
 and malleability 
(Chiu et al., 1997)
 of personality traits and that these beliefs predict outcomes related to impression formation 
(Haslam et al., 2004)
, information search 
(Plaks et al., 2001)
, and stereotyping 
(Levy et al., 1998)
. Here, we showed that people also hold beliefs about the extent to which different traits are reflected in facial appearance. We also conducted exploratory factor analyses on participants' physiognomic belief scores for the nine different personality traits, which showed that a onefactor solution fit the data best (see Supplemental Materials). This suggests that there are important person-level (as well as trait-level) factors shaping physiognomic belief. Additional studies are needed to better understand how this general belief in physiognomy shapes social perception and behavior (for first attempts, see 
Jaeger, Todorov, et al., 2020;
Suzuki et al., 2017)
.


Conclusion
People spontaneously infer personality traits from faces and rely on their inferences to make a wide range of social decisions 
(Olivola et al., 2014;
Todorov et al., 2015)
. Here, we asked whether the perceived diagnostic value of facial appearance varies across different personality dimensions. Are some traits believed to be more reflected in facial appearance than others? We found that beliefs in the manifestation of personality traits in facial appearance are strongest for sociability (vs. morality or competence). We also found that people are more confident in the accuracy of their trait impressions when judging sociability (vs. morality or competence). In a hiring context, people value information on a person's facial appearance more when looking for a sociable (vs. moral or competent) employee, reliance on facial appearance to select job candidates is seen as more appropriate when looking for a sociable (vs. moral or competent) employee, and reliance on facial appearance is seen as more effective when looking for a sociable (vs. competent) employee (differences between sociability and morality were not significant). Overall, the current results provide converging evidence that people see facial appearance as especially relevant for judging a person's sociability. Put differently, facial cues weigh heavy in judgment and decision-making, especially when judging another person's sociability.
