You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction:
The rapid acceleration of digital transformation across sectors has been notably observed in many areas, such as hospital 
(Ayers, J. W et. 2023)
, stock market 
(Lopez-Lira, A., & Tang, Y. 2023
) and many other workplace. Many Researchers show that AI can deliver a less biased 
(Kleinberg, J., Lakkaraju, H., Leskovec, J., Ludwig, J., & Mullainathan, S. 2018)
 and noisy judgment 
(Kahneman, D., Sibony, O., & Sunstein, C. R. 2021
). An estimated 60% of businesses reported leveraging AI-powered tools to augment their decision-making 
(Binz, M., & Schulz, E. 2023)
 processes and strategic planning. While AI's contribution to enhancing operational efficiency is well-recognized, concerns persist about the risks of human displacement and the potential loss of nuanced understanding that human consultants provide.
GPT-4, OpenAI's state-of-the-art language model, exemplifies the new generation of AI technologies making significant strides in the business consultancy realm. Launched on March 15, 2023, GPT-4 hit 200 million users within 90 days of its release, testifying to its capabilities in providing high-quality, data-driven insights across an expansive range of topics. GPT-4 was not developed explicitly for business consultancy, and its potential in serving as an effective workplace consultant remained largely untapped until recently.
Our research explores GPT-4's aptitude in four crucial aspects of business consultancy: problem-solving,self efficacy, strategic thinking, and decision-making. We contrasted GPT-4's responses and recommendations with those of human consultants, utilizing data from real-world business scenarios collated from an extensive set of online platforms. The study endeavored to uncover whether GPT-4 could rival or even outperform human consultants in delivering valuable business insights while maintaining the ability to comprehend and navigate complex business landscapes.
In order to understand insight problem-solving, it is necessary to establish the definitions of key terms. Problem-solving refers to a series of cognitive processes that aim to transform a given situation into a desirable outcome when there is no clear solution available 
(Mayer and Wittrock, 2006)
. In simpler terms, it encompasses the process of finding a solution to a problem or set of problems, utilizing various strategies or techniques to overcome obstacles and achieve a specific goal, particularly when the problem solver lacks an obvious solution method 
(Mayer, 1992)
. Problem-solving can be approached in different ways, such as through analytical, creative, and intuitive methods. Analytical methods involve breaking down the problem into smaller components and systematically analyzing each part to arrive at a solution (e.g., 
Polya, 2004)
. Creative methods involve generating fresh and unique ideas to address the problem, while intuitive methods rely on past experiences and knowledge to guide the problem-solving process.
Career planing is a ill-structured problem, which needs a creative problem solving skills 
(Ericsson, K. A. 1999
. Simon, 1981
. Weisberg, 1999
,2006
. This theory is based on expert knowledge. When the problem is not define well, a "good enough" solution is acceptable 
(Newell, A., & Simon, H. A. 1972)
. Another important theory is the "Dual-Process Hypothesis" (DPT), which posits that problem-solving can be accomplished through two distinct processes: rapid and intuitive (referred to as System 1), as well as slow and deliberate (known as System 2).
In the medical study, researchers compare medical experts and AI's answer 
(Ayers, J. W et. 2023)
, for every question, AI will generate much longer answer than these medical experts, which fits the fluency creativity theory 
(Torrance, E. P. 1966)
, the more ideas you generate, the more creative you are.
AI has been treated as an uncreative machine for a long time, but since large language model develop in recent years, some people has raised the question that if AI is still uncreative.


3.Method:


Study 1
The first study, we do not control the word number of a human resource professor's response (See Table1). A research assistant ask the professor to give an advice about his workplace problem, and we ask Chat GPT to answer the same question. Then we conduct a survey to recruit 30 participants from social media to eveluste the answer of both professor and Chat GPT for First, participants were asked which response was better (i.e., response 1 or response 2). Then, using Likert scales, evaluators judged the following questions: problem solving skills, decision making, strategic making. Response options were translated into a 1 to 5 scale, where higher values indicated greater quality or relevance.
We relied on an ensemble scoring strategy, where scores were averaged across evaluators for each exchange studied. This method is used when there is no ground truth in the outcome being studied, and the evaluated outcomes themselves are inherently subjective.
We compared the number of words in expert and AI responses and reported the percentage of responses for which the AI was preferred. Using 2-tailed t tests, we compared mean quality and relevance scores of expert responses with AI responses. We also reported the Pearson correlation matrix between the question 1~5 and relevance scores. Assuming that in-real-life business questions may be longer than those posted on the online forum, we also assessed the extent to which subsetting the data into longer replies authored by experts changed evaluator preferences and the quality or relevance ratings relative to the AI responses.


Results:
The participants preferred the AI response to the expert responses 93%. Summaries of example questions and the corresponding expert and AI responses are shown in the 
Table 1
. AI preforms better in problem solving (t(27) = 9.22, p < 0.001, d = 1.7427.), strategic thinking(t(27) = 10.06, p < .001, d = 1.82) and decision making (t(27) = 8.44, p < .001, d = 1.543).  


Study 2
Here we use a business school professor's podcast that discuss career life decision and many other issues. The professor has publish a book discussing life choice 
(Galloway, S. 2019)
. Listeners will record their problem and send them to the podcast, and the professor will try to answer these questions.
Then we conduct a survey to recruit 30 participants from social media to evaluate the answer of both professor and Chat GPT like the first study, we also measure self efficacy 
(Bandura, A., Barbaranelli, C., Caprara, G. V., & Pastorelli, C. 2001)
. Remember, it's normal to feel some anxiety before public speaking. The goal is not to eliminate these feelings entirely, but to manage them so that they don't interfere with your ability to communicate effectively. 


Results:
Summaries of example questions and the corresponding expert and AI responses are shown in the 
Table 4
. AI preforms better in problem solving (t(27) = 4.329, p < 0.001, d = 0.8973), strategic thinking (t(27) = 6.4505, p < 0.001, d = 1.5668) ,decision making (t(27) = 9.22, p < 0.001, d = 1.1547), and self efficacy (t(27) = 2.9284, p < 0.005, d = 1.2754).


Discussion:
In study 2 we control the lengh of expert response, and the cohen's D drop significantly, which means that people prefer longer response.
We do not yet have a complete understanding of how AI assistants like GPT-4 will perform in real-time business consultancy, but this study provides motivation for further research into their adoption. As our study suggests, GPT-4 could assist human resource or other management consultant to solve problems, help clients make a better decision, enhance self efficacy and make a better strategy. An AI-assisted approach could unlock new levels of productivity, enabling experts staff to allocate their time to more complex tasks, facilitate more consistent responses, and help staff improve their overall communication skills by reviewing and modifying AI-written drafts.
Investments into AI-assistant integrated to business world could have significant effects on client outcomes. If more client queries are answered promptly, with clarity, and to a high standard, it might reduce unnecessary consultancy meetings, freeing up resources for those who need them. Moreover, consultancy is a crucial resource for fostering business equity, where organizations with limited access to professional advice, irregular working hours, or budget constraints, are more likely to turn to digital platforms for solutions. High-quality responses might also improve business outcomes, as timely and precise consultancy could impact strategic decisions, operational efficiency, and overall business performance.
Evaluating AI assistant technologies in the context of controlled business scenarios will be essential for their implementation, including studying outcomes for consultants, such as job satisfaction, engagement, and the potential reduction of consultant burnout.


Limitation:
The primary limitation of this study revolves around our reliance on real-world business scenarios collected from the podcast Q&A. Such data might not accurately reflect typical consultant-client interactions. For instance, our evaluation focused on GPT-4's response to isolated queries, whereas actual consultants may tailor their responses based on existing relationships with their clients.
We have yet to determine to what extent human consultants personalize their advice, or how effectively GPT-4 can simulate such personalized details.
While we have evaluated the overall quality of GPT-4's recommendations, we have not assessed how its integration could enhance the overall consultation process. The value added by AI assistance may differ widely across industries, organizations, and individual consultants, given that AI is meant to augment, not replace, existing consultation procedures.
Another limitation is that the complex business problems that our study addresses are just one of the many issues that consultants deal with. Other common queries could pertain to specific strategies, market analysis, human resource issues, or operational dilemmas.
Furthermore, this study's metrics for assessing the quality and relevance of responses were not pre-tested or validated. The evaluators of this study, despite being blind to the source of the response and initial results, also served as co-authors, which could have potentially influenced their assessments. Also, evaluators did not specifically assess GPT-4 or human responses for accuracy or misleading information, though this was factored into the overall quality evaluation and preference.
The usage of a public database ensures that this study can be replicated, expanded, and validated, especially as newer AI technologies emerge. We only considered a single-dimensional measure of response quality, but future research can elucidate sub-dimensions of quality (e.g., timeliness or precision) and personalization (e.g., understanding the client's specific needs or expressing concern for their challenges).
Lastly, incorporating AI assistants like GPT-4 in workplace presents numerous ethical concerns that need to be addressed prior to implementation. These include the need for human review of AI-generated content for accuracy and potential misinformation, maintaining the privacy and security of sensitive business information, and ensuring transparency in AI-generated insights.


Conclusion:
While this study has shown promising results regarding the application of AI tools like GPT-4 in the context of workpace or career consultancy, it is important to underline that additional research is required before any definitive conclusions about their impact in practical business settings can be made. Despite the study's limitations and the tendency to overstate the potential of emerging technologies, exploring the integration of AI assistants in business consultancy processes bears promise. It holds the potential to enhance both consultant and client outcomes, suggesting a prospective avenue for efficiency and innovation in the realm of business consultancy.


Future suggestion:
Machine learning encompasses vast quantities of data, beyond the capacity of human memory to retain. GPT, with its access to extensive online data, can effectively deliver comparable product information. In addressing complex issues such as assessing creativity, the breadth of data accessible to machine learning can serve to counteract certain heuristic biases.

2. Mentorship: Finding a mentor in your industry can provide personalized guidance without coaching fees. A mentor can be a senior colleague, a professional contact or someone you find online.
3. Career Services: If you are a student or alumni, your university or college may offer free career services.
4. Free or low-cost seminars/webinars: Many organizations or professional associations offer seminars that can help you develop a career strategy.
5. Networking: Networking in your chosen field can provide advice and guidance, often for free. This can be done in person at industry events or online on platforms such as LinkedIn.
5. Career-focused podcasts and videos: There are many free resources that offer advice and insights on career development, job hunting, and skill development.
If after exploring these options, you still feel like you need more personal help, you might consider saving up for a few sessions with a career coach. Make sure you have thoroughly researched the credibility of the instructor before hiring, and maybe try a session before taking more sessions. Women's entry into leadership does present unique challenges due to bias in many workplaces. However, there are several strategies that can help you meet these challenges and move towards a leadership role:
1. Gain the necessary skills: Seek out continuing education and skill-building opportunities, especially in areas deemed critical in your field. This can make you more competitive for leadership positions.
2. Find mentors and sponsors: Mentors can provide guidance, while sponsors can actively advocate for your advancement in the organization. These people can be men or women who recognize your potential and want to help you succeed.
have that space.
I'm not sure I believe young women don't have the same opportunities as men in tech. I think there may be some inherent bias. I think those biases really come into play when women have children. I don't think corporate America has figured out a way to sustain the trajectory for women, and all the data show that. Once there are children, society will only bring more burdens on women to raise children.
5. Be Negotiable: Women are often hesitant to negotiate a higher salary or promotion. Don't shy away from promoting your worth and abilities.
6. Challenge bias: If you experience bias or discrimination, don't hesitate to call it out (diplomatically) and suggest fairer practices.
7. Support other women: Support other women in the workplace. This helps create a culture that values women's contributions and paves the way for more women to take on leadership roles.
8. Find work-life balance: Make sure you set and maintain boundaries for your personal life and self-care. This balance is critical to preventing burnout.
9. Pursue opportunities in women-friendly companies: Some organizations have a strong track record of supporting women leaders.
Researching a company's culture and history can help you find such a place to work.
10. Consider leadership training: There are programs specifically designed to help women develop leadership skills and overcome workplace bias.
Remember that change is often slow and there may be setbacks along the way. Persistence is the key to this journey. It's also important to note that you can work to implement change within an organization or industry by advocating for policies that promote diversity and equality.
How do I talk about religion to my kids
Since religion and spirituality are involved in these discussions, I just think this thing is too personal. I don't know if I can give you any advice, and I certainly don't have any. People need to come together. I never believed in the idea of God. I hope you decide to get involved in your church because I feel you can have a very positive impact on people.
Talking to your kids about religion can be a daunting task because it involves personal beliefs and values. This number has increased fivefold since 1990. The same survey found that men were less likely than women to rely on friends for emotional support or to share personal feelings.
The question is, why is it getting harder for men to make friends, especially as they get older? I think, first of all, our upbringing discourages making friends. I grew up with sports and we bumped into each other all the time while we were growing up. I have become more withdrawn. It is difficult for me to make friends. In addition, men will be suspicious of each other. At least in the US we are also taught that affection or admiration for another man means you are gay, which was an insult when I was growing up. In the end, we became a little more progressive and less homophobic. Or second, you would use affection or cuddling as a means of affection, which is the act of trying to have sex with someone.
i think it all needs to change often socialized to engage in more competitive, less emotionally open relationships. As men age, their social circles tend to shrink due to professional demands and family obligations. Additionally, people are often reluctant to allow themselves to be vulnerable, which is key to deepening friendships.
So what to do? Joining a group or club that matches your interests is a great way to start. Whether it's a sports club, book club, fitness group, or even a cooking class, these are great ways to meet like-minded people. Volunteering that you are already doing is also a great way to meet people with similar values.
Also, try to create an environment where deeper conversations can take place. Sharing personal stories, thoughts and experiences can help create stronger connections. You may also want to try reaching out to people individually, not just in a group setting, to get to know them better.
Remember that true friendships often take time to develop, so don't be discouraged if they don't develop overnight. It's about consistency and shared experience over time. You are already on the right path, so keep going and be patient.
I wish you all the best in your new life in the UK! I am Dr. C from Canada. Do you think storytelling can be important. As a parent, what can you do to make your child a better storyteller? Second, as an educator, do you think universities should do more on how to become better storytellers?
Dr. C., I was over dinner and I told them the story of their grandparents, how they met, immigrated from England, moved to Canada, and traveled across America on the Austin mini-metro when my mom was seven months pregnant. I think they listen to stories and it makes them Hello Dr. C! Your insights on the power of storytelling are all spot on.
To answer your first question, as a parent, you can guide your children to become savvier storytellers by teaching them to approach narratives critically. This means encouraging them to ask questions about the sources of the stories, their motivations, the messages presented, and the angles in which the stories are told. You can help them practice this skill using examples from everyday life, the media, or even your own stories. Encourage them to ask questions such as: "What is the purpose of this story? What facts support it? Are there any inconsistencies or gaps? Who benefits from this story? Who might better storytellers. My son goes to a great school, my son is in eighth grade, and every eighth grader has to stand in front of the whole community at school, including parents, and give a 10 or 15 minute presentation. My son gave a lecture on whaling and the Nantucket whaling industry. Anyway, it's great be harmed?"
For your second question, yes, I do think universities should teach students how to be better storytellers. Critical thinking, media literacy, and even discipline-specific courses such as history, sociology, or political science can be incorporated into courses that assess narrative.
Universities could also consider more interdisciplinary approaches, combining elements from different fields such as psychology, philosophy, media studies and data science, to develop a fuller understanding of storytelling and its impact on society and individuals.
