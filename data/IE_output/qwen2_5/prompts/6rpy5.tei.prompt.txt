You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
The ability to weigh expected rewards and costs is critical for optimal decision-making 
(Frömer & Shenhav, 2021;
Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021;
Westbrook et al., 2020)
. For instance, many everyday activities such as exercising 
(Harris & Bray, 2021)
 and helping others 
(Lockwood et al., 2017)
 involve physical effort. Furthermore, an imbalanced effort sensitivity has been found to be closely related to a variety of disorders including schizophrenia 
(Gold et al., 2015)
, binge eating 
(Brassard & Balodis, 2021)
, Parkinson's disease 
(Chong, 2018)
, aging 
(Byrne & Anaraky, 2020)
, and depression 
(Berwian et al., 2020;
Treadway et al., 2012)
.
Considering its ubiquitous presence in our daily life and clear clinical relevance, it is crucial to elucidate the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying effort-based valuations.
The common currency theory suggests that a neural network is involved in subjective value calculation on a single scale across multiple types of reward and decision situations 
(Levy & Glimcher, 2012;
McNamee et al., 2013;
Sescousse et al., 2013)
, thus providing a powerful framework to explain how different options are compared in the brain. Indeed, in decisionmaking with common costs, such as risk and delay, numerous studies have shown a positive association between ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity and subjective value 
(Bartra et al., 2013;
Kable & Glimcher, 2007;
Peters & Büchel, 2009)
, which implicates its critical role in cost-reward integration regardless of task types. Hence, the vmPFC has been proposed as a central node of this domain-general valuation network 
(Bartra et al., 2013;
Levy & Glimcher, 2012)
.
While this view has also received some supportive evidence in effort-based decisionmaking 
(Aridan et al., 2019;
Hogan et al., 2019;
Westbrook et al., 2019)
, a few other studies have identified effort-related value signals beyond the vmPFC 
(Chong et al., 2017;
Klein-Flügge et al., 2016)
, particularly in a more dorsal portion of the medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) that mainly includes the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and some parts of the presupplementary motor area 
(Kolling et al., 2016;
Piva et al., 2019)
. A meta-analysis of fMRI studies showed that both vmPFC and dmPFC activity is associated with effort-reward integration, although in opposite directions 
(Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021)
. These findings thus raise the possibility that, next to its ventral counterpart, the dmPFC also plays an important role in computing subjective value of effortful options.
To date, only a few studies with divergent results have directly tested if the common currency theory could be applied to effort-based decision-making by comparing it with decisions that involve other types of costs (e.g., risk and delay) 
(Aridan et al., 2019;
Massar et al., 2015;
Prévost et al., 2010;
Seaman et al., 2018)
. For example, one study found that vmPFC activity increased with subjective value during both effort-based and risky decision-making 
(Aridan et al., 2019)
, whereas some other studies showed that the dmPFC (especially the dACC) was uniquely involved in effort-reward integration 
(Massar et al., 2015;
Prévost et al., 2010)
. Another study identified subjective value signals in a large cluster covering both the vmPFC and dmPFC regardless of task types 
(Seaman et al., 2018)
. One possible factor that may have caused the inconsistency between studies is that some studies required participants to exert effort during decision-making, while other did not, possibly confounding neural correlates of subjective value with motor execution effects 
(Chong et al., 2017;
Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021)
. Moreover, those studies mainly relied on a mass-univariate approach, which ignores the dependencies between brain voxels, as opposed to multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) 
(Haynes & Rees, 2006;
Norman et al., 2006)
. Thus, studies solely based on univariate analyses might be less sensitive to detecting signals related to subjective value in heterogeneous regions like the medial prefrontal cortex 
(Jimura & Poldrack, 2012;
Kahnt, 2018;
Nee et al., 2011)
. Finally, trial-wise subjective value used in fMRI analyses is typically inferred based on a computational model. Although a few studies have explored a range of computational models used to describe choice behaviors during effort-based decision-making 
(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;
Chong et al., 2017;
Klein-Flügge et al., 2015;
Prévost et al., 2010)
, there is still an ongoing debate on the computational underpinnings of effort-reward integration, and it remains largely unclear if effort and risk have similar discounting effects on prospective outcomes.
The current study aimed to directly test the common currency theory by examining which brain regions represent subjective value information across effort-based and risky decisionmaking. Unlike previous studies, we used a combination of computational modeling and both univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses, to first reanalyze an existing dataset 
(Aridan et al., 2019)
 and then conducted an independent study to confirm our results. While the univariate analyses showed rather divergent results between effort-based and risky decision-making, MVPA consistently indicated the dmPFC as a possible site of subjective value representations across effortful and risky tasks. Our results might help reconcile current debates on the neural basis of effort-based valuation and extend the scope of the common currency theory to include the dmPFC as a critical region in value processing independent of cost types.


Results
To examine both effort-based and risky decision making in a common paradigm, in study 1, we reanalyzed the choice and fMRI data from an open-access dataset by 
Aridan et al. (2019)
.
This dataset includes two one-option decision-making tasks, with either effort 
(N = 39;
Fig. 1a)
 and risk (N = 38; 
Fig. 1b
) as the cost on each trial, respectively. Effort requirements were defined as proportions of participants' maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), as measured in the calibration task at the beginning of the experiment. Risk levels were defined as the losing probabilities of an option. In addition to the cost, each option was associated with a potential gain and a potential loss. In each trial, participants decided to accept or reject an option. At the end of the experiment, a trial was randomly selected from each decision-making task. If the selected option was accepted, the outcome (gain or loss) depended on successful effort execution for the effortful task or losing probability for the risky task. Otherwise, if the selected option was rejected, participants would not get or lose any reward.


Fig. 1.
Experimental design of study 1 and study 2. Schematic design of the one-option effortbased (a) and risky decision-making tasks (b) used in study 1. Each trial included three components: a potential gain, a potential loss, and a cost (effort or risk depending on the task type). In study 2, prior to scanning, participants were asked to complete an effort-calibration task (c), a cue-effort association training (d), and a task to estimate indifference points for all combinations of rewards and effort levels (e). Participants also had to complete a cue-risk association training and an IDP task for risk (i.e., effort was replaced with risk in d and e). For effort-based (f) and risky decision-making (g) conducted in the scanner, the amount of the smaller reward was determined by the indifference point of the large-reward option (as determined in the IDP task shown in e) and a proximity value ( = • (1 + )).
The second study, which aimed to conceptually replicate the findings from study 1, was largely similar to the above described setup. On issue in in study 1 was that participants accepted more effortful options than risky options, which may reflect different decision difficulties in effort-based and risky decision-making. To maintain similar overall acceptance rates between tasks and to explicitly control the effects of decision difficulty on value processing, we therefore increased the overall effort requirements in study 2 (0.50-0.95 MVC). Moreover, in addition to the effort calibration ( 
Fig. 1c
) and cue-cost association training ( 
Fig. 1d
) tasks, we conducted another pre-scanning task ( 
Fig. 1e
) to estimate participant-specific indifference points for different combinations of rewards and costs (i.e., effort or risk) using a stepwise titration manner 
(Westbrook et al., 2013
(Westbrook et al., , 2019
) (see Supplementary Methods and 
Fig. S1
 for details).
For the effort-based (N = 30; 
Fig. 1f
) and risky (N = 31; 
Fig. 1g
) decision-making tasks conducted within the scanner, we manipulated the amounts of smaller rewards around these indifference points. Specifically, each trial included two options, one associated with a larger reward and a certain effort or risk level, and another with a smaller reward but no cost. The amount of the smaller reward was varied around the indifference point of the large-reward option based on a proximity parameter (i.e., = • (1 + )). The proximity parameter specified the subjective value difference between two options. For example, a small absolute proximity value means that the subjective values of two options are close to each other, which leads to a difficult decision in this trial, and vice versa. At the end of the experiment, ten trials were randomly selected for each task outside the scanner. For effort-based decision-making, participants had to exert the effort requirement to obtain the corresponding reward. For risky decision-making, the computer decided if they would get the reward based on the losing probability of the chosen option.

Behavioral and modeling results. In study 1, (a) participants accepted less effortful and risky options when cost levels increased. (b) Discounting curves based on the two-parameter power function with mean parameter values showed that effort and risk had distinct effects on prospective outcomes. Shaded regions represent 95% highest density interval (HDI) of the mean fitted line. In study 2, (c) pre-scanning tasks showed that participants' normalized indifference points (i.e., indifference point/large reward) decreased when effort or risk cost was high. (d) For effort-based and risky decision-making conducted in the scanner, the overall high-cost option acceptance rate was around 50% for both tasks. Moreover, the probability of choosing a highcost option was influenced by the proximity value. (e) Similar to study 1, the effort discounting curve has a more concave shape compared with that of risk. The difference was more significant in study 2 because we increased the overall effort requirement in this study.


Effects of effort and risk on choices
We first conducted two one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to examine general effects of effort and risk on choices, respectively. In study 1, results ( 
Fig. 2a)
 


Behavioral modeling of effort-and risk-related value integration
To precisely quantify how participants integrate effort and potential outcomes to calculate the subjective value of an option on a trial-by-trial basis, we examined a range of computational models (see Materials and Methods). These included five functions that have been used to characterize the discounting effects of effort (i.e., linear, hyperbolic, parabolic, twoparameter power, and sigmoidal functions) 
(Aridan et al., 2019;
Arulpragasam et al., 2018;
Chong et al., 2017;
Klein-Flügge et al., 2015;
Prévost et al., 2010)
, as well as two approaches to characterize prospective outcomes (objective amount and utility function; 
Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)
. The probability of choosing the effortful option was calculated using a softmax function.
Models were fitted under a hierarchical Bayesian framework 
(Ahn et al., 2017)
. A model comparison was conducted based on leave-one-out information criterion (LOOIC), which is a Bayesian criterion to evaluate the out-of-sample predictive performance of a model 
(Vehtari et al., 2017)
. A lower LOOIC indicates a better fit between the model and data. Model weight was also calculated using Bayesian model averaging based on Bayesian bootstrapping, with a higher weight indicating a higher probability of a model to have generated the data 
(Yao et al., 2018)
.
Since the use of the utility function compared to objective amounts improved the model fit, we will focus on models with the utility function as the outcome (model comparison results for models based on objective outcomes are shown in 
Table S2
). The leave-one-out information criterion (LOOIC) is a Bayesian criterion to evaluate the out-ofsample predictive performance of a model, with a lower value indicating a better fit. Here we used the winning model as the reference and calculated ΔLOOIC compared to other models. Model weight was calculated using Bayesian model averaging based on Bayesian bootstrapping.
CPT: cumulative prospect theory.
For effort-based decision-making in study 1, model comparison results 
(Table 1)
 showed that choice behavior was best described by a model based on the two-parameter power function:
= − • "
(1)
where SV is subjective value, OC is prospective outcome, k and p are two free parameters, which reflect the discounting rate and cost sensitivity (i.e., effort in this case), respectively. Compared with one-parameter discounting functions (k as the only free parameter), such as linear and parabolic functions, the two-parameter power function can produce a larger range of discounting curves 
(Arulpragasam et al., 2018)
. Importantly, although the effortful task used in study 2 had a different structure (e.g., two options and no losses involved), model comparisons showed that the two-parameter power discounting model also fit the data best. Together, these results suggest that the two-parameter power discounting model can best characterize the profile of effort discounting among the model space, which may help resolve the ongoing debate on the computational mechanisms of effort-reward integration 
(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;
Chong et al., 2017;
Klein-Flügge et al., 2015;
Prévost et al., 2010)
.
Regarding risky decision-making tasks, in addition to the ten candidate models sketched above, we added a model based on cumulative prospect theory (CPT) 
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1992)
 to the model space. Crucially, however, the model based on the two-parameter power function was also the winning model for the risky task in study 1, and the finding was confirmed in study 2. Hence, this pattern of results allows us to compare risky and effort-based decision making in a common computational framework.
Since model comparison only provides insights into the relative performance of the models in the model space, we further examined the validity of the winning model based on separate posterior predictive checks for each task. This analysis suggested that all winning models could generate posterior predictions that captured key features of the data 
(Fig. S2
).
Additionally, we conducted parameter recovery analyses for the winning model for each task.
The results showed that all group-and individual-level parameters could be accurately recaptured ( 
Fig. S3-S4
). k and p are two free parameters of the two-parameter power function that control the shape of the discounting curve.
Having established that risky and effortful choices can be reliably captured in our winning model, we next asked whether effort and risk devalue prospective outcomes in a similar fashion. As mentioned above, the two-parameter discounting function can produce a wide range of discounting curves. Although it is the winning model for both effort-based and risky decisionmaking, it is still possible that effort and risk have distinct discounting effects on prospective outcomes. To directly test this question, we compared four variants of the two-parameter power model with either the same or separate and for the effortful and risky task, that is, the two parameters that determine the shape of the discounting curve. We found that the model with separate and showed the best fit in both studies 
(Table 2)
. Specifically, compared with risk, effort showed smaller discounting effects on outcomes when costs were low but larger devaluations when costs were high (i.e., more concave shape; 
Fig. 2b
 and 
Fig. 2e
). 


Univariate neural correlates of subjective value
To examine the neural correlates of subjective value during risky and effortful decision making, we next analyzed fMRI data using model-based trial-by-trial subjective values from the winning model of each task. We split trials based on the median subjective value and focused on the contrast of high versus low values in most analyses. We first used univariate general linear model (GLM) analyses to replicate previous findings 
(Aridan et al., 2019;
Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021)
. Based on the findings from a previous meta-analysis on effort-based value integration (Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021), we restricted our analyses within a frontostriatal mask (see Materials and Methods). Since we are particularly interested in the roles of the vmPFC and dmPFC, we extracted the mean effects from 6-radius spherical masks centered at the peak coordinates if there were significant clusters in these two regions. We used the independent coordinates (vmPFC coordinate: 0, 40, -4; dmPFC: 0, 22, 38) from an independent study 
(Piva et al., 2019)
 to extract effects if there were no significant clusters in the vmPFC or dmPFC.
For effort-based decision-making ( 
Fig. 3
 and 
Table S3
), we found that dmPFC activity was negatively associated with subjective value magnitude in both studies ( 
Fig. 3a
 and 
Fig. 3c
).
Conversely, vmPFC activity was positively associated with subjective value in study 1, but this effect was not significant in study 2 (t(30) = -0.10, p = 0.90, Cohen's d = -0.02).
For risky decision-making ( 
Fig. 3
 and 
Table S3
), vmPFC activity was positively associated with subjective value in study 1 
(Fig. 3b
). This effect was not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons in study 2 (t(30) = 1.81, p = 0.08, Cohen's d = 0.32).
Instead, we observed significant positive correlates of subjective value in a cluster located around the rostral ACC ( 
Fig. 3d
). We did not find significant results in the dmPFC in both studies (study 1: t(37) = 0.77, p = 0.44, Cohen's d = 0.13; study 2: t(30) = -1.85, p = 0.08,
Cohen's d = -0.33).


Multivariate neural representations of subjective value within effort-and risk-based tasks
Since the univariate approach does not take dependencies between voxels into account, it may be less sensitive to detecting value-related signal in heterogeneous brain regions 
(Kahnt, 2018)
. To deal with this issue, we conducted searchlight multivariate decoding analyses within the same frontostriatal mask used in the univariate analyses. This MVPA approach examines patterns of neural activity across voxels and is thus suitable to detect distributed coding of subjective value 
(Jimura & Poldrack, 2012)
. Moreover, unlike univariate analysis that focuses on positive effects, multivariate decoding analyses take both activity increases and decreases into account and yield (unsigned) decoding accuracy 
(Haynes et al., 2015)
.
As shown in 
Fig. 4
 and 
Table 3
, for effort-based decision-making, we found that subjective value information could be accurately decoded from a large cluster including both the vmPFC and dmPFC in study 1 
(Fig. 4a
). Additionally, we found that activity of the dmPFC also represented subjective value in study 2 ( 
Fig. 4c
), but the effect was not significant in the vmPFC (t(30) = 1.36, p = 0.18, Cohen's d = 0.24). Within-task multivariate decoding results are corrected for multiple comparison using a voxelwise uncorrected threshold of p < 0.001 and a FWE cluster-level corrected threshold of p < 0.05.
For large clusters (i.e., voxel size > 2000), another three peak coordinates inside the cluster were reported. For exploratory purposes, cross-task multivariate decoding results are corrected using a voxel-wise threshold of p < 0.005 and a FWE cluster-level corrected threshold of p < 0.05.
1 Clusters only significant when using a voxel-wise uncorrected threshold of p < 0.005 and a FWE cluster-level corrected threshold of p < 0.05.
dmPFC: dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; dlPFC: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; vmPFC: ventromedial prefrontal cortex; OFC: orbitofrontal cortex.
Similarly, for risky decision-making, subjective value information could be decoded in a large cluster including the vmPFC and dmPFC in study 1 
(Fig. 4b)
.
In study 2, we found that activity pattern of the vmPFC and dmPFC also represented subjective value information ( 
Fig.   4d
), although clusters were smaller than those identified in study 1.
The dmPFC has also been closely related to decision difficulty in other studies 
(Hogan et al., 2019;
Shenhav et al., 2016;
Westbrook et al., 2019)
. In study 2, we therefore orthogonally manipulated subjective value and decision difficulty, which allowed us to test if the neural patterns of the dmPFC reported above were specific to subjective value. We split trials into highand low-difficulty conditions for each decision-making task in study 2 (see Materials and Methods). Notably, subjective value information could still be decoded in the dmPFC at a voxellevel uncorrected threshold of p < 0.005 in both conditions of each task 
(Table S4
). 


Cross-task subjective value encoding in the dmPFC
The within-task multivariate decoding analyses described above detected subjective value information in the dmPFC during both effort-based and risky decision-making. However, it is still unclear if the dmPFC employs unique subjective value codes in different tasks, or encodes value information in a task-independent manner as suggested by the common currency theory 
(Kahnt, 2018)
. To directly test this idea, we utilized a cross-task multivariate decoding approach by training the classifier based on data from one task and testing its performance in decoding value magnitude in another task 
(Table 3)
. If the decoding accuracy of a brain regions is significantly above chance level, it suggests that the neural patterns of this region represent subjective value in a similar fashion across effort-based and risky decision-making. Strikingly, we found that the anterior part of the dmPFC contained subjective value information independent of task type in study 1. The cluster extended into the vmPFC when using a more lenient voxellevel threshold of p < 0.005. In study 2, task-independent value information was mainly represented in the posterior dmPFC, but not the vmPFC (t(30) = -0.92, p = 0.37, Cohen's d = -0.16). Importantly, although the significant clusters from the two studies did not perfectly overlap, the above-chance decoding maps converged in a cluster in the dmPFC 
(Fig. 5c
) at an uncorrected voxel-level threshold of p < 0.005. These findings thus provide support to the common currency theory and highlight the critical role of the dmPFC in subjective value representation across tasks and datasets. 


Discussion
We used behavioral modeling combined with univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses to examine the neural and computational mechanisms underlying effort-based and risky decision-making. We found that effort-and risk-related costs showed distinct discounting effects on potential outcomes when calculating subjective values. At the neural level, although the univariate analyses yielded divergent results between tasks, the multivariate decoding analyses showed that the dmPFC represented subjective value information in a task-independent manner.
These findings further elucidate the neural response patterns within the medial prefrontal cortex during value integration and suggest that the dmPFC may serve as a potential hub in subjective value computations independent of the cost types involved in decision-making.
Previous behavioral modeling studies have used different discounting functions to describe the way that effort devalues prospective outcomes, yet yielded mixed results, possibly because they have relied on different model spaces 
(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;
Chong et al., 2017;
Klein-Flügge et al., 2015;
Prévost et al., 2010
). In the current study, we compared a large range of winning models of previous research, and found that the two-parameter power discounting model showed a superior fit to effort-based decision-making in both studies compared with alternative models. A key feature of this model is that, except for the discountingrate parameter k, it includes another free parameter p to characterize effort sensitivity for each subject. Hence, this model could flexibly generate a wide range of discounting curve shapes to account for individual differences in effort valuation 
(Arulpragasam et al., 2018)
. Importantly, risky choices were also best described by the two-parameter power discounting model, which thus allowed us to compare effort-based and risky decision making in a common computational framework. In follow-up analyses, we further compared models with same or separate k and p for effort-based and risky decision-making and found that the model with separate k and p provided best fit in both studies. These analyses showed that, compared with risk, effort devalued outcomes to a lesser extent when costs were low, but showed larger discounting effects when costs were high. Thus, contrary to previous assumptions that effort and risk discount reward in a similar fashion 
(Burke et al., 2013;
Prévost et al., 2010)
, our findings support the view that these two types of costs have distinct discounting effects on prospective outcomes 
(Apps et al., 2015
).
There has also been considerable debate over the exact role of the dmPFC, particularly the dACC area, in effort-reward integration 
(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;
Chong et al., 2017;
Hogan et al., 2019;
Klein-Flügge et al., 2016;
Massar et al., 2015;
Westbrook et al., 2019)
.
Although animal studies showed that lesions to the dACC could profoundly alter effort-related valuation 
(Rudebeck et al., 2008;
Walton et al., 2009)
, fMRI studies in humans yielded rather divergent results 
(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;
Chong et al., 2017;
Hogan et al., 2019;
Klein-Flügge et al., 2016)
. One potential explanation is that the association between dmPFC activity and subjective value is often negative when using univariate analyses 
(Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021)
, which might have been overlooked by studies focusing on positive neural correlates.
Moreover, neural activity within the dmPFC is highly heterogeneous 
(Neubert et al., 2015)
, which may cause the results to be undetectable when voxels within this region are treated as homogenous.
Therefore, one important advantage of the current study is that we utilized both univariate
and multivariate analysis approaches and tested the results in two independent studies. Indeed, at the univariate level, we observed negative correlates of subjective value in the dmPFC during effort-based decision-making. When using within-task multivariate decoding analyses, we found that the neural patterns of the dmPFC could be used to decode effort-related value information in both studies. These MVPA findings thus bridge the gap between previous findings based on univariate fMRI analyses 
(Chong et al., 2017;
Hogan et al., 2019;
Klein-Flügge et al., 2016;
Massar et al., 2015;
Seaman et al., 2018)
 and animal lesion studies 
(Rudebeck et al., 2008;
Walton et al., 2009)
. Moreover, despite diverse univariate results in the dmPFC during two risky decision-making tasks, multivariate analyses suggested that the neural patterns of this region represent subjective value information. These results are in keeping with a previous study based on intertemporal decision-making 
(Wang et al., 2014)
, in which MVPA yielded value codes in the dmPFC even in the absence of univariate effects. Taken together, these findings suggest that the dmPFC could represent subjective value based on distributed neural coding that may be beyond the detectability of univariate analyses.
A question that follows from these considerations is thus whether the dmPFC or other brain regions are involved in value encoding in a task-independent manner. To address this issue, we performed a more stringent cross-task decoding analysis by training the classifier on data from one task and testing its performance on data from another task. Strikingly, this yielded significant decoding of subjective value in the dmPFC, which was consistent across two independent studies, suggesting that subjective value information represented in the dmPFC might generalize across cost types and datasets. Although there is only limited evidence on value encoding across different forms of decision-making, our findings align closely with previous MVPA studies showing subjective value signals in the dmPFC across different decision-making tasks or reward categories 
(Gross et al., 2014;
Piva et al., 2019;
Pogoda et al., 2016)
. Therefore, these findings provide new insights into the common currency theory proposing that values of different options are converted into a single scale at the neural level to allow efficient value comparison 
(Levy & Glimcher, 2012)
. Most previous studies focused on the role of the vmPFC in this process 
(Bartra et al., 2013;
Clithero & Rangel, 2013;
Levy & Glimcher, 2012;
Peters & Büchel, 2009
). Our cross-task MVPA findings suggest that the scope of this neural system is broader and that the dmPFC may also be critically involved in calculating subjective value regardless of cost types.
As mentioned above, the vmPFC has been regarded as a potential hub for taskindependent subjective value representation during decision-making 
(Levy & Glimcher, 2012)
, since a plethora of research has demonstrated neural correlates of value in this region across different reward types and valuation stages 
(Bartra et al., 2013;
Clithero & Rangel, 2013;
Kahnt et al., 2014;
Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021;
Sescousse et al., 2013)
. Indeed, both univariate and multivariate analyses identified neural correlates of subjective value in the vmPFC in two tasks of study 1. However, most analyses, except for multivariate decoding for risky decision-making, did not identified significant value signals in the vmPFC in study 2. These inconsistent results may be related to the differences in the experimental design, since participants could focus on computing the value of the single option in study 1, but may have relied on additional cognitive processes (e.g., attention distribution) in study 2 which represented two options simultaneously in each trial 
(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;
Westbrook et al., 2019)
. Another study using a similar two-option choice paradigm also failed to decode subjective value from the neural patterns of the vmPFC 
(Piva et al., 2019)
. However, further research is needed to test this speculation.
Moreover, the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal around the vmPFC is likely to be affected by susceptibility gradients, and these influences could be reduced by changing the scanning orientation 
(Deichmann et al., 2003)
, as implemented in study 1. A potential limitation of study 2 is that it did not use the optimized orientation when collecting functional images.
Future studies on valuation processes related to vmPFC activity should thus consider changing the imaging slice orientation to reduce related signal dropout.
In summary, using a combination of computational modeling and multiple fMRI analyses, our study indicates that effort and risk costs have different discounting effects on prospective outcomes. At the neural level, the activity patterns of the dmPFC could represent subjective value across effort-based and risky decision-making, and the results are robust across two independent studies. Overall, the work we present here advances our understanding of the neural and computational mechanisms underlying effort-related value integration and suggests that the dmPFC emerges as a potential hub that utilizes a task-independent mechanism for computing subjective value.


Materials and Methods


Study 1


Participants
We used the behavioral and fMRI data of the effort-based and risky decision-making tasks from the study of 
Aridan et al. (2019)
, in which the details of the participants were reported. Briefly, forty (twenty-one female) healthy, right-handed participants were enrolled in this study. One participant was excluded from the effortful task because they showed significant gain-aversive and loss-seeking behavior. Data from two participants were excluded because they showed extreme choice behaviors (i.e., accepted or rejected more than 90% of gambles) during the risky task. Therefore, the final dataset included 39 and 38 participants for effort-based and risky decision-making, respectively. The experiment was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the University of Texas at Austin, and all participants provided written informed consent prior to the experiment.


Experimental paradigm
Both decision-making tasks were based on a one-option mixed-gamble paradigm. For effort-based decision-making ( 
Fig. 1a)
, each gamble included three components: a potential gain ($2-$12, in $2 increments), a potential loss ($1-$6, in $1 increments), and a physical effort requirement 
(30,
40,
50,
60,
and 70% MVC)
. Participants were asked whether they would like to accept a gamble by indicating one of the four responses (strongly accept, weakly accept, weakly reject, and strongly reject), which were collapsed into accept and reject categories in subsequent analyses. Each task included 180 trials based on the unique combination of these three components. The task was split into five runs, with 36 trials each. Participants were instructed that they did not need to execute the required effort during the task. Instead, a trial would be randomly picked at the end of the task. If it was accepted, participants had to squeeze a dynamometer to reach the corresponding effort requirement. The outcome (gain or loss) was determined by their successful effort performance. If the gamble was rejected, participants would not receive any outcome from this task.
The risky decision-making task had a similar task structure 
(Fig. 1b)
, except that the effort requirement was replaced by the winning probability 
(90, 70, 50, 30, and 10%)
. Again, a trial was randomly picked at the end, and the outcome was based on their choice (accept or reject) and winning probability.


MRI data acquisition
The neuroimaging data are openly available at https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003782.
They were collected on a 3T Siemens Skyra MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).
Scanning parameters were reported in 
Aridan et al. (2019)
. Briefly, functional images were collected with a T2 * -weighted multiband echo-planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence (TR = 1000 ms, multiband acceleration factor = 4, iPAT parallel acceleration factor = 2, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 63°, FOV = 230, voxel size = 2.4 × 2.4 × 2.4 mm, 56 slices). These data were acquired at an angle of 30° off the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line to reduce signal dropout in the orbitofrontal region 
(Deichmann et al., 2003)
. A high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical image was collected using a MPRAGE pulse sequence (TR = 1900 ms, TE = 2.43 ms, flip angle = 9°, FOV = 256, voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm).


Study 2


Participants
Thirty-six (twenty female) healthy, right-handed participants were enrolled in this study.
All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, fulfilled all eligibility criteria for participating in an fMRI study, and reported no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders.
Five participants were excluded from the subsequent experiment because of extreme choice behaviors (i.e., accepted or rejected more than 90% of effortful or risky options) during the prescanning tests. Another participant was excluded from the effortful task during scanning because they showed significant gain-aversive and loss-seeking behavior. Therefore, the final dataset 


Experimental paradigm
For effort-based decision-making, participants were required to complete three tasks outside the scanner: First, a calibration task 
(Fig. 1c
) was conducted to measure participants' MVC. Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamometer (Vernier HD-BTA, Beaverton, USA)
using their right hand as hard as possible for 6s, followed by a rest period of 5s. This procedure was repeated five times, and the MVC was defined as the averaged force above the median point over the last half of the squeezing period across these five trials 
(Meyniel et al., 2016)
. Second, participants were trained to remember four associations between effort level cues (level 1-4) and physical effort requirements (50, 65, 80, 95% MVC), because the effort level cues would be used in the subsequent effort-based decision-making task. In each trial, participants were presented an effort level cue. Subsequently, they were shown a thermometer, with the yellow line as the required force level and the height of the red filling as the real-time squeezing force 
(Fig. 1d
). To complete a trial, participants were required to keep the red filling above the yellow line for a total of 6s. Each association was repeated twice, yielding eight trials. Third, participants made a series of choices to estimate indifference points based on a previously validated procedure 
(Westbrook et al., 2013)
. In each trial, participants were asked to choose between an option associated with a larger reward (€2, 3, or 4) and an effort requirement (level 1-4) and an alternative with a smaller reward but no effort requirement. The amount of the smaller reward was changed in a stepwise titration manner (over 6 choices for each unique combination of the effort and larger reward) until the two options were indifferent to participants (see Supplementary Materials for details).
After the three pre-scanning tasks, another effort-based decision-making task was conducted in the scanner, which is the focus of this paper. Participants were asked to complete a similar decision-making task as used in the third phase 
(Fig. 1f)
. To control the overall acceptance rate of effortful options and ensure sufficient variability in choice behaviors, we varied the amount of the smaller reward (SR) around the indifference point (IDP) of the corresponding larger-reward option using a proximity parameter γ 
(Westbrook et al., 2019)
:
= • (1 + )
(2)
Therefore, the absolute value of γ specified the subjective value difference between two options. A positive value indicated that the effortless option was favored, and vice versa. Each run of the task included 48 slightly biased trials (unique combination of proximity parameter value from {-0.4, -0.1, 0.2, 0.5}, effort requirement, and large reward) and eight strongly biased trials (unique combination of proximity parameter value from {-0.8, 0.8} and effort requirement, randomly paired with a large reward). Please note that the amount of the smaller reward would not exceed that of the larger reward. This task included three runs and a total of 168 trials. In each trial, to isolate the motor component from the valuation process, participants were presented two options for 2s (evaluation period) first before getting the notice to make a choice within 2s (action period). A 2-4s interval was used between trials (ITI). At the end of the task (outside of the scanner), ten trials were randomly selected. If participants chose the effortful option, they could only get the rewards after exerting the required effort by squeezing the dynamometer.
The risky decision-making part was implemented in a similar procedure 
(Fig. 1g)
, except that the calibration task was not required, and that four risk levels were associated with four winning probabilities (90, 70, 50, 30%). The risky decision-making task (168 trials) of the last phase was conducted in the scanner. Again, ten trials were randomly selected at the end of the task outside the scanner. Participants were shown the outcome of each trial generated by the computer based on the winning probability. The order of the effort-based and risky decisionmaking tasks was counterbalanced across participants.


MRI data acquisition
MRI data were acquired using a 3T Siemens Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).
Functional images were collected with a T2 * -weighted EPI pulse sequence (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 25 ms, flip angle = 85°, FOV = 220, voxel size = 3.4 × 3.4 × 4.0 mm, 34 slices). A highresolution T1-weighted anatomical image was collected using a MPRAGE pulse sequence (TR = 2530 ms, TE = 3.39 ms, flip angle = 7°, FOV = 256, voxel size = 1.3 × 1.0 × 1.3 mm, 144 slices).


MRI data preprocessing
MRI data of both datasets were preprocessed using SPM12 (version 7177;
https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) and DPABI 
(Yan et al., 2016)
 in MATLAB 2019b (The MathWorks inc., Natick, MA; http://www.mathworks.com/). Functional images were corrected for motion through realignment with respect to the first volume. Both functional and anatomical images were manually checked and reoriented based on the AC-PC line before they were co-registered. The anatomical images were then segmented to gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. Finally, functional images were normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with 6-mm full-widthhalf-maximum (FWHM). Participants who showed excessive head motion (i.e., > 3 mm of displacement or 3° of rotation in any of the six head motion parameters from realignment) in more than two runs of a task were excluded from subsequent analyses.


Computational modeling of choice behaviors
Behavioral data were analyzed using R (version 4.1.2; https://cran.r-project.org/). We used five different discounting functions to characterize the way that a prospective outcome is devalued by a cost. These models have previously been used in effort-based decision-making studies 
(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;
Chong et al., 2017;
Klein-Flügge et al., 2015;
Prévost et al., 2010)
. Except for the two-parameter power function described above, other discounting functions were defined as follows:
Linear: = − •
(3)
Hyperbolic:
= • # #$%•'()*
(4)
Parabolic:
= − • !
(5)
Sigmoidal:
= • @1 − A # #$+ !"•$%&'!'( − # #$+ "•'( B • A1 + # + "•'( BC (6)
where k is a free parameter, which reflects the discounting rate. The sigmoidal function has another free parameter tp, which is the turning point of the curve 
(Klein-Flügge et al., 2015)
.
Cost denotes the objective effort requirement (e.g., 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 for dataset 1) or losing probability (i.e., 1 -winning probability). OC denotes the outcome. For study 1, it is defined as eq. 7, where λ reflects the relative weighting of losses and gains. For study 2, since options are not associated with potential losses, OC equals the potential gain value.
= − •
(7)
We have also calculated OC based on utilities 
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)
, in which the α parameter is used to yield a concave value function for gains and a convex value function for losses:
= , − • ,
(8)
For risky decision-making, we included an additional model based on CPT 
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1992)
, which has been widely used in previous studies in this field 
(Nilsson et al., 2011;
Pachur et al., 2017)
:
= , • $ ( ) − • , • -( )
(9)
The weighting functions for gains and losses ( $ and -) are defined as:
$ ( ) = . ) •" * . ) •" * $(#-") * -( ) = . ! •1 * . ! •1 * $(#-1) *
(10)
The parameter controls the curvature of the weighting function. The parameters $ and control the elevation of the weighting function for gains and losses, respectively 
(Pachur et al., 2017)
. For study 2, only the part related to gains was used.
The softmax function was used to calculate the probability of choosing the effortful or risky option:
( ) = + +•,-(/) + +•,-(/) $+ +•,-(1/)
(11)
where ( ) is the choice probability for the costly (i.e., effortful or risky) option. denotes the stochasticity of a participant's choice. ( ) represents the SV of the costly option with a cost.
( ) is always 0 for study 1 and the amount of the smaller reward for study 2.
All models were fitted and evaluated using a hierarchical Bayesian approach by following the template used in the hBayesDM package 
(Ahn et al., 2017)
. Because this method not only estimates parameters for each participant but also includes a group-level hyperparameter distribution that governs the individual-level parameters, it is less sensitive to outliers and can generate more robust estimates 
(Huys et al., 2011;
Lockwood & Klein-Flügge, 2021)
. The parameter estimation was conducted using Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling implemented in Stan (version 2.21; https://mc-stan.org/). We used four chains, each with 3000 MCMC samples including a burn-in period of 1000 samples. To determine which model fit the data best, we used the loo package (version 2.4.1; https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/loo/) to perform a model comparison based on LOOIC 
(Vehtari et al., 2017)
 and model weight calculated using Bayesian model averaging based on Bayesian bootstrapping 
(Yao et al., 2018)
.
Finally, to assess the validity of the winning model, we further conducted posterior predictive checks and checked if the posterior prediction from the model could capture key features of the behavioral data 
(Zhang et al., 2020)
. Moreover, we performed parameter recovery analyses to examine if the parameters of the winning model could be accurately identified 
(Wilson & Collins, 2019)
.


fMRI data analysis


Univariate analysis
To conduct the model-based fMRI data analysis, we first derived the subjective value of each gamble based on the winning model. For study 1, we focused on the choice period. Two general linear models (GLM1.1 and GLM1.2) were used to examine the neural activity related to the subjective value of each option during effort-based and risky decision-making, respectively.
These models included two regressors using a stick function: high-and low-value trials, which were split based on the median subjective value. We added the contrast of high-vs. low-value at the first level. Moreover, another two GLMs (GLM1.3 and GLM1.4 for the effort-based and risky decision-making task, respectively) similar to the ones used in the original study were also conducted for confirmation 
(Aridan et al., 2019)
. These models included a regressor of the choice period of all trials and trial-by-trial subjective values as a parametric modulator. We focused on the effect of this parametric modulator at the first level.
In study 2, to isolate the effects of motor action on valuation, we divided each choice into evaluation and action periods. In subsequent analyses, we focused on the evaluation period and included the action period as a separate regressor of no interest. Because there are two options in each trial, we derived the subjective value of the chosen option from the winning model, consistent with other two-option decision-making studies 
(Arulpragasam et al., 2018;
Hogan et al., 2019)
. We repeated the analyses used for study 1, but split trials based on the median chosen subjective value for GLM2.1 and GLM2.2. In another two control GLMs (GLM2.3 and GLM2.4), we used the subjective value difference (i.e., chosen -unchosen value) of each trial as the parametric modulator for effort-based and risky decision-making, respectively.
In all GLMs, trials without any responses were modeled as a separate nuisance regressor.
Moreover, six motion parameters from the realignment were included as regressors of no interest. Contrasts from the first-level analyses were taken to group-level random-effects analyses. Voxelwise analyses were conducted within a frontostriatal mask, including Brodmann area (BA) 9, 10, 11, 23, 32 and bilateral nucleus accumbens, caudate, and putamen from the Harvard-Oxford structural atlas, which covered most potential regions within the valuation network 
(Bartra et al., 2013;
Clithero & Rangel, 2013;
Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021)
 and excluded most sensory and motor areas. Statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using a voxel-level uncorrected threshold of p < 0.001 and a FWE cluster-level corrected at p < 0.05 by the means of Gaussian Random Field Theory (GRFT). Since we are particularly interested in the roles of the vmPFC and dmPFC in cost-reward integration, for significant results in these two regions, we extracted the mean effects from 6-mm-radius spherical masks centered at the peak coordinates. If no significant results were detected in these regions, we used the peak coordinates (vmPFC: 0, 40, -4; dmPFC: 0, 22, 38) from a previous study 
(Piva et al., 2019)
 to create spherical masks to comprehensively illustrate their effects in each analysis.


Multivariate decoding analysis
Multivariate decoding analyses were performed using a linear support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for binary classification implemented in The Decoding Toolbox 
(TDT, v 3.999E;
Hebart et al., 2015)
. In study 1, we repeated the above mentioned first-level analyses on unsmoothed data and used the beta images from the choice period of GLM1.1 and GLM1.2 to examine neural representations of subjective value during effort-based and risky decisionmaking, respectively. For each task, a five-fold cross-run validation was used, in which the SVM was trained on all but one run and tested on the left-out run. We utilized the searchlight analysis (radius = 3 voxels) within the frontostriatal mask used in univariate analyses above. Voxelwise cross-validated decoding accuracy (minus chance-level accuracy) was calculated.
To examine subjective value representations independent of cost types, we further conducted a cross-task decoding analysis, which included the beta images from both GLM1.1 and GLM1.2. The SVM was trained on four runs of one task (e.g., run 1-4 of the effort-based decision-making task) and tested on one run of the other task (e.g., run 5 of the risky decisionmaking task), and the procedure was repeated ten times.
For study 2, because both decision-making tasks only included three runs, each run was divided into two halves (i.e., six datasets for each task) to increase the number of datasets used for the decoding analyses 
(Jimura & Poldrack, 2012)
. GLM2.1 and GLM2.2 were performed on unsmoothed data, and beta images from the evaluation period were used for searchlight decoding analyses for each task. Moreover, to ensure that the results were driven by subjective value but not decision difficulty, we repeated the decoding analyses for chosen subjective value magnitude using high-(i.e., |γ| <= 0.2) and low-difficulty (|γ| > 0.2) trials in each task. Finally, the cross-task decoding analysis was conducted as described above in study 1.
Within-task decoding results were corrected for multiple comparison using a voxel-level uncorrected threshold of p < 0.001 and a FWE cluster-level corrected p < 0.05. For exploratory purposes, cross-task decoding analyses and other control analyses were corrected using a lenient threshold of voxel-level p < 0.005 and a FWE cluster-level corrected p < 0.05. Similar to the univariate analyses, we extracted the mean decoding accuracy from the vmPFC and dmPFC spherical masks, respectively. It should be noted that these ROI results reflect post-hoc signal extractions from the searchlight analyses but not a priori ROI-wise MVPA.

. An example of the stepwise titration procedure used to estimate indifference points.
After five iterations, the two options should have similar subjective values. Because the smallreward option is associated with no cost, its amount can be used as subjective value of the corresponding large-reward option.  . Parameter recovery for study 1. We simulated 200 sets of parameters (i.e., ground-truth parameters) by randomly sampling from the posterior distribution of each parameter of the winning model. Next, we simulated choice data based on the winning model using each set of parameters. We then fitted the winning model to the simulated choice data and obtained the posterior distribution for each parameter (i.e., recovered parameters). The results showed that, at the group level, for effort-based (a) and risky decision-making (c), the black lines (i.e., means of the true parameters) were located within the posterior distributions of simulated parameters. At the individual level, those parameters can also be accurately recovered 
(b, d)
. and are two parameters that control the discounting curve, is the parameter used to calculate utility, is the relative weight of losses compared with gains, and is the noise parameter of the softmax function.

Since no potential losses were used in both tasks in study 2, the two-parameter discounting model has four free parameters.

 The leave-one-out-cross-validation-information criterion (LOOIC) is a Bayesian criterion to evaluate the out-of-sample predictive performance of a model, with a lower value indicating a better fit. We used the winning model as the reference and calculated ΔLOOIC compared to other models. Model weight was calculated using Bayesian model averaging based on Bayesian bootstrapping. Results are corrected for multiple comparison using a voxel-wise uncorrected threshold of p < 0.001 and a FWE cluster-level corrected threshold of p < 0.05.

included 30 and 31 participants for effort-based and risky decision-making, respectively. After the experiment, participants received financial compensation based on their participation time and randomly selected chosen options from decision-making tasks. The experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Education and Psychology, Freie Universität Berlin, and all participants provided written informed consent prior to the experiment.

Model validation with posterior predictive checks (PPCs). For study 1, predicted acceptance rates of five cost levels were plotted as a function of acceptance rates of five cost levels in the data. The line was used as a reference for perfect predictions. Winning models for effort-based (a) and risky decision-making (b) can both accurately predict the proportion of choosing high-cost options at different cost level in the data. For study 2, predicted acceptance rates of six proximity levels (i.e., : − 0.8, −0.4, −0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8) were plotted as a function of acceptance rates of six proximity levels in the data. Although some predictions slightly deviate from the reference line, winning models for effort-based (c) and risky decision-making (d) can also predict the general pattern that the data. Error bars represent the 95% highest density interval (HDI) of the mean effects.

Supplementary Methods


Procedure to estimate indifference points
We used a stepwise titration method to estimate indifference points for each participant.
The stepwise titration method was inspired by adjusting-immediate-amount methods 
(Holt, Green, & Myerson, 2012)
 and has been validated in previous studies 
(Westbrook et al., 2013
(Westbrook et al., , 2019
. Taking effort-based decision-making as an example, participants faced a series of choices between an option with a larger reward and an effort requirement, and an alternative with smaller reward but no effort requirement. For a specific combination of a larger reward (e.g., 2.00 credits) and an effort requirement (e.g., level 3), the amount of the smaller reward started from the half of its amount (1.00 credit in this case):
where 2 is the initial small reward amount, and is the corresponding larger reward.
If the large-reward option is selected by the participant, the amount of the small reward increases in the next iteration; in contrast, if the small-reward option is selected, its amount decreases in the next iteration. The rules that determined the amount of the smaller reward were listed as follows:
For example, as shown in 
Fig S1,
 if the larger-reward option is associated with 2 credits and effort level 3, the initial amount of the smaller reward ( 2 ) is 1. If the participant selects the smaller-reward option, the amount of this option will decrease to 0.5 in the first iteration ( # ); in contrast, if the participant rejects the smaller-reward option (i.e., selects the largerreward option), the amount of this option will increase to 1.5 in the first iteration ( # ). After five iterations, the amount of the smaller reward ( 4 ) was close to the subjective value of the larger-reward option.
This procedure was used for all combinations of larger rewards (2, 3, 4 credits) and effort levels (level 1-4), yielding a total of 72 trials. The order of the trials was randomized for each participant. Results are corrected for multiple comparison using a voxel-wise uncorrected threshold of p < 0.005 and a FWE cluster-level corrected p < 0.05.
