You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
In recent times, economic experiments have started to involve young populations, typically within school or high school settings. These experimental studies with nonstandard subject pools 
(Exadaktylos et al., 2013;
Henrich et al., 2010)
, fundamentally address three research questions: i) the emergence of economic preferences 
Carrillo, 2020a, 2020b;
Fehr et al., 2013)
; ii) the exploration of potential relations between these preferences and academic as well as non-academic outcomes ; and iii) the examination of the feasibility of intervening in these preferences in early ages 
(Lührmann et al., 2018)
.
It is important to underscore that experimental studies undertaken with students offer a unique opportunity to gather insights beyond the conventional school metrics. Collecting supplementary data from students contributes to more effective school management and the improvement of educational processes and school environment. For instance, social network studies in schools are useful for launching alcohol and drug prevention programs, among other initiatives 
(Paluck et al., 2016;
Starkey et al., 2009;
Valente et al., 2007)
.
While the body of literature involving children and adolescents has grown rapidly in recent years, the majority of these studies rely on samples drawn from developed nations, namely the United States and Europe. Although there are exceptions 1 , this prevailing trend not only limits our understanding of students in different contexts but, more importantly, hinders the applicability of findings from these settings to environments where such knowledge could be particularly relevant.
An important limitation to transporting experimental tools to developing countries lies in the uncertainty surrounding their utility in more complex socioeconomic contexts. It is well-established that many of these countries are characterized by marked educational gaps, exacerbated by economic constraints and high violence levels that deter school attendance and human capital acquisition 
(Adelman and Szekely, 2016;
Dinarte-Diaz and Egana-delSol, 2023)
.
The primary objective of this paper is precisely to assess the applicability of a tool 1 For example, some studies have measured social preferences among children in El Salvador 
(Bonan et al., 2023)
 and Turkey 
(Alan et al., 2021;
Ugur, 2021)
; competitiveness and risk preferences in Colombia 
(Cárdenas et al., 2012)

Sutter et al. (2019)
 for a detailed review.
initially deployed among 5,000 Spanish students to a cohort of 2,248 Salvadoran students. These tasks were meticulously tailored to adolescents (refer to 
Alfonso et al. (2023a)
). The only difference between the Spanish and Salvadoran versions pertains to a linguistic adaptation process conducted by a local pedagogical team to ensure clarity of language while preserving the integrity of the task illustrations.
To test the applicability of these experimental tools, we focused on two classical experiments: first, a task designed to measure time preferences (as outlined in 
Alfonso et al. (2023a)
), and second, a task intended to measure risk preferences (see 
Vasco and Vazquez (2023)
). Both are very simplified tasks. In each case, students make 6 decisions on a set of vignettes where they have to decide between A and B. The success of the portability of these tasks is measured in terms of the percentage of students who make consistent decisions in the tasks. Inconsistency may arise due to an array of factors, including a lack of understanding of the task or simply lack of attention.
Inconsistency poses a serious challenge; when a student responds inconsistently, it means that their decisions fail to accurately reflect their underlying preferences. The immediate consequence of such inconsistency lies in the loss of data reliability. Consequently, the proportion of students offering inconsistent responses promptly translates into a segment of the sample that is unusable.
The principal findings of this study can be summarized as follows: First, the percentage of students that make inconsistent decisions in either task is nearly half of the cohort. More importantly, only one quarter of the subjects exhibit consistent performance in both tasks. These outcomes bear significant implications concerning sample size reduction. Furthermore, we do not observe distinctive patterns among schools, with all institutions exhibiting comparably poor performance. Notably, there are no substantial gender differences.
Secondly, we delve into the question of whether developmental factors exert influence over the consistency of responses, specifically whether inconsistency diminishes with age. We find that age has a negative and significant impact on risk inconsistencies, but not on time inconsistencies.
Third, we explore the influence of cognitive skills (including reflection, financial analyses, and probability assessment) in the consistency of their decision-making processes. We show that students with higher cognitive abilities are also less likely to exhibit inconsistencies, especially in risk preferences.
Also, taking advantage of the fact that more than one thousand participants had taken part in a second wave, we test whether repeating the tasks a few months later improves consistency. The results are not particularly encouraging. While many become consistent, there is also a percentage who were consistent in the first wave but cease to be in the second.
Lastly, we analyze whether this consistency problem is associated with students' immediate and long-term educational outcomes, namely: performance at school, the expectations to return to school next year, to attend university, and whether they would like to go to university. We find that the inconsistent students have lower school performance, worse expectations, and even less interest in attending university.
After this introduction, the next sections of this paper are organized as follows: the second section describes the data collection procedures, the tasks, the sample composition, and defines the measures that underpin our analytical framework. The third section presents the findings and the fourth section discusses the implications, while the fifth section concludes.
2 Protocol, tasks and dataset


Protocol
The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Universidad Loyola Andalucía and the entire experiment was pre-registered. The project was funded by an international development agency. The experiment was conducted during 2 years in 12 schools located in 5 departments of El Salvador. Subjects were students from middle school (7 th and 8 th grades) and high school (9 th , 10 th , 11 th and 12 th grades). The data was collected in three waves. 2 While the first wave was collected between March and June 2022, the second wave was run between March and May 2023. Respectively, we obtained 2,600 and 2,649 observations for waves 1 and 2.
Participants were recruited thanks to a local partner who had an established network with public schools across the country. This local partner worked with a field coordinator under the supervision of the research team in Spain. The experiment was adapted for subjects with the help of a local pedagogical team, and it was tested using a group of students from El Salvador to assess the adaptations.
The recruitment process was identical for both waves. Participants were not selfselected. School directors signed an agreement to integrate the experiment into their pedagogical curriculum and to conduct it as a class activity. This eliminated the need of parental consent for subjects under 14 years old, decreasing the non-response rate. Experimental sessions were scheduled with the support of the local partner, and the experiment was conducted as a lab-in-the-field on a platform called SAND 3 , which was developed to provide greater control over data privacy and adaptability. Subjects were informed that all responses were anonymous and were provided with general information and instructions as well as the necessary tools to complete the experiment: a tablet, internet connection, username, and temporary password to access SAND.
Once subjects logged in, they completed the experiment by navigating through the different screens containing specific instructions for each task. In 8 schools, participants first completed the temporal discounting (The Truck ) and then they completed risk preferences (The Gumball ). Task order was inverted for the last 4 schools. We control for this through school fixed effects. Payments were hypothetical, knowing that they elicit similar results than monetary payments (refer to Alfonso et al. (2023a)).


The truck and the gumball tasks
This study uses tailored tasks designed explicitly for the non-adult population. The Truck task is a visual version of the Multiple Price List task of 
Coller and Williams (1999)
 to elicit time preferences developed by 
Alfonso et al. (2023a)
. The Gumball Machine is a graphic version of 
Holt and Laury (2002)
 test to measure risk preferences introduced by 
Vasco and Vazquez (2023)
. 
Figure 1
 shows the first screen for participants of the truck (top) and the gumball (bottom) tasks.
In both tasks, subjects made six consecutive decisions. For the truck task, they were asked to choose in each scenario between 10$ tomorrow or 10$+x (being x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 dollars) one week later. For the gumball, they choose between two paired lotteries (A and B) with high and low payoffs. Lottery A is initially better than Lottery B until p high becomes sufficiently large, and lottery B is more attractive (and rewarding). Appendix A explains both tasks in detail. Under consistency 4 , the truck task lets us compute several measures of time preferences: number of future allocations (#F uture, from 0 to 6 choices of one week later) and three dummies: subjects who allocate all in present (AllP resent), future (AllF uture) or those who use interior allocations at least once (Interior). Similarly, the gumball task lets us compute several measures of risk preferences under consistency 5 : #Risky counts from 0 to 6 the number of risky allocations (option B vs A) and three dummies: Averse if the subject chooses at least three A's in the first five decisions -i.e. AAABBB, AAAABB, AAAAAB-, N eutral if she/he chooses AABBBB and Lover if she/he chooses ABBBBB.


Other tasks
To study the role of individual abilities on how subjects make choices we used two different measures: cognitive and probability abilities. We used two complementary tasks to study cognitive abilities: the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT ) adapted for teenagers and a financial numeracy test (F inAb) comprising three mathematical questions related to basic operations and interest rates. To study probability abilities we used an extended version of the Delavande test 
(Delavande & Kohler, 2009)
 adapted by Brañas-Garza et al. (2021) that allows assessing subjects' accuracy and consistency when handling probabilities. Both tasks were previously tested with adolescents in Spain 
(Alfonso et al., 2023a)
. See Appendix A.3, A.4 and A.5 for details.
We also captured students' educational outcomes, expectations, and aspirations. As short-term measurements of educational outcomes, we asked students to report their performance at school in the previous year in terms of the number of subjects in which they obtained excellent or good grades. Also, they were asked about the likelihood of continuing studying in school in the next year. 6 Furthermore, we captured students' long-term educational expectations and aspirations by asking them to report the likelihood of going to university and whether they want to go to university. 7


Schools
Along this section we summarize the main features of the 12 school that participated in the study.  The 12 schools are public and evenly distributed across urban and rural areas 8 . With few exceptions, most schools offer middle and high school education 9 . The total student population for middle and high school varies. The smallest school had 70 students, and the largest had 560 students.
Additionally, we collected information on the reported violent events in the different municipalities in which the schools are located. These events are usually related to the presence of gangs 10 in the local communities. This information was captured before the exception regime which started on March 27 th , 2022.


Definitions


Inconsistency
Along this paper we consider three types of inconsistent behavior: subjects who make wrong choices in time, risk and both (time ∪ risk). For simplicity, we do consider whether the individual makes or not an inconsistent choice in the respective domain.
Observe that we might also consider intensity (number of inconsistencies) in the same task. For instance, in Holt-Laury elicitation we may find at least three types of inconsistencies: lack of understanding (playing B in the first choice), multiple switching and inattention (playing A in the last choice, strictly dominated) (see Amador-Hidalgo et al. 
2021
). Therefore, a subject might be inconsistent in time, i
t i = 1, in risk i r i = 1, or in both, I i = i t i + i r i = 0, 1, 2.
To sum up: Time: refers to multiple switching along the temporal discounting task.
Risk: refers to choosing dominated strategies and/or multiple switching along the risk task.
Both: refers to being inconsistent in time and/or risk task.
In the following we explore inconsistency by task (i t i , i r i ) and in aggregate (I i ). While the former measures are useful to test whether a particular domain may impact differently the later helps us to identify subjects with strong problems in making choices (I i = 2).


Individual abilities
We constructed different indexes to study the role of individual abilities in decisionmaking. The first one is Cognitive abilities and reflects subjects' ability to think deliberately and carefully but also some analytical skills, particularly in financial maths:
CogAb = CRT + F inAb.
On the other side, we created a Probability abilities index based on an extended version of Delavande test (see 
Brañas-Garza et al. (2021)
). This index is composed of the number of correct probability estimations (accuracy) and the consistent decisions between sets (noviolations) 11 : P robAb = accuracy + noviolations. 12 Our two measures of individual abilities, CogAb and P robAb, are highly correlated (φ = 0.33, p = 0.00).
Finally, we built an index from 0 to 12 according to students' report of the number of subjects in which they obtained excellent or good grades during the previous school year. We refer to this variable as Self-reported GPA.


Students
Along this section, we summarize the main features of the students who participated in the study.
From a total of 2,600 observations obtained, the following criteria were taken to obtain the final sample: task completion (truck, gumball, CRT, financial abilities and Delavande test), age between 12 and 20 years, being in the school years from 7 th to 11 th grade and having specified their gender as female (or male).
Several participants did not complete the entire exercise (70) 13 , 13 subjects were excluded due to their age (but 48 did not report their age) and 105 subjects were in 12 th grade. Regarding gender, 12 students reported belonging to "other gender", 56 "preferred not to answer" while 48 were removed from the sample since they did not report their gender.
After removing those who did not complete all the information or failed any selection criteria, the final sample amounts 2,248 participants out of the original 2,495 (90.1%). 
Table 2
 summarizes.
Half of the sample (49%) were female and the mean age was 15.46 years old. The average CogAb and P robAb scores were 1.49 and 2.5, respectively. In terms of school performance, the mean self-reported GPA was 2.05. 14 The questions on long-term expectations show that the average likelihood of going to university is 63.2% and studying next year is 86.48%. Finally, the mean desire to go to university is 85.25%. 15 
Table 2
 also shows that the proportion of 7 th , 8 th and 9 th grade students is similar (approximately 25%), while 13.79% are 10 th graders and 13.21% are 11 th graders. 3 Results 
Figure 2
 shows aggregate inconsistencies for time preferences, risk preferences, and both (within-subjects). Numbers are not positive: 45% of students made at least one inconsistent choice along the truck task (left), 57% were inconsistent when faced the gumball machine (center), and more concerning, only 27% were consistent in both tasks (right side).


Overview
Compared to the outcomes of Spanish students who used identical tasks (see 
Alfonso et al. (2024)
) with average levels of inconsistency of about 15%, these results are extremely concerning. 
16
 Recall that the only difference between Alfonso et al. 
(2024) and
these data is that the language of the instruments was adapted by a local pedagogical team.


Figure 2: Inconsistency across tasks
Result 1: 45% of students are inconsistent in time, 57% in risk while only 27% were consistent in both tasks.


Inconsistencies by schools
This section compares schools. The main reason why we run this comparison is to assess whether the previous results ( 
Figure 2
) are mostly due to certain schools with severe problems or, more concerning if adolescents' difficulties when facing the tasks are general. 
Figure 3
 shows the results.
Regarding inconsistencies in time preferences (left side) we do not observe substantial differences among schools. In most cases, the deviation from the average is not larger than 5%. The only exceptions are schools #4 and #5, with inconsistency levels of 39% and 33% respectively. For risk preferences (center) we observe a similar pattern:
a similar task with a sample between 5 and 16 years old, 
Bettinger and Slonim (2007)
 found that 34% was inconsistent. For risk preferences, in a recent study 
Filippin and Crosetto (2016)
 found an average inconsistent behavior of 14% across 41 studies. It is important to note, however, that 
Jacobson and Petrie (2009)
 found a similar level of inconsistency in Rwanda (55%).
with few exceptions, most schools show similar numbers. Interestingly, in school #5 we observed a lower level of inconsistency in time preferences, but higher inconsistency in risk preferences.


Figure 3: Inconsistency across schools
The graph on the right shows the fraction of inconsistent (within) subjects in both tasks. By inspection, we can see that, on average, schools are pretty similar with a fraction of around 27% of students who performed both tasks consistently. 
Table 3
 shows a series of models to estimate the effect of each school. Models 1, 4 and 7 study inconsistencies in time (also introducing CogAb and ProbAb). Models 2, 5 and 8 analyze inconsistencies in risk (with the same specifications). Similarly, models 3, 6 and 9 focus on inconsistency on both tasks (being no-inconsistency=0, inconsistent in one task=0.5, and 1 when the subject fails in both tasks). The reference group is school #11.
The very truth is that school effects are rather limited. Similarly to results presented in 
Figure 3
, 
Table 3
 shows that school #5 does better in time preferences (p < 0.01) but worse in risk preferences (p < 0.01, like schools #6, #7 and #12) but on aggregate (both) these differences balance each other in the majority of cases with some weak differences like #6, #7 and #12 (p < 0.05). When we introduce CogAb these differences decrease 17 and when we control for ProbAb differential behavior across schools completely vanishes. 18
Result 2: The level of inconsistency across schools of our sample is not different.
We cannot generalize these results to all the schools in the country since our sample was not collected with the aim of being representative. However, our sample is composed of 12 schools with different sizes, locations (urban/rural), economic backgrounds, and violence exposure (presence of maras). See section 2.4 for details.


Inconsistencies by gender
Now, we study whether girls and boys performed the tasks differently. 
Figure 4
 shows the fraction of inconsistent students for time, risk, and both tasks.
By inspection, looks pretty clear that both girls and boys performed the time preferences task (graph on the left) identically: 45% of the girls and boys made at least one inconsistent choice. Models 1, 4 and 7 
(Table 3)
 reports the very same results (p > 0.1 in all cases).  For risk preferences (graph in the center) the situation differs. Girls made more errors than boys (59% vs. 54%) and the difference is strongly significant in model 2 (p < 0.01) - 
Table 3
 -but becomes weakly significant (p < 0.05) after adding controls for abilities (models 5 and 8). Finally, the right side shows that there are no gender differences for both tasks, as 26% (28%) of the girls (boys) were consistent in both (p > 0.1). Models 3, 6 and 9 show that gender differences in both tasks vanish.
Result 3: Inconsistency in time preferences is not different between boys and girls, but girls are more inconsistent in risk preferences. However, gender differences vanishes in both tasks.


Developmental consistency
Now we explore whether inconsistencies evolve with age, that is, if developmental factors exert influence over the consistency of responses, specifically whether inconsistency diminishes with age. 
Figure 5
 shows respectively the average level of inconsistency in time (left), risk (center) and both (right) by age. Apparently the performance in these tasks seems to improve with age (since inconsistency seems to decrease). However, in order to have a more precise picture 
Table 3
 explores the developmental side of these behaviors in detail using regressions (with and without controls for cognitive abilities). Models 1, 4 and 7 show that age has no impact on time inconsistencies (p > 0.1) implying that subjects do not learn to complete the task properly as they become more mature. Models 2 and 5 show that age has a negative and significant (p < 0.01) impact on risk inconsistencies, that is, as subjects become older (more mature) they are more likely to make consistent choices under uncertainty. Model 8 shows that the effect of age on risk inconsistencies is weaker (p < 0.05) when we control for ProbAb.
Models 3, 6 and 9 
(Table 3)
 analyze inconsistencies in both tasks and we observe that the impact of age is again negative and significant (p < 0.01 without controls; p < 0.05 when we control for individual abilities CogAb or ProbAb). However this effect seems to be entirely driven by the improvement in risk choices with age -since time decisions do not improve.
Result 4: As subjects develop they are less likely to make inconsistent choice under uncertainty but do not learn to make inter-temporal choices consistently


The role of cognitive skills
Models 4, 5 and 6 in 
Table 3
 analyze the impact of CogAb on inconsistent choices. While these abilities do not improve (worse) intertemporal decision-making, the impact on uncertain decisions is clear: subjects endowed with these abilities are less likely to make errors (p < 0.01, see model 5). By extension, these abilities also decrease the probability of making both tasks inconsistently (p < 0.01, see model 6). Models 7 and 8 show that ProbAb has a negative and significant impact on both time (p < 0.05) and risk inconsistent decision-making (p < 0.01). 
Figure 6
 presents the estimated effects of CogAb and ProbAb in the likelihood of making inconsistent choices in time and risk preferences. It is clear that individuals with cognitive and probability abilities are less likely to make inconsistent choices under uncertainty. While subjects with the minimum CogAb score (zero) have a 61% likelihood of being inconsistent in the gumball task, this probability drops 20 percentage points for those with the maximum CogAb score (six). The effect of ProbAb on inconsistent risk choices is stronger, dropping from a 70% likelihood of inconsistent choices in subjects with the minimum ProbAb score to 38% with the maximum ProbAb score.


Figure 6: Inconsistency and cognitive abilities
Result 5: Individuals with cognitive and probability abilities are less likely to make inconsistent choices under uncertainty. Consistency in inter-temporal choices is affected by probability (not cognitive) abilities.


Task repetition
A relevant question is to determine whether repeating the task improves the results. In other words, whether a student who repeats the task for the second time performs better. To do this, we will take advantage of having two waves (with a 9-month gap) and study the behavior of 1,491 students 19 who participated in both the first and second waves.
Figure 7 examines this case. On the horizontal axis, we show how their behavior was in the first wave (in terms of time, risk, both), and on the vertical axis, we have the results of the second wave. As you can see, 54% of the subjects who were inconsistent in time preferences in wave 1 become consistent in the second wave. For risk, this percentage is only 36%. The results may seem modest but positive.
However, there's a problem. If we look at the subjects who were consistent in the first wave, many of them become inconsistent: 32% in the case of time and 36% in the case of risk. In other words, students who used to perform well are now performing poorly.
The graph on the right shows the behavior in both tasks simultaneously. The results are not positive. Out of the subjects who did not commit any inconsistency in wave 1 (none), only half of them, 55%, remained consistent in the second wave. 


Time and risk preferences under alternative definitions of consistency
In previous sections, we have seen that using standard definitions of inconsistency creates a huge loss of data. Along this section, we will use alternative -less demanding -definitions of consistency.
Replacement: One inconsistent choice is replaced by the consistent one for all subjects making only one inconsistency.
Training: First choice is considered as training for all subjects. Therefore both time and risk preferences are measured with 5 decisions.
First, we defined eligible subjects for replacement. Among inconsistent subjects, we selected those who would become consistent by changing only one decision: 78% of inconsistent subjects in time preferences and 58% in risk preferences. Then, we replaced one decision that would lead to a re-classification of those subjects into consistent ones. For time preferences, we replaced 611 cases of switch back decisions. For risk preferences, we replaced 415 cases of strictly dominated strategies and 296 cases of switch back decisions. 20
The use of alternative definitions of consistency changes results substantially. In time preferences we see that, compared to the standard procedure with only 55% of consistent subjects, the replacement of a single error increases this fraction to 82%. Likewise, using the first choice as a trial and eliciting time preferences with the subsequent five decisions also increases the consistent fraction to 59%.
Similar results are found for risk preferences. While the standard procedure provided 43% of consistent subjects, the replacement increases this fraction to 75% and the use of one trial increases consistency to 54%. For time preferences, replacing one inconsistency does not affect the distribution of preferences: the fraction of present-oriented shifts from 32% under the standard definition to 31% (replacement), while the fraction of future-oriented remains in 21% under both definitions. However, eliciting time preferences with 5 decisions (training) increases the proportion of future-oriented from 21% to 35% and reduces interior allocations from 47% to 33%.


Figure 8: Alternative definitions of consistency
For risk preferences, the proportion of averse subjects under the standard definition (35%) changes slightly when replacing one inconsistency (36%) and when the first decision is taken as trial (33%). Under the alternative definitions, neutral decreases from 39% to 30% (replacement) and 34% (training), and lover increases from 26% to 34% (replacement) and 33% (training).
To summarize, using alternative -less demanding -definitions of consistency leads to a substantial increase in the fraction of consistent subjects in the sample and slightly modifies the distribution of preferences.


Implications
Along this section we explore to different implications of the problem shown across this paper. First refers to the implication to academics or policy-makers aimed to run experiments in the field. Second explore how inconsistencies may have an impact on expectations, that is, whether the expectations of inconsistent individuals differs from those consistent.


Implications for running experiments
There are two important implications from these results. First, these data bring bad news for multi-cultural experiments with kids and adolescents. Besides the efforts we made to adapt the language (not the graphics) to local students, it is pretty clear that these students did not understand the task as Spanish teens did. Observe that for adult population this transportation has worked quite successfully in many international studies. For instance, Brañas-Garza et al. (2021) elicited risk preferences in three countries -Honduras, Nigeria and Spain -with very similar instructions and found negligible differences in inconsistencies among samples. Summarizing, experimental tasks cannot be transported directly to adolescents.
Most likely this problem is directly related to differences in the quality of education. While participants are the same age, the level of educational achievement of the participants is substantially different among countries.
The second problem refers to the quality of the data and the amount of observations we lost due to the lack of understanding or/and inattention. When a participant makes inconsistent choices her data are simply not usable since we cannot elicit her preferences from her choices. We simply do not know the implications of her choices. For instance, her choices might be simply random. The implications for our study are overwhelming: about half of the data are useless for time and more than half are lost for risk preferences. Most of the sample (73%) is lost for both the elicitation of time and risk simultaneously.


Implications for educational outcomes
The truly relevant question is whether inconsistency is more than just a nuisance for experimentalists and represents a deeper problem. In other words, if the inconsistencies are showing us a problem in the decision-making fundamentals. If subjects who cannot complete a task satisfactorily are revealing other, more profound issues with long-term implications.
In this section, we will assume that the results obtained are not due to a failure in the transfer of tools from one context to another, but that the results accurately reflect the situation of adolescents in El Salvador. In other words, we assume that in another format, the results would have been similar. Under this assumption, we will examine issues that reflect the immediate and long-term implications of inconsistency.
To simplify, we will consider the extreme cases: those without inconsistency problems (performing both tasks well, 27% of the sample) and those with serious problems (performing both tasks poorly, 29% of the sample), and we will show the Cumula-tive Distribution Functions (CDFs). Note that these comparisons are based on the standard consistency definitions described in 2.5.


Immediate implications
As immediate measurements of the educational implications of inconsistency, we analyzed:
• Their performance at school (self-reported GPA).
• Their expectations of continuing studying in school the following year.
The red (blue) line in 
Figure 9
 displays inconsistent (consistent) students' CDFs for these two outcomes. As we can see, inconsistent students have lower educational performance and expectations. For instance, while for the 20th percentile of inconsistent students the likelihood of continuing studying the next year is 50% or lower, for consistent students this likelihood increases to 80%. 


Long-term implications of inconsistency
We analyzed students' long-term educational aspirations in terms of:
• Their expectations of going to university.
• Whether they would like to attend university. 
Figure 10
 shows that inconsistent students have lower expectations and aspirations of going to university. For the 20th percentile of inconsistent students the likelihood of attending university is 20% or lower, while for consistent students this likelihood increases to 50%.


Figure 10: Inconsistency and long-term implications
To summarize, this section showed that students with problems in the fundamentals have clear educational implications, both immediately and in the long term.


Conclusion
The experiments involving young people and adolescents are scarce, and they are even scarcer in developing countries, where paradoxically, they could be much more relevant in terms of policy implications. This work analyzes how a large sample of adolescents (n > 2000) makes decisions regarding time -choosing between a nearby prize and a distant one -and risk -choosing between two lotteries. Our primary concern is to see if students in El Salvador are capable of performing the tasks satisfactorily, and the answer is negative. In fact, just over a quarter of the sample completes both tasks consistently. While we do find some differences between girls and boys -for example, in risk consistency -the reality is that, in the end, the number of girls and boys making mistakes is almost the same.
In the study, we address whether inconsistencies are different among the twelve schools (quite diverse among them), and we find that, for the most part, students from different schools do not exhibit very different behaviors. This implies that the problem could be general, and not a specific case of a particular school. While it is true that the twelve schools are not representative of the country, it is also true that the significant differences between them lead us to believe that they may represent a good number of schools of various natures.
We also analyze whether inconsistency evolves with age and find that it does, as they get better with years. This result is consistent with previous research, such as that of 
Brocas and Carrillo (2020a)
 and 
Alfonso et al. (2024)
 and 
Alfonso et al. (2023a)
, which shows that the ability to choose rationally improves with age. However, the improvement in reasoning of our participants is only modestly positive because, on the one hand, the improvements are not very significant -in fact, in the highest grade (with mean age of 17.7 years), the percentage of consistent boys remains small and concerning (60% for time, 48% for risk and 34% for both) -and, on the other hand, because the previously mentioned works show that consistency appears at much younger ages. For example, in 
Alfonso et al. (2023b)
, half of the 6-7-year-olds play games with private information consistently.
In parallel, we analyze the role of cognitive abilities. As expected, we find that boys who perform better on the CRT 
(Brañas-Garza et al., 2019;
Frederick, 2005)
 are also less likely to exhibit inconsistencies. Similarly, we find that the grade on a finance test (of three questions) as well as the ability to assign probabilities to events with true value also predict consistency in the tasks. All of this is not surprising and is perfectly consistent with many previous works (see, for example, Amador-Hidalgo et al. 
2021
and 
Vasco and Vazquez (2023)
).
Taking advantage of the fact that many participants had taken part in a second wave, we tested whether repeating the tasks a few months later would help alleviate the problem. The results are not particularly encouraging. While many boys improve with repetition (become consistent), there is also a percentage who were consistent in the first wave but cease to be in the second. In summary, the aggregate result is practically null. Therefore, as opposed to what other studies have found 
(Charness & Chemaya, 2023;
Ert & Haruvy, 2017)
, repeated exposure to risk elicitation tasks, such as the Holt-Laury task, does not always result in individuals making more consistent decisions.
The reality is that only about 25% of the sample completes the tasks consistently, and this result is not specific to a particular school but seems quite general, and repeating the tasks doesn't help much either. This number is overwhelming for two very different reasons. First, because it is much lower than the work conducted in Spain with very similar instructions -identical graphic illustrations and minor text adaptations -and identical procedures. Second, because these results indicate that we do not know what or how 75% of the sample has decided on two canonical tasks. In other words, we run the risk of the collected data being useless.
We must ask ourselves what the lack of consistency in decisions means. After all, we are saying that a student fails to choose, for example, between a and A (where
A = d•a, d > 1)
, which means they are presenting a serious problem with the basics. An alternative explanation is that their problem is not with the basics but with their attention during the experiment, i.e., whether they took it seriously or not. It seems credible that 75% of the students in the entire sample made random decisions. But even accepting that possibility, we have analyzed whether this consistency problem is only a theoretical concern that is not so relevant in the empirical field. For example, 
Jacobson and Petrie (2009)
 found that inconsistent choices in the Holt and Laury task lead to sub-optimal financial decisions in Rwanda. To do this, we have taken four measures: their performance at school, the expectations of the boys to return to school next year, to attend university, and whether they would like to go to university. The answer is straightforward: in all four cases, the CDF of the consistent group stochastically dominates the CDF of the inconsistent group. This implies that the inconsistent students have worse expectations and even less interest in attending university. And it is well known that expectations are a good predictor of outcomes 
(Bandura et al., 2001;
Khattab, 2015;
Samara et al., 2021)
. This result no longer seems like just a theoretical concern; rather, it reflects a fairly real problem: a problem with the development of fundamentals at a young age can have long-term consequences on people's lives.


Supplementary Material


A Experimental tasks
This section describes the tasks as they were presented to subjects. In schools 1 to 8, they completed the tasks in the following the order: truck + CRT + Fin + gumball + Delavande. In schools 9 to 12, the order of the truck and gumball tasks was inverted.


A.1 Truck
Screen 1. Throughout the next 6 screens, you will have to make 6 decisions (one per screen) about how you want to receive a hypothetical amount of money. Your task is to choose which option you prefer, knowing that if you choose one you will receive the money tomorrow, and if you choose the other you will receive it next week. As you progress through the decisions, the amount of money you will receive for waiting will get larger and larger.  


A.2 Gumball task
Screen 1. In this task you are going to make decisions about probabilities. Probability is the possibility of something happening, that is, how someone is sure what is going to happen. In each decision you will have to choose between two options where you can win fictitious money: in both you will win, but you can be luckier and win more, or you can be less lucky and win less. The probabilities of winning change from one decision to another. Below, you are presented with 6 different questions. Your task is to choose option A) or option B) in all questions. To complete the task, proceed to the next screen.     
Ü I A) Ü I B) ¿Qué prefieres' Ü I A) Ü I B) 0®@ @® ---- º L Figure A.2.3: Screen 4
Ü I A) Q I B) fo¿\@ ~ ~@ 0) @ 2$ •" ---- ---~ º o L L ¿Qué prefieres? Ü I A) Ü I B)


A.4 Financial abilities
Screen 1. NOTE: In case you do NOT know how to answer or you think this question is not for you, please answer with this question is not for you, answer with: 00
1. If there are 5 people who possess the winning ticket of a lottery and the prize to be shared is 2 million dollars, how much money will each person receive? Indicate with numbers without periods or commas. (correct: 400000).
2. Imagine that you have $100 in a savings account. The account accumulates an interest rate of 10% by year. How much money will you have in the account after 2 years? (correct: 121).
3. Imagine you have $100 in a savings account and the interest rate you earn on the savings is 2% by year. If you keep the money in the account for 5 years, how much money will you have at the end of 5 years? (This question had options to select as an answer: Less than $102, Exactly $102, More than $102 or 00. I don't know) (correct: More than 102).


A.5 Delavande
Note that participants in schools 1 to 8 responded to the task by entering a number, while in schools 9 to 12 half of the sample entered numbers and the other half moved a slider (see 
Figure A
.5.1). The instructions and questions were maintained in both versions.
Figure A.5.1: Slider Screen 1. In the next screen, we will ask you about the probability that certain things could happen. In each question, you should write down how likely you think it is that these things will happen in reality. If you think something will happen for sure, you should write 100. If you are fairly but not completely sure, write a number close to 100 (but less than 100). If you think it is something that will never happen, write 0. If you think it is unlikely, write a number close to 0 (but greater than 0). If you think it is equally likely to happen or not to happen, write 50.


Screen 2. EXAMPLES:
-If it is a sunny day and I ask you how likely it is that it will be sunny within 1 hour, you would typically say 100 or numbers very close to 100.
-If it is 12 o'clock at night, the most reasonable thing to say is that the probability that it will be sunny in 1 hour is 0.
-If I flip a coin, the probability that it will come up heads is 50.
Screen 3. (First question format schools 1 to 8: how likely from 0 to 100 do you think it is possible to GET the GREEN apple?)
1. Imagine I have a basket with 5 APPLES: 1 GREEN and 4 RED. If I ask you to pick ONE of the apples WITHOUT LOOKING inside the basket, how likely is it that you will get the GREEN apple from 0 to 100?
2. Imagine I have a basket with 10 APPLEs: 1 GREEN and 9 RED. If I ask you to pick ONE of the apples WITHOUT LOOKING inside the basket, how likely is 41
Valor; 50 o 100 it that you will get the GREEN apple from 0 to 100?
3. How likely are you to EAT RICE in THE NEXT WEEK from 0 to 100 (including today)?
4. How likely are you to EAT RICE in THE NEXT MONTH from 0 to 100 (including today)?
Screen 4.
5. How likely is it that you will NOT ATTEND your school any time in the NEXT MONTH from 0 to 100 (including today)?
6. How likely is it that you will take a bath at least once during the NEXT MONTH from 0 to 100 (including today)?
Screen 5. 21 (First question format center 1 to 8: How likely from 0 to 100 is it that you will still be STUDYING in 1 YEAR?)
7. How likely are you to CONTINUE your STUDIES next year from 0 to 100?
9. How likely are you to go to UNIVERSITY from 0 to 100?
21 Question 8 is not of interest for this study.

C Strategies
Replacement strategies and elicitation of preferences
In this section we describe our replacement strategy for switching back decisions and discuss why it involves non-trivial assumptions that could distort the elicitation of subjects' preferences. Recall that the strategy that we adopted replaced subject's switching back decision to the one she had made immediately before. Take the case of a subject whose decision pattern was ABABBB. In this case, the switching back took place in the third decision "A" and the replacement consisted in changing it to the one she had made immediately before (second decision) "B". The underlying assumption of this replacement strategy is that subject's mistake was switching back from "B" to "A" in the third decision. However, an alternative interpretation of subject's decision pattern could be that the mistake was choosing "B" in the second decision. Under this assumption, an alternative replacement strategy would be to replace subject's second decision from a "B" to an "A".
Different assumptions about subject's inconsistent choices have non-trivial implications in the elicitation of their preferences. For risk preferences, the implications of the example above are straightforward: the first replacement strategy leads to the new decision pattern ABBBBB and the subject is classified as risk lover. Instead, with the alternative replacement, the resulting decision pattern is AAABBB and the subject is classified as risk averse. As illustrated in C.0.1, alternative replacement strategies in The Gumball task lead to different classifications that could potentially distort the elicitation of subjects' preferences.

For this research, only waves 1 and 2 are analyzed. Wave 3 was running in 2023.


Acronym for Social Analysis and Network Data. This platform is offered by Kampal company (https://www.kampal.com/).


As we explain in 2.5, consistent subjects in the truck tasks are those who do not switch back. 5 There are three types of inconsistency: i) lack of understanding when subjects selected lottery B in the first decision, which had no uncertainty, and B is dominated by A; ii) Switch back, when subjects switched back from lottery B to A; and iii) lack of attention when subjects chose lottery A in the sixth decision which had no uncertainty, and A is dominated by B. See 2.5 for more details.


As described in 2.6, we excluded 12th-grade students from our analyses, so in theory, all students of our sample are supposed to continue studying in school in the next year.7 Students' expectations and aspirations were measured on a scale from 0 to 100.


An example of a violation would be, for example, reporting that the likelihood of choosing an apple is higher when there are ten apples in a basked than where there are five apples in a basket.12 Both CogAb and P robAb = 0, 1, ..., 6.


64 of them ended the experiment during Delavande test or provided wrong answers (values over 100) and 6 of them ended the experiment during the Truck Task.14 The distribution of cognitive abilities and school performance variables can be found in Appendix B.15 There are fewer observations for the questions on likelihood of studying next year and wanting to go to university because they were included during data collection.


Inconsistency levels are also high compared to previous studies in other contexts. For time preferences,
Castillo et al. (2011)
 used an instrument that is different from the truck task (but can also be used to assess inconsistencies) and found an inconsistency rate of 31% among 8 th graders in the United States. Using


The only exception is #5 for time which stays similar.


The only exceptions are: school #5 at 1% for time and school #7 at 1% for risk, schools #5, #6 and #12 at 5% for risk, and school #12 at 5% for both.


A total of 1,960 students from wave 1 repeated the experiment of which 1,491 met the same selection criteria as wave 1.


For both tasks, we replaced subject's switching back decision to the one she had made immediately before. Take the case of a subject with the decision pattern ABABBB. In this case, the switching back took place in the third decision "A" and the replacement consisted in changing it to the one she had made immediately before (second decision) "B", leading to the "corrected" pattern ABBBBB. We acknowledge that this replacement strategy involves non-trivial assumptions that could distort the elicitation of subjects' preferences. For a more elaborate discussion see Appendix C.
