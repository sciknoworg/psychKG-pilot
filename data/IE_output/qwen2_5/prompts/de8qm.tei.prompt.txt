You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

aversiveness of ambivalence motivates people to regulate the discomfort or regain a univalent attitude 
Festinger, 1957;
van Harreveld et al., 2015)
. However, despite the large temporal variation inherent to the different attitude objects employed in previous research, the motivational consequences of ambivalence have been investigated in isolation from its temporal characteristics. This is although repeated experiences of ambivalent discomfort about an attitude object may be aversive in themselves, such that recurring ambivalence could shape the way people cope with the ambivalence.
To further our understanding of the nature of ambivalence and its motivational consequences, we investigate the extent to which ambivalence reoccurs and whether such reexperiences of ambivalence influence coping efforts. We propose that the perceived recurrence of ambivalence motivates people to engage in more effortful coping than nonrecurring ambivalence, with the aim to gain a univalent attitude and thereby avert future experiences of the ambivalence. This paper tests these assertions through two studies by examining the variability in how ambivalence recurs naturally and the motivational processes and consequences associated with this recurring ambivalence.


RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 4
The temporal dynamics of ambivalence Psychological states inherently fluctuate across time 
(Bailen et al., 2019;
Heavey et al., 2019;
Hurlburt et al., 2022;
Pauer, Rutjens, Brick, et al., 2024)
. In the context of attitudinal ambivalence, prevailing theorizing suggests that metacognitive awareness of evaluative conflict (i.e., felt ambivalence) arises in situations when opposed sides of an ambivalent attitude object (i.e., potential ambivalence) are simultaneously accessible 
(Priester & Petty, 1996;
. Even for attitude objects with relatively stable potential ambivalence, such as in the domains of food and personal goals 
(Emmons & King, 1988;
Keller & Siegrist, 2015)
, an experience sampling study has shown that feelings of conflict episodically fluctuate across time 
(Hofmann et al., 2012
). In the context of school-leisure conflicts in adolescents, for example, 
Kuhnle et al. (2010)
 revealed considerable variance in the perceived frequency of evaluative conflict depending on individual differences and environmental context. A pivotal reason for why felt ambivalence arises is decision-making 
Nohlen et al., 2016;
Schneider & Schwarz, 2017;
van Harreveld, Rutjens, et al., 2009;
van Harreveld et al., 2015)
. In a large-scale experience sampling study,  showed that potential ambivalence about a topic remained in a dormant state throughout everyday life until people had to make a conflicted decision and its potential outcomes became salient, giving rise to episodes of felt ambivalence. Given the propensity of ambivalent attitudes to engender repeated instances of felt ambivalence, this line of research indicates that felt ambivalence can chronically recur.
When felt ambivalence towards an attitude object occurs repeatedly over multiple intervals, individuals might appraise the frequent exposure to the ambivalence as aversive in itself. In the context of unpleasant thoughts and emotions more generally, repeated experiences have been associated with feelings of frustration 
(Linden et al., 2009;
McClelland & Apicella, 1945)
, annoyance about the persistence 
(Belloch et al., 2004)
, concern about future outcomes and a need to gain control over the aversive state 
(Purdon, 2001
). These characteristics indicate that perceptions of recurring ambivalence involve appraisals of chronic and recent reappearances of the ambivalence, as well as an anticipation of future reexperiences. Based on these proposed discomfortable appraisals and the ensuing desire to forestall future experiences of the ambivalence, we argue that recurring ambivalence RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 5 motivates individuals to resort to effortful coping strategies that they deem effective in reducing the discomfort ambivalence is known to elicit.


Recurrence-motivated coping
While potential ambivalence can impact on attitude stability and choice variability 
(Armitage & Conner, 2000;
Conner et al., 2020;
Luttrell et al., 2016)
, ambivalence-induced discomfort drives the motivational consequences of felt ambivalence with the aim to alleviate the discomfort 
(van Harreveld et al., 2015)
. People employ a vast number of coping strategies to alleviate aversive states like felt ambivalence, which have been conceptualized as either problem-or emotion-focused 
Folkman & Lazarus, 1980;
.
Emotion-focused coping primarily aims at alleviating momentary ambivalent discomfort, such as by avoiding a conflicted decision 
(Luce, 1998;
Tversky & Shafir, 1992)
. Problem-focused strategies like effortful information processing attempt to restore attitudinal consistency and can thus be more effective in the long-run 
van Harreveld et al., 2015)
. This effectiveness of problem-focused coping aligns with self-regulation research showing that coping strategies dedicated to preventing an aversive state are, on average, more effective than reactive coping strategies that primarily alleviate momentary affect 
(Gross, 1998;
S. G. Hofmann et al., 2009;
John & Gross, 2004;
Webb et al., 2012)
.
In selecting the most suitable coping strategy, individuals may draw on contextual features of the experience of ambivalence. According to the Model of Ambivalent Discomfort , the choice between coping strategies entails trading off the cognitive effort involved in a strategy against accuracy goals for the outcome of an ambivalent decision. The model predicts that individuals prefer frugal coping strategies to reduce ambivalence with minimal effort, unless a desire to optimize outcomes motivates more propitious but costly problem-focused coping.
For example, ambivalence motivates people to seek out proattitudinal information only if they lack knowledge about a topic presumably because high knowledge renders the perceived utility of novel information negligible 
(Sawicki et al., 2013)
. This illustrates that individuals draw on contextual features of the experience of ambivalence in weighing the costs of a coping strategy against its expected effectiveness.


RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 6
By the same logic, perceptions of frequently recurring ambivalence could shift the tradeoff between coping strategies towards choosing actions that can avert reexperiences of the ambivalence in the long run. While thought suppression or distraction, for example, may be successful at reducing a momentary experience of ambivalence, such reactive emotion-focused actions will be ineffective in averting aversive states from reoccurring 
(Wegner et al., 1987;
Wegner & Gold, 1995)
. A continuous preference for effortless coping can hence be maladaptive and harmful if it withholds potential improvement through more effortful problem-focused coping, such as information processing 
(Ford & Troy, 2019;
Mehta et al., 2020)
. Selecting coping actions that meet contextual demands, in contrast, carries adaptive value 
(Cheng et al., 2014;
Lazarus & Folkman, 1987)
. Consequently, negative appraisals of recurring ambivalence could prompt individuals to directly address the attitudinal origins of recurring ambivalence despite the cognitive costs involved. As long as individuals feel motivated and able to reconcile ambivalent attitudes, such effortful problem-focused coping is instrumental in gaining univalent attitude structures 
Dalege et al., 2018;
. Univalent attitudes will, in turn, resolve the reappearance of ambivalence in the long run. We therefore expect that perceptions of frequently recurring ambivalence motivate individuals to resort to more effortful coping with the aim to avert the ambivalence from reoccurring.


Overview of the current research
We conducted two studies to examine the temporal nature of attitudinal ambivalence and its motivational consequences. Perceptions of frequently recurring ambivalence should motivate people to resort to more effortful coping compared to nonrecurring ambivalence. Study 1 investigated this interaction effect of felt ambivalence with its perceived recurrence on motivating effortful coping in a cross-sectional design, while also testing for potential roles of the aversive nature of recurring ambivalence and an amplification of the effect by dispositional inter-temporal cognition. Study 2 provides experimental evidence through a well-controlled design with high ecological validity, manipulating ambivalence and recurrence orthogonally. In doing so, we substantiated the interaction effect and further examined the role of recurrence-induced negative affect in the consequences of RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 7 recurring ambivalence. Thereby, the studies investigated our central tenet that people adapt their coping efforts to the temporal nature that they attribute to the ambivalence.
The paper reports all measures, experimental manipulations, sample size calculations, and exclusions. All data files are openly accessible at OSF: osf.io/skwt3/?view_only=453950a4494b4b23a42b909f3e4b112b.


Study 1
Study 1 examined our assertion that frequently recurring ambivalence increases the desire to engage in effortful coping for averting future experiences of ambivalence. The study tested whether felt ambivalence interacts with its perceived recurrence in predicting the willingness to engage in more strenuous coping efforts. Felt ambivalence should motivate more effortful coping strategies such as information processing especially at high compared to low levels of recurrence. We employed a cross-sectional design with a diverse construct space of self-generated attitude objects aimed at providing high ecological validity to shed light on the phenomenon of recurring ambivalence.
The study scrutinized the mechanisms involved in the consequences of recurring ambivalence by accounting for possible roles of potential ambivalence, attitude importance, and dispositional future orientation. We expected that the motivational nature of felt ambivalence above and beyond its underlying attitude structure (i.e., potential ambivalence) drives the motivational effects of recurring ambivalence, as the aversive state of ambivalent discomfort is deemed to be more consequential for coping processes 
(van Harreveld et al, 2015)
, even though potential ambivalence might influence coping indirectly through its effects on felt ambivalence and choice variability 
(Conner & Armitage, 2008
). In addition, especially people high in dispositional anticipation of future consequences consider aversive future events 
(Murphy & Dockray, 2018)
, which could increase the motivation to avert reappearances of ambivalence. For instance, the anticipation of future regret in conflicted decisions is oftentimes fundamental to the experience and consequences of felt ambivalence 
(Itzchakov & van Harreveld, 2018;
van Harreveld, Rutjens, et al., 2009)
. We thus assessed the Consideration of Future Consequences scale 
(Joireman et al., 2012;
Strathman et al., 1994)
 to explore whether recurring ambivalence is more consequential in highly future-oriented people compared to other people. Furthermore, we tested whether the motivational effect of recurring ambivalence holds RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 8 even when partialling out a potential role of perceived importance of an attitude object, which may correlate with recurrence 
(Andrews-Hanna et al., 2013)
 and effortful coping 
(Erber & Fiske, 1984)
.
Taken together, we hypothesized that felt ambivalence motivates effortful coping especially if the ambivalence recurs frequently, presumably because people appraise the recurrence as aversive, and the anticipation of future experiences of the ambivalence may lead people to engage in efforts to avert these reappearance of the ambivalent discomfort.


Sample
The final sample included 496 Prolific workers from the UK (Mage = 34.79, SD = 12.73, 57.1% with university degree, 69.2% identified as female, 29.8% male, and a total of 1.0% either nonbinary or transgender. We recruited a total of 533 participants, 6.9% of whom failed at least one quality check and were thus excluded, as planned in advance, i.e., a simple attention check ("select completely disagree"), bot detection utilizing reCaptcha v3 
(Google, 2022)
, or missing or nonsensical text entries for a self-generated ambivalent topic. We aimed to recruit 532 participants with a target sample size of 478 participants, accounting for an exclusion rate of up to 10%. We determined the sample size in advance in G*Power 
(Faul et al., 2007)
 to detect an effect of β = .15 with alpha = .05 in a multiple regression approach with more than 80% power. Given that statistical power depends on correlations between predictors in multiple regression, we provide sensitivity power estimates using the R package pwr2ppl (Aberson, 2019; see the OSF repository for R code): the final sample size afforded at least 80% power to detect the observed two-way and three-way interaction effects of β = .12 and .09, respectively, with alpha = .05.


Procedure
Participants consented to a study on "daily life events" and wrote down an ambivalent attitude object as in previous research (e.g., 
Berrios et al., 2015;
van Harreveld et al., 2014)
: "We want to ask you to think of a topic you personally are ambivalent about. This could be anything -as long as you have strong but mixed thoughts and feelings about it." Participants reported various topics, ranging from upcoming decisions to family members, horror movies, covid-19, or meat production. They RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 9 answered five measures regarding the self-generated topic and, afterward, we assessed the dispositional scale.


Measures
Importance. In line with previous research 
(Krosnick, 1989)
, perceived importance of the self-generated attitude object was assessed with one item to control for potential non-target effects of variation in attitude importance by different topics: "To what extent is the topic important to you?"
The response scale ranged from 1 (not at all important) to 7 (very important).
Potential ambivalence. We employed two split semantic differential scales 
(Kaplan, 1972)
 
Table 1
 for means).
Felt ambivalence. The Felt Ambivalence Questionnaire 
(Priester & Petty, 1996)
 measured metacognitive awareness of ambivalence about the self-generated topic. The questionnaire includes three items: "Towards the ambivalent topic I feel [/have]…" with response scales that ranged from 1 (no conflict at all/no indecision at all/completely one-sided reactions) to 7 (maximum conflict/maximum indecision/completely mixed reactions). Internal consistency was sufficient, α = .66, considering the small number of items and good inter-item correlation, r(494) = .47, p < .001 
(Briggs & Cheek, 1986)
.


Recurrence.
A three-item scale measured the perceived extent to which experiences of ambivalence about the self-generated topic recur. In line with previous research on time perception of psychological states 
(Diener et al., 1985;
Fresco et al., 2007;
Heavey et al., 2019;
Linden et al., 2009;
Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999)
, we assessed recalled and expected experiences of ambivalence as well as its perceived overall frequency. Two items assessed the perceived temporal distance to the ambivalence, and one item measured the overall perceived frequency: "When is the last time you felt ambivalent about the topic before right now?", "When do you expect to feel ambivalent about the RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 10 topic again?", "How frequently do you feel ambivalent about the topic?". The response scales ranged from 1 (a long time ago/never/very infrequently) to 7 (very recently/very soon/very frequently).
Internal consistency was good, α = .81.
Motivation for effortful coping. We devised a scale to measure whether individuals explicitly want to engage in effortful coping, in line with previous research 
(DeMarree et al., 2014)
. Four items measured the motivation to engage in effortful problem-focused coping (adapted from 
Carver et al., 1989;
DeMarree et al., 2014;
Pearlin & Schooler, 1978;
Wrosch et al., 2000)
: "I am willing to do what I can to change my ambivalence about the topic and achieve a more one-sided attitude", "I will take action to resolve my ambivalence about the topic", "I am motivated to get rid of my ambivalence about this topic once and for all", "Even if it costs me a lot of effort, I would try to resolve my ambivalence about the topic". The response scales ranged from 1 (completely disagree) to 4 (neither disagree nor agree) to 7 (completely agree). Internal consistency was excellent, α = .92.


Future orientation.
We employed the subscale Concern with Future Consequences from a revised two-factor solution of the of Consideration of Future Consequences scale 
(Joireman et al., 2012;
Strathman et al., 1994)
. Given the adequacy of brief versions of this scale (Murphy & Dockray, 2018), we selected four items (items 1, 7, 13, 14) based on their factor loadings and face validity, e.g., "When I make a decision, I think about how it might affect me in the future." The response scales ranged from 1 (very uncharacteristic of me) to 7 (very characteristic of me). Internal consistency was sufficient, α = .77, and similar to the original scale (α = .80; 
Joireman et al., 2012)
.


Results


Heterogeneity in recurring ambivalence
As expected, the reported ambivalent attitude objects varied substantially in the perceived frequency with which the ambivalence recurs, and the objects involved a high frequency of recurrence, on average (see 
Figure 1
 and 
Table 1
). Recurrence significantly correlated with a greater willingness to engage in effortful problem-focused coping, felt ambivalence, importance, negative evaluation, and future orientation (see 
Table 1
). These findings highlight that ambivalence can sometimes arise repeatedly over time, rather than as a one-time occurrence. Furthermore, the perceptions of recurrence vary by features of ambivalent attitude objects and individual differences.


RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 11
This systematic heterogeneity aligns with our assertion that ambivalence is associated with a range of different appraisals and motivational consequences as a function of the extent to which the ambivalence recurs over time, supporting our assertion that the temporal dynamics of ambivalence influence its motivational consequences.

The interaction between felt ambivalence and its recurrence
We investigated an interaction effect of felt ambivalence with its perceived recurrence on the motivation to engage in effortful coping. As recommended, we conducted assumption checks to test for nonlinear effects 
(Cohen et al., 2003;
Cortina, 1993;
Simonsohn, 2024)
, which revealed a nonconfirmatory significant quadratic interaction between felt ambivalence and recurrence in addition to the expected linear effects (see 
Table 2
). We therefore report the expected linear effects beyond the nonlinear terms in accordance with best practice recommendations 
(Cohen et al., 2003;
Cortina, 1993;
Hayes, 2017;
Roisman et al., 2012;
Simonsohn, 2024
; see 
Table S1
 in the Supplementary Material for a simple linear model, which yields the same pattern of findings). We therefore used PROCESS 
(Hayes, 2018)
 to probe a model that included both linear and quadratic interaction effects 
(Hayes, 2017)
, providing linear (and quadratic) simple slopes while holding quadratic (or linear) effects constant 
(Cohen, 2003)
.
The results revealed that all main and interaction effects on the motivation for effortful coping reached significance, except for the main effect of recurrence (see 
Table 2
). Crucially, as expected, the results for the interaction effect of a linear effect of felt ambivalence with recurrence on coping indicated that the linear simple slopes of felt ambivalence are significant at medium and high levels of recurrence but nonsignificant at low recurrence (see 
Table 2
 and 
Figure 2a
), with 60.9% of observations in recurrence within the region of significance. These findings support our assertion that ambivalence motivates more effortful coping especially at high levels of recurrence.
In addition, the linear effects remained significant above and beyond the nonconfirmatory quadratic effects, which the model partialled out 
(Cohen et al., 2003)
. While the results of the quadratic part of the statistical model are not part of our conceptual model, they indicated a significant concave association of felt ambivalence with coping at low levels of recurrence but not at high levels (see 
Figure 2b)
. The Johnson-Neyman technique indicated that 49.2% of the quadratic effects in recurrence were within the region of significance, all of which were at low levels of recurrence. The remaining levels of recurrence, which are of focal interest to our conceptual model, are thus not characterized by quadratic effects 
(Hayes, 2017)
. As such, the quadratic effect of felt ambivalence at RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 13 low recurrence complements the linear effects at higher levels of recurrence orthogonally to our hypotheses, indicating that recurrence impacts the pattern of ambivalence-induced coping even more so than hypothesized. More importantly, however, we conclude that the overall model supports our hypothesized interaction effect between ambivalence and recurrence, with higher ambivalence being related to a stronger motivation for effortful coping at higher levels of recurrence.
Next, we explored potential covariates by step-wise exclusion of nonsignificant variables (i.e., gender, age, response time), which revealed education as a significant covariate, possibly as it correlated with effortful coping, r(494) = -.21, p < .001, and with the interaction term between felt ambivalence and recurrence, r(494) = .09, p = .039. However, the pattern of findings remained the same (see 
Table 2
, model 2).

We report simple slopes at mean values of recurrence and additionally at the median due to a slightly skewed distribution 
(Hayes, 2018)
. Effect sizes are standardized.

McCabe et al. (2018)

The motivational nature of recurring ambivalence
We hypothesized that the aversive recurrence of ambivalent discomfort motivates effortful coping. Consequently, the effect should be primarily driven by the motivational nature of felt RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 15 ambivalence rather than potential ambivalence or perceived importance of an attitude object. In support of this assertion, the interaction effect between felt ambivalence and perceived recurrence on motivation for effortful coping remained significant after controlling for potential ambivalence, positivity and negativity, and attitude importance, β = .10, 95% CI[.02, .18], p = .020. Finally, we tested whether individual differences in future orientation moderated the motivational effect of recurring ambivalence on effortful coping but the three-way interaction effect was nonsignificant, β = .05, 95% CI[-.03, .14], p = .218.


Discussion
The findings obtained in this study support the idea that the motivational consequences of felt ambivalence for engaging in effortful coping depend on the extent to which people perceive the ambivalence to recur. At high levels of perceived recurrence, felt ambivalence correlates with a motivation for more effortful coping, presumably due to recurrence-induced discomfort and a desire to effectively avert future experiences of reappearing ambivalence. However, the present study obtained no significant evidence for dispositional future orientation qualifying the pattern of findings. Importantly, however, the effect of felt ambivalence held above and beyond the effect of potential ambivalence. This pattern of findings suggests that the aversive recurrence of ambivalent discomfort may play a pivotal role in recurring ambivalence leading to more effortful coping. We therefore further investigated this mechanism in Study 2 using an experimental study design.
Interestingly, at low levels of recurrence, the effect size of the association between felt ambivalence and effortful coping was substantially lower and only concave. While this quadratic effect is nonconfirmatory and secondary, it could reflect a dynamic choice of coping strategies as a function of the magnitude of ambivalent discomfort at low levels of recurrence. This aligns with emotion-regulation research showing that individuals engage in more distraction to efficiently downregulate a single-instance episode of highly aversive emotion (compared to less intense emotion) before it can gather force and elicit cognitive processing; cognitive processing would be comparatively less resource-efficient during a high-intensity emotion episode as its costs increase proportionally to emotional intensity . In the context of RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 16 frequently recurring ambivalence, by contrast, the trade-off between cognitive effort and accuracy goals may motivate people to engage in effortful coping despite the discomfort of felt ambivalence, as this is instrumental in averting future experiences of the ambivalence by addressing the root of the problem.


Study 2
Study 1 provided evidence for our central tenet that people adapt their coping strategy to the temporal nature of ambivalence. Specifically, the study revealed an interaction effect of felt ambivalence with its perceived recurrence on motivating more effortful problem-focused coping, such that the association between felt ambivalence and effortful coping is stronger at higher levels of recurrence. The study indicated that this interaction effect could be driven particularly by the discomfort of reexperiencing ambivalence. In Study 2, we replicated and substantiated those findings by manipulating ambivalence and recurrence in a well-controlled experiment with high ecological validity. Additionally, we examined whether the motivational effect of recurring ambivalence is driven by recurrence-induced discomfort. The metacognitive awareness of reexperiencing ambivalence could amplify negative affect about the ambivalence, eliciting a desire to avert the recurrence even through more effortful problem-focused actions despite being cognitively taxing.


Sample
The final sample included 838 Prolific workers from the UK (M age = 35.37, SD = 12.48, 58.0% with university degree, 75.4% identified as female, 23.9% male, 0.7% missing reports). We recruited a total of 898 participants, 6.7% of whom failed at least one quality check and were thus excluded, as planned in advance, i.e., a simple attention check ("select completely disagree"), 2.5 SD or more below the mean response time, or missing or nonsensical text entries for the attitude object.
We aimed to recruit 897 participants with a target sample size of 852 participants, accounting for an exclusion rate of 5%. We determined the sample size in advance based on Study 1 to detect an interaction effect of d = .16 (β = .09) at p = .05 with more than 90% power in a 2x2 between-subjects ANOVA using Superpower 
(Lakens et al., 2019)
 as recommended by 
Giner-Sorolla et al. (2024)
.
Sensitivity power analyses in G*Power 
(Faul et al., 2007)
 indicated that the final sample size afforded RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 17 80% power to detect an effect of d = 0.19 and 50% power for d = 0.13 in the 2x2 ANOVA with alpha = .05.


Procedure
Participants provided informed consent and were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 2x2 design that manipulated ambivalence (vs. indifference) and recurrence (high vs. low). In each of the conditions, a 100-word vignette instructed participants to write down an attitude object: "Please write down a topic you are highly 
[ambivalent / indifferent]
 


Measures
Two items measured felt ambivalence and recurrence as manipulation checks. We utilized one item from the Felt Ambivalence Questionnaire 
(Priester & Petty, 1996)
 with a response scale ranging from 1 (no conflict at all) to 7 (maximum conflict): "Towards the topic I feel…" Recurrence was measured by one question adapted from Study 1 with a response scale ranging from 1 (very infrequently) to 7 (very frequently): "How frequently do you think about the topic?" Subsequently, we assessed the valence of affective reactions to recurrence on two items, i.e., "negative" and "positive" 
(Diener et al., 2010)
, anchored by the question: "When you consider the frequency of you thinking about the topic, to what extent do you feel…". The two response scales ranged from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). While our hypothesis only concerned negative affect, we included positive affect to counterbalance for the negative item. The two items correlated, r(836) = -.28, p < .001. Lastly, effortful problem-focused coping was assessed on the same four items as in Study 1, with excellent internal consistency, α = .92.


Results
Manipulation checks indicated that the experimental conditions successfully manipulated felt ambivalence and recurrence in two t-tests (see 
Table 4
 for descriptives). Felt ambivalence was higher in the ambivalence condition compared to the indifference condition, t(836) = 22.15, p < .001, d = 1.53, and recurrence was higher in the frequent compared to the infrequent recurrence condition, t(836) = 27.26, p < .001, d = 1.88. A two-way ANOVA supported our main assertion of an interaction effect between ambivalence and recurrence on motivation for effortful coping (see 
Figure 3
 and 
Table 4
). As hypothesized, a simple effects analysis showed a larger effect of ambivalence induction on effortful coping in the high recurrence condition compared to the low recurrence condition. Next, we added potential covariates to the model. As in Study 1, education and age were significant covariates without differing by group, and the findings remained the same after controlling for these covariates (see 
Table 4
).

RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 20


Recurrence-induced negative affect
We expected that recurring ambivalence motivates engagement in effortful coping due to the aversive nature of the recurrence. In line with this prediction, a two-way ANOVA indicated that recurrence-induced negative affect was higher in the frequent compared to the infrequent recurrence condition, F(1,834) = 113.25, p < .001, d = 0.24, just as in the ambivalence compared to the indifference condition, F(1,834) = 118.43, p < .001, d = 0.75. However, in contrast to our prediction, the interaction effect between ambivalence and recurrence on negative affect was nonsignificant, F(1,834) = 1.20, p = .274, d = 0.07. We scrutinized this finding in exploratory post-hoc comparisons, revealing that the nonsignificant interaction effect is due to unexpectedly higher negativity in the recurring indifference compared to the nonrecurring indifference condition, t(421) = 3.36, p(Bonferroni-corrected) = .005, d = 0.33 (see 
Table 3
 for descriptives). This exploratory analysis indicates that when people frequently feel indifferent about a topic, they might appraise the recurrence as negative. For example, indifference in daily food choices might hamper decision-making and become mentally taxing when individuals cannot engage in effective decision-making due to a lack of preferences. Overall, the unequivocal main effects of ambivalence and recurrence on negativity demonstrate that individuals generally perceive the recurrence of ambivalence as unpleasant. Next, we tested whether this affective response to recurrence explains the effect of recurring ambivalence on effortful coping.
We conducted a mediation analysis to test for indirect effects of ambivalence, recurrence, and their interaction effect on effortful coping through recurrence-induced negative affect (see 
Figure 4
).
All indirect and direct effects of recurrence and ambivalence were significant (except for the abovementioned indirect effect of the interaction term on negativity). Most importantly, there was a significant direct effect of negativity on coping, as well as indirect effects of ambivalence and recurrence on coping through negativity. Overall, these findings align with the assumption that negative affective reactions to recurring ambivalence drives its motivational effects on effortful coping.

General Discussion
Ambivalent attitudes are ubiquitous in day-to-day life. While previous research has investigated the experience of ambivalence and its consequences by focusing on single instances of the ambivalence without accounting for its persistence over time, the current paper sheds light on the extent to which felt ambivalence naturally reoccurs and how this shapes the way in which individuals cope with the ambivalence. Felt ambivalence may motivate individuals to engage in more effortful coping especially if they recurringly experience the ambivalence, presumably with the aim to effectively resolve the aversive reoccurrence of ambivalence-induced discomfort. In support of this assertion, Study 1 found that recurring ambivalence about an attitude object amplified the correlation of felt ambivalence with effortful problem-focused coping. Moreover, the study reveals the temporal nature of ambivalence in human experiences by highlighting considerable variability in the frequency with which ambivalence about self-generated attitude objects recurs, stemming from attitude RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 22 importance and individual differences in future orientation. Study 2 replicated and substantiated the interaction effect of ambivalence with its recurrence by experimentally manipulating them orthogonally. We found that recurrence and ambivalence increased negative appraisals which, in turn, was associated with a motivation to engage in more effortful coping.
The present findings contribute to prevailing theorizing on the consequences of attitudinal ambivalence 
Rothman et al., 2017;
van Harreveld et al., 2015)
 by showing that temporal dynamics in the experience of ambivalence motivate people to avert the recurrence of felt ambivalence. In line with the notion that individuals trade off cognitive effort against accuracy goals in selecting how they cope with ambivalence , participants in the current studies adapted the choice of coping strategies to temporal features of the felt ambivalence. Specifically, we argue that individuals try to more effortfully reconcile the underlying ambivalent attitude when they experience discomfort about the persistence of ambivalence, presumably with the aim to effectively avert future reappearances of the ambivalence.
Such effects of the aversiveness of recurring ambivalence may amplify the pivotal role of ambivalent discomfort in motivating coping actions 
(Vaccaro et al., 2020;
van Harreveld et al., 2015)
. Finally, the findings contribute to the current debate on beneficial effects of ambivalence 
Pauer et al., 2022;
Rothman et al., 2017;
Schneider et al., 2021)
 by showing that the often advantageous consequences of ambivalence through effortful coping may depend on the temporal characteristics of the ambivalence, with the beneficial effects being more likely to emerge when the ambivalence recurs frequently.


Limitations and future research
The studies tentatively shed light on the mechanisms involved in the consequences of recurring ambivalence on coping. We expected that the downstream consequences of recurring ambivalence are driven by negative appraisals of frequently recurring ambivalence and the desire to avert future reexperiences of the ambivalence, whereas the current studies indicate that especially negative appraisals plays a central role. To gain further insight into the mechanisms involved in the consequences of recurring ambivalence, one could integrate negative appraisals and domain-specific concern about future outcomes 
(Purdon, 2001)
 into a comprehensive process model to scrutinize their RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 23 potential roles. Furthermore, recurring ambivalence likely motivates more effortful coping only if the ambivalence is appraised as undesirable. Thus, an experimental induction of ambivalence desirability (e.g., 
Siev & Petty, 2024)
 should alleviate the effects of recurring ambivalence.
Another worthwhile endeavor may be repeated-measurement designs to manipulate perceived recurrence toward a single attitude object (e.g., 
Newby-Clark et al., 2002)
. Such experimental designs would further strengthen the understanding of the patterns of findings of the present studies in two ways. First, they can reduce the number of potentially confounding variables. Specifically, while introspective tasks, as used in our studies, are widely accepted for investigating ambivalence with high ecological and internal validity 
(Berrios et al., 2015;
van Harreveld et al., 2014)
, they might possibly lead to systematic variability in the ambivalent objects participants report. As this and similar limitations hamper parts of causal inferences in experimental research more generally 
(Diener et al., 2022;
Pauer, Linne, & Erb, 2024;
Schwarz, 1996
Schwarz, , 2012
Yarkoni, 2022)
, we statistically accounted for several third variables in our studies, such as attitude importance. However, experimentally manipulating the recurrence of a single attitude object would provide additional converging evidence for our assertions, as it would provide higher internal validity at the costs of decreased ecological validity and lower generalizability across attitude objects compared to our study designs. Second, a manipulation using repeated measurements lends itself to applying novel statistical models for mediation analysis, which circumvent the limited causal inference of the classical mediation analysis we employed (see 
Loh & Ren, 2023
).
The present research reveals that the recurrence of ambivalence increases the average magnitude of effortful problem-focused coping, in line with their adaptiveness for averting future experiences of ambivalence. While recent research indicates that effortful coping is indeed effective in resolving ambivalence in the long-run, on average 
(Buttlar, Pauer, Ruby, et al., 2024;
Finkhäuser et al., 2024;
Pauer, Rutjens, Hofmann, et al., 2024)
, such investment into an ambivalent attitude would become maladaptive in individuals who fail to resolve ambivalence continuously over a long period of time. This could eventually lead to readjusting the frequency and intensity of effortful problemfocused coping with irreconcilable ambivalence, given the pivotal role of efficacy expectations in selecting coping strategies . As a consequence, individuals RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 24 might possibly revert to less effortful coping at some point in time, such as by preferring to avoid situations that make the ambivalence salient 
Pauer et al., 2022)
. This aligns with our non-confirmatory finding in Study 1 of an inverse U-shaped effect at infrequently recurring ambivalence (see 
Figure 2)
, tentatively supporting the notion that low levels of recurrence make emotion-focused coping with ambivalence more likely, whereas frequently recurring ambivalence leads to more effortful problem-focused coping. Future research could investigate such distinct effects of recurring ambivalence on emotion-and problem-focused coping strategies in several ways. For instance, experimental manipulations of the ease of retrieval 
(Schwarz et al., 1991)
 of recurring ambivalence toward an ambivalent attitude object could more directly test for the suggested effect of recurring ambivalence on increasing problem-focused rather than emotion-focused coping strategies, on average; longitudinal designs could additionally disentangle shifts in the expected heterogeneous dynamics of these effects over prolonged time periods and examine potential nonlinear effects of recurring ambivalence as a function of dispositional coping tendencies (such as acceptance; 
Kelly et al., 2012)
, for example.
Further boundary conditions and mechanisms could be investigated using experimental, cross-cultural, and experience sampling methods. Experimental manipulations of the perceived recurrence of an ambivalent topic could draw on decreasing psychological distance (i.e., hypothetical and temporal distance) to the expected reoccurrence of the ambivalence and, thus, increase the specificity and aversiveness of its mental representation .
Experience sampling methods could observe the actual frequency with which ambivalence recurs in daily life  and test whether its consequences depend on appraisals of recurrence even after controlling for objective recurrence. One could similarly explore emotions associated with the motivational effects of recurring ambivalence, such as anticipated relief and annoyance 
(Belloch et al., 2004;
Sweeny & Vohs, 2012
).
The present studies provide ecologically valid as well as experimentally controlled insights into the relevance of temporal dynamics for the experience of ambivalence. By illuminating these dynamics, we demonstrate that a temporal perspective helps to further our understanding of how RECURRING AMBIVALENCE 25 people experience ambivalence and what the consequences of this experience are for coping with the ambivalence.

The response scales ranged from 1 (not at all negative [/positive] to 7 (extremely negative [/positive]. We computed potential ambivalence utilizing Thompson et al.
