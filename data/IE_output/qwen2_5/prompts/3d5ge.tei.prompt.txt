You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
A confidence judgment about a current stimulus can be predicted from a previous confidence judgment about a different stimulus. This confidence serial dependence phenomenon is known as "confidence leak" 
(Rahnev et al., 2015;
Mei et al., 2023)
. Confidence leak is thought to occur across virtually any task and domain but nonetheless remains severely underexplored. In fact, it has been explicitly investigated in only five papers 
(Mueller & Weidemann, 2008;
Rahnev et al., 2015;
Kantner et al., 2019;
Aguilar-Lleyda et al., 2021;
Mei et al., 2023)
 and one conference abstract 
(Ng et al., 2021)
.
The earliest investigation of confidence leak appears to be in a paper focused on providing evidence for decision noise in perceptual decision-making 
(Mueller & Weidemann, 2008
). Mueller & Weidemann showed that subjects had a tendency to repeat the same confidence judgment in consecutive trials, which shows the existence of noise in the confidence criterion placement. The first paper specifically devoted to confidence serial dependence showed that confidence leaks across different perceptual tasks and different ways of indicating confidence, thus ruling out simple motor confounds 
(Rahnev et al., 2015)
. Confidence leak was subsequently demonstrated within recognition memory and was even shown to occur across tasks from different domains (in this case memory and perception) 
(Kantner et al., 2019)
.
Similarly, 
Mei et al. (2023)
 showed that a classifier trained on confidence serial dependence in one domain can predict confidence serial dependence in different domains. Finally, confidence leak has been shown to occur even when the previous trial did not require an explicit confidence judgment 
(Aguilar-Lleyda et al., 2021)
.
As the brief review above shows, while confidence leak has been established as a ubiquitous and robust phenomenon, it is still unclear whether the strength of the effect can be modulated. One particular source of modulation could be the motor action used to make a response. Indeed, both first-order choices and confidence judgments in simple psychophysical tasks are mediated by the action required to indicate the decision 
(Prinz, 1990;
Creem-Regehr & Kunz, 2010;
Lepora & Pezzulo, 2015;
Selen et al., 2012;
Burk et al., 2014;
Fleming et al., 2015;
Gajdos et al., 2019;
Kubanek et al., 2024)
. Some modulations of first-order choices include the motor effort 
(Burk et al., 2014)
 or the motor cost 
(Gajdos et al., 2019)
 of the action associated with the decision, where perceptual decisions associated with less costly actions are preferred.
Confidence judgments have also been shown to depend on the perceptual-motor mapping of representations 
(Faivre et al., 2020;
Fleming et al., 2015;
Gajdos et al., 2019)
. For example, TMS perturbations of premotor cortical regions influence confidence without affecting signal discrimination abilities 
(Fleming et al., 2015)
. Overall, motor actions have been shown to robustly affect confidence judgments, but whether or not they also modulate confidence serial dependence remains unknown.
To test whether the perceptual-motor link also mediates the strength of the confidence leak effect, we conducted two experiments where subjects completed an orientation discrimination task. Critically, on different trials, subjects were randomly cued to respond using either the left or right hand. We found that switching the motor response significantly decreased the strength of confidence serial dependence. However, we also found that using the left hand on the previous trial was associated with weaker confidence leak, suggesting an underlying mechanism that goes beyond recently formed perceptual-motor mappings. These results suggest that different motor aspects of making a decision influence the amount of confidence leak observed in future judgments.


Methods


Subjects
Forty-five subjects participated in Experiment 1 and 51 subjects participated in Experiment 2. These sample sizes allow for power of 91% and 94%, respectively, to detect a medium effect size (Cohen's d = .5) with a false alarm rate of alpha = .05. A total of four subjects were excluded (three for Experiment 1 and one for Experiment 2) for using a single confidence rating in over 90% of the trials, because such extreme responses make estimates of confidence serial dependence unstable. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and signed a consent form prior to participation.


Stimuli and procedure
In both experiments, subjects completed a 2-choice orientation discrimination task. Each trial began with a 500-ms fixations screen, followed by a Gabor patch presented for 200 ms in the center of the screen 
(Figure 1
). After the stimulus disappeared, subjects were required to indicate the correct Gabor patch orientation (counterclockwise vs. clockwise from vertical).
After they made a choice, subjects gave a confidence rating on a 4-point scale where 1 is the lowest and 4 is the highest confidence rating. Both decisions were untimed. The Gabor patches (size = 4° of visual angle) were oriented 45° clockwise or counterclockwise relative to vertical, with a spatial frequency of 1.5 cycles per degree. The Gabor patches were presented in two contrast conditions (low vs. high). Both Gabor orientations appeared with equal probability throughout the experiment. hand the response should be made with. In Experiment 2, left-hand responses were made with the keyboard, whereas right-hand responses were made with a mouse. In both experiments, the confidence judgment was made with the same hand as the perceptual decision.
Both experiments consisted of a total of 1000 trials separated into 4 runs, where each run consisted of 5 blocks of 50 trials each. Subjects were given 15-second breaks between blocks and unlimited breaks between runs.
The training phase consisted of three blocks in total. The first block consisted of 20 trials where the Gabor contrast was fixed to 0.4. The other two training blocks consisted of 15 trials each with Gabor contrast set to 0.18 and 0.14, respectively. Decreasing contrast at this rate made the task harder with each training block. During the training session, subjects were given trialby-trial feedback about the accuracy of their response. The training blocks were followed by two staircase blocks used to estimate the optimal contrast level for each subject. The first staircase block was a 2-down-1-up with a step size of .01 and a total of 14 reversals. The second staircase was a 3-down-1-up and had the same parameters. The two contrast levels in the actual experiment (low vs. high) were set separately for each subject by either dividing the mean value across the two staircases by 1.2 (resulting in a low contrast value) or multiplying it by 1.2 (resulting in a high contrast value). The average values of the low and high contrasts were 8.1%
(SD = 0.09) and 11% (SD = 0.09) for Experiment 1, and 5.8% (SD = 0.01) and 8.4% (SD = 0.01) for Experiment 2, respectively.


Experiment 1: Keyboard only
In Experiment 1, subjects were instructed to make their perceptual and confidence decisions with either the left or right hand using a keyboard. Left-and right-hand prompts appeared with equal probability throughout the experiment. The hand condition was randomly determined on each trial with no constraints relative to the previous trials. Perceptual and confidence responses within a trial were always given with the same hand. Whenever the left hand was prompted, responses were given by pressing "Z" for a counterclockwise-oriented Gabor and "X" for a clockwise-oriented Gabor, and confidence ratings were given via "Z", "X", "C", and "V", where "Z" indicated the lowest confidence and "V" indicated to the highest confidence. Similarly, when the right hand was prompted, responses were given by pressing "N" for a counterclockwise-oriented Gabor and "M" for a clockwise-oriented Gabor. Confidence ratings were given via the "N", "M", "<" and ">" keys, where "N" indicated the lowest confidence and ">" indicated the highest confidence.


Experiment 2: Keyboard and mouse
In Experiment 2, subjects were instructed to make their perceptual and confidence decisions with either a keyboard (using their left hand) or a mouse (using their right hand). As in Experiment 1, left-and right-hand prompts were determined randomly on a trial-by-trial basis.
The left-hand keyboard responses were the same as in Experiment 1: subjects gave their responses by pressing "Z" for a counterclockwise-oriented Gabor and "X" for a clockwiseoriented Gabor and gave their confidence ratings with keys "Z" through "V". Subjects gave mouse responses by checking boxes on the screen to first give their perceptual judgment and subsequently indicate their confidence rating on a 4-point scale.


Apparatus
Stimuli in both experiments were generated using Psychophysics Toolbox in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and were presented on a gray background (6.0 cd/m2). The task was ran on an iMac monitor (19 inch monitor size, 1680 × 1050 pixel resolution, 60 Hz refresh rate).
Subjects sat 60 cm away from the monitor.


Analyses
We first excluded trials with response times (RTs) over 3000 ms in either the perceptual or confidence judgment (2.24% and 4.65% of trials were excluded in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively). Out of these, 2.08% and 0.95% trials featured overly slow perceptual responses, 0.13% and 2.64% trials featured overly slow confidence responses, and 0.02% and 1.06% trials featured overly slow responses of both types. We used repeated measures ANOVAs to assess the effect of current and previous contrast on confidence and task performance. We then employed linear regression to compute both choice and confidence serial dependence by fitting the lagged series (t-1) of trials as a predictor of the regular time series for repeat-hand and switch-hand trials separately:
Response = + 1 Response −1 + ϵ Confidence = 0 + 1 Confidence −1 + ϵ
We used paired sample t-tests to compare the beta coefficients, accuracy, confidence, RT, and metacognitive sensitivity for repeat-hand and switch-hand trials. To assess the effect of hand switching on metacognitive sensitivity, we used the metadpy package for Python 
(Fleming, 2017
) and computed meta-d' 
(Maniscalco & Lau, 2012;
 separately for repeat-hand and switch-hand trials. To assess whether hand dominance modulated confidence leak and average confidence, we assumed that statistically the majority of our subjects would be right-handed since we did not record hand dominance. We used the same analyses for comparing previous left-hand and right-hand responses.

Results
Our goal was to investigate how motor aspects of making a decision influence confidence serial dependence. To do so, we manipulated the hand with which subjects gave their motor response. We then compared confidence serial dependence when the same hand was used in consecutive trials vs. when a hand switch occurred. 


Manipulation checks
We first confirmed that subjects performed better for high compared to low Gabor contrast. This was indeed the case for both experiments (Expt 1: high contrast = 82% correct; low contrast = 69% correct (t(41) = 19.9, p = 1.06 x 10 -22 , Cohen's d = 3.07; Expt 2: high contrast = 80% correct; low contrast = 67% correct (t(49) = 27.8, p = 1.01 x 10 -31 , Cohen's d = 3.94). Similarly, higher Gabor contrast led to higher confidence ratings (Expt 1: t(41) = 9.29, p = 1.21 x 10 -11 , Cohen's d = 1.43; Expt 2: t(49) = 10.48, p = 4.10 x 10 -14 , Cohen's d = 1.48).
We further confirmed the existence of robust confidence serial dependence (Expt 1: average β = .3, p = 3.44 x 10 -18 , Cohen's d = 2.3; Expt 2: average β = .3, p = 1.33 x 10 -21 , Cohen's d = 2.3). Similar to 
Rahnev et al., (2015)
, experimentally manipulating confidence on the previous trial by varying the contrast level of Gabor patches had a causal effect on confidence on the current trial (Expt 1: F(1, 41) = 50.61, p = 1.03 x 10 -8 , ηp 2 = .55; Expt 2: F(1, 49) = 52.89, p = 2.46 x 10 -9 , ηp 2 = .51).


Confidence leak strength decreases for switch-hand trials
Having established the existence of robust confidence leak, we then turned to the main analyses where we compared confidence leak between repeat-hand and switch-hand trials. In Experiment 1, we found significant confidence leak for both repeat-hand (average β = .33, t(41) = 15.9, p = 3.76 x 10 -19 , Cohen's d = 2.43) and switch-hand trials (average β = .28, t(41) = 13.2, p = 2.56 x 10 -16 , Cohen's d = 2.03). Critically, the strength (β value) of confidence serial dependence was higher in the repeat-hand condition (t(41) = 4.9, p = .00002, Cohen's d = .75; 
Figure 2
). These results were replicated in Experiment 2. Specifically, confidence leak was significant for both repeat-hand (average β = .34, t(49) = 18.6, p = 7.32 x 10 -24 , Cohen's d = 10 2.62) and switch-hand trials (average β = .25, t(49) = 10.2, p = 9.25 x -14 , Cohen's d = 1.44), but was crucially higher for repeat-hand trials (t(49) = 3.92, p = .0002, Cohen's d = .55). These results show that switching the motor response weakens confidence serial dependence. We ran the same analyses for the main perceptual decision (left vs. right Gabor patch tilt). Regular choice serial dependence was significant for repeat (average β = .12, t(49) = 7.03, p = 1.47 x 10 -8 , Cohen's d = 1.08) and switch (average β = .08, t(49) = 5.04, p = 9.71 x 10 -6 , Cohen's d = .77) trials. Just like with confidence leak, repeating the motor response significantly increased the strength of serial dependence (t(41) = 3.5, p = .001, Cohen's d = .54). In Experiment 2, the same was true for repeat (average β = .1, t(49) = 7.85, p = 3.20 x 10-10 , Cohen's d = 1.11) and switch (average β = .06, t(49) = 4.91, p = 1.04 x 10 -5 , Cohen's d = .69) trials. Once again, the difference between the two conditions was significant (t(49) = 4.89, p = .00001, Cohen's d = .69). These results indicate that although the choice serial dependence was much weaker than confidence leak, the motor response modulated both effects to a similar degree (average Cohen's d was .62 for choice serial dependence and .65 for confidence leak).
To better understand what drives the hand-switching effect on confidence leak, we investigated how hand-switching affected accuracy, confidence, metacognitive sensitivity, and RT. We found that repeating vs. switching the hand response did not affect accuracy (Expt 1: t(41) = .581, p = .564; Expt 2: t(49) = -.538, p = .593), confidence (Expt 1: t(41) = .31, p = .758;
Expt 2: t(49) = 1.37, p = .175), or meta-d' (Expt 1: t(41) = 0.002, p = .998; Expt 2: t(49) = 0.42, p = .671). These results suggest that switching the response hand does not impair the first-order representation of the stimulus and does not make confidence more in line with the current sensory evidence (meta-d').
However, as would be expected, RT was significantly lower for repeat-hand than switchhand trials (Expt 1: t(41) = 11.67, p = 1.29 x 10 -14 , Cohen's d = 1.8; Expt 2: t(49) = 14.49, p = 2.39 x 10 -19 , Cohen's d = 2.05). These results suggest the possibility that the stronger confidence leak effect in repeat-hand trials is because these trials were closer in time. However, if proximity in time indeed causally affects the strength of confidence leak, we would expect that the strength of confidence leak would be modulated by factors that affect RT. Contrary to this prediction, we found that even though low-contrast stimuli led to higher RT (Expt 1: t(41) = 4.73, p = 2.63 x 10 -5 , Cohen's d: 0.73; Expt 2: t(49) = 6.001, p = 2.32 x 10 -7 , Cohen's d: 0.84), they did not affect the confidence leak strength on the next trial (Expt 1: t(41) = -.34, p = .732; Expt 2: t(49) = -.61, p = .542). Similarly, although RT was longer in the first vs. second half of the experiments (Expt 1: t(41) = 4.02, p = .0002, Cohen's d = 0.62; Expt 2: t(49) = 13.24, p = 8.32 x 10-18, Cohen's d = 1.87), there was no difference between the confidence leak strength for the two halves of the experiments (Expt 1: t(41) = 7.74, p = 1.50 x 10 -9 , Cohen's d = 1.19; Expt 2: t(49) = 14.4, p = 3.13 x 10 -19 , Cohen's d = 2.04). Therefore, RT is unlikely to causally affect the strength of confidence leak.


Confidence leak strength is lower when the prior response is made with the left hand
As reviewed earlier, confidence judgments are known to be modulated by the motor effort of the response 
(Gajdos et al., 2019;
Faivre et al., 2020)
. Correspondingly, one may expect that motor effort would mediate confidence leak as well. In Experiment 1, this type of effect should lead to lower confidence leak when subjects used the left hand on the previous trial because that is the non-dominant hand for about 90% of people 
(Raymond et al., 1996)
. Indeed, we found that confidence serial dependence was significantly weaker when using the left hand in a previous trial (t(41) = 3.7, p = .0006, Cohen's d = .57) 
(Figure 3)
.
In contrast to Experiment 1, the design in Experiment 2 is more complex, which allows for different predictions. On one hand, one may postulate that motor costs are higher for lefthand responses (since the left hand is usually non-dominant) and therefore predict higher confidence leak when the right hand was used on the previous trial. On the other hand, one may postulate that motor costs are higher for right-hand responses (since people used their right hand to give responses via the mouse, and making responses with a mouse requires more complex motor action) and therefore predict higher confidence leak when the right hand was used on the previous trial. To find out which prediction is correct, we performed the same analyses for Experiment 2 as in Experiment 1. We found weaker confidence leak when using the left hand on the previous trial (t(49) = 3.9, p = .0003, Cohen's d = .55), which is consistent with the expected effects of hand-dominance but contrary to the expected effects of increased motor complexity due to using the mouse. Together, these results demonstrate that motor effort can modulate confidence leak strength, and suggest that the hand dominance effect has a stronger influence than the means by which the response is given. One possibility is that the hand dominance effect on confidence leak may be driven by differences in confidence on the previous trial for left-vs. right-hand responses. Indeed, increased motor cost has previously been associated with higher confidence 
(Turner et al., 2021;
Sanchez et al., 2024)
. We found that left-handed responses resulted in higher confidence in Experiment 1 (t(41) = 3.1, p = .003, Cohen's d = .48; 
Figure 4
) but marginally lower confidence in Experiment 2 (t(49) = 1.7, p = .08). This flip in the effects between Experiments 1 and 2 is likely due to the fact that in Experiment 2, right-hand responses were given with the mouse, 14 which may make them have higher motor cost. Although these results are consistent with the idea that motor cost promotes higher confidence, they are not consistent with the conjecture that higher confidence on costly trials will diminish confidence leak. This conclusion is further reinforced by the finding that switching the hand does not affect confidence (see previous section). the effect of hand dominance on average confidence did not extend to hand switching, once again pointing towards the idea that hand dominance and action complexity should be grasped as two separate motor cost variables. Namely, left-handed responses on the previous trial weakened confidence leak in both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, irrespective of the complexity of the action.

. Confidence is higher for the more costly motor response. Confidence was higher for left-handed responses in Experiment 1. We found higher confidence on average when the decision was reported via the non-dominant hand. Similarly, there was a trend towards higher confidence for the more costly motor action (mouse response) in Experiment 2. Error bars depict


SEM.
Lastly, we checked whether the effect of left-and right-handed responses on confidence leak extended to the 2-back trial. We first ran a repeated-measures ANOVA with hand used on trial N-1 and trial N-2 as predictors of confidence leak. Consistent with our previous results, the hand prompt on trial N-1 had a significant effect on confidence leak in Experiment 1 (F(1, 41) = 12.94, p = .0009, ηp 2 = .23) and in Experiment 2 (F(1, 49) = 14.92, p = .0003, ηp 2 = .23).
However, the hand used on trial N-2 did not affect the strength of confidence leak in either Experiment 1 (F(1, 41) = 2.16, p = .148) or Experiment 2 (F(1, 49) = 0.07, p = .779). Together, these results suggest that confidence leak is only influenced by the current and the immediately preceding motor action.


Discussion
Confidence leak is a temporal judgment bias where confidence in a current trial can be predicted based on confidence from the preceding trial. It has been shown to occur across various tasks 
(Rahnev et al., 2015)
 and cognitive domains 
(Mei et al., 2023;
Kantner et al., 2019;
Aguilar-Lleyda et al., 2021)
. However, it is unclear whether the strength of this bias can be artificially reduced. We created a perceptual task where subjects were required to discriminate between two Gabor orientations by unpredictably switching the motor response. Across two experiments, we found that confidence leak decreases with switching the hand used to give the response. Moreover, we showed that confidence leak was weaker whenever the left hand was used in the previous trial, irrespective of motor action complexity. These results suggest that the degree of confidence leak can be modulated by the motor aspects of the task.
The fact that switching the motor response decreased the strength of confidence leak is in line with prior research on the motor influences on confidence itself. Indeed, as discussed in the Introduction, multiple studies have demonstrated that our motor actions can influence confidence judgments 
(Fleming et al., 2015;
Gajdos et al., 2019)
. Specifically, 
Fleming et al.
 showed that TMS stimulation of motor areas associated with the unchosen response reduced confidence in the correctness of the perceptual decision. Further, confidence has been found to be significantly higher in trials with EMG-recorded subthreshold motor activity 
(Gajdos et al., 2019)
. Together, these results support the general decision-making argument that decisional variables are passed onto the motor system before a decision is made 
(Selen et al., 2012;
Kubanek & Kaplan, 2012)
.
However, our results build on this understanding of perception-action modulations by showing that motor changes can behaviorally disrupt confidence serial dependence across trials while keeping perceptual performance and metacognitive sensitivity intact.
We found that using the left hand in a previous trial reduced confidence leak. In other words, confidence judgments made with the left hand are less able to influence subsequent confidence judgments (regardless of which hand is used in the subsequent judgment). One possible interpretation of this finding is that using one's non-dominant hand to indicate a decision incurs motor cost (note that while we did not record hand dominance, the right hand is dominant for about 90% of the population; 
Raymond et al., 1996)
. The motor cost associated with the use of one's non-dominant hand may interfere with the strength of the encoding of the confidence judgment. Specifically, if more attention and cognitive resources are devoted to the response action, there may be fewer resources left for encoding the confidence variable, which would then reduce the influence of the current confidence judgment on subsequent decisions. This interpretation is in line with previous findings that motor cost can influence perceptual decisions 
(Marcos et al., 2015;
Hagura et al., 2017)
. Our findings suggest that higher motor cost not only influences the current perceptual decision but also interferes with the process of using the decision (and its associated confidence) in subsequent decision-making.
There are important implications of confidence leak modulation. In general, confidence leak can be cast as a type of metacognitive noise 
(Shekhar & Rahnev, 2021a;
2021b;
. That is, confidence leak induces noise in the confidence criteria by pulling them up or down based on the confidence in the previous trial 
(Rahnev et al., 2015)
. Therefore, the fact that increasing the motor costs can reduce confidence leak suggests that it should also reduce metacognitive noise.
That said, the reduction of confidence leak in the current experiments was insufficient to cause a significant increase in metacognitive sensitivity. Nevertheless, low confidence leak has been shown to correlate with metacognitive sensitivity 
(Rahnev et al., 2015)
, and therefore motor manipulations hold promise for reducing metacognitive noise.
Our results raise the question as to whether other manipulations can also modulate confidence leak. Prior research has demonstrated that confidence ratings themselves can be influenced by a variety of factors such as arousal level 
(Allen et al., 2016;
Hauser et al., 2017)
, brain stimulation 
(Rounis et al., 2010;
Fetsch et al., 2014;
Shekhar & Rahnev, 2018;
Xue et al., 2023)
, evidence volatility 
(Zylberger et al., 2016;
Boldt et al., 2017)
, and stimulus uncertainty 
(Kiani et al., 2014;
Zylberger et al., 2014;
de Gardelle & Mamassian, 2015;
Spence et al., 2018)
.
It is reasonable to hypothesize that some of these factors would affect not only the confidence on the current trial but also the strength with which the confidence on the current trial influences confidence on the subsequent trial. We expect that future studies will demonstrate additional influence on confidence leak beyond the motor costs examined in the current study.
In conclusion, we showed that confidence serial dependence can be modulated by switching the motor response in a perceptual task. In addition, we found weaker confidence leak when the non-dominant hand was used in the previous trial. Together, these results demonstrate that the action required to make a choice influences future metacognitive judgments.
