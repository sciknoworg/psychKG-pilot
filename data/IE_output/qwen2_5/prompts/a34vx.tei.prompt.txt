You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
People from distinct socioeconomic backgrounds often exhibit differences in attitudes, behaviors and decision-making patterns. Research has demonstrated that individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES) tend to show higher risk aversion 
(Haushofer & Fehr, 2014
), greater present bias 
(Brown et al., 2015;
Griskevicius et al., 2011;
Lawrance, 1991)
, lower levels of trust 
(Bigoni et al., 2022;
Jachimowicz et al., 2017)
, and a diminished sense of control 
(Kraus et al., 2009)
. Several researchers have suggested that these differences in behavioral and attitudinal patterns are mediated by heightened levels of stress experienced by low-SES individuals 
(Baum et al., 1999;
Haushofer & Fehr, 2014;
Kraft & Kraft, 2021;
Matthews & Gallo, 2011)
. Even though SES differences in major life events are well established 
(Hatch & Dohrenwend, 2007)
, we know less about how differences in SES are related to more mundane, everyday experiences of stress, which can be described as 'daily hassles'. This study aims to investigate how daily hassles vary with SES and how they influence attitudes and decision-making.
Daily hassles are defined as small, often recurring challenges of daily living that can accumulate and significantly impact an individual's psychological well-being and health 
(Lazarus & Folkman, 1984;
Turner et al., 1995;
Zheng et al., 2023)
. Unlike major life events, which are infrequent but momentous, daily hassles tend to be more subtle but pervasive, potentially leading to chronic stress 
(Almeida, 2005)
. Generally, people differ in their exposure and vulnerability to daily hassles, with both exposure and vulnerability playing distinct roles in how stress affects them. Exposure refers to the extent to which individuals encounter hassling stressors, and can be broken down into two subdomains: exposure frequency, which is how often hassles occur, and exposure intensity, which refers to the severity of these hassles. Vulnerability refers to how susceptible a person is to the negative effects of these hassles. Vulnerability is shaped by factors such as emotional regulation, resilience, and coping mechanisms. People with greater psychological resources and resilience tend to exhibit lower vulnerability, perceiving daily hassles as less disruptive, while those with fewer resources are more likely to experience greater emotional reactivity and negative outcomes in response to daily hassles .
While research on SES differences in major life events 
(Hatch & Dohrenwend, 2007)
, and differences in perceived overall life stress 
(Hamad et al., 2008)
 are well established, the empirical basis for a social gradient in the frequency and intensity of daily hassles remains scarce. A study found that while individuals with higher levels of education experienced more daily hassles more frequently, the hassles reported by those with lower education levels were more intense 
(Grzywacz et al., 2004)
. SES may not only affect the frequency and intensity of daily hassles but also affects individuals' capacity to cope with these hassles.
Low-SES individuals tend to be more vulnerable to hassles because they often have fewer coping resources, such as social support or access to health care 
(Jachimowicz et al., 2022;
Kraus et al., 2009;
Lachman & Weaver, 1998;
Snibbe & Markus, 2005)
. These hassles, when experienced regularly, can deplete psychological resources, resulting in negative outcomes such as lower life satisfaction, poorer health, and diminished decision-making capacity 
(Grzywacz et al., 2004)
.
The present study investigates how SES is related to both the exposure to daily hassles, and individuals' vulnerability to these hassles. We hypothesize that low-SES individuals experience more frequent and more intense daily hassles, and that these hassles partly explain SES differences in attitudes and decision making. To test these hypotheses, we recruited UK adults and divided them into high-and low-SES groups based on subjective SES ratings 
(Adler et al., 2000)
. Over the course of one week, participants provided daily descriptions of events from their lives, and their content was subsequently rated by an advanced natural language processing model (ChatGPT). Using language models in psychological research offers significant benefits due to their ability to produce consistent, reproducible, and valid measures from large volumes of qualitative data 
(Yang et al., 2024)
.
This approach enhances the reliability of findings and minimizes subjective biases, making it a valuable tool for generating robust insights in social science research. As such, these ratings allowed us to objectively assess the nature of participants' daily hassles and make inferences about differences in exposure and vulnerability across SES groups. Furthermore, we explored how these daily hassles were related to key attitudinal outcomes such as trust, risk preferences, time preferences, and sense of control.
This study seeks to address several key questions: how socioeconomic status is related to people's exposure to daily hassles, including their frequency and intensity (RQ1), and how people's appraisals of these daily hassles differ depending on their SES (RQ2). Furthermore, it explores how the experience of daily hassles is linked to attitudinal outcomes such as trust, sense of control, risk preferences, and time preferences (RQ3), and whether daily hassles are associated with broader evaluations of overall life stress and life satisfaction (RQ4). By answering these questions, this study aims to deepen our understanding of how daily hassles shape the social gradient in decision-making, health, and well-being.


Methods


Participants and procedure
We recruited UK-based participants from Prolific, an online platform that connects researchers with participants for research purposes, in two groups according to participants' subjective SES as measured by the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status 
(Adler et al., 2000)
. On Prolific, all participants are required to answer a set of questions when they initially sign up for the platform. These responses are used to create a profile that allows researchers to recruit participants based on specific criteria, such as demographics, experiences, or self-perceptions indicated in their answers. Thus, for the onboarding session, we sampled people who indicated a low rank (1 to 3) as part of the low-SES group, which represents the bottom 12.16% of the UK sample on Prolific. For the high-SES group, wer recruited people with a high rank (8 to 10), which represents the top 5.72% of the UK sample on Prolific. Within the onboarding session, we asked participants again for their subjective SES, and only invited participants with a low rank (1 to 4) and a high rank (7 to 10) back to the daily diaries.
Our final sample consisted of 230 participants, 113 in the low-and 117 in the high-SES group. For further demographic information, see 
Table 1
.


Onboarding
The onboarding session consisted of a short questionnaire asking some demographic questions on age, gender, income, education and employment status. Participants indicated their rank on the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status 
(Adler et al., 2000)
. We included this measure to obtain an updated and accurate assessment of participants' perceived social status, as some individuals may have signed up for Prolific several years earlier, making their previous self-assessment potentially outdated. This was important because we aimed to recruit participants who currently perceive themselves as either high or low on the social ladder, ensuring that our sample accurately reflected their current subjective social status.


Daily diaries
For the following week, all participants were asked to complete one diary per day, each night between 6 pm and 12 pm. Within the daily diary, we asked participants to report on three negative events that had happened to them within the last 24 hours. After they reported each event, we asked them to rate the event on how stressful, disruptive, unpredictable and controllable the event was, how much it put at risk their financial situation and their future plans, as well as how much time has passed since the event took place. We adapted these questions from the Daily Inventory of Stressful Events 
(Almeida et al., 2002)
. After participants reported on all three events, we asked them if any other stressful events had happened within the last 24 hours.


Offboarding
During the offboarding questionnaire, we asked participants how stressful they generally found their life (i.e. overall life stress), their life satisfaction 
(Cheung & Lucas, 2014)
, their sense of control 
(Lachman & Weaver, 1998)
, their time and risk preferences 
(Falk et al., 2016)
, as well as their trust in people 
(Rosenberg, 1956)
.


Event ratings
To better understand the types of events people reported in the daily diary portion of our study, we leveraged large language models to rate the written accounts of participants' negative experiences over the course of a week. This rich dataset of personal narratives required an unbiased, systematic approach to annotate and categorize the events. Large language models have proven useful to annotate large data of written text in the past 
(Dubourg et al., 2023;
Udayar et al., 2023)
, ensuring objectivity. When annotating data within psychology, researchers mainly rely on ratings from multiple raters in order to improve the reliability and objectivity of assessments. When multiple individuals rate the same behavior or phenomenon, the impact of any one rater's subjective bias or error is reduced, resulting in more accurate and consistent measurements. Although large language models can already address some of the reasons why multiple raters are essential, we took advantage of the fact that these models are constantly evolving. To further improve the reliability and objectivity of our ratings generated by large language models, we relied on different versions of ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-turbo and gpt-4o) to annotate the total of 4551 events reported by our participants. We asked ChatGPT to annotate each event on 6 of the 8 dimensions from the daily diary part. More specifically, we asked ChatGPT to take the perspective of an average person living in the UK, and indicate on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much, how much the event was stressful, disruptive, unpredictable and controllable, how much it put their financial situation and their future plans at risk. We also asked ChatGPT to determine whether each event should be classified as a daily hassle, providing it with a definition of the concept beforehand. Finally, we requested ChatGPT to categorize the event into one of the following domains: financial, physical, relational, environmental, professional, or other.


ChatGPT as rater: Interclass Correlation Coefficient with human raters
To evaluate the reliability of the automatic annotations, we conducted an additional assessment involving human raters. We selected a random subsample of 200 events and had them rated by six human evaluators on the same six dimensions. We then calculated the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to measure the consistency between the human raters' assessments and the annotations produced by ChatGPT. For our main variable of interest (how stressful the event was), the resulting ICC value was .63, indicating a substantial level of agreement and suggesting that the automated annotations are reasonably aligned with human raters 
(Koo & Li, 2016)
.


Calculating variables Exposure frequency
Prior studies, which have primarily used structured telephone interviews to assess the experience of daily hassles, have found that most participants report experiencing less than one hassle per day 
(Klusmann et al., 2021;
Grywacz et al., 2004)
. However, it remains unclear whether a difference in reported daily hassles truly reflects a difference in experienced daily hassles, as SES might influence how individuals identify and classify events as hassles. For instance, Grywacz et al. 
(2004)
 found that higher levels of education were associated with reporting a greater frequency of daily hassles, though these hassles were less intensely negative. This raises the question of whether higher education genuinely increases the frequency of daily hassles or if it merely increases individuals' likelihood of reporting them. More educated individuals may be better at articulating and identifying challenges, thereby appearing to experience more hassles when, in reality, the actual frequency remains unchanged.
To address potential reporting bias, participants were instructed to report three events per day, prioritizing negative events. If fewer than three negative events occurred, they could report any events from that day. These events were then classified by large language models (i.e., ChatGPT) as either counting as a daily hassle or not. In our analyses, an event was considered a daily hassle if at least two out of three ChatGPT ratings classified it as such. Additionally, at the end of each day, participants were asked if any other negative events had occurred. For participants who had already reported three daily hassles as identified by ChatGPT but also indicated experiencing more than three negative events, the frequency variable was assigned a value of 4 to reflect that they experienced more than three hassles. This adjustment was made on 6.59% of recorded days.


Exposure intensity
Exposure intensity was calculated as the average stress rating assigned by ChatGPT for all events identified as daily hassles. This rating reflects the perceived severity of each hassle, aggregated to provide an overall measure of the intensity of daily hassles experienced by the participant. 


Domain
To assign each event to a specific domain, we used the agreement of the three ChatGPT ratings. Building on earlier work on daily hassles 
(Almeida et al., 2002)
, we categorized domains of daily hassles into the following types: financial, health, relational, environmental, and professional. As with the categorization of events into daily hassles, an event was assigned to a particular domain if at least two out of three ChatGPT ratings agreed. Events where no two ChatGPT ratings concurred were classified as NA (Not Applicable; 2.04% of all events). This classification helps in understanding the context in which daily hassles occur and allows for domain-specific analyses of stress exposure and vulnerability.


Open science statement
Following open science standards, we pre-registered our sample size, sampling approach, measures, hypotheses, and analysis plan prior to conducting the study. For full access to our data, analysis scripts, pre-registration details, and materials, please visit our Open Science Framework project: https://osf.io/5ugzv/?view_only=9ed1981d6fe54ea7abcabb1c5b7d9740.
All pre-registered hypotheses (RQ1-4) are reported within the results section.
We deviated from our pre-registration by opting to use ChatGPT for annotating event descriptions instead of external human raters, as originally planned. This decision allowed us to take advantage of recent advancements in large language models. To validate this approach, we collected independent ratings from human raters for a subset of 200 events, providing a comparative benchmark, the results of which are reported above.


Analysis strategy
In our pre-registered analysis, we examined the relationship between SES and both exposure and vulnerability to daily hassles, as well as how these experiences of hassles are linked to attitudinal measures. For our primary analyses, we used MANOVAs to detect overall SES-based differences in hassle exposure, vulnerability, and appraisal dimensions.
We conducted targeted post-hoc analyses, using t-tests or simple linear regressions to examine specific hypotheses. Significance was assessed at the 0.05 alpha level, using one-sided tests for hypotheses with directional predictions.
We performed several exploratory analyses, looking at SES differences in hassles, stress responses and decision-making.


Results
For all demographics of the sample, see 
Table 1
.   


SES differences in event appraisals
We found no SES difference in people's appraisals of the events in our pre-registered MANOVA (RQ2), F(5, 224) = 1.262, p = .281. However, post-hoc analyses revealed significant differences in perceived control over the events, with participants from the low-SES group reporting lower levels of control, t(225.25) = -1.719, p = .043, d = -0.227.
Furthermore, participants in the low-SES group reported events as more threatening to their own health, t(219.15) = 2.074, p = .020, d = 0.274. When looking at differences in terms of GPT ratings between events reported by low-vs. high-SES participants, we did not observe any significant difference, all ps > .05 (for all statistics, see Appendix B).
We identified differences between the low-and high-SES groups regarding the life domains in which they encountered hassles as classified by ChatGPT, 2 (5) = 55.952, p < .001. More specifically, participants in the low-SES group experienced more hassles related to their physical health, 2 (1) = 15.267, p < .001, while participants in the high-SES group reported more events within the professional domain, 2 (1) = 40.493, p < .001 (see 
Figure 2
).


Figure 2

SES differences in attitudes and decision-making were less likely to trust others, 2 (1) = 15.475, p < .001 (see 
Figure 1
). Furthermore, people within the low-SES group also reported lower levels of life satisfaction, t(201.8) = -9.263, p < .001, d = -1.251, as well as higher levels of overall life stress, t(222.88) = 4.749, p < .001, d
= .633 (see 
Figure 3)
. 1.959, p = .102 (RQ3). Post-hoc analyses revealed that the aggregated stress from all negative events was significantly related to time preferences, with those experiencing more stress being less patient, = -.183, p = .013. We did, however, find that this hassle-related stress was associated with overall evaluations of overall life stress and life satisfaction, F(2, 218) = 18.21, p < .001 (RQ4). More specifically, while hassle-related stress was not related to life satisfaction, = -.028, p = .71, it significantly predicted higher overall life stress levels, = 0.362, p < .001.


Discussion
This study aimed to investigate the relationship between SES and the experience of daily hassles, specifically examining exposure intensity, exposure frequency, and vulnerability.
While individuals with lower SES rated their overall lives as more stressful, there was no significant difference between low-and high-SES participants in terms of daily hassle exposure frequency, exposure intensity, or vulnerability. Contrary to our hypotheses, participants in both SES groups experienced daily hassles with similar frequency and intensity, and their vulnerability to these hassles was also comparable. Likewise, there was no significant difference in event-related stress between the two groups. Minor daily stressors, therefore, do not appear to significantly contribute to the observed SES differences in overall life stress.
One notable finding is that low-SES individuals reported feeling less control over the events they experienced compared to high-SES individuals. This aligns with the broader literature suggesting that a diminished sense of control is common among low-SES populations 
(Kraus et al., 2009)
. Additionally, we observed differences in the types of hassles experienced by the two groups: low-SES individuals reported more hassles related to physical health, while high-SES individuals reported more events in the professional domain.
These results align with literature suggesting that the relationship between SES and stressors is highly domain-specific, with SES associated with fewer stressors in some domains (e.g. health-related stressors or administrative burden; 
Baum et al., 1999;
Martin et al., 2024)
 but more in others (e.g., work-related stressors; 
Damaske et al., 2016;
Schieman & Koltai, 2017)
. Our finding that overall life stress was significantly higher for the low SES group suggests that, while stressors vary across domains, the cumulative stress burden remains greater for individuals with lower SES. Additionally, low SES is often linked to poorer health outcomes, which may explain why individuals with low SES experience more health-related hassles in our study 
(Adler et al., 2000;
Hoebel & Lampert, 2020
).
Furthermore, we replicated not only the SES differences in perceived overall life stress 
(Hamad et al., 2008;
Lund et al., 2010;
World Health Organization, 2001
), but also in life satisfaction 
(Kahneman & Deaton, 2010;
Lindqvist et al., 2020;
Stevenson & Wolfers, 2013)
, trust 
(Bigoni et al., 2022;
Jachimowicz et al., 2017)
, sense of control 
(Kraus et al., 2009)
, and time preferences 
(Brown et al., 2015;
Griskevicius et al., 2011;
Lawrance, 1991)
.
A key strength of this study lies in the use of fine-grained daily diaries, which provided a rich dataset capturing the nuances of participants' daily experiences and offering a detailed view of how daily hassles unfold across SES groups. This approach captures the fluidity of daily life, including small but potentially significant stressors that accumulate over time. It enables researchers to track how these daily experiences vary across individuals and groups, illustrating how SES may influence both the nature and impact of everyday challenges.
Furthermore, the use of large language models to annotate and categorize participants' daily experiences represents a significant strength of our study. Large language models provide an efficient, consistent, and unbiased approach to analyzing large datasets of written text, ensuring objectivity in the classification of events as daily hassles or otherwise. This method reduces the subjectivity inherent in relying solely on human raters, who may inadvertently introduce personal biases into their evaluations. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models, we were able to process and identify common themes across a rich dataset of personal narratives, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of participants' daily experiences. The ability of large language models to handle large-scale textual data also facilitated the identification of subtle patterns and ensured a level of reproducibility and transparency that is difficult to achieve with manual annotations alone. This approach aligns with recent advancements in psychological research, highlighting the potential of integrating artificial intelligence tools to enhance the reliability and depth of data analysis. Also, our study's high statistical power and pre-registered design ensured that our analyses were both robust and transparent.
Additionally, our measure of hassle frequency moves beyond the existing literature. To ensure thorough data collection and avoid underestimating the frequency of hassles, we required participants to report three events each day, regardless of whether they were explicitly negative. Interestingly, our results showed a higher frequency of hassles per participant than previously reported: While prior studies found participants reported daily hassles roughly every second day 
(Klusmann et al., 2021;
Grzywacz et al., 2004)
, in our study participants report an average of 2.569 of hassles per day. Interestingly, we did not observe the difference in daily hassle frequency between low and high SES participants
reported by 
Grzywacz et al. (2004)
. They observed that less educated individuals reported fewer but more intense daily hassles, while more educated individuals reported more frequent daily hassles 
(Grzywacz et al., 2004)
. However, we found no difference in hassle frequency or intensity between SES groups, which challenges some of the earlier literature on the social gradient of daily hassles. This divergence in findings may be attributed to differences in how daily hassles were measured. In 
Grzywacz et al. (2004)
, the higher hassle frequency amongst the more educated may reflect the tendency of more educated individuals to be more expressive, articulate, or verbally fluent, which could lead them to report a greater number of hassles. Additionally, they may be more inclined to perceive everyday events as hassles compared to individuals with lower educational attainment. By requiring participants to report three events each day, our methodology was better equipped to address common issues in hassle research, such as the potential for underreporting or the risk of participants rushing through surveys. Additionally, by using large language models to classify these events as hassles, we established a more objective and consistent metric.
This method not only reduces subjectivity in determining what constitutes a hassle but also ensures that participants remain engaged with the survey, leading to more accurate and reliable data.
While our frequency measure addresses some of the limitations of previous approaches, it also introduces its own potential drawbacks. Specifically, this approach may obscure variations in exposure frequency, particularly for participants who experienced more than three daily hassles but were unable to report them due to the constraints of the diary format.
The fixed reporting requirement of three events per day could limit the ability to capture a fuller range of participants' experiences, potentially underestimating the true frequency of daily hassles for some individuals.
Our results further diverge from prior research. 
For example, van Eck et al. (1998)
 found that higher perceived stress was associated with greater emotional reactivity to daily events. Yet, we did not find a similar pattern of heightened vulnerability to daily hassles among low-SES individuals, which could suggest that the source of perceived stress in low-SES groups may stem from factors beyond daily hassles.
Similarly, 
Udayar et al. (2023)
 found that daily hassles negatively predicted life satisfaction and explained variance beyond demographic factors. However, in our study, daily hassles were not related to life satisfaction but were instead linked to overall life stress levels. This discrepancy suggests that daily hassles may have varying impacts on well-being depending on the broader social and psychological context.
Generally, our findings suggest that the heightened stress levels commonly reported by low-SES individuals may not be driven by differences in daily hassle frequency, intensity, or vulnerability. This raises the key question: if daily hassles do not account for the additional stress experienced by low-SES individuals, where does this stress originate? Several potential explanations could account for these disparities. For example, literature on life events has shown that individuals from lower SES backgrounds experience more frequent and severe life events, such as job loss, illness, divorce, or housing instability, which can lead to heightened stress levels 
(Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1970)
. However, stress may also stem from structural factors such as long-term financial insecurity, limited access to healthcare and social services, or unsafe living conditions, all of which are disproportionately experienced by low-SES individuals 
(Evans & Kantrowitz, 2002)
. These structural stressors may generate chronic, ongoing stress that is not necessarily tied to discrete events but rather to persistent conditions that limit individuals' coping resources 
(Peetz et al., 2021;
Evans & Kantrowitz, 2002)
. Repeated exposure to socio-economic hardships, combined with limited resources to mitigate these pressures, could contribute to a sustained and often overwhelming sense of stress.
Future research should adopt a holistic approach to the stress process, examining how SES is linked to various types of stressors and stress responses. Stressors manifest in diverse forms, ranging from discrete events to more continuous experiences 
(Wheaton, 1994)
, while also encompassing different domains such as health, finances, relationships, and work 
(Almeida et al., 2004)
. Given the complex and multifaceted nature of stress, it is crucial to explore not only the specific stressors individuals encounter but also the psychological, biological, and structural factors that shape how stress is perceived, experienced, and managed within different SES groups. By broadening the focus of stress research to include these interconnected dimensions, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of how SES influences stress processes and their downstream effects on well-being and decision-making.


Conclusion
In conclusion, this study highlights the nuanced relationship between SES and the experience of daily hassles, challenging the assumption that heightened stress levels among low-SES individuals stem primarily from more frequent or intense routine stressors. While low-SES participants reported greater overall life stress and lower perceived control, these disparities were not explained by differences in daily hassle frequency or intensity. Instead, distinct patterns emerged, with low-SES individuals encountering more health-related stressors but fewer work-related hassles compared to their high-SES counterparts. By integrating subjective ratings and large language model-based analyses, this study provides a robust methodological framework for future research to explore the diverse sources of stress across SES groups. A holistic approach that accounts for the multifaceted nature of stressors and stress responses is essential for understanding and addressing SES-related disparities in well-being and decision-making.
VulnerabilityVulnerability was assessed by examining the difference between self-rated and ChatGPT-rated stress levels for events categorized as daily hassles. This measure reflects the extent to which an individual's perception of stress aligns or diverges from an external assessment, serving as an indicator of their vulnerability. Positive scores on this measure suggest that an individual perceives events as more stressful than others might, indicating greater vulnerability. Negative scores on the vulnerability measure indicate stronger robustness towards potentially stressful situations.Event-related stressEvent-related stress was computed as the mean of all self-rated stress ratings across the events described by participants. This measure provides a general indicator of the stress level associated with the reported events, offering a broad view of how stressful participants found their daily experiences, irrespective of whether the events were classified as daily hassles.


Contrary to our hypothesis (RQ1), we found no difference between the two SES groups in terms of hassle exposure and vulnerability, F(3, 226) = 0.799, p = .496. Overall, participants of the low-SES group experienced roughly as many hassles per day (M = 2.649, SD = 0.463) as participants in the high-SES group (M = 2.523, SD = 0.516), t(226.81) = 1.385, p = .084, d = 0.182. Furthermore, these hassles were experienced as similarly stressful in the low-(M = 4.359, SD = 1.044) and high-SES group (M = 4.317, SD = 1.133), t(227.49) = 0.293, p = .385, d = 0.039. Also in terms of vulnerability, we found no differences between the low-(M = 0.440, SD = 0.918) and high-SES group (M = 0.352, SD = 1.050), t(225.78) = 0.679, p = .249, d = 0.089.
