You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Hannah is considering buying her first house. She currently rents an apartment in a major metropolitan area in the United States and dreams of owning a home one day. Hannah is not the first of her friends to think about buying a home; at 36, she is the average age for first-time homebuyers in the United States 
(Brooks, 2023)
. Unfortunately for Hannah, in 2023, the housing market hit a breaking point. Mortgage rates soared to record levels and many would-be first-time homeowners were priced out of a prohibitively expensive and limited housing market 
(Friedman, 2024)
. Historically, homeownership has been seen as a worthwhile financial investment: in addition to signaling financial independence, it can also result in substantial financial profit later in life 
(Goodman & Mayer, 2018)
. However, buying a house comes with a significant amount of risk, as there are many factors that are outside of one's control (e.g., one can set a firm budget but cannot control interest rates). In short, the outcome of Hannah's decision has the potential to significantly impact her life. These types of decisions can evoke strong negative emotionsincluding dread, fear, and anxiety -that often need to be regulated to maintain psychological wellbeing and achieve short-and long-term goals.
In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between decision making and emotion regulation in the context of risky decision-making processes -those that have the potential for both rewards and losses -such as buying a home, switching jobs, or investing in stock options. We focus on risky decision making because it has long-term and real-world implications for individual health and well-being 
(Rutledge et al., 2015)
. First, we will operationalize decision making and emotion regulation, and establish a framework in which to think about these two processes and their interaction. Second, we will briefly examine recent findings within this framework from research in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Next, we will move through each stage of decision making and demonstrate how a specific emotion regulation strategy, cognitive reappraisal, can guide thoughts and actions to potentially improve decision making across a wide range of contexts. We will also underscore how the brain supports these processes and their interaction. Finally, we will conclude with unanswered questions in the space and implications for developmental and psychopathological populations.


What do we mean by decision making?
Decision making can be broadly defined as the cognitive process behind selecting an action or behavior, with the goal of achieving a desired outcome from a variety of possibilities. In this chapter, we focus specifically on risky decision making, where possible outcomes include rewards and losses 
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1984)
. This type of decision making has clear emotional relevance, where rewards are associated with positive emotions and losses are associated with negative emotions 
(Slovic et al., 2005)
. There is considerable uncertainty associated with risky decisions -decisions where there is a larger variety of possible outcomes or lesser clarity in the probabilities of desired outcomes. Uncertainty and risk tend to elicit negative emotions, providing an opportunity for emotion regulation (Flores-Torres, 
Gómez-Pérez, & McRae, 2022;
Heilman et al., 2010)
.


What do we mean by emotion regulation?
Emotion regulation refers to the act of exerting control over emotions with the goal of changing the experience, intensity, timing, or influence of these emotions 
(Gross, 2015)
. Most commonly, emotion regulation serves to decrease negative emotions (trying to calm down when feeling upset) or to increase positive emotions (giving oneself a pep talk before a public speech) 
(Gross, 2014)
. In this chapter, we will specifically examine emotion regulation in the context of the Process Model 
(Gross, 1998)
. This model posits that emotion regulation can have an impact at each stage of generating an emotional reaction to a given situation 
(Gross, 1998)
. There are five linear components to the Process Model: situation selection, situation modification, attention deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation. We will discuss how and when each component serves to impact an emotional response and provide an example for how each component may manifest in the context of decision making.
Situation selection involves approaching or avoiding certain situations to facilitate or circumvent an emotional response to a situation. To return to our motivating example at the start of the chapter, Hannah may engage in situation selection by avoiding putting an offer in on a house that she's excited about in order to avoid the negative emotions that may arise if the offer was rejected. Situation modification involves actively trying to modify or change a situation to alter its emotional impact. In our example, this might mean that Hannah looks at multiple properties, to avoid getting too attached to the idea of one house. Attention deployment involves actively shifting attentional focus towards or away from an emotional situation or element to reduce its emotional impact. One common emotion regulation strategy that targets attention deployment is distraction, where someone may focus on a non-emotional aspect of a situation to reduce the overall emotional impact. By concentrating on non-emotional features, distraction can help amplify positive emotions by shifting attention towards or away from emotional elements. In our example, Hannah may go to the movies or plan a dinner with friends after putting in an offer, so that she doesn't ruminate on whether her offer will be accepted.
Cognitive change involves changing the evaluation of or meaning derived from an emotioneliciting situation. An emotion regulation strategy that leverages cognitive change is cognitive reappraisal, wherein someone reframes a situation to alter its emotional impact. This might take the form of Hannah reminding herself that there are many houses in the area in which she could be happy, and that while a rejected offer would be disappointing, it could also represent an opportunity to find another great house elsewhere. Finally, response modulation involves directly influencing the physiological, experiential, or behavioral response to an emotion-eliciting situation. A response modulation strategy like suppression helps people inhibit expressive behaviors of an emotional reaction and potentially reduce their experience of those emotions. In our example, if Hannah's offer is rejected, she would avoid expressing disappointment or sadness to others, but would still feel it internally.
We posit that emotion regulation can serve as a tool that can be flexibly applied or manipulated as either an adaptive or maladaptive strategy for different types of decision-making scenarios. Consistent with this claim, findings from psychology and cognitive neuroscience suggest that unchecked emotional reactions when making risky decisions tend to be associated with worse outcomes 
(Martin & Delgado, 2011)
. Under-regulation, or a tendency to leave emotional responses uncontrolled, is associated with risk-seeking behavior, while over-regulation, or regulating emotions to an excessive degree, is associated with risk-averse behavior. Thus, both under-and over-regulation are associated with suboptimal decision outcomes 
(Mitchell, 2011)
. Below, we outline potential contributions of emotion regulation at different stages of risky decisionmaking processes, which may be applicable across multiple contexts.


Focusing on the intersection of decision making and emotion regulation
Examining the neural and behavioral bases of risky decision making through the lens of emotion regulation may yield new insights into both processes. We will also focus on risky decision making because it has long-term and real-world implications for individual health and well-being 
(Rutledge et al., 2015)
. Below, we will outline six distinct components of the risky decision-making process: 1) identifying the problem, 2) evaluating possible outcomes, 3) taking decisive action, 4) anticipating the outcome, 5) dealing with the outcome, and 6) the post-decision experience. At each point, we identify the role that emotion regulation may play in this decision stage and identify neural circuitry that has been implicated in both processes. While we will identify contributions that different Process Model components may play throughout the decision-making process, we will largely focus on cognitive reappraisal given the extent to which its behavioral and neural bases have been characterized in the literature 
(Buhle et al., 2014;
Braunstein, Herrera, & Delgado, 2014;
Denny et al., 2023;
Webb, Miles, & Sheeran, 2012)
.


Decision making as a multi-stage process.
As individuals navigate their day to day lives, they encounter situations that can be resolved or modified with decisive action in accordance with their momentary goals and values 
(Rangel, Camerer, & Montague, 2008)
. For decision making to be initiated, an individual must first identify the problem 
(Doya, 2008)
. Once individuals have identified the problem, they can evaluate possible outcomes 
(Morris et al., 2021
). This step involves weighing possible outcomes and comparing these outcomes to situational goals to identify an ideal outcome that aligns with these goals. Next, decisive action is taken 
(Sharpe et al., 2019
). An individual decides to act to attempt to achieve the ideal outcome. In anticipation of the outcome, the individual wonders if the decision will achieve their goals and have the intended consequences 
(Lerner et al., 2015)
. Once an outcome becomes clear, the individual must deal with the outcome 
(Lerner et al., 2015)
. If the goals of the decisive action were not met, there may be a need to restart the decision-making process. He or she may also feel a range of emotions in response to the outcome, and sometimes individuals must navigate post-decision experiences like regret 
(Matarazzo et al., 2021)
. These types of decisions are common and made every day; importantly, however, at each stage of the decision-making process, there is an opportunity to modify an emotional drive, state, or response using emotion regulation to adjust goals, actions, and expected outcomes ( 
Fig. 1)
. 


Integration of neural circuitry involved in emotion regulation and decision making
Recent reviews in psychology and neuroscience have identified the central role of affect 
(Barrett & Bliss-Moreau, 2009)
 in both decision making 
(Asutay & Västfjäll, 2022)
 and emotion regulation 
(Mitchell, 2011)
. By affect, we refer to an internal state characterized by a certain level of valence and arousal 
(Russell & Barrett, 1999;
Russell, 2003)
. Consistent with this account, both processes involve the recruitment of similar prefrontal cortex regions implicated in executive control and the modulation of cortical and subcortical circuitry implicated in affective experience 
(Denny et al., 2023
; 
Table 1
). Further, the convergence of emotion dysregulation and deficits in effective decision making 
(Grecucci & Sanfey, 2014
) suggest a behavioral and neural relationship between these two processes. The majority of the studies in the literature have focused on cognitive reappraisal as a regulation strategy, and therefore in the remaining sections of this chapter, we will review neural circuitry involved in decision making in the context of cognitive reappraisal 
(Fig.  2)
.  


Identifying the problem
Let's return to the scenario of Hannah considering buying her first house. This decision represents a motivational conflict: she can either continue renting and prolong a familiar situation, or she can take a personal, emotional, and financial risk and buy her first home. She has identified her problem (choosing between a low-risk or high-risk outcome), and she can leverage cognitive reappraisal to regulate the emotional impacts that often come with making this kind of risky decision.
Neural circuitry implicated in problem identification. The dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices (dlPFC, dmPFC) support conflict resolution, primarily by driving attention and cognitive control 
(Oehrn et al., 2014)
. The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) may also facilitate flexible conflict resolution 
(Badre & Wagner, 2006)
 and helps individuals appropriately assign value to abstract and concrete concepts 
(Dixon & Christoff, 2014)
. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsal ACC are also heavily implicated in conflict monitoring and detection 
(Milham & Banich, 2005)
, helping to determine the expected value of motivation and control 
(Shenhav, Cohen, & Botvinick, 2016)
.


Modulation of neural activity via emotion regulation.
Prior research has found evidence that cognitive reappraisal can serve to modulate ACC activity during decision making. In a study by 
Grecucci and colleagues (2013)
, researchers instructed participants to up-and downregulate (increase and decrease the interpretation of a negative event, respectively) in the context of an ultimatum game. Participants received a monetary offer from a computer player (either an equal or unequal split), reappraised the intentions and behavior of the player based on the regulation instruction, and decided whether to accept the offer. They found that decisions to accept an unfair offer when reappraising were associated with increased activity in the ACC, which is consistent with conflict resolution processes that may be involved in accepting an unfair offer by ignoring another's negative intentions. Taken together, this indicates that identifying the problem -whether it is accepting an unfair offer or taking a gamble on the housing market -recruits multiple neural regions in the frontal cortex involved in a diverse set of cognitive processes. This includes conflict detection, value assignment, and effort allocation. Furthermore, the neural and behavioral markers of these processes may be modulated by emotion regulation.


Evaluating possible outcomes
As Hannah explores different housing options, and tours properties around the city, she must evaluate her possible outcomes. She may have an emotional attachment to a given location or neighborhood, but the houses available in those areas may not align with her budget. She must consider if she wants to be near shops and restaurants, or if it's more important to be nearer to close friends. She tries to imagine what her life will look like if she lives in each home and considers whether it's the "right" place. This evaluative stage allows her to gather information before deciding, and she can again leverage an emotion regulation strategy like cognitive reappraisal to minimize her stress and improve her decision-related outcome.
Neural circuitry implicated in outcome evaluation. When evaluating possible outcomes, many cortical and subcortical regions implicated in cognitive reappraisal are also involved in decision making. These regions work together to not only support the evaluation of different outcomes and calculate probabilities of success 
(Kahneman & Tversky, 2000)
, but also support a number of cognitive processes. Notably, recent evidence highlights the role of affect as a weighted consideration when accumulating evidence and evaluating possible outcomes 
(Roberts et al., 2024)
. The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) assign value to different variables 
(Dixon & Christoff, 2014)
 while the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices (dlPFC, dmPFC) support conflict resolution in addition to value assignment 
(Mitchell, 2011)
. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) may also support encoding of emotional value 
(Winecoff et al., 2013)
, and evidence of an additive effect of value and emotion on vmPFC activation has also recently shown 
(Jaiswal et al., 2024)
. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) also processes reward and may aid in optimal solution consideration 
(Wallis, 2007)
, while the amygdala reduces negative affect associated with possible undesired outcomes 
(Steward et al., 2021;
Gupta et al., 2011)
. Furthermore, the ventral striatum (VS) tracks outcome value, a critical component to evaluating reward in possible outcomes 
(Pool et al., 2022)
.


Modulation of neural activity via emotion regulation.
In addition to the valuation processes outlined above, mentalizing may also play a large role in the outcome evaluation process 
(Gilead & Ochsner, 2021)
. Each of her decision outcomes involves simulating her future self, likely recruiting mentalizing network regions such as temporoparietal junction (TPJ), mPFC, dmPFC, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). With regard to emotion regulation, perspective taking -a particularly robust form of cognitive reappraisal 
(Webb, Miles, & Sheeran, 2012
) -modulates the recruitment of neural circuitry implicated in affective reactivity. In a study by 
Gilead and colleagues (2016)
, researchers had participants view affective images while taking their own perspective or that of another named person and rate their affective reactions to the images 
(Fig. 3)
. They found that perspective-taking was associated with activation in the mentalizing network and modulated affective processing. For Hannah, this type of reappraisal might take the form of imagining her future self in each home that she tours and picturing the positives and/or negatives associated with each property, thus shaping her emotional response to each outcome. Taken together, there is evidence that outcome evaluation recruits multiple neural regions across frontal and parietal cortices and subcortical regions. These regions support a range of cognitive processes, including value assignment, mentalizing, conflict resolution, and outcome optimization, all of which may be modulated by emotion regulation. 
Fig. 3
. Reproduction of experimental paradigm 
(Gilead et al., 2016)
 examining perspective-taking and emotional reactivity. Participants completed a questionnaire to report demographics and hobbies and viewed two character description questionnaires in the same format (pre-scanner character evaluations). In the scanner, participants were asked to view an affective image taking their own perspective or that of one of the evaluated characters. 


Pre-scanner Character Evaluations Affective Response Task


Taking decisive action
Although at the upper end of her budget, Hannah has found a house that checks every other box on her list -it's in a location near to both friends and restaurants and she can picture herself living here now and growing into it with a future family. She takes decisive action and puts an offer down on the house. Individual differences in risk-seeking or risk aversion may determine whether she feels nervous, energized, or exhausted by this process 
(Engelmann & Tamir, 2009)
. However, prior research indicates that she can once again use cognitive reappraisal to regulate her emotions.
Neural circuitry implicated in taking decisive action. Just before the point of taking decisive action, the vlPFC supports the opportunity for action inhibition 
(Apšvalka et al., 2022)
. It is rarely helpful to rush to action before weighing possible outcomes, and the vlPFC supports action inhibition and impulse control. The dlPFC and ACC also support a decision to act, such as Hannah putting an offer in on a house 
(Tannou et al., 2021;
Hampton & O'Doherty, 2007)
. Decision enactment also involves a motivational perspective, to ensure that the action aligns with motivational goals and desired outcomes, recruiting the VS and OFC 
(Filimon et al., 2020;
Wallis, 2007;
Martin & Delgado, 2011)
.


Modulation of neural activity via emotion regulation.
Cognitive reappraisal consistently activates regions involved in cognitive control, like the dlPFC and vlPFC 
(Buhle et al., 2014)
. In addition to these more canonical regions involved in reappraisal, it is also possible that taking decisive action may involve a comparatively less-studied form of reappraisal, termed positivizing. This approach involves up-regulating the positive emotions associated with a stimulus 
(Doré et al., 2017)
 and may be particularly effective for decisions that involve elements of risk and reward. Prior neuroimaging research has found that engaging in positivizing is associated with increased function connectivity between the OFC, VS, vmPFC, and amygdala. Taken together, this indicates that taking decisive action recruits neural regions involved in action inhibition, increasing and decreasing emotional responses, and potentially up-regulating positive emotions.


Anticipating the outcome
Now that Hannah has acted decisively and put in an offer, she must wait to hear if her offer is accepted. While waiting, she may feel anxious that the offer won't be accepted or worried that she overlooked something. In other words, Hannah experiences uncertainty following her decisive action while she anticipates the outcome. Like taking action, individual differences may account for variation in the emotional states and intensity elicited by this stage of the decision process. For example, individuals that have a lower tolerance for uncertainty (i.e., experience more negative affect when faced with unknowns) may experience more negative emotions during the anticipation period 
(Morriss et al., 2023)
, or may have more challenges emotionally disengaging from negative stimuli 
(Nanni-Zepeda et al., 2024)
, and thus may benefit more from the adoption of emotion regulation strategies like cognitive reappraisal.
Neural circuitry implicated in outcome anticipation. After action is taken, and before the outcome is known, individuals must navigate the anticipation and uncertainty associated with waiting for the outcome. The mPFC supports outcome anticipation when expecting rewarding outcomes, which is often associated with motivational goals driving decisive action 
(Mitchell, 2011)
. The VS has also been implicated in information and reward anticipation 
(Filimon et al., 2020)
; subcortical regions like the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a small subcortical structure connected to other limbic structures, are associated specifically with negative outcomes 
(Pedersen, Muftuler, & Larson, 2019;
Hammack, Braas, & May, 2021)
. For example, Hannah is expecting her offer to be accepted (a rewarding outcome), but she must navigate a period of uncertainty as she waits (where both rewarding and disappointing outcomes are possible). Furthermore, although less well-studied, the insula may also help reduce uncertainty during this anticipatory period 
(Smith, Steinberg, & Chein, 2014)
.
Modulation of neural activity via emotion regulation. Emotion regulatory strategies like cognitive reappraisal may modulate neural activity in anticipation of negative outcomes in the amygdala and BNST 
(Pedersen, Muftuler, & Larson, 2019;
Hammack, Braas, & May, 2021)
. The neural connectivity between the amygdala and mPFC are particularly central to emotion regulation processes 
(Buhle et al., 2014;
Banks et al., 2007)
. Cognitive reappraisal may also modulate VS activity 
(Filimon et al., 2020;
Liu et al., 2023)
, potentially preventing someone from getting too invested in an unlikely positive outcome (e.g., Hannah having an offer far below the listed price get accepted), and insular activity 
(Carlson & Mujica-Parodi, 2010)
, helping to reduce uncertainty and associated anxiety. Taken together, this indicates that outcome anticipation recruits neural regions involved in reward expectation and uncertainty reduction, and emotion regulation strategies to reduce negative affect associated with uncertainty may modulate the markers associated with these processes.


Dealing with the outcome and post-decision experience
After days of waiting, Hannah hears that her offer on the house was accepted! She feels relieved that her housing search is over, and she is excited about starting the new life she envisioned for herself. While this outcome is what Hannah wanted, others who bid on the same house may be simultaneously dealing with the outcome in a different way. Their housing search didn't conclude the way they wanted, and they may feel defeated to not have their offer accepted. These different outcomes provide different opportunities for emotion regulation.
Neural circuitry implicated in post-decision emotional outcomes. While Hannah's ideal outcome became reality, other people may experience prediction errors between their expected and actual outcomes 
(Mitchell, 2011)
. Moreover, the context surrounding a decisive action may influence individual difficulties in accepting an outcome, as impulsivity during decisive action is associated with increased emotional reactivity and amygdala activation 
(Gupta et al., 2011)
. Therefore, outcomes do not always align with the ideal and may become tinged with regret over time. Post-decision regret may be supported by the vlPFC to encode negative feedback from a given decision and help an individual perhaps make a more effective decision in the future 
(Kim, Hwang, & Lee, 2018)
. Regret is also associated with greater activation in the OFC 
(Chua et al., 2009)
. Counterfactual thinking for negative outcomes, or comparing the reality of a given outcome to alternative possibilities, is also associated with mixed emotions and activation in the VS, insula, and dlPFC 
(Henderson & Norris, 2013)
.


Modulation of neural activity via emotion regulation.
Moreover, regret may require longerterm emotion regulation to prevent long-term emotional impacts 
(Reeck & LaBar, 2024)
. This may be especially true when individuals experience dissonance following a decision outcome, resulting in attitudinal adjustments to other possible outcomes (e.g., chosen outcome viewed as more positive and non-chosen outcomes seen as more negative) (Harmon-Jones, Harmon-Jones, & Summerell, 2017). The dlPFC and dmPFC are thought to support this regulatory maintenance 
(Mitchell, 2011)
, and the vlPFC may additionally support regulation when predicted and actual outcomes differ 
(Bratec et al., 2015)
. Furthermore, decreased insula activity has been associated with subsequent decision-related attitude changes, perhaps to help individuals rationalize their decisions as they distance themselves from them 
(Jarcho, Berkman, & Lieberman, 2011)
. In this study by 
Jarcho and colleagues (2011)
, participants initially rated how much they liked hundreds of names and paintings. While in the fMRI scanner, they were shown a subset of similarly rated items (i.e., equally liked) and were asked to select preferences in two meaningful contexts: preferred names for future children and preferred paintings to hang in their home. Participants then rated their liking for all names and paintings again after exiting the scanner. Researchers found that attitudes towards selected preferences became more positive while attitudes towards rejected preferences became more negative. This attitude change was associated with decreased insula activity, which may suggest a neurocognitive mechanism for rationalization when choosing between equally attractive options. Taken together, this indicates that the post-decision experience recruits neural circuitry involved in prediction errors, feedback, and rationalization, and emotion regulation may modulate neural and behavioral markers associated with these processes.


Future research and considerations
While this chapter has focused on decision making and emotion regulation in the context of healthy individuals, risk-related decision making may be especially impacted in populations with mood or affective disorders 
(Lamba, Frank, & FeldmanHall, 2020;
Pawluk & Koerner, 2013;
Sripada et al., 2009)
. This suggests that emotion regulation may play an important role in improving decision making for these groups, and thus underscores the importance of exploring the neural and behavioral correlates at each stage of the decision-making process. Further research should continue to examine implications of emotion regulatory and risky decision-making success for clinical groups, such as those with eating disorders 
(Francesconi, Flouri, & Harrison, 2023)
, anxiety 
(Wake, Wormwood, & Satpute, 2020)
, and autism spectrum disorder 
(Sáez-Suanes et al., 2020)
.
Although the research summarized here has largely focused on young adult populations, prior research has consistently shown that emotion regulatory abilities vary substantially across the lifespan 
(Helion, Krueger, & Ochsner, 2019)
. Cognitive reappraisal doesn't emerge as an effective regulation strategy until adolescence, and individuals increase recruitment of dorsal and lateral prefrontal regions with age, suggesting that reappraisal is effective only once the neural circuitry is developed 
(Moreira, McLaughlin, & Silvers, 2021;
Silvers, 2022)
. Adolescents are also potentially particularly sensitive to reward, which may impact their ability to assess risk as they consider possible outcomes and take decisive action 
(Schreuders et al., 2018)
. This sensitivity may be especially important in social contexts, where adolescents are susceptible to social influence 
(Foulkes & Blakemore, 2016)
 and may act particularly impulsively 
(Smith et al., 2018
).
While we discussed 
Gross's (1998)
 Process Model, we ultimately limited our discussion of decision making and emotion regulation to focus on cognitive reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy frequently examined in the neuroscience literature. However, there are alternative regulatory strategies that may or may not fit into the framework defined in this chapter, such as mindfulness 
(Jovanova et al., 2023)
, affect labeling 
(Torre & Lieberman, 2018)
, and interpersonal emotion regulation 
(Zaki & Williams, 2013)
. Other Process Model strategies have psychological processes and neural circuitry supporting them, but these are understudied relative to cognitive reappraisal 
(Webb, Miles, & Sheeran, 2012)
. While the less-studied nature of some regulatory strategies can be explained by technical limitations (for example, studying situation selection is challenging in a functional neuroimaging experimental setting), others, like suppression and distraction, are alternative strategies to consider. Individual differences and situational factors may drive regulatory choices 
(Sheppes et al., 2011;
Mitchell et al., in press
) -for some individuals, risky decision-making may be associated with high intensity negative affect, and they may opt for distraction, while those who consider it less affectively intense may instead select reappraisal.
Finally, additional research should continue to examine contexts in which emotion regulation is unhelpful for decision making 
(Ford & Troy, 2019)
, an example we acknowledged but did not elaborate upon. While there is a general consensus in psychology and neuroscience that emotion regulation is helpful for decision making 
(Heilman et al., 2010)
, there may be individual characteristics or situational factors that are associated with a beneficial role of high intensity, negative affect (e.g., social decision making or interpersonal relationships) 
(Gross & Oliver, 2003)
. Furthermore, for psychologists who study emotion regulation, the extent to which individual strategies may yield more or less optimal outcomes (i.e., what others have called a personalized science of emotion regulation) 
(Doré, Silvers, & Ochsner, 2016)
 remains unclear.


Conclusion
By entering the housing market and putting an offer down on her first house, Hannah experienced the full process of risky decision making. While not all decisions involve such high risk, people make many decisions like these throughout their lifetimes. Likewise, affective states fluctuate depending on situational factors, interpersonal interactions, and internal motivations. Decision making and emotion regulation processes are thus constantly working alongside each other in tandem, while overlapping neural circuitry in the brain works to support these cognitive processes and their associated behaviors.
