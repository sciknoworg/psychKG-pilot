You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Improving Forensic Expert Decision-Making through Deliberate Practice
Suppose that you have an option to choose between two dentists. Both dentists graduated from the same university, work in the same clinic, and all other demographics are the same, except for how long they practiced (and, by default, their age). Dentist A practiced for 20 years whereas Dentist B practiced for 5 years. Who would you choose as your dentist? Most people may choose Dentist A because traditionally professional experience has been assessed through length of experience, or their reputation 
(Ericsson, 2008)
. However, arguably, Dentist B may have comparable, or even superior expertise, for any number of reasons; for example if Dentist A has not deliberately improved their skills throughout their career. Repetition of tasks is not necessarily a reflection of improved performance 
(Ericsson et al., 1993;
Ericsson & Harwell, 2019)
; one may make the same mistakes for years and call it experience. In improving expert decision-making, there is a need for direction towards more accuracy.
In forensic science, forensic experts employ science to address legal questions by navigating alternative hypotheses and reaching a conclusion. However, there is now ample evidence that human factors can influence their navigation and their decisions (for review, see 
Cooper & Meterko, 2019;
Kukucka & Dror, 2022)
. In addition, a major issue in forensic science is that the ground truth is typically unknown; even a confession can be false 
(Kassin, 2014)
 and eyewitness testimony is unreliable 
(Houston et al., 2013)
; therefore, accuracy for real cases may not be possible to measure; casework is not research. In contrast, accuracy in other domains, like medicine or aviation, is easier to assess. Medical errors can lead to prolonged health issues or deaths, and aviation errors can lead to plane crashes (e.g., 
Zavala et al., 2018)
. If there is no clear direction on what outcome is right or wrong, then this is an added challenge to addressing human factors that can unconsciously affect forensic experts' decision-making 
(Kassin et al., 2013)
. This is perhaps one of the factors leading to the lack of consistency of decision-making even by the same forensic experts at different times 
(Dror, 2023)
.
This commentary suggests that elements of deliberate practice may help in not only having more consistent forensic decisions, but also towards (expected) accuracy 
(Ericsson, 2008;
Ericsson et al., 1993)
. Deliberate practice entails that professionals aiming to improve their performance at Page 3 of 11 work would be: (1) given a task with a specific goal, (2) motivated to improve, (3) offered immediate feedback, and (4) given ample chances of repetition of the task (see 
Figure 1
).
Empirical evidence suggests that following these key elements may lead to significant improvement in skills acquisition and performance 
(Ericsson & Harwell, 2019)
. However, this commentary is not about skill or expertise acquisition per se; this aspect has been briefly discussed in the forensic science literature 
(Edmond et al., 2017;
Passalacqua et al., 2023)
. Rather, the current commentary is about using deliberate practice elements to improve forensic decisionmaking through combating human factors (such as implicit biases and workplace stressors). Next, an example is used to illustrate the benefit of utilizing deliberate practice to mitigate biases through proficiency testing.

repeating the task until mastery. The goal may be reviewed and updated, and so the cycle would repeat.
Proficiency testing aims to ensure that forensic experts follow the operating procedures and reach the expected conclusions 
(Koehler, 2013)
. It may entail asking forensic experts to examine items (e.g., underwear) for specific testing (e.g., biological traces, like semen) where the ground truth is known, and thus, accuracy can be measured. Typically, such proficiency testing is simple by comparison with actual cases that might be more complex by their nature. It is in complex and ambiguous decisions that implicit biases may be pronounced, not in easy, clear-cut tests (see Bias Danger Zone in 
Dror, 2013)
. In addition, when one knows they are being tested, their observed performance may deviate from normal-business performance. Hence, there have been calls for blind programs, like blind proficiency testing where the test items and real casework are integrated in a way that it is difficult for experts to know when they are tested 
(Hundl et al., 2019;
Kunkler & Roy, 2023)
. Implementation of blind proficiency can be practically difficult; there is one known forensic laboratory that has successfully implemented blind proficiency 
(Pierce & Cook, 2020;
Stout, 2023)
, and it is evident that they unintentionally followed elements of deliberate practice mentioned here.
If a forensic laboratory aims to effectively implement blind proficiency, then elements of deliberate practice need to be considered. The goal needs to be well-defined for both the practitioners and the forensic service providers (Element 1). If the laboratory wants to detect vulnerabilities and errors, then some of the proficiency tasks need to be more challenging, like actual casework, and not merely simple tests. This may include, for example, degraded or unclear forensic traces or even complex triaging tasks where the experts need to coordinate tests with multiple disciplines (e.g., a cartridge can be tested for both DNA and firearms) without compromising either trace. Alternatively, the goal may include addressing issues of taskirrelevant information on forensic decisions. In this case, the case materials may include contextual information against the ground truth and evaluate whether that influences decisions or confidence levels of the examiners. For instance, for same-source fingerprints, information that are irrelevant to the fingerprint matching task (e.g., alibi with family or lack of eye witness testimony) may suggest a non-match, similar to what was done in previous research .
Setting a goal alone is not sufficient. There needs to be a buy-in from the practitioners, or Element 2 on motivation. Here, motivation is about intentional effort by the experts to do all caseworkincluding the challenging blind tests-to the best of their abilities and with the intention to mitigate bias. Intrinsic motivation can be enhanced through different ways. One way to enhance motivation is through continuous training to practitioners on human factors issues so that they are aware of them and can take proactive steps to mitigate their effects. This can potentially address the issue of bias blind spot, which is when some individuals believe they are not themselves biased, but other individuals may be prone to bias 
(Kukucka et al., 2017;
Pronin & Kugler, 2007)
. Another potential way to motivate staff is through gaming; e.g., see the following quote from a laboratory director on their blind proficiency program: "I have a Starbucks card in it for them. If they think something is a blind and it turns out not to be, they owe me a buck" 
(Stout, 2023, p. 3)
. Importantly, motivation should come from their supervisors or managers; research in forensic science has consistently shown that supervisors can be a major supporting agent to managing stress and enhance motivation 
(Almazrouei et al., 2020
(Almazrouei et al., , 2021
Harper, 2022;
Holt et al., 2017)
.
Once there is a clear goal and motivation to do the task, next would be feedback (Element 3).
Feedback needs to be immediate, or soon after the proficiency test is complete. Delayed feedback can have negative consequences, such as the expert not remembering the specific steps they took in a blind test if they made a mistake. In other words, the direction of decision-making may not be effectively amended if the prior details of the mistake were not clear, and so the mistake can potentially be repeated (see 
Figure 2)
. Feedback, either positive or negative, is a leveraging point for improvement; a system cannot respond to short-term changes when there are long-term delays 
(Meadows, 2008)
. In the specific example of blind testing, feedback needs to be given in a non-putative environment 
(Heavey et al., 2022;
Stout, 2023)
. There should be clarity that it is acceptable to make a mistake, i.e. forensic experts are human and can make unintentional errors.
If this is not effectively communicated, either in writing or verbally, then there is an increased risk of diminished motivation (Element 2) or underreporting of errors. This also goes along with the final element of deliberate practice in that the experts should have ample chances to absorb and learn (Element 4). The experts need to do the tasks, potentially make mistakes, and correct the direction of their decision-making in a continuous manner. is not about skill acquisition that make them specialized experts in their domains.
Elements of deliberate practice are not limited to mitigating implicit biases, as in the previous example, but can also be helpful in managing stress and optimizing performance. For example, managing stress that forensic experts may experience during testimony at court (e.g., 
Holt et al., 2017
; National Institute of Justice, 2019). Giving testimony can be a highly stressful experience, and so competent scientists might be prone to suboptimal testimony if they did not manage it well. A way to address this is by immersing the experts in challenging testimony scenarios before they give their first testimony 
(Elements 1 and 2)
. Ideally, the exercises should be as realistic and challenging as possible. This could be done by potentially working with legal teams so that training can happen in court settings and being asked questions by practicing lawyers who can ask difficult questions and then offer feedback (Element 3). Where possible, the expected answers should be considered so that feedback can be more effective. Equally, responses that should not be given during court testimony (e.g., offering new opinions without evidence base) could be considered, and such scenarios should be pre-tested. For example, in the medical domain, it is possible to pre-test scenarios that have one or more possible actions by doctors that would not have detrimental effect on the patient 
(Ericsson, 2008;
Raptis et al., 2017)
. Finally, there should be a repeated cycle of training and feedback so that the mindset of the expert is continually adapted to challenging expert testimony (Element 4).
Forensic experts make critical decisions that help police or the court, so improving their decisionmaking is necessary to promote justice. This commentary presented elements of deliberate practice as a way to effectively train forensic experts to combat bias and manage stress at work. It is argued that if some elements of deliberate practice are missing during the training, like immediate feedback or intrinsic motivation, then there is an increased risk of suboptimal, or worse no, improvement of decision-making. Unintentional mistakes might be acceptable as long as they are not recklessly repeated. Without deliberate practice, the experts may be repeating the same tasks, the same way, even if there is a more optimal direction to address human factors at work.

Key elements of deliberate practice that can be utilized to enhance forensic expert decision-making, in terms of mitigating cognitive biases and managing workplace stressors. These elements are: (1) setting a well-defined goal; (2) stimulate motivation of experts; (3) offering immediate and meaningful feedback; and

Illustration of expert performance and their experience. When implementing deliberate practice to intentionally and consistently address human factors that may affect their decisions, accompanied with appropriate feedback, it is expected that experts would have enhanced ability to address them (solid line and top target chart). In contrast, repeating the tasks without feedback and direction might lead to more consistency, but not necessarily enhanced performance (dotted line and bottom target chart). To make it clear, enhanced performance here is about the increased ability to address cognitive biases and manage workplace stressors, and it
