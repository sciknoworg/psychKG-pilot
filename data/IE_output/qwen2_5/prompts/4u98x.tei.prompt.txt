You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
The inaction inertia effect is a cognitive bias in which people, when faced with a foregone opportunity, are less likely to accept a subsequent less attractive opportunity 
(Tykocinski et al., 1995)
. This phenomenon occurs even if the second chance still offers a desired positive absolute value 
(Tykocinski & Pittman, 1998)
. This is because past experience serves as a benchmark against which current decisions are compared: an initial decision not to act (or being unable to act) increases the likelihood of making subsequent decisions not to act, especially if the subsequent opportunity fails to reach the value of the first lost opportunity.
Such bias can be seen in the following scenario: let's suppose a person walks by an appliance store on their way home and sees the following advertisement "Today only! Buy this television and win a set of portable speakers and an AirFryer!". This announcement seems very interesting; however, they decide to continue on their way home. Afterward, they change their mind and hush back to the appliance store to buy the TV and win both the portable speakers and the air fryer, but it is too late: the store is now closed. On the following day, the person goes back to the store, but now there is another advertisement: "Buy this television and win a movie theater ticket!".
Frustrated, the person once again makes their way back home without buying the television. As we can see, this new promotion still has an advantage, but not as much as compared with the former, reducing the probability of that person choosing it.
The inaction inertia effect has been used to explain other phenomena, such as product aversion following a missed opportunity 
(Tykocinski & Pittman, 2001
), procrastination 
(Pittman et al., 2008)
, suboptimal decisions for retirement saving 
(Krijnen et al., 2020)
, negotiations on job offers 
(Foster & Diab, 2017)
, and international negotiations 
(Terris & Tykocinski, 2016)
. Such behaviors have been explained by the decrease in the individual's subjective value of the subsequent opportunity and by the desire to avoid the regret of having missed the initial opportunity 
(Arkes et al., 2002;
Tykocinski & Pittman, 2001
).
In the inaction inertia original study 
(Tykocinski et al., 1995)
, participants faced four scenarios with three different conditions (see Supplementary material tables S1
and S2), which differed in the magnitude of the difference between the opportunities presented: the "Large-Difference" condition presented an initial opportunity more advantageous than the subsequent, the "Small-Difference" condition presented an initial opportunity only slightly more advantageous than the subsequent, and finally, the "Control" condition only presented the subsequent opportunity. The study concluded that the inaction inertia effect is a cognitive bias that occurs in different scenarios, in any case whether it involves price, level of effort required, or the reward size expected. The results also indicated that the size of the difference in attractiveness between the opportunities presented (small or large) is an important determinant of the inaction inertia effect: the larger the difference, the lower the likelihood of choosing the subsequent bid.
Although the indirect effect of inaction inertia has been investigated in previous studies 
(van Putten et al., 2008;
Zeelenberg et al., 2006)
, only one direct replication of the original study has been published up to now 
(Chen et al., 2021)
. This replication found similar results when compared to the original study and the inaction inertia effect was found only when the "Large-Difference" condition was compared with the other conditions. Such evidence suggested that the inaction inertia effect is stronger in situations involving foregone opportunities and much more advantageous than the initial opportunity (results of the original and replication studies are summarized in tables S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Material).
Up to now, no study of the inaction inertia effect has been conducted with the Latin American population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a direct replication study on a Brazilian sample to verify the presence of this effect, as originally described by 
Tykocinski et al. (1995)
. Additionally, our study included two preregistered extensions: 1) considering the increasing use of technological tools in everyday life throughout the years 
(Dscout, 2016;
Statista, 2021)
, a new scenario involving an imaginary streaming platform created by the authors, named Pucflix, was proposed to investigate the inaction inertia effect in the acquisition of a digital service and 2) considering the importance of money in decision making and evidence that people respond differently when another unit (such as time) is provided as the outcome (Festjens et al. 2015), we conducted a specific analysis comparing scenarios that involved money in their outcomes and those without it, to investigate the role of financial decisions in the inaction inertia effect. According to these aims, we hypothesized: 1) the inaction inertia effect would be present in the Brazilian population, considering that the greater the difference between the initial offer (more advantageous) and the subsequent one (less advantageous), the lower the acceptance of the offer. Therefore, we expected to find support for the investigated effect, considering the results of the previous studies, which, further on 
(Table 5), are
 shown and compared to the results of the present study; 2) the inaction inertia effect would also be present in the extension scenario, and 3) the effect would be more pronounced in scenarios involving money. All analyses and hypotheses were preregistered prior to data collection, including the extension analyses.


Methods


Procedures
This is a replication of the inaction inertia effect from the original study of 
Tykocinski et al. (1995)
 adapted to Brazilian culture and with two pre-registered extensions: 1) a streaming platform scenario to suit our current time better, and 2) an analysis on the impact of money on the decision-making in the Brazilian population.
This research was approved by the research ethics committee of the Pontifícia Universidade Católica of São Paulo (PUC-SP) in 2021 (CAAE 44189021.5.0000.5482, approval number 4.592.619).
We adopted an experimental design with an online questionnaire data collection. Participation in the study was voluntary, without any financial aid. Inclusion criteria were (a) age greater than or equal to 18 years and (b) authorization granted through the Free and Informed Consent Form (ICF). If the participant did not complete all scenarios; their data was included only in the filled-out scenarios. A description of each scenario is displayed on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/62nxb/).
A self-report questionnaire was developed using the Qualtrics XM platform, and the access link was distributed and shared through various social media platforms.
Data collection took place between December 2021 and February 2022, online.


Translation and cultural adaptation
The scenarios from the original study 
(Tykocinski et al., 1995)
 were translated
into Brazilian Portuguese and adapted to the Brazilian context based on Beaton and Yasir guidelines 
(Beaton et al., 2000;
Yasir, 2016
 


Instruments
First, we collected sociodemographic information such as age, gender, city of residence, education level, and family income. Then, the four replication scenarios and the extension scenario were presented in the same order for all participants. After reading each scenario, participants rated their likelihood of accepting an offer on an 11-point scale (0 = not likely at all, 10 = extremely likely). For each scenario, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) "Large-Difference";
2) "Small-Difference", and 3) "Control" condition. At the "Large-Difference" condition, the subsequent opportunity was much less attractive than the foregone opportunity (i.e., a price of $120.00 on the missed opportunity compared to $300.00 on the subsequent opportunity). In the "Small-Difference" condition, the subsequent 1 A more familiar type of resort in Brazil is the Farm hotel (also known as Country hotels or Farm Stay -in Portuguese it's called "Hotel Fazenda"): a type of accommodation common in Brazil, in which guests pay to stay on vacation in a working farm. This substitution was due to a cultural adaptation, since there are no ski resorts in Brazil since the average snowfall is very low and exclusive to the extreme southern region.
opportunity was slightly less attractive than the foregone opportunity (i.e., a price of $270.00 compared to $300.00). At the "Control" condition, only the second opportunity was presented. The monetary values of the original study were converted into Brazilian Reais, considering an exchange rate of 3 reais to 1 Dollar. Such currency conversion was the closest value in order to represent the last decade, considering
Brazil's recent relatively high variability of Dollar values (AASP, 2023). Verification questions were used to ensure participants' comprehension of each scenario 
(Table   S5
 from the Supplementary Material). Participants were excluded from the analysis of scenarios in which they failed verification questions.


Data analysis
All statistical analyses, R scripts, and databases are available on the OSF page.
Power analyses were conducted using G*Power software (version 3.1.9.6, 2020) to estimate the necessary sample size for each scenario (excluding the extension scenario, for which we did not have any prior effect size) 
(Faul et al., 2007)
. We adopted the effect sizes from the original study 
(Table 1)
 as calculated by Chen et al. 
2021
, with a fixed alpha = 0.05 and 1-beta = 0.95 for a two-tailed F test with three groups. 2022), using the packages "readxl"

 "sjPlot" 
(Lüdecke, 2023)

(Pinheiro & Bates, 2000)
 and "jmv"

. The JAMOVI software was used to generate the visual representation of the data analysis through histograms, violin plots, and box plots 
(Jamovi, 2020)
 [version 2.2.5.0]. In R, we first performed the descriptive analyses for each condition ("Large-Difference", "Small-Difference", "Control"). Then, QQ plots were generated ('ggpubr' package) for the residuals of a linear model between the condition and the participant's response in each scenario. Normality checks were then conducted for each scenario and each condition using the Shapiro-Wilk test ('rstatix' package To check for the hypothesis of the impact of money on decision-making, scenarios involving money (Hotel and Car scenarios) and scenarios not involving money (Frequent flyer and Fitness center) were allocated into separate subgroups, as preregistered. We did not include the extension scenario in this analysis. After organizing the data set and separating it into two subgroups, we performed mixed effects analysis to compare the clusters ('lme' function from ´nlme' package in R). In this analysis, the participants were considered as a random effect, whereas the subgroups and conditions were considered fixed effects. We investigated if scenarios involving money and the conditions predicted the probability values chosen by the participants. Also, paired t-tests (´stats' package) were performed to investigate the presence of the inaction inertia effect within scenarios with and without money for comparisons between 1) "Large-Difference vs Small-Difference"; 2) "Small-Difference vs Control", and 3) "Large-Difference vs Control".


Open Science Framework
In accordance with the practices in reproducible research, the research plan and analysis plan were pre-registered (with respective English translations also uploaded) at the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform prior to data collection.
Such practices support transparency and openness regarding the procedures and hypothesis described in the study, reducing bias and contributing to a more robust and reproducible study

Results


Replication
Socio-demographic data are shown in table S6 in the supplementary material.
In total, 456 participants responded to the survey. Of those, 19 abandoned the study without completing the first scenario, and one was excluded for being under the age of eighteen, resulting in 436 participants who completed at least the first scenario (the Farm hotel scenario). The total number of participants completing all the scenarios was 421. The sample was composed mostly of women (66%), with a mean age of 32 years (SD = 13.8), with complete or ongoing graduation (94%), and a monthly family income higher than R$15,675.01 (40%). Participants represented 19 of the 27 states of Brazil, but the majority were from São Paulo state (82%) ( 
Figure S1
). 
Table 2
 shows the mean values of each condition and the comparison between conditions of the replication and extension scenarios. All scenarios, except the Frequent flyer scenario (p-value = 0.073; ² = 0.01), showed the inaction inertia effect.
Of the five scenarios, the "Control" condition presented the highest mean value in three scenarios, while the "Small-Difference" presented the highest mean in two scenarios.
There was a significant difference between the "Large-Difference" and "Small-Difference" conditions in three scenarios 
(Table 3)
. When comparing the "Large-Difference" condition with the "Control" condition, the difference was significant only for the Car scenario (p < 0.001; W = 5.59). Noteworthy, as opposed to previous findings, the means of the "Control" condition were significantly higher when compared with the "Large-Difference" condition in the Fitness center scenario, and the "Small-Difference" was significantly higher when compared with the "Control" condition in the Farm hotel scenario 
(Figure 1
).   In the present study, half of the results (6 out of 12 possibilities) from the original study 
(Tykocinski et al., 1995)
 were replicated, as shown in 
Table 5
. In the comparison between the "large difference" and "small difference" conditions, the results of the original study were replicated in two of the four scenarios (scenarios 1 and 4). In the "large difference" versus "control" comparison, the results were replicated in scenarios 2 (Car) and 4 (Fitness center). Between the "small difference" and "control" conditions, the results were replicated in scenarios 2 and 3 out of the four scenarios. Note: Dif (significant difference); L ("large difference"); S ("small difference"); C ("control"). We also ran preregistered analyses for all scenarios after excluding the participants who failed the verification question. 
Table S7
 in the supplementary material shows the rate of correct answers in each scenario. There was no significant difference compared with the total sample: the inaction inertia effect was observed in three scenarios, and in four of a total of twelve situations in the original scenarios ( 
Figure S2
; Tables S8 and S9). 
Tables 2 and 3
 show the comparisons between conditions of the Pucflix extension scenario. The only significant difference (after Bonferroni correction) was between the "Large-Difference" and the "Control" (p-value = 0.002). Of all the conditions, the "Large-Difference" had the lowest average, indicating a lower probability of subscribing to the streaming service when the subsequent offer was farther from the initial offer.


Extensions
A mixed linear effects analysis was used for the second extension, with the variable "money" as a fixed factor. The analysis indicated that money was a predictor of the value indicated by the subjects considering the conditions as random effects (t=-3.37, p-value < 0.001). In addition, within-group comparisons with the average values indicated by the participants between the different conditions for the grouping of scenarios "with money" (Farm hotel and Car) and "without money" (Frequent flyer and Fitness center) were performed. As shown in 
Table 6
, all comparisons in the "with money" scenarios presented differences among conditions, whereas in the "without money" scenarios the "large-control" comparison was the only one that did not present significant differences among the conditions. The same analyses were conducted after excluding the participants who failed the verification question, and the results remained similar (Tables S11 and S12). Note: the values of N are doubled compared to the analysis of each scenario because each subject responded to 2 "with money" and 2 "without money" scenarios (subjects were considered in the analysis as fixed effects). The average for each group condition is shown in the table, as well as the significant, or not significant, differences between the two conditions for each comparison.


Discussion
Our study shows evidence of the inaction inertia effect in the Brazilian population, partially replicating the original study and replicating very closely the study of 
Chen et al. (2021)
: half of the results (6 of 12 possibilities) of the original study were replicated 
(Tykocinski et al., 1995)
, as shown in 
Table 5
, and almost all results were replicated in comparison with 
Chen et al. (2021)
, as shown in 
Table 4
, with the only exception of the fitness center scenario (Large-Control condition). Therefore, our and previous studies may suggest that the inaction inertia effect occurs similarly in different cultural and geographical contexts and that it is possibly more susceptible to factors linked to the passage of time, such as: generational issues, the increased use of Ecommerce, or the value of the products/services offered in the scenarios in the era in which they are presented. We further elaborate on possible explanations for the results in each scenario.
In the Farm hotel scenario, there was a significant difference between the "Large-Difference" and "Small-Difference" conditions and between "Small-Difference"
and "Control". These results were also found in the study of 
Chen et al. (2021)
,
whereas in the original study 
(Tykocinski et al., 1995)
, the result was similar for the comparison between "Large-Difference" and "Small-Difference". Our main assumption for this outcome is the time frame in which each study has been conducted, hence the present replication results are remarkably close to the study of 
Chen et al. (2021)
, and partially close to the original study, performed in 1995. The temporal proximity between our study and Chen's proved to be a more determining factor than the cultural adaptation made in the scenarios (changing the Ski resort to a Farm hotel), as well as the geographical location (and culture) of the analyzed samples.
In the Car scenario, the results also matched the study by 
Chen et al. (2021)
.
On the other hand, compared to the original study, the same result was found only in the "Large-Difference" and "Control" comparison. Once again, this difference may suggest that the temporal proximity of the sample influences the effect, despite cultural differences between Brazilian and North American samples.
We did not find support for the inaction inertia effect in the Frequent flyer scenario, as occurred in the study by 
Chen and colleagues (2021)
. This result differed from the original study, which found an effect between the "Large-Difference" condition and the others. The low value of Frequent flyer programs may be caused due to the fact that the amount of miles offered no longer corresponds to the same exchange power for consumers as it did in the year of the original study. Moreover, making use of this score to purchase airline tickets was not available during the  pandemic (when the present study was conducted), due to the closure of international borders and restrictive measures for circulation.
In the Fitness center scenario, there were two significant differences between conditions: the difference between "Large-Difference" and "Small-Difference", replicating the original findings, and a higher acceptance of the "Small-Difference" condition in relation to the "Control". Interestingly, the replication study by 
Chen et al. (2021)
 also showed the same unexpected result in the comparison between these conditions. We suggest at least two possible explanations to interpret such results:
first, a temporal proximity with the other replication study, in comparison with the original one and second, the hypothesis that the inaction inertia effect could be better observed and measured depending on the conditions that are being compared. In this sense, the effect seems to be stronger for the "Large" versus "Small" differences.
Finally, in the Pucflix extension scenario, there was a difference between the "Large-Difference" condition and control condition, also attesting to the inaction inertia effect in this new scenario with a contemporary theme. Noteworthy, the verification question of this scenario obtained the highest hit rate (94.8%) 
(Table S7
). It's important to point out that all scenarios presented hit rates above 85% in the verification questions, indicating that participants were paying attention to the task. Importantly, there were no differences in the results for the subsamples of those who correctly answered the verification question 
(Table S7
). Thus, it is possible to rule out a lack of understanding of the questions as a limiting factor for the comparisons. For more detailed information about the verification questions, see the Supplementary material.
Regarding the investigation of the effects of money on people's decisionmaking, our results suggest that money may be a determinant variable, at least in the Brazilian population. This data is in line with the current literature, as it points out that throughout history, money has played a relevant role in the lives of individuals and societies 
(Lauer-Leite et al., 2014)
. It is also indicated that money can be considered a guiding principle used by individuals as a criterion to justify their actions 
(Lins & Poeschl, 2015)
 and that through purchasing power, and thus, money, there is a materialization of decision-making power 
(Silva & Henriques, 2017)
. One possible explanation suggests that money can be considered an instrument to mediate the satisfaction of human needs 
(Lauer-Leite et al., 2014)
, having an extraordinarily large rewarding potential 
(Skinner, 1967)
.
This analysis evaluating the financial aspect of decision-making in the context of the inaction inertia effect is innovative in our study. The influence of money on human behavior is relevant to both psychology and behavioral economics 
(Paixão, 2017)
. Future studies can further investigate the role of money in the inaction inertia effect and human decision-making, especially considering the comparison between scenarios with and without money in its description.
It is worth noting the economic differences between the samples of the original study and of the present replication are relevant, since there are scenarios directly involving money. In the United States in 1995, the site and year of the original study, the minimum wage was US$737.00 
(Countryeconomy, 2023a)
 and the inflation rate was 2.81% 
(Media, 2023)
, while in Brazil, in 2022, the minimum wage was R$1,212.0 (currently equivalent approximately to US$230.00) 
(Countryeconomy, 2023b)
 and the inflation rate was 5.79% 
(IBGE, 2023)
. Such discrepancies may be responsible for differences between the present study and the original one. Addressing this issue, it is worth remembering that ~40% of the sample in this replication study had a family income above 15 minimum wages. So, due to the high purchasing power of the sample, it is possible that the discrepancy between the proportion of discounts presented in the conditions had a different importance for the present sample when compared to the original study's sample.
This replication study has important limitations to address. Regarding sociodemographic characteristics, we noted a certain degree of variability in participants' socioeconomic status, as measured by family income, which reflects a portion of the Brazilian population. This concentration of participants with high purchasing power and high educational levels in the sample, as is often seen in academic research in Psychology, is a limitation that has been previously criticized 
(Bloom, 2017)
. Additionally, our study's participants were mainly based in São Paulo, one of the Brazilian states, and were predominantly composed of women (66%), which differs from the demographic distribution of Brazil (IBGE, 2010). Also, we acknowledge two deviations from the preregistration that could be considered limitations: 1) we have extended our proposed sample (n = 250), thus our sample was larger than planned and 2) we opted to use non-parametric analyses, since these were more adequate to our dataset, according to normality distribution and homogeneity of variance assumptions. Despite these limitations, the present study had adequate sample size analysis and used reliable methodologies in data collection and analysis.
Finally, this study assessed the inaction inertia effect by means of a hypothetical scenario: participants were required to evaluate how they would respond to certain situations. Given that it is known that hypothetical situations tend to differ from real-world situations 
(Vlaev, 2012)
, future experiments are suggested to offer a certain amount of money to participants (which could be symbolic) and present them with practical situations involving decision-making related to the inaction inertia effect.
This would be a more ecological task, closer to a more practical, naturalistic, and reliable situation. Future studies should also explore if individual differences in susceptibility to the inaction inertia effect are correlated across the different scenarios.


Conclusions
As in the original study 
(Tykocinski et al., 1995)
, the presence of the inaction inertia effect in decision-making was confirmed in the Brazilian population, especially in comparisons between the "Large-Difference" and "Small-Difference" conditions, and also appeared in comparisons of the "Large-Difference" condition and the "Control" condition. Of note, our study also replicated findings by 
Chen and colleagues (2021)
, which is contemporary to ours with a different population (mostly Americans assessed via Amazon Mechanical Turk). Our first extension, the Pucflix scenario, also indicated the presence of the Inaction Inertia effect in our culture. Therefore, our results further expand the evidence regarding the influence of the difference between offers on the inaction inertia effect, where the greater the difference in the value of the offers, the lower the likelihood of accepting the subsequent one. Finally, addressing the preregistered comparisons of the "With Money" versus "Without Money" scenario groups, we concluded that money was a determinant variable in the participants' decision-making, and therefore, that the Brazilian population (and possibly all human beings, generally in Western societies) may have different decision-making processes when money is or isn't involved. Future studies will have to take into account the importance of financial stimuli when evaluating the inaction inertia effect.

Statistical analyses were conducted using R [version 4.2.2] (R Core Team,

). The equality of variances was analyzed through Levene's Test ('rstatix' package), for each scenario. Analyses revealed non-normal distributions for all conditions in each scenario (for these results of normality check and homogeneity of variance, please see the Rmd and their knitted files in OSF, https://osf.io/ybfjp). Therefore, differences between conditions were analyzed with the non-parametric test Kruskall Wallis ('rstatix' package). When a significant difference was obtained, a pairwise comparison test was performed between conditions with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons within each scenario, resulting in an alpha value < 0.016 ('stats' package and JAMOVI post hoc pairwise comparisons to obtain the
