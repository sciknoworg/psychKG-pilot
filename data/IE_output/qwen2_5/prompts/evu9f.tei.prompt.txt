You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

The Police Use of Background Information Related to Alleged Victims in


Mock Evaluations of Child Sexual Abuse
The decision to press charges in child sexual abuse (CSA) cases depends on the quality and quantity of the available evidence. 
Herman (2010)
 divided evidence in forensic CSA evaluations into two groups: psychosocial and non-psychosocial. Non-psychosocial evidence, also referred to as strong evidence, includes medical findings, confessions, or videos and photographs. Psychosocial evidence, often considered soft evidence, can, for example, be children's reports and behaviors, or situations that affect the likelihood of the allegation being true (e.g., parental alienation syndrome; 
Gardner, 1998
; see also O'Donohue, 
Benuto, & Bennett, 2016)
. The presence of non-psychosocial evidence is usually enough to press charges, while psychosocial evidence tends to be considered less persuasive 
(Herman, 2010;
Myers, 2005)
. For example, Walsh, Jones, Cross, and Lippert (2010) have identified four types of evidence that, if present, increase the probability that CSA allegations are prosecuted: a disclosure by the victim, a corroborating witness, a confession by the suspect, or a second report against the suspect. In the absence of stronger evidence, the presence of a corroborating witness was the type of evidence that most increased the probability that charges would be filed. 
Herman (2010)
 demonstrated that only 36% of 894 CSA cases included corroborative non-psychosocial evidence 1 . In cases considered true by mental health and medical professionals this rose to 54%, suggesting that CSA allegations are often prosecuted based on non-corroborative evidence. It is therefore important that professionals involved in investigations and trials are able to identify and correctly assess the role and importance of psychosocial pieces of evidence in CSA cases.


Statistical Use of Background Information
Traditionally, for psychosocial and non-psychosocial evidence to be considered as important during investigations and trial, they both have to be directly related to the CSA allegations. Videos and medical symptoms, as well as children's statements and non-verbal behaviors need to be robustly linked to the CSA event to be admitted as evidence in court.
There is a third type of information, that we here call background information, which can potentially play an important role during an investigation, even if it is not directly linked to the CSA allegation and is not admissible as evidence. Examples of such background information include previous experiences of the alleged victim with other crimes, personal relations with relatives and peers that are not involved in the CSA allegation, or the alleged victim's life style, such as smoking or drinking.
In statistical terms, whether an alleged case of CSA is true or not, or whether the alleged offender has committed the offence or not, can be considered a classification problem.
In other words, the allegation or the suspect needs to be assigned to the right class, that is, a true or false allegation, or whether the suspect is the offender or not. A number of classification techniques are available (e.g., logistic regression, discriminant analysis, Knearest neighbors, naïve Bayes, classification trees, and others; 
James, Witten, Hastie, & Tibshirani, 2013)
, and they have been made accessible to non-statisticians through easy-to-use statistical packages (see, for example, 
Koul, Becchio, & Cavallo, 2017)
. Seen from a Bayesian decision-making point of view, background information can be used to estimate the veracity of an allegation, increasing or decreasing the probability of it being true. Using a naïve 
Bayes classifier, Tadei et al. (2017)
 identified 42 pieces of background information that predicted whether a CSA allegation was true or false with a high level of accuracy. This classifier, called FICSA (Finnish Investigative Instrument of Child Sexual Abuse), was trained on data regarding over 11 000 children and 903 variables 
(Ellonen, Fagerlund, Kääriäinen, Peltola, & Sariola, 2013)
. To calculate the probability of a CSA allegation being true or false, FICSA needs that part, if not all, of the 42 pieces of background information identified as statistically related to the CSA risk (25 specific for girls, 14 for boys, 3 common) are collected. For example, FICSA might ask if the child has ever tried to smoke, or ever has been robbed. Being a naïve Bayes classifier, FICSA can successfully integrate several pieces of evidence, also when gathered at different times, and the more questions are answered, the more accurate CSA probability estimation will be. Although these pieces of background information required by FICSA do not constitute actual evidence of CSA and would be likely to be non-admissible during a trial in many jurisdictions, the information could still increase the number of CSA allegations that are correctly solved. The authors suggested that knowing the correct base-line probability of a case being true when psychosocial or background information related to it is considered could help investigators prioritize among open cases to optimize the use of investigative resources 
(Tadei, Santtila, & Antfolk, n.d.)
. This could reduce the risk that important pieces of admissible evidence that degrade with time (e.g., physical symptoms, witnesses, child's memories) are invalidated in cases otherwise likely to be prosecuted 
(Adams, 2011;
Antfolk, Rönnholm, Salo, Rantamäki, & Santtila, n.d.;
Heger, Ticson, Velasquez, & Bernier, 2002;
Pipe, Sutherland, Webster, Jones, & La Rooy, 2004)
.
When applied to forensic evaluations, it has been demonstrated, however, that not only the creation of a classifier 
(Tadei et al., 2017;
Zawoad & Hasan, 2015)
, but also the interpretation of its results 
(Fenton & Neil, 2012;
Koehler, 2011;
Tadei et al., n.d.)
 can be problematic. When in contrast with their own opinion, expert witnesses and legal professionals tend not to consider the results provided by a statistical tool built on actuarial data 
(Tadei et al., n.d.)
. This might affect the correctness of the conclusions drawn by forensic professionals, since it has been demonstrated that various cognitive biases might affect decision making and accuracy also when dealing with statistics, (e.g., defense counsel's fallacy, prosecutor's fallacy; 
Fenton & Neil, 2012;
Henderson, 2002)
. In sum, background information and classification methods have potential to improve the accuracy of the decisions made by legal professionals, but available studies indicate that more training is needed.


Background Information in CSA Research and Investigations
There is a lack of research on the use police make of background information about alleged CSA victims. The few studies that have considered also background information have generally limited this to include only gender, ethnicity, and/or age of the child 
(Stroud, Martens, & Barker, 2000;
Walsh et al., 2010)
. Interestingly, 
Stroud, Martens, and Barker (2000)
 observed how all these three pieces of information, even if not evidence, were statistically related to the probability of a case being referred for criminal prosecution.
However, the authors did not specify if it is correct to assume that a particular age range, gender, or ethnicity increases the probability of the alleged abuse being true. In the case this assumption was wrong, the connections between these three variables and CSA could be considered CSA myths. 
Cromer and Goldsmith (2010)
 defined CSA myths as false beliefs that may "reflect circumscribed features of perpetrators and victims 
[and]
 cause harm through diminishing awareness for CSA and the allocation of resources to prevent CSA and help victims, and/or dissuade victims from disclosing abuse" (p. 619). To our best knowledge, research on CSA myths have not explored if these are common, for example, among police officers. The lack of representativeness of background information is visible in CSA myths research as well. 
Cromer and Goldsmith (2010)
 gathered and categorized 119 CSA myths, but, when discussing the beliefs about victim characteristics, they only commented on gender.
As far as concerns police officers, they are also subject to cognitive biases and myths as everyone else 
(Aamodt, 2008;
Saunders, 2012)
. Thus, we can expect that, because of the absence of research on CSA background information, they can hold false beliefs about the relation between these variables and CSA risk.


The Present Study
In the present study, we examined how police use background, non-corroborative, information in evaluations of CSA cases. We also tested if the use of such information was affected by it being contextualized in a scenario, as compared to when considered as individual pieces of information. Finally, we tested if being able to correctly consider all available pieces of valid background information, and correctly exclude information that is not valid, led to more accurate conclusions about an alleged CSA case being true or not.
Because of the lack of research about the connection between CSA and background information, we expected police officers not to be able to distinguish a CSA-related piece of information from an unrelated one, both when inserted in scenarios and when presented as individual pieces of information. We expected instead police officers to be able to interpret CSA-related information in the correct direction, that is, either increasing or decreasing the probability of the CSA allegation being true. Based on previous results (Tadei et al., n.d.), indicating a low accuracy of experts in estimating CSA probability without the help of decision-support tools (e.g. FICSA; Tadei et al., 2017), we expected a low performance from the participants when assessing the probability of CSA in the scenarios we presented them, independently of the performance in the CSA related information selection and interpretation task.


Method Participants
A total of 135 Finnish police officers participated in the present study. They were recruited through the Police College of Finland. Of the participants, 57% (n = 77) completed the online questionnaire in its entirety. We excluded participants only from analyses that required the missing information. Of the entire sample, 75% (n = 101) were detectives, the other 25% (n = 34) were non-detective officers. On average, participants had worked as police officers for 15 years (SD = 8). Of the participants, 62% (n = 84) had investigated at least one CSA case, whereas 38% (n = 51) had never dealt with a CSA case. Finally, 29% (n = 39) of the participants had attended a one-year training in child interviewing.


Ethical Permission
The Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Arts, Psychology and Theology of Åbo Akademi University considered the ethical implications of the present study and gave permission to the authors to carry it out. Before starting the questionnaire, participants signed an online consent form where policy about anonymity, possibility to withdraw from the study, and the aims of the research were described.


Measures and Procedures
The study consisted of two separate sections: section one (S1) and section two (S2). In S1, participants were presented with four scenarios (see Appendix A), each of them shortly describing the life situation and habits of four different children: Minna (14-year-old girl), Salla (8-year-old girl), Petri (14-year-old boy), and Mikko (8-year-old boy). The four scenarios included all possible combinations of gender (girl/boy) and probability of abuse (high/low). Each scenario contained exactly ten pieces of information (variables). Of these, five pieces were statistically unrelated to CSA and five pieces of information were statistically related to CSA. All variables were selected from a pool of approximately 1,000 variables used to study the life of over 11,000 Finnish children and their experience with crime conducted in 2013 
(Ellonen et al., 2013)
. This same pool of variables was used to train FICSA. We defined a variable as CSA-unrelated when the chi-squared test between the variable and the presence or absence of CSA experiences was statistically non-significant and the chi-squared test value was close to zero. We considered a variable CSA-related when the chi-squared test between the variable and CSA was statistically significant and the variable was used as a feature in 
FICSA (Tadei et al., 2017)
.
After each scenario, participants had to report their perceived probability (0-100%) that the child described had been victim of CSA. CSA was defined as the occurrence of one or more experiences ranging from Receiving a proposal to do anything sexual to Sexual penetration involving a person before age 17, along with at least a 5 year age difference between the victim and the offender (Duodecim, 2013). Furthermore, out of the ten variables in each scenario, they had to list the variables they used to estimate the CSA probability and specify, for each of them, if it increased or decreased the CSA risk.
In S2, participants were presented with a list of 44 variables (see Appendix B). These variables belonged to one of the following categories: CSA-related for both boys and girls (n = 1), related only for boys (n = 5), related only for girls (n = 16), or unrelated to CSA both for boys and girls (n = 22). To define a variable as CSA-related or -unrelated, we used the same approach as in S1. None of the 44 variables overlapped with the ones used in the four scenarios in S1. In S2, the variables were distributed unevenly across the four categories. This is because the number of features used by FICSA is not equal for these categories. FICSA uses 25 variables that are related to CSA only for girls, 14 only for boys, and 3 variables that are related to CSA for both girls and boys. For each variable, participants were asked to specify which of the four categories it belonged to, being informed that a variable could belong to only one of the four categories.


Statistical Analyses
Section 1. To evaluate how accurate participants were in estimating the CSA probability in the four scenarios we compared the mean of their answers with the probability calculated by FICSA. For more informative descriptive statistics, since the four means were associated with large standard deviations, we decided to use a bootstrapping procedure with 1000 re-samples and a 95% confidence interval. A one-way ANOVA was used to investigate possible differences in the CSA probability estimates both between the scenarios and when compared with the probabilities calculated by FICSA. Descriptive statistics were used to report how well participants performed in excluding CSA-unrelated variables and in retaining CSA-related variables. We also checked whether the CSA-related variables were interpreted in the correct direction (i.e., increasing or decreasing the CSA probability). Pearson correlation was used to test if a good or bad performance in recognizing CSA-related orunrelated variables was consistent across all scenarios. Finally, we used Pearson correlation to test if a more correct identification of the CSA-related and -unrelated variables was associated with a more correct estimation of the CSA probability.
Section 2. Descriptive statistics were used to measure how good participants were in choosing the right category for each of the 44 variables listed among CSA-related for both boys and girls, related only for boys, related only for girls, or unrelated to CSA both for boys and for girls. 
Table 1
 shows the average probability estimated by the participants for each scenario, together with standard deviations, 95% confidence intervals, and probability estimated by FICSA. The descriptive analysis in 
Table 1
 shows how the estimates in all the scenarios are below 50%, indicating a tendency to consider the CSA allegation as unlikely to be true when not supported by corroborative evidence. A one-way ANOVA analysis on the estimates, using the scenarios as factor, showed significant differences between the scenarios (F(3, 368) =

Accuracy of CSA Probability Estimates
18.72, p < .001). However, a Gabriel's pairwise post hoc test, chosen because of the small differences in the size of the compared groups 
(Field, 2013)
, did not indicate differences between scenarios 1 and 2 and between scenarios 3 and 4 as statistically significant (p = 1.000), while all the other contrasts were statistically significant (p < .001). These results indicate a gender effect, with the scenarios about girls receiving higher risk estimates than the scenarios about boys. However, the officers do not seem to be sensitive to the differences between scenarios with low and high probabilities of abuse. The comparison between our participants' estimates and the ones from FICSA shows that police officers have been accurate, even if at the limits of the confidence intervals, only in two scenarios out of four. In scenarios 2 and 3, the difference between the two estimates is about 35 points, indicating important misjudgments. We then investigated if the difference between police and FICSA estimates is statistically larger in scenarios 2 and 3, than in scenarios 1 and 4. A one-way ANOVA on the differences between the estimates from our participants and the probabilities calculated by FICSA, using the scenarios as factor, showed significant differences between the scenarios (F(3, 368) = 58.80, p < .001). A Gabriel's pairwise post hoc test, however, did not identify any statistical difference between scenarios 1 (girl: low) and 4 (boy: low, p = .13) and between scenarios 2 (girl: high) and 3 (boy: high, p = .33). These results could indicate a tendency among police officers to give low estimates overall when only background information is available, making them accurate for cases with low probability.


Selection and Interpretation of CSA Related and Unrelated Variables
We next investigated police officers' performance in distinguishing between pieces of background information that have an influence on the CSA probability and ones that are irrelevant. 
Table 2
 shows, per scenario, the average number of irrelevant variables correctly excluded from the CSA evaluation, the average number of CSA related variables used to estimate the CSA probability, the average number of CSA related variables that were used in the correct direction (i.e., increasing or decreasing the CSA probability). For each of these values, the optimal performance would be 5, as five unrelated and five related CSA variables were included in each scenario. These results show a better performance in discarding irrelevant variables than in retaining relevant ones. These numbers partially confirm our hypothesis about the difficulties to distinguish relevant information from irrelevant ones. The tendency not to consider background information as relevant for an accurate CSA evaluation can explain both discarding irrelevant variables and failing to retain relevant variables. The third column indicates that, when a CSA-related variable was included it was done in the correct direction most of the times (91.7%), hence in line with our hypothesis about the capacity of police officers in understanding if a variable would either increase or decrease the CSA probability.
We studied the correlation between the performances in selecting or excluding the correct variables in the four scenarios. None of the correlations were statistically significant.
Moreover, we did not find any statistically significant correlation between the performances in the CSA probability estimation task and the relevant/irrelevant information selection task.
The results of the correlations are shown in 
Table 3
. With Section 2 of the present study, we investigated if police officers were able to separate CSA-related variables from unrelated variables when presented outside the context of a mock scenario. 
Table 4
 shows a crosstab with the categorization done by police in the rows and the correct categorization on the columns. Police officers correctly identified 49.8% of the unrelated variables (i.e., in more than 50% of the cases they thought an unrelated variable was related to CSA. As participants used almost only two categories, that is, unrelated and related for both, the percentage of correct identification for the unrelated variables would raise to 51.7%, only slightly better than chance level), 74% of the variables related to CSA for both genders, but only 0.8% of the ones related only for girls, and 0.5% of the ones related only for boys. As shown in 
Table 4
, the variables related to CSA only for boys and only for girls have been interpreted, most of the times, as valid for both genders.


Discussion
In the current study, we aimed to investigate how police officers select and interpret background information in CSA mock evaluations, both when part of scenarios and when observed individually. We also investigated if the correct use of background information leads to better estimation of the CSA risk probability.


Selection and Interpretation of Background Information
When the background variables were contextualized in a scenario, police officers performed better in discarding the CSA-unrelated variables that in taking in consideration the related ones. This can be explained by the fact that participants overall tended to use a small number of variables (on average, 3 out of 10 per scenario) to estimate the CSA probability.
On the other hand, police officers performed very well in understanding if a variable, when correctly identified as CSA-related, would have increased or decreased the CSA probability.
When evaluating the police officers' performance in understanding the correct direction of the chosen CSA-related variables, 91.7% overall, we must keep in mind the different baselines of the variables that increase and decrease the CSA probability in each scenario. In the four scenarios, the distribution of the CSA-related variables was uneven, meaning that scenarios 1 and 2 had four variables that increased the CSA probability and only one that decreased it, while scenarios 3 and 4 had three variables that increased and two that decreased it. However, even considering that by defining all CSA-related variables as increasing the CSA probability, this would have led to 80% and 60% accuracy, showing that participants performed quite well.
When the variables were not contextualized in scenarios, police officers performed well in identifying variables related to CSA for both genders, but worse when the variable was unrelated to CSA, or related only for boys or only for girls. In particular, in more than 50% of the times they considered CSA unrelated variables as related. This result goes in the opposite direction compared to when the variables were inside scenarios. This might be due to the fact that, as demonstrated by the low CSA estimates, participants did not consider the CSA risk in the scenarios very likely and so tended to disregard a higher number of variables.
When the variables were not part of a scenario, instead, police officers were not influenced by their own opinions about the CSA having occurred or not. Another possible explanation is that the single CSA-related variable presented individually, compared to the ones in the scenarios, simply was more well-known to the police officers. The reversed could be the case for CSA-unrelated variables, with more well-known variables being presented in the scenarios and less known presented separately. Finally, participants almost never considered the possibility that a variable could be related to CSA only for a specific gender. This result indicates the need for a much better training about gender specific CSA risk and protective factors.


Estimation of CSA Probability
The results show that police officers, when asked to evaluate the CSA probability in scenarios containing only background information, tend to provide low values overall. On one hand, this conservativeness is understandable because of the short length of the scenarios and the complete absence of corroborative evidence. On the other hand, if the conservativeness translates to real allegations, high probability cases risk not to be identified as such. In all the scenarios, on average, they estimated a probability lower than 50%, meaning that they considered it was unlikely that the abuse had actually taken place. As a consequence of consistently estimating low probabilities, police officers were more accurate in evaluating low probability scenarios. We also observed the possible existence of a gender bias, since participants consistently estimated the CSA risk for a boy to be 15% less probable than when a comparable scenario was about a girl. The difference between the CSA prevalence for boys and girls (in Finland 0.7% and 3%, respectively; Tadei et al., 2017) is not large enough to alone explain the difference between genders in the police officers' estimates. Unfortunately, there is a lack of scientific literature about the perception of CSA risk for boys and girls and its accuracy. However, we might hypothesize that, since it is commonly known that most people who commit CSA are males 
(Faller, 1996;
McLeod, 2015)
, over-simplistic reasoning could lead to the assumption that male sex offenders would abuse girls in almost the totality of cases. Another reason why girls are perceived as at much higher risk than boys could be because the distribution of sexual assaults among adults indicates that women are more likely to be victimized 
(Breiding et al., 2015;
Tjaden & Thoennes, 2000)
. People, therefore, could tend to transpose the same prevalence to the children. These are possible explanations of the gender bias we identified in the present study, but they should be scientifically investigated to even be considered as plausible.
Correlation coefficients close to zero and absence of statistical significance for the association between ability of estimating the CSA probability and selection and interpretation of the CSA related variables indicate a difficulty from police officers to attribute the correct weight to each risk and protective factor and to compute a probability based on these weights.
This result is in line with what has been observed in a recent study by 
Tadei et al. (n.d.)
, that is, experts from the Finnish CSA investigative units tend to be inaccurate in estimating CSA probability when not assisted by decision-making support tools.


Limitations
To measure how correct participants were in estimating CSA probability, we
compared their values with the ones we obtained by running FICSA on the four scenarios and that we considered correct. Even if it has been demonstrated that FICSA has excellent diagnostic validity (AUC = .88 for girls and .97 for boys; Tadei et al., 2017), there is still the possibility for a scenario to be among the false positives or false negatives. In this case, the police officers' estimations might be right and the FICSA's ones, that here we considered correct, might be wrong. However, we limited this risk basing our analyses on four scenarios rather than only one. Furthermore, the risk of wrong estimates by FICSA is also reduced by our results being in line with previous studies.
Earlier we illustrated the possibility that the complete absence of information about a possible CSA event might have driven the participants towards lower estimates. This is supported by the fact that a CSA allegation where only background information is present would rarely be considered worthy of an investigation. However, a previous study 
(Tadei et al., n.d.)
 demonstrated that the presence of information related to the alleged CSA event does not always influence the probability estimated using background information only. In any case, we could not add this type of evidence to our scenarios since FICSA would not take it in consideration, i.e. the probability provided by FICSA would be wrong, hence, we could not evaluate the police officers' performance.


Conclusions
With this study, we demonstrated that police officers partially use the available background information when evaluating CSA allegations. However, the relevance given to these pieces of information seems to be dependent on the police officers' own opinion about the CSA probability. Hence, we highlight the importance of better research and training on the nature and use of background information in CSA cases, with a special focus on the gender specific risk and protective factors. We also suggest a consistent use, during the entire investigation process, of decision-making support tools based on actuarial data to help understanding correctly the probabilistic value of each piece of evidence. Finally, we
identified the presence of a gender bias that makes the officers estimate an unjustified much higher CSA risk in the scenarios involving girls. This bias, and the reasons behind it, necessitate a deeper exploration.

 The four scenarios, translated from Finnish, used in Section 1. The CSA probability estimated by FICSA is reported.


Scenario 1
Minna is a 14-year-old girl. She lives with her father and the father's girlfriend; both of them work in the evening, so they have dinner together with Minna once a week or less. The father's girlfriend, when angry at him, usually slaps him in the face, even in front of Minna.
Since Minna is often alone in the evening, she sometimes meets her friends, same age as she, in the main square, usually between 10pm and 12am. Otherwise, she spends her time with the boyfriend, 14 years old as well. They already had sex, even if the first time the boyfriend convinced her under the threat to leave her. She really did not like his behavior, but decided not to tell anyone. She sometimes drinks a glass of wine, or half bottle of beer, taken from home when the adults are not there. Even more in the past 6 months, she would describe herself as easily scared and with quite many fears.
FICSA probability: 36.9%


Scenario 2
Salla is an 8-year-old girl. At school, during breaks, it happens that she smokes a cigarette or two, not daily. Maybe is for that that in the last year, on social networks, people are saying nasty things about her. Also, she sometimes gets insulted through text messages. Salla told her best friend, Olga, about these messages, but Olga got angry and blamed her. Salla got very upset for that because she considers herself helpful whenever someone is sad or hurt. Salla does not even receive much support at home, where the father has always insulted her.
However, he never pushed or shook her. In her family sexual matters have been always discussed openly. Some form of hearing impairment affects Salla, since she was born.
FICSA probability: 80.8%


Scenario
Petri is a 14-year-old boy. Lately he has been caught stealing some money from the parents' wallet, and also his classmates complained about missing things, but never accused him directly. When he was young, he lived for a few months in a foster family, due to unspecified parents' difficulties. Anyway, he is currently back to his family. Even if sometimes his parents drink wine during meals, Petri never saw them drunk. He likes organized activities and, in particular, he plays as attacker in the school football team. He defines himself as very persistent, he never stops until he finishes what he is doing. Petri considers himself extremely handsome, maybe because of the number of peers, his age, he had sexual touching experiences with, around 8-9. This, most of the times, happened at the peers' house, where they organized to study together. When explicitly asked, Petri said that he never received any sexual proposal online by unknown people.
FICSA probability: 67.6%


Scenario 4
Mikko is an 8-year-old boy. He lives with the mother, the step-father and with two older sisters, 11 and 12 years old. The relation with the sisters is stormy. They often mock him when they are home alone. Once they even gave Mikko a glass of beer to drink just to bully him about being drunk, even if he drank so little that the effect on him was very light. One month ago, Mikko has been attacked by an older schoolmate who pushed him against the wall just to take his snack and the lucky stone that he always kept in his pocket. Mikko spends every night at home with his family.
