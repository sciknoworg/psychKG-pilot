You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Cooperation is a key motive for social interaction, which determines and structures communities across species 
(Melis & Semmann, 2010)
. Cooperation hinges on establishing trust, i.e., the expectation that a potential cooperation partner will have benevolent motives and prioritize collective as supposed to their individual goals 
(Balliet & Van Lange, 2013)
. Precursors to cooperation emerge in infancy and are continuously refined thereafter as children orient themselves more towards building peer relationships 
(Dawson et al., 1998;
Elsabbagh & Johnson, 2010;
Rosati et al., 2019)
.
Young children already decide to cooperate with others based on their perceived trustworthiness 
(Grueneisen et al., 2021)
 but as children transition to adolescence, they become more accurate at judging their partner's trustworthiness by building an implicit understanding of their partner's intention from their behavior 
(Fett et al., 2014;
van de Groep et al., 2020;
Van Hoorn et al., 2017)
.
Adolescence is an important life phase for developing well-adjusted social behavior. Establishing and maintaining positive peer relationships become key social goals and peers exert the greatest influence on cooperative behavior 
(Crone & Dahl, 2012;
Lafontana & Antonius, 2009;
Nelson et al., 2016)
. While adolescents show an exceptionally high social motivation -actively seeking out affiliations with peers and caring deeply about being excluded -their social learning and decision-making strategies are less optimal compared to those of adults 
(Fuhrmann et al., 2015;
Hofmans & van den Bos, 2022;
Rosenblau et al., 2018)
.
While a substantial body of literature has informed the transition from adolescence to adulthood 
(Casey, 2015;
Casey et al., 2008;
Tomova et al., 2021)
, relatively little is known about the transition from childhood to adolescence. The term preadolescence was coined to refer to children in the age range of 10 to 12 who experience first pubertal changes 
(Richardson et al., 2021)
. Recent studies have recorded earlier pubertal shifts 
(Muftuler et al., 2012;
Richardson et al., 2021)
, referring to children between 8 and 12 as early adolescents, preadolescents or "tweens", in between childhood and adolescence 
(Holm et al., 2022;
Pelham III et al., 2021)
. Our study focuses on this early adolescent phase, as it may represent a window of opportunity to increase pro-social behavior, positive social outcomes, and decrease the risk for poor health outcomes in adolescence 
(Flook, Zahn-Waxler, & Davidson, 2019)
.
Note that for simplicity, we will refer to individuals in this age range as children.
Our objective was to characterize ongoing development underlying cooperation decisions, a key social behavior, during early adolescence. We had pre-registered this aim, drawing on strong evidence from previous studies conducted with older typically developing groups, including older adolescents and adults 
(Van den Bos et al., 2012)
.
Our pre-registered hypotheses predicted significant changes in cooperation decisions and in the cognitive strategies involved in information sampling for cooperation during early adolescence. These hypotheses were based on previous findings indicating substantial developmental shifts in rational decision-making abilities and an increasing focus on peer relationships during this period 
(Flook, Zahn-Waxler, & Davidson, 2019)
.
Our second exploratory aim was to investigate whether autistic children with comparable cognitive skills to their non-autistic peers would exhibit differences in cooperation decisions and in information sampling prior to making cooperation decisions. During adolescence, autistic children face greater challenges than their non-autistic peers due to pronounced social deficits 
(Bolling et al., 2015;
Dawson et al., 1998;
Jones et al., 2018;
Oerlemans et al., 2018;
Rosenblau et al., 2020)
. They are therefore at a higher risk of experiencing isolation and rejection compared to TD children 
(Orsmond et al., 2004;
Rotheram-fuller, 2007)
. Given these unique social difficulties, it is crucial to investigate how social decision-making processes in autistic children may diverge from typical developmental trajectories as they transition into adolescence.
Recent studies comparing reward processing including social rewards in autistic children have not conclusively established differences between TD and ASD groups 
(Baumeister et al., 2023;
Bottini, 2018;
Mantas et al., 2022;
Van Hoorn et al., 2017)
. The small number of studies investigating differences in trust and cooperation of autistic individuals have also produced inconclusive results. Some studies did not find differences in cooperation decisions between TD and ASD groups. Like TD individuals, autistic individuals relied on their partner's reputation to decide whether to cooperate 
(Mantas et al., 2022;
Van Hoorn et al., 2017)
. Other studies found that TD participants adapted their level of trust in a partner more to implicit cues that signaled the level of trustworthiness 
(Ewing et al., 2015;
Maurer et al., 2018;
Yi et al., 2013)
. A recent review on deception in autism highlights small sample sizes and the large heterogeneity in cognitive and symptomatology profiles as contributing factors to these inconsistent findings 
(Bagnall et al., 2022)
. This emphasizes the need for larger and more diverse samples of autistic individuals and in depth phenotyping, in order to better understand group differences in strategic behavior and cooperation 
(Mottron & Bzdok, 2020)
.
Cooperation can be studied reliably with behavioral economics paradigms such as the trust game 
(Alós-Ferrer & Farolfi, 2019;
Berg et al., 1995;
Glaeser et al., 2000)
.
In the trust game, one player, the investor, is endowed money and can choose to share some of their endowment with another player, the trustee 
(Güth et al., 1997)
. In a single round trust game an economically rational investor would not share the money with an unknown trustee because the trustee does not face any negative consequences for exploiting the investor 
(Holt & Roth, 2004)
. Contrary to this economic prediction, humans frequently trust their counterpart and cooperate despite the high risk of facing exploitation 
(Adolphs, 2003;
Berg et al., 1995;
Fehr & Fischbacher, 2003)
. To minimize the risk of exploitations, humans actively seek information about their partners ahead of investment decisions 
(Ma et al., 2020;
Vives & Feldmanhall, 2018)
.
Children and adults have been shown to successfully gather information about a trustee's past behavior to minimize their uncertainty about the trustee's trustworthiness 
(Van den Bos et al., 2012;
Vives & Feldmanhall, 2018)
. 
colleagues (Ma et al., 2020, 2022)
 assessed how adults and adolescents sequentially sampled information about a trustee's reciprocation history before making cooperation decisions. The authors found that both adolescents and adults sampled information about their partners to decrease uncertainty about their trustworthiness. While they relied on the same information sampling strategy to reduce uncertainty of their partners' trustworthiness, with age, adolescents relied less on their priors and more on efficient information sampling to make cooperation decisions 
(Ma et al., 2022)
.
The current study aimed to extend this literature by investigating developmental changes in both cooperation and information sampling strategies in younger early adolescent children in the age range of 8 to 12 years old. We surmised that ongoing development in this stage would scale with a more efficient implementation of cognitive strategies, which would ultimately lead to more adaptive behavior. Our preregistered hypotheses stated that TD children would rely on the same information sampling strategy, captured with computational models, as older age groups 
(Ma et al., 2022)
.
We further expected that non-linear social cognitive development during adolescence 
(Blijd-Hoogewys et al., 2021;
Pauls et al., 2013)
 would extend to early adolescence. To this end, we expected non-linear effects of age and the magnitude of social skills to scale with cooperation decisions, information sampling frequency, and underlying model variables in TD children.
Our second exploratory aim addressed the critical need of more in depth phenotyping of autistic children. To this end, we connected behavioral responses to underlying cognitive models, demographic factors, and symptom profiles. We tested how autistic children between 8 and 12 years differed in their cooperation strategies from their TD counterparts. The exploratory analyses tested the notion that autistic individuals are less able to adapt their behavior to their interaction partners 
McPartland & Volkmar, 2012;
Neuhaus et al., 2016;
Pelphrey & Carter, 2008)
.
Based on these studies, autistic children were expected to rely on a less adaptive information sampling strategy. As a result, we predicted that autistic children would exhibit less adaptation of cooperation decisions and information sampling frequencies to their partners' trustworthiness levels compared with the TD group. Furthermore, considering the cascading neurodevelopmental changes that impact the severity of autism symptomatology, particularly changes in social functioning 
(Bieneck et al., 2021;
Seguin et al., 2021;
Vivanti et al., 2013)
, we expected to observe group differences in the relationship between age and task behavior. Finally, we surmised that these differences in cooperation, information sampling frequencies, and strategies would scale with social deficits in the ASD group.


Method


Participants
Child participants and their parent guardians completed the study through RedCap (https://cri-datacap.org/), a secure web application hosted by Children's National for building and managing surveys and databases. A parent / legal guardian was asked to first read and sign the online consent form. Children were subsequently asked to give assent for participation. The study was conducted in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institutional review board of the George Washington University (FWA00005945).


Typically developing participants
Our preregistered target sample size for the information sampling trust game was 50 TD children (age range 8-12 years). Participants were recruited through advertisements on online (social media) platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, lab website) or through local recruitment and outreach events. Eligible TD children were enrolled if they did not have any uncorrected sensory deficits that would interfere with study participation (i.e., uncorrected visual or hearing deficits), neurodevelopmental or other neuropsychological disorder including learning disabilities, an individualized educational plan, and did not have siblings or parents diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder and/ or learning disabilities. To robustly characterize reciprocation and information sampling tendencies we excluded participants with more than 25% missed responses on the information sampling task (N(TD)=2). The final TD group for our model-free analyses included 48 TD children 
(Mean Age=10.05,
SD=1.47,
21 males)
.


Autistic participants
We expanded the original scope of the project, which was to characterize information sampling strategies of TD children, by additionally comparing strategies of TD children with those of autistic children. To this end, we recruited an additional group of autistic We aimed to recruit 50 autistic children; the same number of individuals as recruited in the typically developing (TD) group. We sought to also match groups according to sex and age. Given a larger proportion of boys diagnosed with autism compared to girls, we did not achieve fully matched samples in terms of sex and had to recruit slightly more autistic participants to select matched samples of participants for group comparisons. Autistic children (N=60) were re-screened by the study team using the same online screener used for TDs to confirm inclusion and exclusion criteria. To robustly characterize reciprocation and information sampling tendencies we excluded participants with more than 25% missed responses on the information sampling task (N(ASD)=4). The final ASD sample for our model-free analyses included 56 ASD children (M=10.76, SD=1.50, 38 males).
A post hoc power analysis based on our results from the pre-registered TD group analyses corroborated that a sample size of 50 autistic adolescents would be sufficient to detect the effect. The power analysis was conducted using package "pwr" in R based on the linear mixed effects model (LME) of the TD group, which predicted cooperation decisions with the trustee's reciprocation probabilities and additionally with age and the scores on the Social Responsiveness Scales (SRS). At a significance level of α=.05 and a statistical power=0.80, the minimum sample size needed with the effect size from the LME model is N=47 participants. We also corroborated this sample size with a post-hoc power analysis based on the group comparison effect for cooperation decisions including group, age and SRS. With a significant criterion of α=0.05 and power=0.80, the minimum sample size needed was N=50.


Study-based inclusions and exclusions
Sex differences. The male-to-female ratio of children diagnosed with ASD is 4 male to 1 female 
(Loomes et al., 2017)
. To ensure a greater representation of autistic females, we oversampled girls thereby achieving a 2 male to 1 female sex ratio. Eighteen of the 56 autistic children included in our final sample were female. This resulted in significant a sex difference between TD and ASD groups. As such, we performed all group comparisons in smaller sex-and age-matched samples of ASD and TD children (see 
Table 1
, model free matched sample).
For the computational modeling analyses, we additionally excluded participants with too little variance in behavioral responses (less than 10% or more than 90% of the tiles uncovered throughout the experiment). This is because our main computational models hinge on participants exhibiting some degree of variability in sampling behavior.
Twelve TD children and 16 autistic children had to be excluded because their sampling behavior fell outside of the predefined range. The final sample for the computational modeling analyses included 36 TD children and 40 autistic children (see 
Table 1
, computational modeling sample).
Post hoc power analyses based on prior belief and decision noise estimates from the TD group at a significance level of α=0.05 and a statistical power=0.80 confirmed that the minimum sample size of autistic group needed would be 41 and 34. In our study, we included 40 autistic children in the computational model analysis.


Preregistration
Building upon robust evidence from previous research conducted on information sampling in older TD adolescents and adults 
(Ma et al., 2020
(Ma et al., , 2022
, we preregistered the procedure, experimental design, and hypotheses for the TD group on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/mt6pz). Throughout the manuscript, we have clearly separated our methods and results sections, using subtitles to indicate whether we are addressing our pre-registered hypotheses or our exploratory hypotheses.


Study procedures
After online consent procedures, participants and parent/guardians were instructed that the experimental task would start, which children should complete independently.
Parents were told not to help or give advice on how to solve the tasks. First, a childfriendly animated video was used to explain the Information Sampling Trust Game to the child participants (see 
Fig.1A
). The video explained the investor and trustee role, buttons to use in the task, and the meaning of all possible information sampling outcomes. In follow-up questions, we probed participants' understanding of the game.
Participants could only continue when they gave the correct answers to the questions.
Otherwise, they were prompted to watch the video again. They were also instructed that they could reach out to the study team with questions. After instructions, child participants were directed to the actual game, which was designed with Unity, a crossplatform game engine (https://unity.com) and served by Psiturk (https://psiturk.org). The game was hosted on the lab's Amazon's Virtual Cloud server (AWS). After completing the game, participants were instructed that the following block involved the parent or legal guardian (i.e., parent block). The block consisted of parent-report questionnaires.
These were a publisher approved version of the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2, 
Constantino, 2013)
, which measures social adjustment in typical and autistic populations with a focus on social deficits in ASD and the autism-spectrum quotient (AQ, 
Constantino, 2013)
, which measures of autistic traits. Participants were compensated with a $20 Amazon voucher for participating.


Experimental paradigm
The Information Sampling Trust Game introduced in previous studies 
(Ma et al., 2020)
 combines a well-established behavioral economics paradigm known as the single-shot Trust Game 
(Berg et al., 1995)
 with sequential information sampling (see 
Fig. 1
). The Trust Game involves two players: an investor and a trustee. At the beginning of each trial, investors are endowed with 6 tokens, which they can keep to themselves or share with the trustee. If they share, the trustee receives the endowment multiplied by 4, meaning that the trustee received 24 tokens. Trustees can then choose to reciprocate half of the endowment, resulting in 12 tokens for both players, or defect and keep all 24 tokens. All participants played the task in the investor role.
Participants were told that the trustees in this task previously participated in a different experiment in which they also played in the trustee role. As such, participants had the chance to investigate whether each trustee previously shared the tokens back with investors or not. To investigate the trustee's reciprocation history, they could uncover up to 25 tiles arranged in a 5x5 grid. They were told that if the tile turned green upon clicking on it, the trustee reciprocated in that past game (i.e., shared back), while a red tile indicated the trustee's decision to defect (i.e., kept). We clarified that the location of the tile did not matter and that the tiles could either be all green, all red or a combination of randomly arranged green and red tiles. Each trial would be played with a new unknown trustee, and the ratio of green to red tiles varied between trials.
On each of the 60 total trials, participants could sample any number of tiles between 0 and 25. Unbeknownst to participants, tile outcomes were computergenerated and drawn from the following probabilities pr = (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1), where 0 is completely untrustworthy (all tiles are red) and 1 is fully trustworthy (all tiles green). Each participant sampled information from 60 different trustees (10 trustees per condition), resulting in a maximum of 1500 sampling decisions. There were no explicit sampling costs other than the time and effort involved in turning tiles and there was no time limit to complete the task (see 
Fig. 1B
 for an example trial).


Model free analysis


Pre-registered analyses
In line with our pre-registered aim, we assessed how TD children's cooperation decisions and sampling amounts differed as a function of the trustees' reciprocation probabilities pr = (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0). To this end, we used linear mixedeffects models (LME) with a random intercept per participant as implemented in the lme4 package in R (www.r-project.org R Core Team, 2014). With respect to sampling frequency, we assessed the effects of outcome uncertainty as introduced in previous studies 
(Ma et al., 2020;
Ma, Westhoff, & van Duijvenvoorde, 2022)
. Outcome uncertainty is defined as the variance in the Bernoulli distribution given by r*(1-r), where r is the trustee's reciprocation probability. Uncertainty represents an inverted u-shaped function of reciprocation probabilities, with reciprocation probabilities around 0.5 (here 0.4 and 0.6 conditions) resulting in high uncertainty. Reciprocation probabilities of 0.2 and 0.8 were defined as medium uncertainty, and 0 and 1 were defined as low uncertainty conditions. In separate analyses, we investigated whether task behavior was modulated by ongoing developmental changes, and differences in social skills.


Cooperation decisions
We specified six LME models. Four of the six models tested our preregistered hypotheses in TD children. Model 1 tested whether children's cooperation decisions were predicted by the trustees' reciprocation probabilities (i.e., task conditions). Model tested the effects of reciprocation probabilities and age in months, as a continuous linear and quadratic regressor on cooperation decisions. Model 3 tested the effects of reciprocation probabilities and social skills on cooperation decisions. For this analysis we used total SRS raw scores and not AQ scores because a smaller number of participants completed the latter measure (see 
Table 1
). Model 4 tested the interaction between age and social skills on participants cooperation decisions.


Exploratory analyses
Additional analogous analyses addressed our second aim of identifying differences in cooperation and sampling decisions between TD and ASD groups. Finally, given the growing literature on the importance of examining sex differences in autism and our ability to oversample females 
(Bölte et al., 2023)
, we investigated sex differences in cooperation decisions and information sampling behaviors and report these exploratory analyses in the supplementary material.
For exploratory analyses, we reported whether significance values (p) were smaller than the Bonferroni adjusted significance thresholds. Given that we run two group comparison models for each question, group differences in cooperation decisions and in information sampling, we reported significant values that pass the significance threshold adjusted=0.05/2.
Additionally, we ran permutation tests for group comparison analyses using the package 'predictmeans' in R. These analyses compared the LME models with and without a group predictor on the combined TD and ASD sample using permutation testing. Likelihood ratio tests were used to determine whether the group 
(TD vs. ASD)
 predictor significantly improved the model fit. This was the case for all reported group differences. We report the permutation analyses in the supplementary material.


Cooperation decisions
Models 5 and 6 corresponded to our exploratory aims and tested group differences (TD vs. ASD) in participants' cooperation decisions. Because of significant sex differences between TD and ASD groups, we performed group comparisons in smaller, closely matched TD and ASD groups (see 
Table 1
). Model 5 is analogous to Model 1 and tested group differences in cooperation decisions. Model 6 is analogous to Model 4 and tested whether group differences in cooperation decisions were modulated by age and


SRS.
Sampling frequency.
Six LME models were set up to predict the number of samples per trial based on outcome uncertainty. These analyses are analogous to the ones testing cooperation decisions.


Computational models
We examined how children decided to sample and stop sampling information. To this end we fit computational models that capture varying levels of cognitive complexity to children's actual information sampling history. Our computational modeling space has been introduced and validated in previous studies including model and parameter recovery 
(Ma et al., 2020
(Ma et al., , 2022
. In brief, the main model space consists of four types of models of increasing complexity: 1) an Uncertainty model prescribes sampling until an uncertainty tolerance criterion is reached, 2) a normative Sample Cost model which maximizes expected utility by weighing the benefits of sampling against the subjective cost, 3) a heuristic Threshold model with decision bounds that weighs the absolute difference between uncovered red and green tiles, and 4) a simple Count model that bases the decision to stop sampling on the total amount of sampled tiles.
Formally, in all sampling models, the state is defined by the number of turned green tiles (n+) and the number of turned red tiles (n-). The actions are to either sample or to stop sampling before or until all 25 tiles are sampled. In all four models the values converted to choice probabilities through a softmax function, which allows for decision noise and bias estimation. Note that all model types, except for the Count model, have multiple versions. The full model has the highest number of free parameters. In additional versions, we systematically removed free parameters from the full model and only kept the free parameters that significantly contributed to the fit in order to avoid overfitting 
(Ma et al., 2020
(Ma et al., , 2022
. The additional free parameters were based on the trust game literature.
Through fixed-effects model comparisons, we identified the best version of each model (see model fitting procedure described below and the supplement). The full Uncertainty model was the best fitting model in the current study and previous studies using this task 
(Ma et al., 2020
(Ma et al., , 2022
. For this reason, we formally describe this model and its variants here. See supplemental section on alternative computational models for a formal description of the other three types of models.


The Uncertainty models
The Uncertainty model assumes that an agent samples information to reduce their uncertainty about their partner's reciprocation probability until a subjective uncertainty tolerance criterion is met. The full model consists of four components: a prior belief over the reciprocation probability of the trustee (r), an evolving posterior belief distribution over r, an uncertainty tolerance criterion (k), and decision noise ( ) 
(Ma et al., 2020
).
The uncertainty model involves updating a Bayesian belief distribution over the possible range of r. The prior belief distribution over r is captured by the beta distribution with parameters 0 and 0. Because participants did not know the true reciprocation probability r of any given trustee, by sampling tiles, they compute the marginal distribution of their prior belief, which is the probability ( | ! , ! ).
There are two possibilities for trustees, they can reciprocate or defect. Those two possibilities follow a Bernoulli distribution over r (i.e., p(reciprocation) = r). The conditional distribution of reciprocation is:
(reciprocation| ! , ! ) = ∫ (reciprocation| ) ( | ! , ! ) = ∫ ( | ! , ! ) = " ! " ! #$ ! (1)
This conditional distribution represents the participants' prior belief about the trustee's trustworthiness, which corresponds to the mean of the beta distribution. The participants' uncertainty about the prior belief is given by the width of the prior belief distribution, which is the standard deviation of the prior belief distribution:
( ! , ! ) = ? " ! $ ! (" ! #$ ! ) " (" ! #$ ! #() (2)
With each sample, the belief distribution is updated and evolves into a posterior distribution with parameters and . Where = ! + # and = ! + ) . The posterior distribution is:
( | # , ) ) = ( ; , )
(3)
The standard deviation of the posterior distribution represents the uncertainty of the posterior belief:
( , ) = ? "$ ("#$ ) " ("#$#()
(4)
The probability of stopping to sample information increases through sampling, as the uncertainty level reaches a certain bound. This is the subjects' uncertainty tolerance (k).
The closer the distance between the updated uncertainty and subjective uncertainty tolerance, the higher the probability that the subject will stop sampling and make their decision. To allow for decision variability, we employed the softmax function with decision noise :
(sample| , ) = 1 1 + ) *+,-./01+/2(",$))4 5
The uncertainty tolerance (k) reflects how much uncertainty an agent is willing to tolerate (i.e., larger values prescribe ending information sampling sooner), while larger decision noise values ( ) render the translation of what is prescribed by the model for an agent's behavior noisier.
There were two different model versions:
The Uncertainty basic model has two free parameters: the uncertainty tolerance (k) and the decision noise ( ). This model has an uninformative, uniform prior (i.e., 0= 1 and 0 = 1).
The Uncertainty full model has four free parameters. Two parameters ( 0, 0) describe the prior distribution. The additional two parameters are the uncertainty tolerance (k) and the decision noise ( ).


Model fitting and model comparison
The models were first fitted for each participant individually using a previously established model fitting routine 
(Ma et al., 2020
(Ma et al., , 2022
. The optimization algorithm used maximum likelihood estimation for model fitting as implemented in the fmincon routine in MATLAB. We used 100 combinations of starting points to avoid local minima.
Model evidence was assessed at the group level using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). First, we compared BIC values of our extended model space comprised of the four main models and their various versions in the TD group (see supplemental material). For this fixed-effects analysis, we calculated the log-group Bayes factor (BF)
by computing the summed BIC scores across participants for each model and then subtracting from the value of the reference model (worst performing model). Note that the best performing model has the lowest score.
Based on this comparison (see supplemental 
Fig. S2
), we selected the best version of each of the four main models by comparing them using bootstrapping to compute the 95% confidence intervals of the summed difference in model evidence via BIC using 100000 iterations for each model and group (TD and ASD). To ensure that models and parameters were recoverable, we analyzed model and parameter recovery and report these analyses in the supplement.
To arbitrate between the two best fitting models, we performed a random-effect model comparison. The group based Hierarchical Bayesian Inference (HBI) approach characterizes both the population distributions over a model's parameters as well as each individual subject's parameters given the population distribution. This approach gives a robust estimation of both winning model and parameter estimates by being less biased towards outliers and overly simplistic models 
(Piray et al., 2019)
. Here, we report two standard metrics for model selection that were derived from this approach: model frequency and protected exceedance probability (PXP). The model frequency metric captures the percentage of participants that are best described by a certain model. The PXP indicates the probability that this model is the most likely model across participants and tested models. It also considers the null hypothesis that any difference between model frequencies is due to chance.


Pre-registered computational modeling analyses
Developmental and age differences in computation model metrics in typically developing children
To investigate whether developmental and social cognitive differences were reflected in computational model metrics, we set up linear models in R. We tested the effects of the continuous predictors age in months, age squared, and social skills via total SRS raw scores on model metrics derived from the winning computational model. In separate models, we added the additional regressor group (TD vs. ASD) to test for group differences in model metrics and their potential interaction with age and social skills.
The winning computational model, the Uncertainty full model, has four free parameters that were estimated for each participant. These allow the computation of four meaningful model metrics: prior belief, prior uncertainty, uncertainty tolerance and decision noise 
(Ma et al., 2020
(Ma et al., , 2022
. Two free parameters, called ! and 0 describe the individual's prior belief distribution over the trustee's reciprocation probability, formalized as a beta distribution (see computational model section). Based on the ! and 0 estimates, we calculated two of the four model metrics: participants' prior belief
and prior belief uncertainty. Since participants do not know the true reciprocation probability of the trustee, they must rely on their prior belief about the probability that the trustee will reciprocate. The prior belief is formalized as the mean of the prior belief distribution. A low prior belief reflects the expectation that lower reciprocation probabilities are more likely. The prior uncertainty is defined as the width (i.e., standard deviation) of the prior belief distribution and reflects the individual's uncertainty about their prior belief. The higher the standard deviation of the prior distribution the more uncertain an individual is about their prior belief. The remaining model metrics, the uncertainty tolerance and decision noise, are directly represented by the free model parameters k and .


Exploratory computational modeling analyses
Investigating group differences in information sampling strategies
The primary goal of the paper was to describe information sampling and subsequent cooperation decisions in TD children. A secondary goal of the paper was to investigate how TD and autistic children differ in these decisions. We examined which model best fit TD and ASD groups separately and investigated group differences in model metrics from the winning model. To this end, we performed linear regression analyses and investigated group differences (TD vs. ASD) in model metrics, as well as differences in how age, as a linear and quadratic regressor, and social skills measured with the SRS scaled with the magnitude of model metrics.


Results


Statistical analysis
Pre-registered analyses


Cooperation decisions
The TD group chose to share 32.8 (SD=8.53) trials in the game. Participants with ASD chose to share back on 31.6 (SD=10.3) trials.


Cooperation decisions in typically developing children
In line with our hypothesis, TD children shared more frequently when the trustee's reciprocation probability was higher (Model 1, β=0.71, SE=0.02, p<0.001, 
Fig. 2A
, 
Table   S1
 in the supplement details contains the complete results of this analysis). There was no main effect of age as a linear or quadratic regressor but there was a significant interaction between age as a linear regressor and the trustee's reciprocation probability 
(Model 2,
β=0.07,
SE=0.02,
p=0
.001, 
Fig. 2A
) revealing that older children matched their cooperation decisions more closely to the reciprocation probability of trustworthy trustees. Model 3 tested the effects of social skills on cooperation decisions. Aside from reciprocation probability (β=0.72, SE=0.02, p<0.001), social skills as measured with the SRS significantly predicted children's cooperation decisions (β=0.05, SE=0.024, p=0.025). Children with higher SRS scores (lower social functioning) shared more indiscriminately of the trustee's reciprocation probability. This is evidenced by a significant interaction between the trustee's reciprocation probability and SRS scores (β=-0.1, SE=0.023, p<0.001). The older the children were, the stronger this interaction between SRS scores and reciprocation conditions. Older children with higher social skills (lower SRS scores) adapted most to the trustees' reciprocation history (Model 4, significant three-way interaction between reciprocation, age and SRS, β=-0.16, SE=0.024, p<0.001, 
Fig. 2B
).


Sampling frequency
TD children sampled on average 15 (SD=9.56) out of 25 tiles and ASD children sampled on average 14.7 (SD=9.88) out of 25 tiles per trial.


Sampling frequency in the typically developing children
In line with our hypothesis, TD children sampled more tiles when uncertainty was higher (Model 1, main effect of uncertainty, β=7.5, SE=1.2, p<0.001, 
Fig. 3A
). There was a quadratic effect of age on samples taken (Model 2, β=-2.6, SE=1.2, p=0.037, 
Fig. 3B
),
whereby children at both edges of the age distribution sampled less than those in the middle (see 
Fig 3B)
. There was no significant interaction between uncertainty and age and no effect of social skills measured with the SRS on sampling frequency (Models 3 and 4, see supplemental 
Table S1
 for full results).


Exploratory analyses


Differences in cooperation decisions between typically developing and autistic children
Children in both groups invested more when the trustee's reciprocation probability was higher (Model 5, main effect of reciprocation probability: β=0.77, SE=0.02, p<0.001, 
Fig.   2C
). Autistic children, however, matched the trustee's reciprocation probability more closely in the low reciprocation conditions, whereas TD children tended to share more often than autistic children in the lower reciprocation conditions. This is reflected in a main effect of group (β=-0.10, SE=0.04, p=0.01, adjusted=0.025) and a significant interaction between group and the trustee's reciprocation probability (β=0.13, SE=0.03, p=0.0001, adjusted=0.025, 
Fig. 2C
).
Additionally, group differences in cooperation decisions were modulated by age and SRS. In the TD group, cooperation decisions were more strongly modulated by SRS scores than in the ASD group. This is reflected in a significant three-way interaction between the trustee's reciprocation probability, SRS, and group (β=0.44, SE=0.06, p<0.001, adjusted=0.025, 
Fig. 2D
). Typically developing children with lower social skills, as reflected by higher SRS scores, adapted less to the trustee's reciprocation probability compared to those with higher social skills. This effect was stronger in the TD group as compared to the ASD group. In the ASD group higher SRS scores (lower social functioning) only scaled with cooperation tendencies in low reciprocation conditions. Autistic children with higher social deficits shared more with an untrustworthy partner compared to autistic children with less severe social deficits.
Conversely, age had a stronger effect on cooperation in autistic children than in TD children. The three-way interaction between reciprocation probability, age and group was significant (β=0.33, SE=0.06, p<0.001, adjusted=0.025, 
Fig. 2D
) showing that in younger autistic children cooperation was less modulated by the trustees' reciprocation probabilities.

 for a full list of results and to supplemental 
Fig. S1A

Differences in sampling frequency between typically developing and autistic children Both TD and autistic children sampled more tiles in higher uncertainty conditions 
(Model 5,
β=8.80,
SE=1.27,
p<0
.001, 
Fig. 3B
). There was no group difference in sampling behavior and no group by uncertainty interaction.  
Fig. S3 and Fig. S4
).
In a next step, we investigated which of these models fit participants data best using a fixed-effects model comparison and computed the 95% CI's of the BIC differences between each model pair using bootstrapping. This method showed that the Count model fit participants' data least well, followed by the Threshold model. Both the Uncertainty and Sample Cost models fit the data better than the Threshold model.
However, using the fixed effects individual fitting approach, we could not conclusively establish whether the Uncertainty or Sample Cost model provided the best fit for participants' data (see 
Fig. 4A left panel)
. To arbitrate between these two models in a more accurate but also computationally demanding manner, we used the HBI procedure as described in the methods section. Based on this random effect analysis, we identified the Uncertainty model as the best fitting model for the sampling behavior of TD children (see 
Fig. 4A right panel)
. This is in line with previous studies 
(Ma et al., 2020
(Ma et al., , 2022
,
showing that this heuristic model best captures adolescents' and adults' sampling behavior.
Given our apriori hypotheses that model metrics (prior beliefs, prior belief uncertainty, uncertainty tolerance and decision noise) vary with age and social skills, we examined linear and non-linear effects of age and linear effects of SRS on these modelderived metrics from the HBI procedure. We found a linear age effect on decision noise 
SE=5.95,
p=0.023)
, showing that decision noise decreased with age ( 
Fig.   4C
). Moreover, social skills were related to children's prior beliefs about the trustee's reciprocation probabilities. Children with lower social skills, as evidenced by higher SRS scores, expected the trustees to be less trustworthy compared to children with greater social skills (β=-0.04, SE=0.02, p=0.044, 
Fig. 4C
). Age and SRS did not have an effect on children's uncertainty tolerance and prior belief uncertainty (see supplemental 
Table   S1
 for the full results).


Exploratory analyses
Group differences in information sampling strategies Similar to findings in the TD sample, we could not conclusively establish whether the Uncertainty or Sample Cost models fit the data best (see 
Fig. 4B left panel)
. Using the HBI procedure for model comparison, we could conclude that the Uncertainty model provides the best fit for the sampling behavior of autistic children as well (see 
Fig. 4B
 right panel). The model fits for the sampling behaviors of TD and autistic children are visualized in 
Fig. 4D
. The models captured the overall pattern of the sampling frequencies in both TD and ASD groups.
While TD and ASD groups relied on the same sampling strategy, one model metric differed significantly between matched samples of TD and autistic children.
Autistic children had lower prior beliefs about the trustee's reciprocation probability compared with TD children (β=-2.52, SE=1.05, p=0.019, 
Fig. 4C
 and 
Fig. 4E
),
suggesting that before sampling, autistic children believed the trustees to be less trustworthy compared to TD children. A three-way interaction between group, age and SRS (β=-0.0004, SE=0.0002, p=0.045, 
Fig. 4C
) on prior beliefs showed that TD children with greater social skills also had higher prior beliefs, meaning that they believed the trustee to be more trustworthy compared to those with lower social skills. This relationship between greater social skills and higher prior beliefs was also present in older autistic children, while in younger autistic children, prior beliefs were not significantly related to social skills. No differences were found in the other three model metrics, prior uncertainty, uncertainty tolerance and decision noise (see supplemental 
Table S2
).


Discussion
Cooperation decisions hinge on our willingness to trust others. A critical ingredient of building trust is considering our partner's likelihood of cooperation, reflected in their reciprocation history 
(Vives & Feldmanhall, 2018)
. In this study, we first investigated our pre-registered analyses concerning developmental changes in information sampling and subsequent cooperation decisions during early adolescence. We found that both cooperation and information sampling decisions undergo significant development in early adolescence, and this development is modulated by social skills. Secondly, exploratory analyses investigated group differences between TD and autistic children in cooperation and information sampling for cooperation decisions. We found nuanced differences in how age and social skills modulated these behaviors. Computational modeling revealed that autistic children had lower expectations (i.e., priors) about their partners' trustworthiness compared to TD children prior to sampling information about them.
Cooperation and information sampling decisions of typically developing early adolescents
With age, TD children adapted their cooperation decisions more closely to the trustee's reciprocation probability. In older children, a higher level of social skills scaled with greater adaptation to the trustees' reciprocation probabilities. This highlights a critical shift in cooperation during early adolescence -as children enter early adolescence, cooperation not only becomes more attuned to the partner's reciprocation probability but also more reflective of everyday social skills.
With respect to information sampling preceding cooperation, older TD children sampled more tiles in high uncertainty conditions, when their partner made a similar amount of cooperation and defection choices in the past. Age predicted how much information children sampled overall. The effect followed an inverted u-shape, meaning that children in the middle age group sampled most information about their trustee counterparts. This finding strengthens the notion that early adolescence is a significant period for cognitive development related to strategic social decision making 
(Lam et al., 2014
).


Information sampling strategies of typically developing children
To closely examine children's underlying strategies, and how these scaled with age and social skills, we employed a well-established computational modeling framework. We found that children's sampling behavior was best fit by the Uncertainty model, the model shown to best describe information sampling in older age groups 
(Ma et al., 2020
(Ma et al., , 2022
).
This suggests that information sampling strategies do not fundamentally change from early adolescence to adulthood. We did, however, find that this information sampling strategy becomes more refined throughout early adolescence. Specifically, we found that TD children's decision noise significantly decreased with age, meaning that older children implemented the Uncertainty model most efficiently. This finding is in line with previous studies showing that children's behavior can rely on a strategy, albeit the cognitive demands of this strategy may result in a higher degree of noise, i.e., stochastic errors in implementation 
(Kushnir & Gopnik, 2007)
. This decrease in decision noise may account for more adaptive information sampling and cooperation decisions in older age groups. Older children in this study sampled information more efficiently, by more closely matching task uncertainty levels. They also adapted their cooperation decisions more closely to the trustees.


Differences in cooperation and information sampling decisions between typically developing and autistic early adolescents
Our exploratory analyses aimed to contribute to the rather small literature on strategic decision making in autism. To gain insights into the nature of group differences in cooperation, we combined behavioral assessments with computational modeling and parent-reported social skill questionnaires. Based on previous research that highlighted reduced adaptation of trust decisions to the partner's trustworthiness in autism 
(Ewing et al., 2015;
Maurer et al., 2018;
Yi et al., 2013)
, we initially expected to find similar patterns in our study.
Contrary to our expectation, we found that autistic children demonstrated a high degree of sensitivity to the reciprocation probabilities of their partners when making cooperation decisions. Our findings align with studies that did not find significant differences in cooperation between autistic and typical individuals 
(Ewing et al., 2015;
Maurer et al., 2018)
 suggesting that autistic children are capable of adapting their
sharing behavior based on their partners' trustworthiness.
We did, however, find group differences in cooperation, but these differences were subtler than hypothesized. We found that autistic children, matched the trustees' reciprocation rates more closely in the low reciprocation conditions, while their TD counterparts tended to be more generous with untrustworthy trustees. Interestingly, exploratory analyses of sex differences in autistic children revealed that autistic girls have a more similar cooperation pattern to the TD group. They differed significantly from autistic boys. Like TD children, autistic girls were more trusting in low probability conditions. This result is in line with previous studies showing that autistic females show a higher degree of pro-social behavior 
(Harrop et al., 2018)
.
Moreover, social skills were more tied to cooperation tendencies of TD children compared to autistic children. In autistic children, social cognitive skills only predicted cooperation tendencies in low reciprocation conditions. Autistic children with higher social deficits shared more with untrustworthy partners compared to those with less social deficits, supporting the notion that greater social deficits render individuals vulnerable to exploitation 
(Jawaid et al., 2012)
. Conversely, age had a stronger effect on cooperation in autistic children than in TD children. Older autistic children were more attuned to the trustee's reciprocation history, highlighting that this age period is marked by significantly greater development of cooperation skills in autistic compared to TD children.
Contrary to our expectation, information sampling did not differ between autistic and TD children, but we did find group differences in how age and social skills modulated information sampling. In both groups, children sampled more information in higher uncertainty conditions. The most striking group differences were found in younger and older children as compared to those in the middle age group. The nonlinear age effect found here, shows that children in the middle age range were most similar across groups and least attuned to the varying levels of uncertainty about the trustees' reciprocation probabilities. Older children in both groups adapted their sampling behavior most to the varying uncertainty levels, thereby more closely resembling adolescents and adults assessed in previous studies 
(Ma et al., 2020
(Ma et al., , 2022
. These previous studies showed that adaptation to uncertainty changes throughout adolescence. From early to mid-adolescence, individuals adapted information sampling frequencies more closely to the level of uncertainty about the trustee's reciprocation tendencies 
(Ma et al., 2022)
. Another important open question is how initial priors evolve over the course of social interaction.
Autistic children differed from TD children in their prior expectations but not in their prior uncertainty. The fact that the prior uncertainty, i.e., the standard deviation of the prior distribution, was similar in TD and ASD groups, indicates a similar shape of the prior distribution in the autistic sample. The hypo-prior account of Autism 
(Lawson et al., 2014;
Pellicano & Burr, 2012)
 posits that atypicalities of autistic individuals stem from broader, less specific priors. Our study provides counterevidence for that notion with respect to information sampling for trust decisions.
There is mixed evidence for the hypo-prior account using basic perception paradigms. While some studies report group differences consistent with this account 
(Utzerath et al., 2018)
, other studies find no evidence in the perceptual domain 
(Van de Cruys et al., 2017)
. In this study we used a computational modeling approach that precisely defines prior uncertainty. To this end, we do not find evidence that children with ASD have less specific priors, i.e., increased prior uncertainty. Lastly, we found sex differences with respect to the magnitude of decision noise in boys versus girls. Autistic boys, who showed a more similar information sampling pattern to TD children, also showed less decision noise than autistic girls. This suggests that autistic boys make better use of the information about the trustees' trustworthiness. They not only sample more information but are also more consistent in implementing the information sampling strategy compared to girls.
Neuro-developmental changes in early adolescence and their effect on social decision making
Our findings emphasize that early adolescence is an important developmental period for strategic social decision making. Children's cooperation and information decisions become more attuned to the trustees' reciprocation history towards early adolescence.
While early adolescent children implement the same information sampling strategy as adolescents and adults, their decreasing decision noise suggests that early adolescence is an important period for optimizing this strategy. One possible mechanism for such an optimization may be a decoupling of cognitive effort and social cognitive skills by the onset of adolescence. Previous studies have found social cognition to be more effortful for early adolescent children and more reliant on executive functioning and general reasoning skills compared to adolescent and adult samples 
(Alkire et al., 2018;
Devine & Hughes, 2013;
Dumontheil et al., 2010)
. One study, specifically, found that children's social and reward decisions relied on more cognitive resources, compared to those of older age groups 
(Devine et al., 2021)
. This may be due to a critical stage in brain reorganization supporting cognitive skills in both TD and autistic children. Social cognitive inefficiencies due to developmental changes in this age period, may underlie children's vulnerabilities to maladaptive behaviors and mental health problems 
(Anselmi et al., 2008;
Roeser et al., 1999)
. At the same time, however, early adolescence is a period of consolidation, extension and integration of emotions and (social) cognitive skills 
(Choudhury et al., 2006;
Warnell et al., 2018)
. As such, early adolescence may be a particularly suitable stage for promoting healthy living skills and pro-social activities that can prevent negative outcomes, such as the onset of psychiatric conditions that often start in early to mid-adolescence 
(Kessler et al., 2007;
Roeser et al., 1999)
.


Conclusion
Taken together, our study shows that early adolescence is a significant period for social cognitive development underlying cooperation and information sampling for trust decisions in both typically developing and autistic children. Age and social skills significantly modulated children's information sampling and subsequent cooperation decisions. Most notably, we found an inverted u-shape relationship between information sampling frequency and age across TD and ASD groups. The middle age group sampled most information and was least sensitive to uncertainty conditions. These inefficiencies may be linked to neural reorganization in the brain networks that crucially support social decision making. TD and ASD groups differed most in the extent to which age and social skills predicted cooperation and information sampling, which is in line with previous studies of divergent social development of individuals with ASD 
(Huang et al., 2017;
Pelphrey et al., 2011;
Senju, 2013)
. Computational modeling revealed that TD and ASD groups differed in their prior beliefs about the trustees' trustworthiness and that the youngest TD children were noisier at implementing the information sampling strategy compared to older TD children.
Our study makes an important contribution to characterizing typical development in early adolescence and reveal differences between typically developing children and those with an ASD diagnosis. By sampling a larger number of girls in the current study, we were also able to replicate and further specify sex differences in social cognition of autistic children. Our results highlight the importance of adopting a more nuanced view of developmental and disorder dimensions that can be derived from a heterogeneous set of assessments, including demographic questionnaires, symptom severity measures, objectively assessed task behaviors, and underlying cognitive strategies.
One limitation of this study is the rather small sample size of autistic children. While larger samples and assessment batteries are needed to fully tease apart the contribution of general cognitive skills to social cognition in early adolescence, our study takes an important first step towards such in-depth phenotyping efforts.   Participants see a 5x5 checkerboard and buttons to choose whether to keep or share coins. Participants can sequentially sample tiles (left panel) to view the decisions that the trustee made in past games. On each trial, investors can sample information about 25 past games by sequentially uncovering up to 25 grey tiles. The color of the turned tile indicates the trustee's past decision (green = shared back, red = kept investor's coins). On each trial, participants can keep track of trial number, and the total number of red and green tiles that they have uncovered within the trial. C. Illustration of the computational models. The Count model keeps track of total tiles sampled and stops sampling when a subjective bound is reached. The Threshold model tracks the absolute difference between sampled red and green tiles and stops sampling when that difference reaches a subjective bound. The Sample Cost Model updates the participant's posterior belief distribution after each sampled tile. The posterior belief distribution is used to calculate the utility of continuing to sample information. The option (i.e., to sample, to share, or to keep) with the highest expected utility is most likely to be chosen. In the uncertainty model, information sampling continues until the evolving posterior uncertainty reaches the subjective uncertainty tolerance criterion. In all models a softmax function was used to convert values to choice probabilities and allow for decision noise.

To identify the best performing model variant for each model type in the TD group, we performed a fixed effects analysis described in the computational models section and the supplementalFig. S2. The best performing model variants were the full Uncertainty model, Sample Cost model with an uninformative prior, Threshold model with a collapsing bound and there was only one version of the Count model. In the remainder of the manuscript, we will refer to these models with the following abbreviated names: Uncertainty model, Sample Cost model, Threshold Model and Count Model. We performed model and parameter recovery analyses with these four model types and found that models and parameters were largely recoverable (see supplement and supplemental figures
Model 6 revealed a four-way
interaction between uncertainty, SRS, age as a quadratic regressor and group (β=-
15.55, SE=4.6, p=0.001, adjusted=0.025, Fig. 3C). The relationship between SRS and
sampling behavior differed most between younger and older children in TD and ASD
groups. Younger TD and autistic children showed a striking difference in the relationship
between social skills and sampling behavior. Younger TD children with lower social
skills sampled less tiles overall, while autistic children with greater social deficits
sampled more tiles. In both groups, older children sampled most tiles when uncertainty
about the trustee's reciprocation was highest. Older autistic children with greater social
deficits, however, discriminated less between levels of uncertainty compared both
autistic peers with Computational modeling analyses
Pre-registered analyses
Information sampling strategies in typically developing children


In our study, older autistic children with greater social deficits discriminated least between levels of uncertainty, showing that everyday social skills scale with children's ability to efficiently adapt their
information sampling strategies to uncertainty conditions. With respect to sex
differences in information sampling, autistic boys and girls differed significantly in their
information sampling behavior. Autistic boys sampled significantly more information
compared to girls.
Information sampling strategies of autistic children do not differ from those of typically
developing children
While autistic children also relied on the Uncertainty full model, they had significantly
lower prior beliefs about the trustees' reciprocation tendencies compared with TD
children. Lower priors indicate that autistic children start off with lower initial
expectations about the trustee's trustworthiness. While sampling similar amounts of
information about the trustees, lower initial estimates of their trustworthiness may
account for our finding that autistic children shared less in low reciprocation conditions.
However, our study was not designed to conclusively answer to this question. It is
important for future research to explore how lower initial trustworthiness priors of autistic
samples affect social decisions, especially in the context of sustaining cooperation.
