You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction


Cognitive impairment
Cognitive impairment is one of the reported side or late effects of cancer treatment. According to the DSM-5, impairment can affect six key domains: perceptual-motor functions, executive functions, language, complex attention, social cognition, learning and memory 
[1]
. In addition to advanced neuroimaging techniques, self-assessment of perceived cognitive functions (impairment) using neuropsychological test batteries is also used 
[2]
. Although the association between objective and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) is unclear 
[2]
, it is important not to underestimate the subjective experiences of patients. While cognitive impairment may be transient for some cancer patients, these symptoms can be long-lasting or permanent for others. This can have a big impact on individuals' quality of life and their global functioning 
[3]
.


Clinical moderators
Although the deterioration of cognitive functions is often referred to as "chemofog" or "chemobrain", it may be caused by either chemotherapy 
[2,
4]
 or adjuvant therapy 
[5,
6]
. A cognitive decline may occur before (25% of patients), during or after treatment (24%) although some patients (15-31%) have reported cognitive improvement 
[6,
7]
. The impairment usually concerns attention, executive function, motor function, processing speed and short-term memory 
[6]
 and gets worse with longer treatment duration 
[4]
. However, there is no consensus on the effect of the type of treatment 
[5]
[6]
[7]
 indicating that the type of cancer and related factors may also play a role in the development of SCI 
[2]
.


Psychological and socio-demographic moderators
Psychological and socio-demographic factors can also be associated with cognitive deficits in cancer patients and play an important role after treatment 
[8]
. Depression and fatigue are the most consistent moderators, supporting the major role of psychoneurological factors in subjective cognitive impairment 
[2]
. In terms of personality factors, neuroticism has been associated with a decrease in cognitive functions 
[9]
, cancer-related worries and continuing cancer-related symptoms 
[10]
. There have been mixed results regarding the associations between SCI and PTSD 
[11,
12]
 as well as between SCI and social support 
[13]
.
The results regarding the relationship between the age of cancer survivors and cognitive impairment are inconsistent although chemotherapy may accelerate the normal cognitive aging in cancer patients 
[6]
. Being female is a risk factor for SCI, especially in younger cancer patients 
[14]
.
There are also other factors that may affect SCI such as pain, grief, or relapse although these have not been well-covered in the research. As such, the current study includes these factors as possible moderators in exploring the relationship between the key domains of cognitive functions.


Aims of the study
Although SCI has been widely reported in cancer patients 
[15]
, there is limited evidence on the concordance between objectively measured cognitive impairment and SCI 
[16]
. Research on this topic would benefit from (1) further examination of the factors that could be related to SCI;
(2) studying the mutual and complex interconnection between cognitive functions [17] using the network approach 
[18]
; and (3) understanding patients' perspective on SCI using qualitative data.
The study aims to (1) examine the sociodemographic (e.g., gender, age), clinical (type of treatment, type of cancer, time since diagnosis) and psychological (e.g. pain, post-traumatic stress, neuroticism) factors related to SCI; (2) analyse the complex relationships between SCI and examine sources of their heterogeneity and (3) understand patients' perspective on SCI and supportive care through the qualitative approach.


Methods


Participants and Procedure
This study is part of the project "The cognitive-existential profile and specifics of posttraumatic growth in cancer survivors" (osf.io/4maz9/). The questionnaires were administered to 566 cancer survivors in 4 hospitals and 5 different cancer support groups in different parts of Slovakia either individually or in groups between July 2019 and July 2020. Three versions of the questionnaire with different orders were used in order to reduce possible bias (e.g. 
[19]
). After completing the questionnaires, the participants were given a short debriefing.
The inclusion criteria for the participants were being 18 or older, having been diagnosed with cancer, not having a severe mental health or physical condition and not being terminally ill (data collection was not carried out in palliative care units). There was no strict selection of participants based on the stage of cancer survivorship 
[20]
 nor by the specific type of diagnosis. Rather, the study aimed to capture the natural heterogeneity of cancer diagnosis in Slovakia as well as avoiding selection bias 
[21]
.


Measures
Eighteen items were used to ask about changes in cognitive functions in the following categories: (1) Senses (4 items), (2) Attention (3 items), (3) Memory (4 items), (4) Spatial functions (2 items), (5) Problem solving and decision-making (4 items), (6) Verbal fluency (1 item). The response scale had two poles: (1) impairment (reflecting the CICI theory 
[22]
) and (2) improvement (reflecting the PTG theory 
[23]
). The participants answered on a 5-point scale as follows:1 -significant improvement; 2 -partial improvement; 3 -without change; 4partial impairment; 5 -significant impairment (see the supplementary materials for more detail). Post-traumatic stress was measured by the ITQ (International Trauma Questionnaire 
[24]
) which examines 6 core PTSD symptoms. The response scale ranges from 0 to 4, with a higher number indicating a higher level of post-traumatic stress. Neuroticism was measured by a 6-item subscale from the BFI-2-S (Big Five Inventory-2-Short form 
[25]
). The response scale ranges from 0 to 4, with a higher number indicating a higher level of neuroticism. 


Data analysis
Firstly, the sum scores for the scales and descriptive analyses, including SCI and specific cognitive abilities, were calculated. A Welch t-test was used to compare SCI across the groups. The structure of SCI (i.e., connections of changes in cognitive abilities) was examined using a network analysis 
[26]
. In the network approach, indicators are represented as nodes while their relationships are represented as edges (the thicker the edge, the stronger the relationship; solid lines represent positive relationships, dashed lines represent negative relationships). An undirected weighted network was estimated where the variables were treated as ordinal ones and an EBICglasso with a high tuning parameter (i.e., regularizing weak relationships to obtain a sparse network) was used. The strength (how strongly a node is directly connected with others) and closeness (how strongly a node is indirectly connected with others) indices were estimated. Non-parametric and case-drop bootstrapping looked at the network accuracy and stability of edge-weights and centrality indices. The correlation stability (CS) coefficient (i.e., indicates the proportion of cases that could be eliminated from the analyses while retaining a correlation of at least 0.70) was estimated. The differences between the networks across selected subgroups were analysed using a network comparison test 
[27]
 with 1000 iteration and adjusted p-value by Bonferroni correction. For the moderation analysis of continuous variables, the networktree function 
[28]
 was used to find an optimal splitting point (i.e., a threshold that produces a significant alteration in the network structure). The analyses were carried out in R (version 4.1.2.) using the following packages: bootnet 
[26]
, NetworkComparisonTest 
[27]
, and networktree 
[28]
.
Content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data from responses to the open ended questions related to patients' perspectives on SCI 
[29]
. After reading and reviewing the collected data for a general overview, it was sorted into content-based categories. Information on category frequencies was also added.


Results


Sample characteristics
From the total sample (N = 566), 388 of the patients with cancer were female (68,6%). Most of the patients were married (61.7%) and had secondary school education (51%). The mean age of the patients was 54 years old (SD = 14.2) (range = 18-90). 
Table 1
 shows selected sample characteristics (see the supplementary material for more detailed information). 


Descriptive statistics, comparisons, and correlations
The descriptive statistics and the endorsement rates for improvement or impairment in specific cognitive functions are shown in 
Table 2
. The two most frequently endorsed SCIs were impairment in working memory and sight. From the positive changes, the two most frequently reported were improvements in problem-solving and decision-making ability. 3.7% 75% 21.3% Note. a For two items, the polychoric correlation coefficient is presented instead of Omega. NA = Not Applicable, for the single item variable, the reliability coefficient was not applied.


Comparisons of perceived cognitive deficits across different groups
The next step was to compare the scores of perceived cognitive deficits in groups of patients based on the factors that would be examined as moderating variables in the network structure of SCI. There were no significant differences found in the examined areas of perceived cognitive deficits between women and men; patients with breast cancer and other types of cancer; patients being actively treated and patients in remission or between patients that found professionals helpful regarding their cancer or cancer treatment-related problems and those that did not.
Patients who had finished chemotherapy had significantly higher levels of cognitive deficits in the senses, attention, memory, and verbal fluency (ps from .04 to .006). Patients who had had a cancer relapse scored significantly higher in all the examined areas of cognitive deficits (ps from .003 to 5e-7). Patients who perceived a late effect of cancer treatment, as well as those who attended cancer support groups, scored significantly higher in cognitive deficits in the senses, attention, memory, and verbal fluency (ps from .02 to .0002). SCI was also higher in patients who had consulted professionals about these perceived changes (ps from .009 to 4e-8). Patients who met the ICD-11 PTSD criteria had higher SCI in all cognitive functions except for spatial abilities (ps from .03 to 1e-5). More detailed results can be found in the supplementary material.


Correlations between perceived cognitive deficits and related factors
The following step was to examine the relationships between the specific cognitive deficits and age, time since being diagnosed with cancer, time since cancer treatment finished, sadness, pain, post-traumatic stress, and neuroticism as possible moderators in the network structure of SCI. The highest average correlation was found between cognitive deficits and PTSD (r = .17), while the lowest average correlation was between perceived cognitive deficits and time since being diagnosed with cancer (r = .07). A correlogram is presented in 
Figure 1
. The full correlation matrix is available in the supplementary material. 
Figure 1
. Polychoric correlations between perceived cognitive deficits and age, time since being diagnosed with cancer, time since cancer treatment ended, sadness, pain, PTSD, and neuroticism


Network analysis
The network of SCI is visualized in 
Figure 2
. The average edge-weight between the cognitive deficits was = .08, with the highest edge-weight observed between problem solving and decision making. The deficits in spatial perception, object-focusing and problem solving had the highest strength. The highest closeness was observed in deficits in spatial perception, verbal fluency, estimation ability and working memory related to facts. On the other hand, deficits related to the senses had the smallest centrality indices. The stability of the network can be considered sufficient (CSedges = .75; CSstrength = .75; CScloseness = .41).

. The network of SCI with centrality indices for the certain SCI.


Network invariance (moderation analysis)
Network invariance was tested for the categorical as well as continuous moderating variables. The network structure was found to be relatively stable across the categorical moderators. The only significant differences in the network's global strength were observed in chemotherapy and cancer relapse -those who had finished chemotherapy and those who had not had a relapse had higher levels of strength for spatial perception and object-focus. The results of the network comparison tests are summarized in 
Table 3
. The subgroup differences in the nodes' strength for chemotherapy and cancer relapse are plotted in 
Figure 3
. For the continuous moderators, significant alterations in the network structure were observed for sadness, pain, and posttraumatic stress (see 
Table 3
). The moderating continuous variables were then added (always separately) as nodes into the SCI network. After adding these, the strength of the previously strongest cognitive deficits (spatial perception, object-focus and problem solving) dropped and the deficits in working memory and estimation ability became more central (see 
Figure 3)
. Consult the supplementary material for the network structures that included sadness, pain, and post-traumatic stress.  One hundred and twenty-five patients provided answers about the impact of SCI on their work performance and everyday functioning. The extracted categories, in descending order, were as follows: deterioration of attention and memory (14.4%); slowing down and reduced performance (12%); impaired visual perception and reading (11.2%); pain (10.4%); emotional lability and/or hypersensitivity (8%); stopped working (8%); fatigue (8%); impaired relationships and communication; lack of interest in relationships (7.2%); problems with fine motor skills (5.6%); walking difficulties (4.8%); weakness (4.8%); anxiety/depression (3.2%) and inability to drive a car 2.4%.
In the second question, patients were asked if/who they had asked for help with the SCI. The 230 received responses can be categorized as follows: oncologist (17.8%); ophthalmologist (13.5%); neurologist (10.9%); GP (8.2%); psychologist (7.4%); psychiatrist (4.8%); otolaryngologist (3.5%) and gynaecologist 3.5%. There were several additional comments given regarding the received support: "just short and terse information provided by specialists, they didn't help, they didn't have time"; "everyone tried to help, but not everything was possible"; "I didnÂ´t ask for help, because I consider changes a temporary state for now, which shall pass".
The third question focused on the reasons why patients did not seek help with SCI and was answered by 123 participants. The most frequent responses were: no reason to deal with the change/it was not a significant impairment (22.8%); it goes with age(ing) (10.6%); hope that the problem would disappear (6.5%); no trust in specialists (6.5%); it goes with the diagnosis (4.1%); tried to cope with the problems alone (4.1%); avoided seeing a doctor (4.1%).


Discussion and implications
The study aimed to examine the SCI of patients with cancer, its structure, correlates, and subgroup differences. The findings were further enriched by qualitative data on SCI. SCI was found to be higher in patients who had undergone chemotherapy as well as those who had had a cancer relapse. In the SCI network, deficits in spatial perception, attention focus and problemsolving ability were highest on the strength index while the deficits related to the senses were the least influential. In terms of the moderating factors, having finished chemotherapy and a cancer relapse caused invariance in the network's global strength. There were alterations in the SCI network when sadness, pain and PTSD were taken into account.


Factors related to SCI
The present results corroborate the findings that chemotherapy is associated with cognitive impairment 
[4,
11]
. However, current studies have suggested that psychological factors such as PTSD, depression, anxiety and fatigue can go beyond chemotherapy in explaining patients' SCI 
[12,
30]
. On the other hand, neither gender, type of cancer, nor active treatment were significant factors contributing to SCI in the present research. This contrasts with the findings of previous studies 
[2,
14]
.


Network structure of SCI and moderating factors
The network analysis of the SCI revealed that the connections between the cognitive deficits correspond with the connections between the cognitive functions 
[31]
. Indeed, impairment in attention focus was found to be strongly connected to the deterioration of working memory 
[32]
. In contrast to existing findings 
[33]
, the study found a weak association between visual impairment and the other senses and other cognitive deficits. Impairments in spatial perception and object-attention were the deficits with the highest strength index. This corresponds to Nevado et al. 
[34]
 who found that visual attention and task switching were the most central abilities in the network of cognitions. As Karyakina and Shmukler 
[35]
 also found, impairment in working memory had the highest direct and indirect connection with other cognitive abilities. The nodes with the highest centrality indices 
[36]
 seem to be the ideal target for effective psychological interventions.
Given the lack of research in the area, the present study not only focused on how different conditions (e.g., treatment type, psychological variables) affect the general level of SCI but also how they alter the structure of SCI. The network structure of SCI was relatively stable across various conditions. The results suggest that finishing chemotherapy is one of the main factors that produces specific interconnection between SCIs. This may be even more visible in patients who have not had a cancer relapse since it is more likely that their cancer treatment has finished. Biglia et al. 
[37]
, also identified chemotherapy as being the main factor which contributes to objectively measured cognitive deficits, with SCI associated with psychological factors such as depression and anxiety. Based on the current findings, pain, sadness, and PTSD are related to changes in the position of the importance of certain SCI in the SCI network. Specifically, when these factors were not modeled in the network structure, the deficits in spatial perception, attention to objects and problem-solving ability showed stronger importance in SCI. On the other hand, if the factors were present in the network, the deficits in working memory related to facts and information, and estimation ability were more important in the mutual interconnection of SCI. Various studies have reported that SCI are associated with pain 
[38]
, depression, anxiety 
[39]
 and PTSD 
[40]
. People with a higher level of psychological distress such as sadness and PTSD have problems in their estimation ability 
[41]
. Cancer pain is also strongly related to psychological distress 
[42]
 and thus could be indirectly related to changes in this specific SCI. These psychological factors may cause heterogeneity in the SCI network and should therefore be considered in SCI intervention and prevention.


Qualitative data on patients' perspective on SCI
Patients most often discussed their SCI with oncologists as well as other specialists such as ophthalmologists or neurologists. Awareness of SCI as a side effect of cancer should be included in the education of specialists as well as being a topic in cancer support groups. The main reasons why patients did not discuss their problems with specialists mostly stemmed from the low level of trust and approachability of specialists. Providing information on cognitive impairment could help patients and specialists recognize these changes and subsequently intervene to increase patients' quality of life. Psychological interventions regarding cognitive deterioration could include cognitive training designed to strengthen cognitive functions or compensatory techniques that aim to help patients manage or cope with the impairment.


Strengths and limitations
(1) The heterogeneity of the sample has built on current knowledge of the SCI in oncological patients usually conducted on a specific sample (e.g., breast cancer). (2) The patients indicated their subjective perceptions of changes in SCI. Although the subjective evaluation of the change is important, utilizing a repeated-measures design (not inquiring about the change per se, but having data on pre-and post-subjective assessment of the cognitive functions) could help reduce biases and control for covariates. Thus, replication studies on different samples of oncological patients as well as utilizing different designs are very much needed. (3) Based on the findings of Dijkshoorn et al. 
[7]
 and addressing the concept of PTG 
[43]
, the items in the SCI were not limited to impairment but also looked at improvement of cognitive functions. Indeed, a small proportion (2-11%) of participants indicated that their cognitive functions (especially problem solving and decision making) had improved. This further supports the presence of PTG and that future research could focus on the particular relationship between PTG and SCI.

Conclusion
SCI is related to various sociodemographic, clinical and psychological factors. SCI is mutually interconnected in a complex system which is relatively stable. Nonetheless, chemotherapy, cancer relapse, pain, sadness, and PTSD have all been identified as factors that could produce heterogeneity in the network structure of SCI. It is important to take these factors into account when understanding the findings related to cognitive impairment following cancer treatment 
[44]
. In particular, the comprehensive supportive cancer care plans related to the cognitive functioning of patients 
[39]
 and management of cognitive difficulties of patients with cancer 
[45]
.
