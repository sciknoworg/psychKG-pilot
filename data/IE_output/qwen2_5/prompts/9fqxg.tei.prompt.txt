You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Active inference is a normative framework describing (Bayes optimal) behaviour and cognition as motivated by the minimisation of surprise of one's sensory observations 
(Parr et al., 2022)
.
Importantly, active inference can be formulated as a process theory; i.e., a mechanistic account of behaviour and the underlying brain functions. Central to this formulation of the active inference framework is the idea that the brain employs and optimises a generative (predictive or "forward") model of the hidden causes of the sensory data it receives, approximating Bayesian inference 
(Friston, 2005)
. As such, it falls into the category of Bayesian brain or "predictive processing" approaches-but it has a special place among those due to its scope and the detail of its formulation, including the mathematics of message passing and belief updating and their potential neurobiological implementation in cortical hierarchies 
(Parr et al., 2022;
cf. Bastos et al., 2012;
Shipp, 2016)
.
Most notably, active inference extends beyond perceptual inference to explain action and behaviour in terms of inference within generative models; i.e., motor control is described as inference and model optimization. Thus, actions are generated to fulfil predictions, in parallel with the updating of predictions through perceptual inference. As such, active inference is a unique framework with intriguing predictions and assumptions about how the brain controls action and behaviour, which has attracted not only theoretical and experimental neuroscientists, but also psychologists and philosophers 
(Hohwy, 2013;
Limanowski & Blankenburg, 2013;
Apps & Tsakiris, 2014;
Clark, 2015;
Metzinger & Wiese, 2017;
Seth & Tsakiris, 2018;
Allen et al. 2020)
.
One of active inference's key appeals is its conceptualisation of precision as defined within generative models, and its possible implementation in neuronal circuits. Precision, in short, it is a form of confidence in the reliability of (neuronal) signals, which therefore has the capacity to bias or modulate neuronal communication and inference in the brain 
(Friston, 2005;
cf. Yu & Dayan, 2005;
Ma et al., 2023)
. In other words, precision encodes "How much do I trust this information". What exactly this means in each case-what it implies functionally-depends on the kind of information, the kind of The many roles of precision in action 4 computation, and the kind of brain region or network at play. Generative world models comprise a set of prior and conditional probability distributions whose inversion determines these computations.
Precision is an attribute of all of these distributions and is associated with their inverse variance or negentropy. Thus, precision can thus mean the gain applied to corrective signals i.e. prediction errors, at the level of sensation and movement-a notion that is important in engineering and motor control (e.g., 
Ciria et al., 2021;
Yuan et al., 2023)
. Neurobiologically, this gain might manifest in population level synaptic gains-which appear to be the loci of action of various neurochemical modulators 
(Shine et al., 2021;
cf. Yu & Dayan, 2005)
. At other levels, precision can mean a confidence estimate in which of several world models is "correct" 
(Metzinger, 2004;
Limanowski & Friston, 2018;
Jordan, 2023)
. Both notions can be combined in hierarchical models for action-a particular promise of the active inference framework.
A key characteristic independently of level or kind of computation is that precision must be estimated;
i.e., the brain does not know from sensory signals alone how reliable they or its models are. Beliefs about precision are formed through inference by the generative model (sometimes called "secondorder inference" to contrast it with inference about the causes of sensation per se; 
Feldman and Friston 2010
, Kanai, Komura et al. 2015
, Parr, Benrimoh et al. 2018a
. It is imperative for the brain to get these beliefs (precision estimates) right, otherwise many pathologies of action and perception emerge 
(Friston 2017
; see below). Many papers have discussed the role of precision in perceptual inference-demonstrating the importance of getting precision estimates right for normal 
(healthy)
 sensation and perception (e.g., 
Corlett et al., 2009;
Adams et al., 2012;
Edwards et al., 2013;
Yon & Frith, 2021)
.
Here, we want to highlight the many roles precision plays in action; i.e., the many key processes in action that rely on adequate estimates of precision-from decision making and planning to the production of movement. We shall give a brief overview of empirical findings demonstrating the importance of precision estimation at various levels of action-from decision making and planning to the production of movement. Secondly, we shall discuss recent methodological developments in the The many roles of precision in action 5 generative models for active inference, which demonstrate the value of the precision concept in action. The concept of precision was, of course, not invented for or within the active inference (or predictive coding) framework. Still, in large parts thanks to work by Karl Friston and his group, there are now very elegant ways to mathematically model precision in its various roles within generative models for active inference. Furthermore, these methods allow us to link the underlying equations to neuronal activity. We shall briefly introduce the key concepts of modelling precision (as the associated generative models have been introduced in great detail elsewhere (see e.g. 
Friston et al., 2017;
Parr et al., 2022;
Hodson et al., 2024;
cf. Ma et al., 2023)
, we shall give a non-mathematical overview). Of particular interest to us are recent developments of so-called "mixed" models-hierarchical generative models spanning multiple levels of discrete (categorical) and continuous active inference. These kinds of models open up new perspectives on the unified description of computations in action, spanning mechanisms from decision making and action planning to overt movement. We shall highlight how these models reflect the many roles of precision in action-from planning to execution-and the associated pathologies if precision estimation goes wrong. Thereby we shall also discuss the potential biological implementation of the associated message passing, focusing on the role of neuromodulatory systems in mediating precision.


Precision at different levels of action
To highlight the importance of inference about precision and uncertainty in action, let's imagine an example: You are a quarterback in possession of the football, and you want to make the optimal play to score your team some points. You must make some decision, such as: Which of the many plays you and your team have studied during training shall you initiate? Should you pass the ball now-or first run to a better spot? Then, of course, you must throw the pass in the best possible way; which means you must guide your muscle movements, correct your movement in response to sudden changes in the game such as a hostile player tackling you etc. On top of this all, you must constantly monitor the game-which you will probably use your vision and audition for. Sometimes you can perhaps not very  A toy example of a quarterback passing the football to a specific teammate indicating several important components of (active) inference that rely on adequate estimates of precision. The underlying computations cover processes ranging from decision making (e.g., Which play do I select? Where should I run to in order to be able to pass optimally?) to overt movement (Contractions of the appropriate arm muscles throughout the throwing movement)-and certainly many more that are not shown, including motivational factors and habits, action understanding, joint action, and communication. Precision plays a key role in all of these processes of inference-but a somewhat different one depending on the exact nature of inference. For instance, at "higher", cognitive levels, the player must decide which of several pre-studied plays he initiates. Here, one can describe precision as the confidence in the selected (optimal) sequence of actions. At "lower", sensorimotor levels, precision can be described as a multiplicative gain on sensory signals. This can mean implementing sensory attention when selectively focusing on one particular teammate; and a similar bias in determining the weights of sensory cues during multisensory integration. Multisensory integration is essential to guide action; e.g., integrating visual and proprioceptive body position information to guide movement, or integrating seen and heard information about my teammates' location. Not last, this notion of precision is key to how muscle movement is produced and controlled along the active inference framework: as sensory attenuation is a prerequisite for the enaction of motor predictions. Note that some of the illustrated processes can be cast as based on discrete or even categorical inference (such as deciding on one among several plays), whereas others require inference in continuous time to track continuous trajectories of sensory data coming from the world (such as guiding a movement or attending to data from a particular sensory channel). Active inference offers a framework to model action through the combination of discrete and continuous state space models 
(Fig. 2)
, thus capturing the interplay between the illustrated cognitive vs sensorimotor processes, and the different roles of precision therein. See main text for details.
This toy example is by no means thought to capture the entirety of action planning and motor control.
It simply illustrates that there are many different (e.g., sensory vs motor vs cognitive) processes in action that depend on adequate estimates of precision. Thereby, precision can mean different things, The many roles of precision in action 7 from an estimate of confidence in some selected action policy to a multiplicative gain applied to continuous sensory signals (see 
Fig. 1 legend)
. Active inference thereby offers a way to account for these potential differences by formalizing action in hierarchical, "mixed" models. Roughly, these models comprise layers where inference operates in discrete time steps-or continually.
To understand why this is important, consider the fact that most decision making and action planning seem to be discrete or even categorical in nature; e.g., preparing a sequence of steps followed by throwing a pass; or choosing one among several alternative pre-studied plays. Conversely, sensation, attention, and movement generate continuous data: to play optimally, we need to know where our teammates are now, and where they will be next-in other words, we need to track their continuously changing states in the world. The same holds for guiding muscle movements. This is fundamentally different from categorical decisions such as selecting the optimal play among several alternatives, and from selecting the sequence of actions required to initiate the play, before actually committing to it.
In the active inference framework, the underlying inference can be formalized slightly differently; operating in terms of discrete or continuous states 
(Fig. 2)
. These different formalizations are, on the one hand, more parsimonious for certain kinds of decisions or control; on the other hand, they also intuitively map onto differences in the associated mental or physical processes. We shall now give a brief, non-technical overview of the generative models used to capture this (for mathematical treatments, see 
Friston, Parr et al. 2017
).
To understand this, it should be noted that, historically, active inference has been modelled as motor control in continuous time (using generalized coordinates of motion; i.e., speed, acceleration, jerk etc.), based on an extension of predictive coding formulations of perceptual inference to include movement via spinal reflex arcs 
(Friston et al., 2010
(Friston et al., , 2012a
. Resulting from recent developments, the generative models used for active inference can be set up in an alternative way;
i.e., they can also be formalized as operating in discrete states-put simply, modelling inference (belief updating) about processes that evolve in "steps" rather than continually. This notion of active inference follows a specific formulation of partially observable Markov decision processes, thus, The many roles of precision in action 8 featuring a notably different computational architecture from e.g. predictive coding or variational filtering. A notable distinction is the possibility to specify multiple alternative (counterfactual) goals and action sequences and to evaluate them based on their expected free energy, thus defining active inference as planning rather than motor control per se 
(Friston et al., 2017;
cf. Botvinick & Toussaint, 2012)
. The discrete and continuous state space formulations are not mutually exclusive (for a comprehensive comparison see 
Hodson et al., 2024)
. Both conform to the free energy principle and can be described in terms of belief updating and model optimisation. The Bayesian message passing of both formulations can be plausibly associated with the neuronal populations in the cortical column-while neural activity represents different quantities in each model (posterior probabilities in discrete-time models vs the statistics of probability densities in continuous-time models), precision can be linked to the gain afforded to synaptic inputs onto superficial pyramidal cell populations in both approaches 
(Bastos et al., 2012;
. However, each kind of model is best suited to a different set of computational problems that an active inference agent needs to solve and, as we shall see below, their combination is what is needed to adequately capture action in its entire richness.


Precision in sensation and movement (continuous inference)
Sensation and movement production are inherently intertwined, which is particularly emphasized in the active inference framework-where sensation guides perceptual decision making for action, which again generates new sensory data. Importantly, the world generates sensory signals continually-and to move within it, our brain should control our muscles continually as well. Therefore, the sensory and motor processes at the interface with the environment (the associated message passing) are elegantly captured by continuous state space models; i.e., predictive models generating data (e.g., trajectories) in continuous time. A simple way to represent a trajectory in continuous time is in terms of generalized coordinates of motion (speed, acceleration, jerk etc.), which has been the formulation of choice in these models 
(Parr et al., 2022)
. In other words, these models capture the brain's inference of how its sensations were caused by continuous states of the world . As noted, this has been the classical way of modelling active inference in predictive coding schemes; i.e., through a dynamic minimization of continuous prediction error signals 
(Friston & Kiebel, 2009;
Bastos et al., 2012;
Shipp, 2016)
.
Precision, in these formulations, has the function of scaling forward prediction errors at each level by their estimated reliability; i.e., sensory signals that are believed to be less noisy (more reliable) are afforded a greater weight 
(Friston & Kiebel, 2009)
. Evidence for the functional role of precision weighting of prediction errors has been obtained in electrophysiological and imaging studies and through mathematical simulations (e.g., 
Kok et al., 2012;
Auksztulewicz et al., 2015;
Feldman and Friston 2010;
Friston and Frith 2015)
. This intuitively links precision at these levels of inference to the concept of sensory attention and attenuation 
(Feldman & Friston, 2010;
Brown et al., 2013;
. Much empirical and theoretical work has focused on this role of precision as sensory gain (e.g., 
Adams et al., 2012;
Friston et al., 2012a,b;
Brown et al., 2013;
Edwards et al., 2013;
Parées et al., 2014;
Palmer et al., 2016;
Limanowski & Friston, 2018
. In the following, we focus on three important aspects of action, in which precision-formalized as continuous gain control-is assigned a key role: multisensory body representation, movement production, and self-other distinction or agency.


Sensory attention and attenuation in multisensory body representation
Although not being a 'motor' process, multisensory integration is crucial for planning and guiding action, because it ensures a coherent and more precise estimate of the state of the body (effector) for guiding action. Thereby, it is well established that a more accurate state estimate can be reached by combining information from multiple sensory modalities 
(Ernst & Bülthoff, 2004;
Körding et al., 2007)
.
For instance, the quarterback in 
Figure 1
 may combine visual and somatosensory (haptic and proprioceptive) information to grasp the football in a way that will allow e.g. adding a specific spin to the throw (although this is probably something that benefits novices; expert players will likely not need to look at their arm or the ball anymore). Precision, in its role as sensory gain, can up-or down-weight sensory signals, thus augmenting or attenuating their impact on inference; i.e., on cue combination and the resulting multisensory estimate. In brief, the combined estimate will be biased towards the more precise ("reliable") sense. That multisensory integration (or cue integration) can be biased by precision estimates has been demonstrated and reviewed extensively elsewhere 
(Beauchamp et al., 2010;
Fetsch et al., 2012;
Meijer et al., 2020;
Ma et al., 2023)
. This assumption is also at the core of Bayesian approaches to body ownership 
(Apps & Tsakiris, 2014;
Limanowski & Blankenburg, 2013;
Noel et al., 2018;
Allen & Friston, 2018;
Seth & Tsakiris, 2018;
Bertoni et al., 2023)
. Here, a particularly intriguing example is the so-named rubber hand illusion 
(Botvinick & Cohen, 1998)
, in which a participant experiences illusory ownership over a visible fake hand placed next to the real, unseen hand; and exhibits a recalibration of the perceived real hand position towards the fake hand. Bayesian models have captured the illusion based on a "dominance" of relatively more precise visual over (less precise) proprioceptive hand position estimates, which, together with a strong prior for having one hand only, leads to inference that the seen hand is "mine" 
(Samad et al., 2015;
Chancel et al., 2022)
.
Intriguingly, electrophysiological and brain imaging studies suggest that the brain could enhance the natural differences in precision between vision and proprioception to better resolve the multisensory conflict during the rubber hand illusion. In brief, these studies suggest that somatosensory information from the hand side subject to the illusion is selectively attenuated, while visual information in general seems to be up-weighted 
(Zeller et al., 2016;
Limanowski & Blankenburg, 2016)
. This would suggest a key role of top-down precision control in shaping the body representation, e.g., under unusual conflicts as in the rubber hand illusion 
(Limanowski, 2022a)
.
Presumably, a similar sensory bias of the multisensory body representation by precision can also operate when we act. For instance, the relative weighing of visual vs proprioceptive signals for the estimation of the body's (effector's) state can be biased top-down to augment visuomotor adaptation and learning. Several studies have suggested that, despite the importance of sensory prediction errors for motor learning, somatosensory attenuation during the early learning phase of visuomotor conflicts may enhance visuomotor adaptation-presumably by speeding up intersensory recalibration (e.g., 
Bernier et al., 2009;
reviewed in Limanowski, 2022a)
. Moreover, we could show that participants can deliberately change the relative weight assigned to visual vs proprioceptive body position, depending on their behavioural relevance during visuomotor conflict tasks; and that those changes can be seen in hemodynamic and oscillatory responses over the corresponding sensory cortices, much like one would expect gain control to operate along predictive coding formulations 
(Limanowski & Friston, 2020b,c)
. This further underwrites the importance of tuning precision estimates for flexible body representation; i.e., the context-dependent weighting and integration of (incongruent) seen and felt body position for action (cf. 
Maselli et al., 2022;
Bertoni et al., 2023)
.


Sensory attenuation for movement initiation
The second key role of precision as sensory gain pertains to movement production itself. This originates from active inference formulations based on an extension of predictive coding schemes with motor reflexes. To understand this, we need to briefly introduce the key assumption of those formulations that movement is produced through the minimization of proprioceptive prediction errors 
(Friston et al., , 2012a
cf. Adams et al., 2013;
Shipp et al., 2013;
Palmer et al., 2016)
: As noted above, in predictive processing approaches based on predictive coding, the model's beliefs (probabilistic representations) capture statistical regularities in the environment and are, in turn, optimised by accommodating prediction errors-this corresponds to perceptual inference. Active inference extends this idea to include movement; i.e., behaviour is explained in terms of inference on the causes of proprioceptive sensations . Thus, descending signals from the primary motor cortex are conceptualised as proprioceptive predictions (i.e., about dynamic muscle or joint states; 
Parr et al., 2022)
. Spinal reflex arcs, i.e., monosynaptic (or in some cases, polysynaptic) loops of primary sensory afferents and motor neurons in the spinal cord, are then thought to minimise the error between predicted and actual proprioceptive states-whereby they cause muscle movements that approximate the predicted joint state 
(Friston et al., 2010
(Friston et al., , 2011
. Thus, the agent is now equipped with a complementary way to deal with prediction errors, as it can now act on the environment to directly reduce them. In other words: it can change the world (i.e., its sensory input)-instead of changing its mind 
(Parr et al., 2022)
.
It should be noted that this 'enaction' of proprioceptive predictions by the motor system is among the points of disagreement between active inference and optimal motor control 
(Friston, 2011;
Pickering & Clark, 2014)
. In short, the assumption that descending signals from the M1 are proprioceptive "predictions" rather than motor "commands" eliminates the need for a cortical "inverse" model, which in optimal control formulations computes the motor commands required to reach the action goal 
(Friston, 2011)
. Instead, the "pure forward model" approach of active inference 
(Parr et al., 2022;
Pickering & Clark, 2014
) relegates the inverse model to spinal reflex arcs, which reduce the prediction error resulting from the mismatch of predicted and actual proprioceptive data 
Shipp et al., 2013)
. Despite these differences, however, both accounts are largely compatible, as they converge on the notion that actions (and movements) are predicted and controlled largely by internal generative ("forward") models in the brain (cf. 
Pickering & Clark, 2014;
Priorelli et al., 2023)
. Likewise, both accounts emphasize the importance of sensory attenuation-albeit with different underlying mechanisms.
Here, active inference entertains one unique assumption; namely, that sensory attenuation is required to move. This results from the conceptualization of behaviour in terms of inference on the causes of proprioceptive sensations; where the spinal reflex arc minimizes proprioceptive prediction errors 
Shipp et al., 2013)
. Not that descending proprioceptive predictions, as assumed by active inference to drive muscle movements (see above), are per se counterfactual; i.e., I am not really moving, and not actually receiving those proprioceptive signals that the descending 'motor' signals predict. Along the classical formulation of (perceptual) inference, the resulting prediction error should be accommodated by updating the model beliefs; i.e., changing my predictions. This would result in immobility, however. The solution to this problem is thought to lie in sensory attenuation;
i.e., by selectively suppressing the precision afforded to proprioceptive signals. The descending proprioceptive predictions are now thought to be relatively dominant; the organism does not update them, but chooses another way to directly minimise the prediction error: It changes the proprioceptive data itself. This means nothing else than that the organism moves, thus generating the predicted proprioceptive trajectory. Therefore, in active inference, sensory attenuation is a requirement for movement initiation to the extent that a failure to correctly initiate or maintain movement can be modelled as a failure of adequate sensory attenuation. Indeed, there is considerable experimental evidence demonstrating sensory attenuation during movements and at the time of movement initiation consistent with active inference. For movements, somatosensory attenuation has typically been studied using electrical stimulation of the median nerve. This produces a somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) recordable at multiple levels of the somatosensory pathway to provide a measure of the magnitude of the afferent volley. Cortical EEG recordings have shown that there is a suppression of the primary and secondary complexes of the SSEP during active and passive movement 
(Rushton et al., 1981)
. Attenuation of SSEPs has also been shown during motor preparation before EMG onset of active movement 
(Starr and Cohen, 1985;
Jiang et al., 1990;
Seki and Fetz, 2012)
. Furthermore, patients with Parkinson's Disease, who have bradykinesia (a deficit in movement initiation and maintenance of movement) show significantly reduced or no attenuation of the primary SSEP component when dopaminergic OFF medication but this is restored when ON medication 
(Macerollo et al. 2016)
.
Thus, in active inference, sensory attenuation is the complement of sensory attention: To produce movement, the agent has to attend away from proprioceptive data by attenuating their gaindecreasing the confidence in them. Note this does not mean that the agent is uncertain about motor control or movement itself, but, momentarily, about its sensations 
(Palmer et al., 2016)
. This may be mediated by low frequency neuronal synchronization 
(Palmer et al., 2016;
cf. Bastos et al., 2015)
.
Interestingly, this account offers an explanation for certain phenomena observed under visuoproprioceptive conflicts as in the rubber hand illusion (see above); i.e., the generation of apparently involuntary unseen hand movements towards the location of a displaced fake hand (observed empirically and replicated in simulations by 
Lanillos et al., 2021)
. In brief, in the active inference approach, the seen hand location could bias proprioceptive predictions of the felt, unseen hand position; the involuntary hand movements can be seen as an 'enaction' of those proprioceptive predictions 
(Limanowski, 2022b)
. Something similar may also happen in motor contagion and visuomotor interference-and related confusions of 'agency'.


Sensory attenuation of reafference and its relation to agency
It is well known that sensory reafference (self-generated movement feedback) is relatively suppressed (e.g., 
Palmer et al., 2016;
. Within the active inference framework, this can be explained by the fact that the precision of the corresponding sensory signals is attenuated (see above). This implies a key role of precision control (sensory attenuation) in self-other distinction 
(Kilner et al., 2007;
Friston & Frith, 2015;
Limanowski, 2022a)
. Disturbances of agency are a particularly impressive case in which, within the active inference framework, the central role of sensory attenuation for self-other distinction becomes evident. Here, we roughly define 'agency' as the experience or feeling of being in control of "one's" actions; i.e., a self-attribution of movement and its sensory consequences. Many accounts of pathological behaviour have focused on aberrant predictive mechanisms; e.g., casting psychosis as prediction failure 
Bansal et al., 2018;
Corlett et al., 2009;
Adams et al., 2012)
. In short, along active inference, the distinction between self and other in part relies on the fact that "self-generated" sensations (i.e., those predicted by the motor system) are attenuated-in order to allow movement, see above-whereas externally generated sensations are not 
(Brown et al., 2013;
Friston & Frith, 2015)
. Thus, a relatively attenuated proprioceptive sensation can be a cue that I am performing a voluntary act-enhanced proprioceptive signals would, conversely, signal that someone or something else caused my movement 
(Friston & Frith, 2015)
. This renders precision estimation a key feature of self-other distinction in social settings.
Correspondingly, simulation studies have shown that a number of characteristic phenomena in schizophrenia/psychosis can be explained by an imbalance in precision between higher hierarchical areas (where it is too low) and lower -e.g., primary sensory -areas (where it is too high). These include impaired smooth pursuit eye movements, reduced evoked responses to unexpected stimuli in sensory oddball tasks, reduced sensitivity to some visual illusions, and -in particular -a loss of attenuation of self-generated sensations (reviewed in . The latter has been demonstrated in the force-matching task 
(Shergill et al., 2005)
, although note that self-produced sensations could be magnified both by reduced attenuation (increased precision) and/or by impaired prediction (increased prediction errors) -few studies test both possibilities. 
Asimakidou et al. (2022)
 found evidence of both problems in schizotypy. Heightened sensations, including from somatic senses, can often result in delusions about foreign objects or external influences on the body in schizophrenia. Interestingly, patients with functional neurological disorder -who suffer from symptoms such as paralysis or dystonia without evidence of neurological damage -also show reduced sensory attenuation in the force-matching task (Parées et al., 2014), implying that loss of agency (for self-generated motor symptoms) may have a similar mechanism across these disorders 
(Edwards et al., 2013)
.
A final interesting showcase of the importance of precision for self-agency and self-other distinction can be found in the phenomena of motor contagion or visuomotor interference: As mentioned, the relative precision assigned to visual and proprioceptive information determines its impact on the brain's multisensory estimate of hand posture and position (see above). Getting the balance between these two senses right is key for bodily identification and self-other distinction; as it determines whether a seen movement is simply observed (other body) or whether it is executed (own body; 
Kilner et al., 2007;
Shipp et al., 2013;
Friston & Frith, 2015)
. This explains why observing incongruent movements of conspecifics biases our own movement execution 
(Kilner et al., 2003;
Press et al., 2011;
Limanowski & Friston, 2020c;
Gonzales-Franco et al., 2020)
. Similarly, new-borns first show a pronounced imitation of observed movements, which is explained by an automatic activation of a body representation that does not yet distinguish between self (i.e., movements associated with visual and proprioceptive consequences) and other (i.e., movements associated with only visual consequences; 
Seth & Tsakiris, 2018;
Ciaunica et al., 2021)
. In certain psychiatric and neurological conditions, such as catatonic schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, or after prefrontal lesions, a similar 'echopraxia' can be observed. This can be thought of as a loss of control. In active inference formulations, specifically, it implies a loss of control over one's expectations of sensory precision-resulting in aberrant attention and attenuation; i.e., an inadequate weighting of sensory evidence that causes an automatic update of a body model and, in the worst case, may lead to explicit misattributions of agency and pathological self-experience (cf. 
Ciaunica et al., 2022;
Harris et al., 2023;
. This renders the execution of control over sensory precision (the context-dependent selective emphasis or suppression of sensory evidence; i.e. sensory attention and attenuation) a key mechanism of bodily self-identification and self-other distinction 
(Limanowski, 2022a)
. But, at the same time, it enables us to be empathetic and to understand our conspecifics' action intentions 
(Friston & Frith, 2015)
.


Precision in action planning (discrete inference and mixed models)
Above, we summarised how body movements are produced according to continuous 
(active)
 inference. This can be seen as "driving action selection in the present to change currently available sensory data" 
(Parr et al., 2022, p. 9)
. In contrast to this, an alternative formulation of active inference accommodates planning; i.e., inference to select the optimal course of action in the future 
(Friston et al., 2017;
cf. Botvinick & Toussaint, 2012)
.
The prominent way of modelling this is as inference in discrete time; e.g., via hidden Markov models or partially observable Markov decision processes (see 
Fig. 2A
). Roughly, the corresponding models comprise policies (which represent sequences of actions), hidden states, and observable sensory data generated by the latter. As states evolve over time according to transition matrices, each action plan (policy) can be evaluated in terms of how likely it is to generate preferred observations. This anticipated fulfilment of preferences is evaluated as part of the policy's expected free energy (for details, see e.g. 
Friston et al., 2017;
Parr et al., 2017)
. The other aspect of expected free energy deals with a prior belief that policy selection will lead to resolution of any uncertainty-offering an exploratory complement to the 'exploitative' preference fulfilment. In these formulations, precision can be associated with beliefs about uncertainty in the mapping of outcomes onto hidden states, in the state transitions, or about action policies ). As we shall see below, these different forms of uncertainty can be elegantly linked to different processes of action planning.  
Friston et al., (2017)
. The key point here is that a continuous trajectory of sensory observations o (o', o'', …; corresponding to speed, acceleration, etc.) is modelled as caused by a hidden state x and its derivatives (x',x'',…; where the interactions between the temporal derivatives are determined by an equation of motion f prescribed by a hidden cause v) through a nonlinear mapping g, plus random fluctuations ω. This elegantly captures the fact that the world generates sensory inputs continually, and, furthermore, that we act upon the world through continuous muscle movements. For this reason, these formulations are typically used to model sensation and movement, for instance, based on prediction error minimisation in predictive coding schemes. B: Inference in a discrete state space formulation. The key difference to the model shown in (A) is that we are seeing a sequence of three distinct hidden states s1-s3, which each generate corresponding an observable outcome o1-o3 through a matrix A specifying the likelihood mapping. The states are linked by transition matrices B, which in turn depend on the current policy (sequence of actions encoded by π; G represents the probability distribution over policies based on expected free energy; D represents the initial state, see 
Friston et al., 2017)
. In contrast to the trajectory generated by the model in (A), this model generates data in discrete steps. These formulations lend themselves to model discrete or even categorical inference of the sort that, presumably, guides decision making or action planning. C: "Mixed" model of action comprising a discrete state space level sitting "on top" of, and linked to a continuous state space level, each displayed as a Bayesian network. The upper, discrete level generates "chunks" of data in discrete-time (the Bayesian network represents conditional dependencies) and thus models categorical decisions or discrete action plans; the lower, continuous level generates data in continuous-time (the Bayesian network represents generalized coordinates of motion). The link between the levels happens as the outcomes of the discrete model determine a hidden cause that prescribes the generalized motion of continuous hidden states, generating continuous sensation. Here, the upper level could select an optimal action sequence (such as a particular throwing movement), which allows to generate muscle movements through proprioceptive predictions via the lower level (thus actually throwing the football). Precision estimates play an important, but different role in several computations at both levels of this model (see 
Fig. 1
 and main text). Adapted from 
Friston et al., (2017, Figs. 1, 5, and 8)

The preference for a different formulation arises from the fact that, in contrast to continuous-time joint movements and the sensations driving them, decision making and action planning are categorical in nature; therefore, their underlying processes are very intuitively modelled in discrete-time 
(Friston et al., 2013;
Schwartenbeck et al., 2019)
. In fact, one can even argue that very soon after leaving the level of sensory receptors, one can speak of discretized representations in the neuronal hierarchy; such as, for example, classical receptive fields 
(Parr et al., 2022)
.
Naturally, practically all actions require planning and moving; i.e., inference in discrete and continuous state spaces-even our simple example in 
Figure 1
 requires the selection of an optimal action policy and the enaction of the movement i.e., the predicted proprioceptive states. How can this be accommodated-how can these levels interact? This has recently been addressed within the active inference framework through the development of hierarchical, "mixed" generative models 
(Friston et al., 2017)
. These models encompass more than one level of belief updating, encompassing both discrete and continuous state spaces (see 
Fig. 2B
 for an example). These kinds of models are needed to capture inference underlying action; because action entails several processes ranging from discrete (categorical) decisions to continuous sensation and movement (see 
Fig. 1
). Thus, in such mixed models, discrete inference will occupy the higher levels of the hierarchy, while continuous inference will underwrite sensation and movement. This means that the lowest level of these models will necessarily be continuous-because it is the agent's interface with the world in continuous time 
(Parr et al., 2022
).
Yet, these continuous levels must link to categorical states, as discrete action planning is informed by continuous sensory data; and (discretely) selected actions generate sequences of (continuous) movements.
In discrete as well as continuous formulations ( 
Fig. 2A-B)
, precision is thought to be implemented via the weighting of synaptic inputs. But the locus of this synaptic weighting varies depending upon the probability distribution with which that precision is associated. In other words: While the role of precision as synaptic gain control is universal, the association of precision with different distributions in the (brain's) generative model means that 'precision' will mean something slightly different at each level of the model hierarchy. For those precisions associated with likelihoods (i.e., conditional distributions linking hierarchical levels) we might anticipate an effect on superficial pyramidal cells that mediate the ascending connections from one cortical region to another. However, for precisions over (for example) policies we might pursue, the relevant synapses might be expected in the basal ganglia, where monoamines such as dopamine can modulate the actions selected. Fast changes in synaptic efficacy such as these (as opposed to slower processes like learning) can plausibly be linked to the action of neuromodulatory systems in the brain (see below).
In line with this, we have recently applied such a hierarchical mixed model to capture the computational architecture underlying sequential, goal-directed pointing movements-encompassing multiple discrete levels modelling target selection and action planning, and a continuous level generating joint (arm) movements 
(Parr et al., 2021)
. By applying simulated lesions to different precision parameters, we could reproduce behavioural changes resembling those associated with either anatomical lesions or neuromodulatory pathologies; mapping the computational architecture onto the known anatomy of movement 
(Fig. 3A)
. We briefly summarize the main findings in the following.
The idea behind this work was to simulate a simple task in which movement planning and execution are necessary but can be disambiguated from one another. Three targets were placed in fixed locations in a 3D space with one highlighted as the target to aim for. Periodically, the highlighted target would change. The highest level of the generative model dealt with transitions between the highlighted target states, with each time-step predicting a short sequence of discrete positions for one's hand at the level below. Finally, the discrete hand positions at each time were used to predict short trajectories in continuous time, using the generalised coordinates of motion apparatus alluded to above. During the inversion of this model, the expected free energy was used to select alternative hand positions, which, via the continuous model at the lowest level, led to proprioceptive predictions that were fulfilled through (reflexive) actions.
Several forms of precision were important here. At the continuous level, this included two key types of precision. The first was the inverse variance of the anticipated sensory data ("sensory precision").
When this was increased-as if the descending corticospinal tracts that attenuate precision during movement (see above) were interrupted-we found relatively normal movement, but greatly exaggerated tendon reflexes elicited by introducing an unexpected proprioceptive stimulus (see 
Fig.   3B
). This is typical of so-called 'upper motor neuron' pathologies which range from stroke 
(Wilson, Gandevia et al. 1999)
 to motor neuron disease 
(Christensen, Nielsen et al. 2003)
. The second precision at the continuous level determined the anticipated smoothness of sensory fluctuations (i.e., their autocorrelation over time). Augmentation of this precision resulted in hypermetric and ataxic-like behaviour of the sort associated with cerebellar syndromes 
(Holmes 1917
, Hore, Wild et al. 1991
.
Neither of the above precision parameters affected the ability to decide upon the correct (highlighted) target-just the execution of the movement to reach that target. In contrast, manipulations to decrement of the precision of policy selection led to an almost akinetic picture, in which no target could be selected with any degree of confidence and the simulated arm remained somewhere in the middle. This might reflect the difficulty in motor initiation seen in Parkinsonian patients with dopamine depletion 
(Albin, Young et al. 1989)
. Finally, we found that reducing the precision that linked between the highest hierarchical level-dealing with changes in the highlighted target-and the level dealing with discrete sequences of hand positions resulted in a form of perseveration, in which every change in target position was associated with a very delayed (but ultimately successful) change in the motor plan to reach the new target. We might think of this form of precision attenuation as the effect of a frontal disconnection syndrome 
(Leonard, Milner et al. 1988
)-with disconnection being the most extreme form of loss of synaptic gain 
(Geschwind 1974, Parr and
Friston 2020)
. 
Figure 3B
 shows the respective simulated pointing trajectories.
In sum, the hierarchical, mixed models briefly introduced here offer a great tool to investigate the neurocomputational basis of action. Specifically, they provide the possibility to simulate lesions to certain brain systems-e.g., those tentatively associated with the implementation of precision, as described in the following section. Here, to simulate pointing movements to three visual targets, we used a hierarchical mixed model with two linked discrete levels, inferring pointing sequences and intermediate attracting points for movement, respectively; the lower level linked to a continuous level as in 
Fig. 2
. The top schematic (small A) shows the mapping of two discrete levels of the mixed model, concerned with target and action selection, onto fronto-parietal cortices and structures of the basal ganglia. The bottom schematic (small B) shows the relationship between the lower discrete level and the continuous level of the model, which ultimately issues proprioceptive predictions that are enacted by movement through spinal reflexes in continuous time. For details, see 
Parr et al. (2021)
. B: This architecture was used to simulate pointing movements to three visual targets under different synthetic lesions. The black lines in the left plots show the trajectory of the simulated arm; the red spheres represent the sequence of attracting points selected by the (lower) discrete model that determine short trajectories for the continuous model (reminiscent of the concept of motor "chunking"). The right plots show the corresponding changes in shoulder rotation and flexion, and elbow flexion. From top to bottom: Overestimation of sensory precision did not impair movement, but exaggerated tendon reflexes (not shown). Reducing the precision of the beliefs about action policy selection produced "akinetik", small amplitude movements. Overestimation of the anticipated smoothness of sensory fluctuations over time produced hypermetric overshoots at the end of each movement. Finally, reducing the precision associated with linking the discrete model levels concerned with target and action policy selection, respectively, produced an apparent confusion whenever the target position changed.

How are different kinds of precision implemented in the brain?
One of the appealing characteristics of active inference is that it can be a process theory; i.e., a mechanistic description of how Bayesian message passing can be mapped onto neurobiological computations 
(Parr et al., 2022)
. Among other things, this allows to generate empirically testable predictions based on the assumed generative model that our brains are using-which may ultimately inform the construction of artificial agents 
(Ciria et al., 2021;
Yuan et al., 2023;
Matsumoto et al., this issue)
. Thus, the inferential (Bayesian) message passing in active inference can be elegantly mapped onto the canonical cortical microcircuit 
(Bastos et al., 2012;
Shipp, 2016)
. This can be achieved for continuous-time formulations, as in predictive coding, and discrete-time formulations such as partially observable Markov decision processes-albeit with some subtle differences 
(Parr et al., 2022;
Hodson et al., 2024)
.
In both formulations, precision estimation can be cast as gain control-reflecting the confidence in probability distributions; e.g., the weight afforded to prediction error signals or the confidence in a policy or likelihood mapping. The associated fast changes in synaptic efficacy (as opposed to those related to slower learning processes) can, in principle, be linked to neuromodulation 
(Parr et al., 2017
(Parr et al., , 2022
Shine et al., 2021;
cf. Lee & Dan, 2012)
. In particular, the focus on neuromodulation allows a very intuitive distinction between the different kinds of precision in action (as depicted in 
Fig. 1
 and 
Fig. 2
; cf. 
Yu & Dayan, 2005;
.
Among the numerous neurotransmitters of the central nervous system, some have received particular attention in this formulation; with respect to precision and uncertainty, those are acetylcholine, dopamine, and noradrenaline or norepinephrine 
(Yu & Dayan, 2005;
Deco & Thiele, 2009;
Marshall et al., 2016;
Burk et al., 2018)
. The cholinergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic systems are often referred to as 'neuromodulatory' systems, in contrast to neurotransmitters that classically are assigned a primarily excitatory or inhibitory role, such as Glutamate or GABA (although these can also influence attentional processes by acting on e.g. cholinergic projections, cf. 
Burk et al., 2018)
. This is due to several characteristics of the respective neurons and their synaptic effects; for instance, in contrast to e.g. Glutamate or GABA, neurons producing acetylcholine, dopamine, and noradrenaline are predominantly located in a few nuclei in the brainstem, from where they have more or less widespread connections to large parts of the brain 
(Yu & Dayan, 2005;
Lee & Dan, 2012)
. This means that a single neuron can influence processes in many (e.g. cortical) neurons simultaneously-a role that lends itself to a global modulatory mechanism such as precision . 
Figure 3
 shows a schematic of the main cholinergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic pathways of the brain. Broadly, the cholinergic system can be seen as a top-down control mechanism, ultimately originating from the prefrontal cortex through its control over cholinergic neurons e.g. in the basal forebrain, which modulates processing in sensory cortices 
(Deco & Thiele, 2009)
. Correspondingly, one of its likely roles is in the control of (selective) attention 
(Bauer et al., 2012a;
Moran et al., 2013)
. Thus, it has been established that cholinergic neuromodulation can be modelled as enhancing sensory or 'expected' precision 
(Yu & Dayan, 2005;
Moran et al., 2013)
. In discrete-time models, this would correspond to the likelihood precision; i.e., how confident one is that hidden states will cause certain observable outcomes . In our example 
(Fig. 1)
, cholinergic modulation would be at play at the lower, sensorimotor levels such as sensory attention and attenuation.
The dopaminergic system has classically been linked to movement production and action selection, in large parts because its main pathways target predominantly motor structures in the basal ganglia 
Parr et al., 2021)
. Active inference models have correspondingly clearly linked dopaminergic activity to the precision of cues that afford action ; which, in discretetime formulations, corresponds to the precision of action policies-i.e., the confidence in action plans 
(Schwartenbeck et al., 2015;
. In our example, dopaminergic modulation would influence the selection of a specific play and movement.
Finally, the noradrenergic system seems to encode the certainty in (precision of) model predictions;
where noradrenergic responses of the brainstem locus coeruleus signal low certainty. Put differently, a substantially increased noradrenergic signalling from the locus coeruleus would signal "global model failure" 
(Jordan, 2023)
 in light of unexpected errors 
(Yu & Dayan, 2005)
; i.e., it signals that the current model is gravely wrong and needs updating in light of incoming sensory evidence. This becomes relevant in learning and model updating 
(Sales et al., 2019)
, particularly when learning depends on the estimated volatility of the environment-where a hypernoradrenergic state may lead to overreactivity to environmental changes, as potentially the case in autism spectrum disorder 
(Lawson et al., 2017)
. One way to conceptualise this is that noradrenaline deals with confidence in how predictably the world changes (i.e., it signals precision in transition probabilities)-a view that is evidenced by modelling of pupillometric data during online manipulation of volatility 
(Vincent, Parr et al. 2019)
.
Joint investigations of all three of the above neuromodulatory systems are still rare, but a recent computational study using pharmacological manipulations of all three neuromodulators overall confirmed the association of acetylcholine with uncertainty about cue-outcome associations; dopamine with action selection; and noradrenaline with learning from unexpected changes 
(Marshall et al., 2016)
. The role of serotonin in attention and precision is less clear 
(Burk et al., 2018;
Doya et al., 2021)
, but it may be linked to preferences or the precision of interoceptive likelihoods 
(Parr et al., 2022)
. In sum, there are still many outstanding questions about the neuromodulatory mechanisms of precision to be asked by future work.
Of course, neuromodulation is only one possible way to mediate precision estimates; for instance, they could also be computed and communicated through the induction of oscillatory coherence i.e. synchronization between cortical areas 
(Shipp, 2016;
Palmer et al., 2016;
cf. Spyropoulos et al., 2024)
.
For instance, low frequency oscillations in the 'alpha' range have classically been assigned a functional role in mediating top-down (selective) sensory attention 
(Fries et al., 2001;
Bastos et al., 2015)
. I.e., in many studies, attention to stimuli in various sensory modalities has been linked to a suppression of alpha power in the respective sensory cortical areas (besides augmenting gamma power). Similar attentional suppression has been observed over sensory cortices in the neighbouring 'beta' frequency range 
(Bauer et al., 2012a,b;
. However, beta oscillations originating from the motor system seem to have a different functional role: Thus, 
Palmer et al. (2016
Palmer et al. ( , 2019
 proposed that the desynchronization in the beta range typically observed during movement reflects an increased uncertainty in the current proprioceptive signals. In other words, this interpretation assigns sensorimotor beta oscillations a role in sensory attenuation, in line with the assumption that an attenuation of proprioceptive signals is required to move (see above). This interpretation of motor beta oscillations as mediating sensory attenuation nicely complements the role of sensory alpha/beta oscillations in sensory attention. Importantly, the association of different kinds of precision with different neuromodulators and the synchronization of different frequency band is not mutually exclusive. On the contrary, there is good evidence to assume a related mechanism; where, for example, cholinergic mechanisms could mediate the attention-related synchronisation of neuronal populations via its inhibitory effect on interneurons 
(Deco & Thiele, 2009;
Bauer et al., 2012a)
. More work is certainly needed to establish such a relationship, and to draw a clear precision-related functional distinction between different neuromodulators and neuronal synchronization in different frequency bands, but the above studies are valuable first steps.


Conclusion and outlook
To conclude, the precision concept has proven a very valuable concept on many levels of understanding brain function and behaviour, from cognitive control and decision making to psychophysical sensory attenuation and motor reflexes. However, the reviewed contributions have, of course, not solved all questions-and opened up new ones-so there remains work to do.
A major line of open questions surely pertains to the implementation of active inference and precision in the brain. Some of the assumptions of the framework are not undisputed, and there is a need for properly designed empirical studies that contrast them with other accounts of brain function and motor control (cf. 
Mikulasch et al., 2023;
for a review, see Hodson et al., 2024;
Shipp, 2016)
. For instance, gain modulation may be associated with more (different) computations than changing precision 
(Rao, 2024;
cf. Stroud et al., 2018)
. An exciting empirical research direction is the link between neuromodulators, neuronal synchronization, and different kinds of precision discussed above. One specific question in this line of research pertains to the timing of precision in active sampling; i.e., involving the coordination of action and effector movements operating on different time scales 
(Parr & Friston, 2017b;
Parr & Limanowski, 2023
) and a potential 'entrainment' of sensory attention by behavioural rhythms 
(Lakatos et al., 2008;
Wang & Limanowski, 2023)
. We did not discuss inference underlying the balance between explorative and exploitative behaviour; but it is surely an important decision for action where adequate precision estimates (e.g., as confidence in control) are essential and determine behavioural flexibility, switching between tasks, and balancing the impact of habits vs goals in action planning 
(Schwartenbeck et al., 2019;
Perrykkad et al., 2021
Perrykkad et al., , 2022
.
In the field of schizophrenia/psychosis research, a crucial open question is the mechanism behind the various precision changes that one can infer from behaviour. For example, higher hierarchical (e.g., prefrontal or hippocampal) loss of precision could be due to reduced synaptic gain from NMDA receptor dysfunction 
(Adams et al., 2022a)
, or reduced neuromodulation -e.g., of prefrontal cortex by dopamine 1 receptors 
(Slifstein et al., 2015)
 or muscarinic receptors 
(Scarr et al., 2009)
 -but reduced attenuation in sensory areas may be due to disinhibition (loss of interneuron function) or poorly understood actions of dopamine in sensory striatum 
(Vilares & Kording, 2017)
. Conversely, other studies have found that striatal dopamine activity seems to strengthen the precision of prior beliefs about sensations, not sensory input 
(Cassidy et al., 2018;
Schmack et al., 2021)
: a possible mechanism for hallucinations, and likely contributory factor to delusions 
(Adams et al. 2022b)
.
A very important field to which the concept of precision in generative models can contribute on many levels are cyber-physical interactions; i.e., interactions involving the control over robotic or virtual bodies (avatars). Robotics itself is a specific field of application, where Bayesian (active) inference can be implemented to control action 
(Ciria et al., 2021;
Yuan et al., 2023;
Matsumoto et al., this issue)
.
Thus equipping artificial agents with separate estimates in e.g. action policies and likelihood mappings may prove useful for generating truly human-like behaviour. This includes social-cognitive processes like action understanding, agency attribution, and joint action; which all rely on learning the appropriate balance between sensory attention and attenuation 
(Kilner et al., 2007;
Press et al., 2011;
Friston & Frith, 2015)
.
More generally, cyber-physical interaction means learning control over alternative bodies-and, often, in different 'realities', as adopting control over a virtual or remote-controlled robotic body will provide the user with different sensory information and different degrees of freedom for movement. Thus, the adoption of a virtual or robotic body can be likened to a switch to a different reality; a different world and a different body representation 
(Limanowski, 2022a)
. This poses many complex problems to the embodied self 
(Seth & Tsakiris, 2018;
Krugwasser et al., 2019;
Wen & Imamizu, 2022)
, including how to adjust one's precision estimates on several levels of inference for optimal behaviour and flexibility.
We have already emphasized the importance of tuning precision estimates for aiding visuomotor adaptation; i.e., the integration of novel seen and felt bodily information for action (see above and 
Bauer et al., 2012a,b;
Gonzales-Franco et al., 2020;
Limanowski, 2022a)
. The same likely factors into adaptation to a different sensorimotor mapping in cyber-physical interactions. Furthermore, precision can act as sensory attention and attenuation to enhance immersion: An attenuation of distracting signals from the 'physical reality' could help attend to those of the desired (virtual) reality; this can mean simple things such as a person playing virtual reality games ignoring the weight or limited field of view of the virtual reality headset, or visuomotor lags introduced by systematic delays in the hardware. But it is unknown what the limits and consequences of this learning are. For instance, in which of these cases is the model (body representation) adjusted, when is a new model learned-and how efficiently can we switch between models? One interesting question is whether there is some sort of sensory attenuation when switching between physical and virtual body representations (or vice versa), similar to what has been discussed for movement initiation above. There are further potential roles of precision in cyber-physical interaction, related to more 'perceptual' inference. For instance, estimates of interoceptive precision can mediate a sense of "presence", such as being in the virtual reality (cf. 
Seth et al., 2012;
Allen et al., 2022)
. This could perhaps link to a higher-level role of precision as model certainty (see above); undermining the sense that current world-and self-model is 'right' 
(Metzinger, 2004;
Limanowski & Blankenburg, 2013)
. Thus, there are many possible roles of precision when switching between physical and virtual body representations-and correspondingly many theoretical and empirical questions that can and should be addressed from within the active inference framework.
The many roles of precision in action 6 clearly see where your selected teammate is, but you hear them yelling instructions-so you focus your attention more on what you hear.Figure 1illustrates this example.
