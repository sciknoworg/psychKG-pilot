Significance statement
Highway merging is one of the most safety-critical situations encountered by human drivers, resulting in a large number of accidents. Driving automation technology can help reduce risks related to unsafe merging, but developing effective automation requires detailed understanding of human cognitive processes involved in merging. This work investigates the interplay between two of these processes, decision making and attention allocation, by measuring response times and eye movements of participants in a video-based study of merging decisions. Our findings highlight a relationship between the duration of glances in the side mirror and merging decisions, especially in conditions with increased time pressure. They provide grounds for future efforts on computational cognitive modeling that can help understand the causal relationship between decision making and attention in merging. Our results have implications for fundamental understanding of human cognition, and can aid the design of driving automation and driver assistance systems.


Introduction
Merging onto a highway is a challenging task that often requires a driver to find an appropriate gap between vehicles within a limited amount of available time. This task is safety-critical, resulting in approximately 19,000 accidents per year in the US alone 
(Sen et al., 2003)
. Better understanding of human merging behavior can aid in designing improved traffic infrastructure 
(Zheng and McDonald, 2007)
, development of advanced driver assistance systems 
(Baumann et al., 2011;
Gonçalves et al., 2022;
de Winter et al., 2022;
Duan et al., 2023)
 and automated vehicles capable of interacting with human traffic participants 
(Sadigh et al., 2018;
Schwarting et al., 2019;
Wang et al., 2020;
Siebinga et al., 2023)
, which all have potential to reduce accidents related to merging.
Studies of natural human behavior on highways have found that merging decisions are affected by gap sizes, the speed of the overtaking vehicle, and the distance to the end of the merging lane 
(Daamen et al., 2010;
Marczak et al., 2013)
. Such studies provide insights into the outcomes of merging maneuvers, but commonly exclude the contribution of human factors, such as situation awareness and cognitive processing, which hinders in-depth understanding of merging decisions.
From a human factors perspective, a more fine-grained understanding of human behavior can be obtained by measuring drivers' eye movements during maneuvers in traffic 
(Salvucci and Liu, 2002;
Ahlström et al., 2021)
. To make an informed and well-timed merging decision, the driver must allocate their attention between the road ahead (with a decreasing time budget as the end of the merging lane approaches) and the overtaking vehicle on a highway (the gap to which can be assessed, e.g., by glancing at the side mirror). Using eye tracking, previous studies investigated how drivers' visual attention is distributed while merging 
(Zheng and McDonald, 2007;
Cheng et al., 2016;
Mateo et al., 2018)
. However, existing literature on merging has predominantly focused either on the outcomes of the merging maneuver (decision making) or drivers' eye movements (attention), but has not explored the link between decision making and attention. An exception is the study by 
Gonçalves et al. (2022)
 who investigated how drivers' eye movements and timing of merging decisions are affected by kinematics of the merging situation and the information displayed on the car dashboard. However, more generally, the relationship between attention allocation and decision making dynamics while merging, remains unexplored despite being relevant for understanding human behavior in traffic. At the same time, this relationship has been extensively studied in basic and applied cognitive science.


Interplay between visual attention and decision making
Ample fundamental research has highlighted the mutual influences between attention and decision making. The evidence for the influence of attention on choice can be traced back to 
Zajonc (1968)
 who demonstrated the mere exposure effect: a stimulus that is attended to more is also preferred more by the decision maker; an effect that has been replicated in various studies since 
(Orquin and Mueller Loose, 2013)
. However, the mere exposure effect is often conflated with the utility effect, i.e., higher preference towards an option leading to a higher likelihood of visually attending to that option 
(Fantz, 1964;
Orquin and Mueller Loose, 2013)
. 
Shimojo et al. (2003)
 hypothesized that the mere exposure effect interacts with the utility effect: the option that is attended to more becomes more preferred, which in turn entails increased likelihood of gazing towards that option, creating a "gaze cascade". The difficulty of disentangling the effects of preference on gaze from the effects of gaze on preference represents a challenge for theories and models that aim to explain the interaction between decision making and attention 
(Krajbich et al., 2010;
Cavanagh et al., 2014;
Thomas et al., 2019)
. However, despite making different assumptions about the mechanisms of gaze-preference interaction, virtually all such theories and models converge on the existence of at least some form of an effect of attention on choice, which has also been illuminated in a recent meta-analysis of empirical literature 
(Bhatnagar and Orquin, 2022)
. At the same time, both empirical and theoretical literature on the relationship between decision making and attention is mostly limited to traditional decision-making paradigms which typically display static information about two options in two dedicated areas of interest. It remains unknown whether the findings of such studies generalize to scenarios in which choice options are not associated with any specific area of interest, of which there are plenty in the real world beyond the laboratory -for instance, deciding whether or not to merge onto a highway.


This study
This study aimed to shed light on the cognitive underpinnings of merging behavior by measuring response timing and eye movements during merging decisions based on naturalistic video stimuli. Using such stimuli allowed us to go beyond decision-making paradigms traditional for cognitive science and investigate the relationship between attention and decision making while avoiding confounding effects thanks to disentangling choice options from the visual sources of information.
Our participants observed first-person-view video recordings of a vehicle driving in the merging lane in a driving simulator. We varied the time-to-arrival and distance to the overtaking vehicle (which participants observed in the side mirror) and the time budget the participants had before the ego vehicle arrived at the end of the merging lane. Participants were asked to judge the situation and make a decision: accept the gap (merge in front of the overtaking vehicle) or reject the gap. Participants pressed either the accept or reject button on a keyboard as soon as they reached their decision, which allowed us to measure the duration of their decision process (response time). Additionally, the recordings of participants' eye movements during the task provided the means to measure how their visual attention was distributed during a decision. With this data at hand, we sought to answer two main research questions.


How does the timing of merging decisions depend on time pressure?
Response times (i.e., how long it takes one to arrive at a decision) can provide valuable insights about, e.g., experienced decision difficulty and choice strategy 
(Luce, 1986)
. Previous studies of timing of gap acceptance decisions demonstrated that response times in accept decisions are faster than in reject decisions in left turn and overtaking decisions 
(Zgonnikov et al., 2024b;
Sevenster et al., 2023;
Mohammad et al., 2024)
. This difference can be attributed to the dynamic nature of the gap acceptance decision (early on in the decision process the evidence in favor or accepting the gap is stronger) and the increased time pressure to make the accept decision (if the gap is not accepted fast, the opportunity to take the gap would be gone). However, these previous studies extracted response times indirectly from vehicle trajectory data. This could have introduced systematic differences due to different measurement procedures used for response times in accept and reject decisions. Here we investigated whether this effect is replicated when the response procedure is unified (keyboard button presses).
Duration of the gap acceptance process has also been shown to depend on the kinematics of the vehicles in the scene. This is the case in pedestrian crossing 
(Pekkanen et al., 2022)
, left turns across path 
(Zgonnikov et al., 2024a,b;
Bontje and Zgonnikov, 2024)
, and overtaking 
(Sevenster et al., 2023;
Mohammad et al., 2024)
. However, response times during merging gap acceptance remain poorly understood. Up to now, gap acceptance response times during merging have only been investigated in a study by 
Gonçalves et al. (2022)
. They found that gap acceptance decisions become faster with increasing distance to the overtaking vehicle. However, 
Gonçalves et al. (2022)
 have not investigated the effects of other kinematic variables such as time-to-arrival of the overtaking vehicle and the merging lane time budget, which are both critical for gap acceptance decisions 
(Daamen et al., 2010;
Marczak et al., 2013)
.
Based on the earlier findings in other gap acceptance scenarios, here we hypothesized that response times in accepted gaps will be shorter than in rejected gaps (H1.1 ). We also hypothesized that increasing the time-to-arrival of the overtaking vehicle would increase both accept response times (H1.2 ) and reject response times (H1.3 ) due to reduced perceived time pressure for the driver to make the decision 
(Zgonnikov et al., 2024a)
. Because distance and TTA were manipulated independently, the distance manipulation would presumably not affect the perceived time pressure, only affecting the perceived size of the gap. The increasing distance would then present stronger evidence for the "accept" decision (and hence faster "accept" responses) but weaker relative evidence for the "reject" decision (and hence slower "reject" responses). We hence assumed that the increased distance gaps would lead to reduced accept response times (H1.4 ) and increased reject response times (H1.5 ). Finally, merging is special in that the time budget to make the decision is constrained by the length of the merging lane. We hypothesized that larger time budget would result in longer response times for both accepted (H1.6 ) and rejected gaps (H1.7 ), for the same reason of reduced time pressure.


Does attention distribution correlate with the outcome of the merging decision?
If a driver making a merging decision fails to see the overtaking vehicle, their merging decision would not depend on the kinematics of the overtaking vehicle. On the other hand, if one's attention is fully on the overtaking vehicle, they would presumably judge the gap to this vehicle accurately but would be unaware of the end of the merging lane. Between these two unlikely extremes are a multitude of different spatiotemporal attentional patterns. For instance, if a driver only looks at the overtaking vehicle for a fraction of a second, would their decision be the same as if they looked at it ten times as long?
Here we hypothesized that naturally occurring differences in attention allocation (as quantified by the total duration of fixations on the overtaking vehicle) are associated with differences in decision outcomes (i.e., the gap acceptance likelihood) (H2 ). This would imply that in conditions with relatively large gaps to the overtaking vehicle, whenever the drivers look more at the side mirror, they would be more likely to accept the gap (since the information in the mirror contributes to the evidence that the gap is safe to accept). Conversely, in conditions where information in the side mirror (distance and TTA) favors rejecting the gap, more attention on the mirror would be associated with lower gap acceptance rate. This hypothesis is grounded in theories and empirical studies of downstream effects of attention on decision making in simpler paradigms 
(Zajonc, 1968;
Krajbich et al., 2010;
Orquin and Mueller Loose, 2013;
Bhatnagar and Orquin, 2022)
. Motivated by these findings, here we investigated whether participants' merging decisions would be correlated with where they look, and if so, under what circumstances.


Methods


Participants
A total of 24 (9 female, 15 male) volunteers participated in the experiment. Our key hypotheses concerned functional relationships at the individual participant level, hence we chose to collect a large number of observations per participant 
(Smith and Little, 2018)
. The number of participants was thus determined based on practical feasibility while keeping it above 20, a number previously shown to yield high levels of statistical power (given the large number of measurements per participant) for a variety of response time study designs 
(Miller, 2023)
.
The age of the participants ranged from 22 to 60 years (all but one of the participants were between 22 and 28 years old), with a mean age of 26.6 years and a standard deviation of 7.3 years. All participants provided written informed consent. The experimental protocol was approved by the TU Delft Research Ethics Committee.


Apparatus
The experiment was conducted using a 24-inch BENQ XL2540-B monitor, with a display resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The video stimuli were recorded at 20 frames per second in the driving simulator Prescan 2019.3.0. Eye movements of the participants were recorded using an SR Research EyeLink 1000 Plus eye tracker. Stimulus presentation, data recording, and experiment flow were controlled using SR Research Experiment Builder. To maximize data quality and minimize the amount of data loss, all participants used head support. The monitor was situated 100 cm from the head support. The experimenter used an adjacent computer to control the experiment. A photo of the setup is shown in 
Figure 1
.


Task and stimuli
On each trial, a participant observed a first-person perspective video of an ego vehicle driving in the merging lane while an overtaking vehicle drove on the highway 
(Figure 2, Figure 3
). The overtaking vehicle was visible in the side mirror. The video stimuli were recorded at 20 frames per second using the driving simulator Prescan 2019.3.0. The participant's task was to press one of the two keyboard buttons depending on whether they thought the current situation represents a good opportunity for the ego vehicle to merge in front of the overtaking vehicle. To elicit naturalistic responses despite the unnatural way of reporting the decision (via button presses), the task was described to participants as providing guidance to an automated vehicle. Participants were asked to respond as soon as they made a decision, and decide just like they would in real traffic. The exact task instructions were as follows: "Imagine you are an expert driver whose job is to teach an autonomous vehicle (AV) how to handle merging situations on a highway. You will view multiple videos of an AV driving in an acceleration lane. You will see that another car is already driving on a highway. Your task is to instruct the AV which situations represent a good opportunity to merge onto a highway, depending on the distance to that car and its speed. Your task is to press LSHIFT if you would like the AV to merge in front of the approaching car on the highway. Alternatively, press RSHIFT if you do not want the AV to merge in front of the approaching car. Please decide just like you would decide when driving on a real road. Press one of the keys as soon as you arrive at your decision. Keep in mind that in the videos, the AV will not actually merge but will stay on the acceleration lane. Keep looking at the video and assess the situation until the video ends."
With these task instructions, our intention was to elicit participants' naturalistic behavior in the manual driving setting, not limited to conditional/supervised automated driving.


Study design
The experiment followed a 2x2x3 within-subject design with three independent variables: 2 values of the time budget in the merging lane (i.e., the time it takes the ego vehicle to arrive at the end of the on-ramp) × 3 values of the distance gap to the overtaking vehicle × 2 values of the time-to-arrival of the overtaking vehicle. The distance gap and time-to-arrival were manipulated independently by changing the speed of the overtaking vehicle 
(Table 1
). For instance, for the 4 s time-to-arrival (and, say, 4 s time budget in the merging lane), the distance could be set to 20, 30, or 40 m by changing the speed of the overtaking vehicle (38, 40.5, or 43 m/s, respectively).
Each of the resulting 12 conditions 
(Table 1
) was repeated 30 times for each participant, leading  to a total of 360 trials per participant. The number of repetitions per condition per participant was chosen to enable reliable estimation of response times as well as to allow future studies to use our data for drift-diffusion modeling 
(Bachmann and van Maanen, 2024)
. The order of the trials was randomized within blocks of 60 trials, such that each block comprised five repetitions of each condition.
Time budget in the merging lane, time-to-arrival and distance to the overtaking vehicle were chosen as independent variables based on previous studies of naturalistic human merging behavior which highlighted these as the key factors influencing gap acceptance 
(Daamen et al., 2010;
Marczak et al., 2013)
. Other variables that affect gap acceptance include accelerations of the ego vehicle and overtaking vehicle, as well as distance to the leading vehicle (if it is present on the highway) and its velocity. These were not included in this study for reasons of simplicity and to keep the number of observations per condition per participant as high as possible.
The levels of independent variables -time budget: 4s or 6s; distance to the overtaking vehicle: 20m or 30m or 40m; TTA: 4 s or 6s -were chosen (and calibrated in a pilot study) in such a way that the condition with the highest proportion of accepted gaps (hypothetically: time budget 4s, distance 40m, TTA 6s) would mostly result in "accept gap" decisions but also occasionally elicit "reject gap" responses. Similarly, the condition with lowest time pressure (time budget 6s) and smallest gap (distance 20m, TTA 4s) was intended to lead to the gap rejected most of the time but still occasionally accepted. This was done to enable the measurement of response times and attention distribution in "rare" decisions -small gaps that were still accepted and large gaps which were nevertheless rejected.


Experimental procedure
At the start of the experiment, the participants were briefed on the objective of the experiment, i.e., to gain insight into the decision-making behavior of human drivers, and that such information could prove valuable in improving the decision-making behavior of automated vehicles. Participants then experienced an interactive demonstration comprising ten trials. In each of these demo trials, a video of merging (Video 12, 
Table 1
) was played for 2s, followed by a text instruction on the screen prompting participants to press either the LSHIFT or RSHIFT key. Upon pressing a key, another video was played in which the ego-vehicle would either merge in front of or behind the overtaking vehicle, based on the pressed key. The purpose of this demo was to familiarize participants with the specific maneuver associated with each instruction, since such feedback was not provided during the main experiment.
Following the demo, participants were presented with the task instructions (see the text above), followed by 20 practice trials. The practice trials were conducted using Videos 1, 6, 7, and 12, each repeated five times. During the practice trials, the experimenter observed the participants to ensure they comprehended the task correctly. If required, additional verbal instructions were provided to clarify the task.
Following the practice sessions, the participants were informed that for the remaining duration of the experiment, they had the option to take a break (to alleviate fatigue) and lift their heads from the head support after every set of 60 trials. Additionally, participants were instructed that they could look away from the screen every ten trials, while still maintaining their head in the head support. After these final instructions were presented, a nine-point eye-tracker calibration was initiated. After calibration, the main experiment (360 trials) began. After every trial, a fixation cross was displayed at the center of the screen for 0.3s. After every set of 60 trials, if a participant opted to lift their head from the head support, the eye-tracker calibration was performed before the subsequent set.


Data preprocessing and analysis
The raw data recorded during the experiment included participants' gaze position of the left and right eyes (in pixels, recorded at 1000Hz), the decision outcome (based on the button pressed: LSHIFT -accept the gap; RSHIFT -reject the gap) and response time (the time between the start of video playback and the moment the participant pressed one of the response buttons). Before the analysis, the gaze data for the two eyes were averaged to obtain the mean gaze position, and downsampled to 100Hz to facilitate data visualization. Six trials with no indicated decision were excluded from the analysis, resulting in 8634 trials analyzed across 24 participants.
We defined two areas of interest on the screen 
(Figure 2
): the side mirror (containing the information on the overtaking vehicle) and the front view (containing the information on the remaining space in the merging lane). For every trial, we then calculated the relative dwell time on the mirror -the percentage of trial time (until the response button was pressed) the participant spent looking

: Standardized coefficients of the mixed-effects logistic regression describing the final decision. All effects were modelled as random slopes per participant: decision ∼ 1 + distance + TTA + time budget + (1 + distance + TTA + time budget) | participant.
β SE z p (Intercept) 1.30 0.26 4.90 < 0.001 distance 0.54 0.11 4.97 < 0.001 TTA 1.84 0.12 15.71 < 0.001 time budget -0.42 0.10 -4.26 < 0.001 in the side mirror. As an example, if the response time was 2s and the participant in total spent 1.2s looking at the mirror (after the video started but before they pressed the button), the relative dwell time on the mirror would be 1.2 s/2 s = 0.6.
The trial-level metrics obtained from pre-processed data thus included the decision outcome (accept the gap (merge) or reject the gap (not merge)), response time, and relative dwell time on the mirror.
Mixed-effect models coded in pymer4 
(Jolly, 2018)
 were used for statistical analyses, with maximum interaction and random effects structure permitting model convergence. Decision outcomes were coded as 0 (reject) and 1 (accept). All other variables were z-scored for the purpose of regression analyses. For the response time model, we computed the Type-III sum-of-squares ANOVA table using the Satterthwaite approximation of degrees of freedom, and performed post-hoc tests to analyze marginal effects for the two decision outcomes separately. "Accept" was set as a reference level for the decision outcome factor in the response time model.


Results
In regard to eye movements, we found that participants frequently looked at the mirror early on in the merging decision ( 
Figure 4
). The majority of the trials started with participants looking in front of them, followed by a rapid glance at the side mirror. Approximately 0.6 s after the commencement of the video, in about 90% of the trials participants were looking at the mirror which displayed the overtaking vehicle. After 0.6 s, the likelihood of looking at the mirror declined, although in reject decisions, participants looked at the mirror more frequently (or for a more extended period) compared to accept decisions. This observation can be attributed to the fact that in most reject trials participants took longer to respond, and therefore needed to evaluate how the situation in the mirror unfolded for a longer time.
We found that similar to the behavior of drivers in real-life merging gap acceptance 
(Daamen et al., 2010;
Marczak et al., 2013)
, our participants' probability of accepting the gap increased with the time-to-arrival (TTA) and distance to the overtaking vehicle, and decreased with the time budget provided by the merging lane 
(Figure 5a
,b, 
Table 2
). From the cognitive perspective, the latter effect could be explained by larger time budgets reducing the pressure to merge. Smaller time budgets, on the other hand, could induce participants' acceptance of the gaps that they would otherwise reject. Overall, the fact that participants' behavior in our simplified video-based study qualitatively matches driver behavior in real-world merging studies provides evidence of at least minimal ecological validity of our experimental setup.


How does timing of merging decisions depend on time pressure?
We hypothesized that response times in accept decisions would be lower than in reject decisions (H1.1 ); we found that this was indeed the case (∆ = 0.69s, t = 11.4, p < 0.001, 
Table 3
,  
Figure 5c,d,e,f)
. This difference can be attributed to two factors: a) "accept" decision being a "cognitive default" in a merging situation (as the driver would normally merge in the target lane eventually, even after rejecting the gap), and b) evidence in favor of accepting the gap being strongest early on in the decision process; the longer the driver deliberates, the smaller the gap becomes, making slow accept decisions unlikely.

In accordance with our hypothesis H1.2, accept response times were slightly shorter in trials with shorter TTA (β = 0.04, t = 3.8, p < 0.001, 
Figure 5c,d)
, confirming previous observations that time pressure imposed by the closing gap leads to faster decisions. Confirming H1.4, accept response times slightly decreased with distance (β = −0.04, t = −3.9, p < 0.001, 
Figure 5c,d)
, presumably because larger distances provided immediately available evidence that a gap is suitable for merging.
Finally, the time budget provided by the merging lane increased accept response times (as hypothesized in H1.6 ), but only in trials with the larger time-to-arrival of the overtaking vehicle (β = 0.01, t = 0.8, p = 0.22 for TTA=4 s, β = 0.1, t = 9.3, p < 0.001 for TTA=6 s, 
Figure 5c,d
; see also interaction effect TTA:time budget in 
Table 3
). This can be explained by increased time budget reducing participants' perceived time pressure, leading to slower accepted gaps. In the trials with lower TTA however this effect could have been negated by the TTA now being the key time pressure factor constraining participants' deliberations, rendering differences in time budget on the merging lane irrelevant for the speed of the decision.
We observed that response times in reject decisions increased with the TTA (β = 0.28, t = 13, Error bars reflect 95% confidence intervals, and are smaller than marker size in most conditions. 
Table 3
: Standardized coefficients of the mixed-effects linear regression describing response times. Random slope of decision was included per participant: RT ∼ 1 + decision*(TTA*time budget + distance) + (1 + decision) | participant. "Accept" was set as a reference level for the decision outcome factor. Degrees of freedom were estimated using the Satterthwaite approximation.  
Figure 6
: Proportion of accepted gaps in trials where participants looked (or did not look) at the mirror at a given time t. To obtain the plot in each panel, for each time point t, we split all trials into two groups: those in which participants were looking (blue) or not looking (orange) at the side mirror at time t. We then calculated the proportions of accepted gaps in both these groups. This was repeated for all t between 0 s and 3 s, with the step of 10 ms. As an example, the proportion of accepted gaps in TTA=4 s trials (left panel) in which a participant was not looking at the side mirror (orange line) at t = 1 s was 0.59. p < 0.001), distance (β = 0.09, t = 5.7, p < 0.001), and time budget (β = 0.13, t = 6.2, p < 0.001) 
(Figure 5e,f)
. This confirmed H1.3, H1.5, and H1.7, respectively. Our explanation for this is that, similar to accepted gaps, decisions to reject a gap are also made under time pressure, which leads TTA and time budget to have a positive effect on the duration of the decision process. Increasing distance to the overtaking vehicle however doesn't seem to contribute to time pressure but instead delays reject responses by providing a stronger cue of the suitability of the gap for merging. Overall, we found that response times in accept decisions are much faster than those in reject decisions, and that in both decisions response times tend to be faster in the presence of time pressure (smaller TTA/time budget) and in the absence of visual cues disfavoring that decision (such as larger distances for rejected gaps). At the same time, the observed effects of the kinematic variables on accept response times were small while reject response times were affected stronger, especially by the TTA.

Does distribution of attention correlate with the outcome of the merging decision?
We observed that eye movements during the initial stage of the decision process have little to no predictive power regarding the decision outcome ( 
Figure 6
, 0 to approx. 0.5 s). At the same time, trials in which participants did not look at the mirror around 1 s were associated with a substantially increased likelihood of accepting the gap in the TTA=4 s condition 
(Figure 6
, left panel, 0.5 to approx. 1.5 s). However, this association could be a direct consequence of the baseline differences in response times between accepted and rejected gaps: participants would inevitably look at the mirror for a longer time (or more often) if they did not accept the gap early on 
(Figure 4)
.
To disentangle the association between decision outcomes and gazing behavior from the potential confounding effect of response time, we analyzed probability of gap acceptance as a function of relative dwell time on the mirror while controlling for response time. We found that participants' probability of accepting the gap was negatively associated with the proportion of decision time they spent looking in the side mirror (Table 4, 
Figure 7
). This association seemed to be present on average SDFFHSW 77$ VWLPHEXGJHW V 77$ VWLPHEXGJHW V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UHVSRQVHWLPHV SDFFHSW 77$ VWLPHEXGJHW V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UHVSRQVHWLPHV 77$ VWLPHEXGJHW V SURSRUWLRQRIWLPH ORRNLQJDWWKHPLUURU @ @ @

across all trials (β = −0.32, z = −4.9, p < 0.001). However, a closer inspection revealed that this effect was mostly limited to trials with lower time budget provided by the merging lane (interaction between time budget and relative dwell time on the mirror: β = 0.24, z = 4.8, p < 0.001), thereby only partially confirming H2. The negative relationship between dwell time on the side mirror and decision outcome is especially striking for TTA=4 s, time budget=4 s -the most ambiguous condition for the participants across the three distance gap levels (as suggested by 
Figure 5a
). For instance, in trials with response times ranging from 1.3 s to 1.44 s, participants accepted most of the gaps (about 70%) if they looked at the mirror less than 57% of total trial time so far, but rejected most of the gaps (about 25% gap acceptance rate) if they looked at the mirror more than 75% of the trial time 
(Figure 7
, top left panel). This suggests that in trials with comparable response times, differences in attention allocation could be associated with major differences in decision outcomes.
In trials with the larger time budget, the association between the decision outcome and dwell times was less pronounced. This suggests that with less time pressure, differences in drivers' atten-

Interestingly, despite differences suggested by 
Figure 7
, there was only weak evidence for an interaction between dwell time on the mirror and TTA (β = 0.13, z = 2.0, p = 0.044). There was however an interaction of dwell time with the distance to the overtaking vehicle, suggesting that the negative association between dwell time and decision outcome was more pronounced at larger distances (β = −0.15, z = −2.8, p = 0.005).
To illuminate the dynamics of participants' decision-making over time, we examined mean response times depending on whether participants were looking at the mirror. We found that if participants looked at the mirror early on, they were more likely to reach a decision swiftly, regardless of which decision was eventually made 
(Figure 8
). This effect was detectable within the first half-second after the start of the trial (that is, well before the decision was indicated in most trials), especially in Accept trials. If a participant kept looking at the mirror from 1 s onward, this was associated with slower decision making. A plausible explanation for this might be that looking at the mirror after a longer period might be an epiphenomenon of indecision.
To further investigate the complex relationship between decisions, response times, and gaze behavior, we analyzed individual differences between participants 
(Figure 9
). There was no evidence that looking in the mirror early correlated with participants' gap acceptance probability (r = 0.07, p = 0.74 and r = −0.04, p = 0.85, for TTA = 4 s and TTA = 6 s, respectively). Participants who were more likely to look into the mirror 0.3 s after the video started were also quicker to arrive at a decision (r = −0.53, p = 0.008 and r = −0.65, p < 0.001 for TTA=4 s and TTA=6 s, respectively). In other words, participants' mirror-looking behavior can, to a certain extent, be used to predict the speed at which participants make their decisions. Yet, early looking at the mirror does not provide a reliable prediction regarding whether one is likely to accept or reject the gap.


Discussion
By probing response timing and eye movements of participants, we scrutinized the cognitive dynamics of merging gap acceptance decisions. Our data revealed that variables that have long been known to affect the outcome of gap acceptance decisions -the size of the gap and the time pressure -also affect the timing of these decisions. Most importantly, we demonstrated that under

To obtain the plot in each panel, for each time point t, we split all trials into two groups: those in which participants were looking (blue) or not looking (orange) at the side mirror at time t. We then calculated the mean response times in both these groups. This was repeated for all t between 0 s and 3 s, with the step of 10 ms. As an example, mean response time in TTA=4 s Accept trials (top left panel) in which a participant was not looking at the side mirror (orange line) at t = 1 s was 1.2 s.
time pressure, the duration of glances in the side mirror can correlate with the outcome of the gap acceptance decisions.


Response times characterize the time course of merging gap acceptance decisions
In cognitive psychology, the duration of the decision making process has proved to be a valuable measure providing a high-level insight into the dynamics of cognitive processing 
(Luce, 1986)
. In driver behavior, response times have been extensively studied in the context of take-over requests 
(Zhang et al., 2019)
, but until recently have been left out of investigations of tactical decision making, including merging. Our study contributes to the emerging body of literature demonstrating that timing of gap acceptance decisions depends on the characteristics of the gap size. Our results are consistent with the finding of 
Gonçalves et al. (2022)
 that response times in accepted gaps decrease with distance (the effect that has also been reported for overtaking 
(Sevenster et al., 2023;
Mohammad et al., 2024)
 but not left-turn gap acceptance 
(Zgonnikov et al., 2024a;
Bontje and Zgonnikov, 2024)
). Furthermore, our data generalize the results of 
Gonçalves et al. (2022)
 in multiple ways. First, the positive effect of the time-to-arrival of the overtaking vehicle on response time has been reported earlier in overtaking 
(Mohammad et al., 2024)
  acceptance 
(Zgonnikov et al., 2024a,b;
Bontje and Zgonnikov, 2024)
; here we showed that it also applies to merging. Second, we analyzed response times not only in accepted but also rejected gaps, revealing that distance gap positively affects reject response times. Third, among the gap acceptance tasks, merging is unique in that the end of the merging lane provides an additional time constraint for making the decision; we found evidence that increasing this time budget leads to increased response times in both accept and reject decisions.
In addition to the relationship between kinematic variables and response times, we found that the speed at which a decision was made was heavily dependent on the decision itself: accept decisions were substantially faster than reject decisions. An explanatory factor of this asymmetry in response times can be found in the limited time available to make a decision, where the longer one waits, the more critical the situation becomes. Accepting the gap requires a certain level of boldness, i.e., a liberal decision threshold, whereas a reject decision can be preceded by a phase of accumulating information about the traffic situation to assure oneself that the gap is indeed too small; taking more time will only reinforce this decision.
These assertions are consistent with prior research which focused on response times for accept and reject decisions in left-turn gap acceptance 
(Zgonnikov et al., 2024b)
 and overtaking maneuvers 
(Sevenster et al., 2023;
Mohammad et al., 2024)
 in the presence of an oncoming vehicle. In those studies, it was posited that the response times for accepted gaps were quicker than for rejected gaps due to the early evidence favoring accepting the gap, as well as the urgency associated with accepting a gap. This aligns with an extensive body of research examining the speed at which drivers regain control from an automated vehicle as a function of time budget until a collision 
(Zhang et al., 2019)
: the empirical evidence indicates that take-over times tend to be quicker when the time budget is shorter 
(Eriksson and Stanton, 2017;
Zhang et al., 2019)
. In comparison, when a larger time budget exists, drivers are inclined to first evaluate the situation, and increase situational awareness before making a decision. In summary, a plausible explanation for the faster response times for accept decisions compared to reject decisions is the limited time budget: prompt action is required to accept the gap. We believe that the asymmetry in accept/reject response times can be informative for studies on reaction times in cognitive psychology at large, particularly concerning individual differences in response criteria.
4.2. Implications of the association between decision making and attention in merging 4.2.1. Implications for the study of human cognition
In simple binary choice (for example, between two food items), the longer one looks at a choice option, the more likely they are to choose it (see 
Orquin and Mueller Loose, 2013;
Bhatnagar and Orquin, 2022, for review)
. 
Krajbich et al. (2010)
 proposed that this can be due to a causal effect of attention allocation on decision making. At the same time, there is no consensus in the literature on this explanation, as these observations could often be explained by the utility effect ("better" choice options are naturally looked at more often) 
(Shimojo et al., 2003;
Orquin and Mueller Loose, 2013)
. This hampers theorizing about the interplay between attention and decision making 
(Orquin and Mueller Loose, 2013;
Bhatnagar and Orquin, 2022)
. Furthermore, current findings on the link between decision making and attention are mostly limited to static tasks in which each choice option is inherently represented by a spatial area of interest (typically, an image or a text description of the option). However, in many real-world tasks, choice options do not necessarily map onto visual areas of interest, making a direct replication of this effect difficult.
In our merging task, the two choice options (accept or reject the gap) are not mapped to any particular location in the visual scene. This goes beyond experimental paradigms traditionally used to study the role of attention in decision making by disentangling the choice options from the sources of information, eliminating the possibility of utility effect and correspondingly the gaze cascade effect 
(Fantz, 1964;
Shimojo et al., 2003)
. Still, we found evidence for an association between attention allocation and decision making in this task, which is in line with the previous evidence from more basic tasks. We thus believe that tasks with naturalistic stimuli like ours can help advance fundamental understanding of underlying cognitive mechanisms by providing a novel kind of testbed for process models of the interplay of attention and decision making.
While existing models have yet to be adapted to the dynamic nature of such tasks to allow for quantitative testing, some of these models are inherently more suitable for dynamic tasks than others. For instance, the mere exposure effect 
(Zajonc, 1968)
 and the gaze cascade hypothesis 
(Shimojo et al., 2003)
 imply that longer gaze at an option would increase the likelihood of choosing that option no matter its value. This implication is difficult to interpret in the context of our task: even if our choice options could hypothetically be represented by some values, they are not per se represented by any areas of interest, hence the theories that attribute interaction of attention and decision making to these effects would not apply to such scenarios. On the other hand, the models which integrate visual attention and evidence accumulation 
(Krajbich et al., 2010;
Cavanagh et al., 2014;
Thomas et al., 2019)
 postulate that longer fixations on an option would increase the likelihood of choosing that option if the value of that option is relatively high, and decrease it if the value is relatively low. Translated to our task, this would imply that the likelihood of gap acceptance should increase with the proportion of time the information favoring the "accept gap" is attended to, and decrease with the dwell time on the information that supports rejecting the gap. Our findings are in principle consistent with this implication. For instance, the effect of dwell time on the mirror on gap acceptance likelihood and its interaction with the kinematic conditions (Table 4, 
Figure 7
) could result from gaze-contingent evidence accumulation process. However, we expect that such models would predict stronger interaction of dwell time with TTA rather than with time budget (because the effect of former on decision is much stronger), while we observed the opposite. Furthermore, we observed negative association between dwell time on the mirror and gap acceptance probability even in conditions where the mirror presented evidence in favor of accepting the gap (e.g., TTA=4 s, time budget = 6 s). Hence, rigorous interpretation of our results in the context of existing models of gaze-choice interaction necessarily requires further research into adapting and testing such models against our data.


Relevance for applications in traffic safety and driving automation
Besides contribution to the fundamental understanding of human cognition, our findings have potential safety implications: for small gaps that are unsafe to accept, short glances on the mirror might not provide the driver with enough evidence to reject the gap, especially when the time budget due to the end of the merging lane is small. Previous studies demonstrated that educating drivers on gap acceptance strategies can improve their driving outcomes (e.g. 
Hunt et al., 2011)
; we thus believe incorporating insights on appropriate attention allocation into driver training could also improve the quality of gap acceptance decisions. Furthermore, our observations can provide a new perspective on the effects of driver distraction on gap acceptance behavior. Past research highlighted that distracted drivers fail to factor in important aspects of the road situation in their gap acceptance decisions at intersections 
(Cooper and Zheng, 2002;
Choudhary and Velaga, 2019)
 and roundabouts 
(Haque et al., 2016)
. However, both intersection crossing and roundabout scenarios are simpler compared to merging in that they typically do not require the driver to use the side mirror. The need for the driver to take into account at least two separate sources of information therefore makes merging particularly vulnerable to detrimental effects of driver distraction, warranting more detailed investigations on the effect of distraction on attention distribution.
We found that early mirror glancing on its own hardly allowed reliable predictions of gap acceptance ( 
Figure 6
). However, conditioned on the kinematic conditions and response time, glancing behavior over the whole duration of the decision can be strongly associated with the gap acceptance outcome 
(Figure 7)
. This provides an avenue for exploring applications of our results to the design of driving automation, such as automated pre-emptive braking based on driver attention, as well as automated systems that support the merging/lane change decision (e.g. 
Ali et al., 2020;
Dreger et al., 2020)
.


Limitations and future directions
Our study provides several illuminating insights, yet the simplifications of our experimental paradigm warrant caution in generalizing our results to real-world merging.


Task simplifications and their consequences
First, our task was not interactive whereas in real-world merging, drivers can accelerate or decelerate while making the decision, thereby effectively increasing or decreasing the size of the available gap. Furthermore, the oncoming vehicle in our paradigm had constant speed, while merging drivers often interact with other vehicles (e.g. 
Kondyli and Elefteriadou, 2012;
Siebinga et al., 2024)
, including the phenomenon of 'anticipation' by the new follower 
(Chen et al., 2023)
 and 'relaxation' after the lane change has occurred 
(Zheng et al., 2013)
. The latter entails that drivers sometimes tolerate small gaps, knowing that these gaps will soon expand again 
(Daamen et al., 2010)
. Therefore, the merging driver's gap acceptance decision and its timing used here as key behavioral metrics only provide a surface-level description of the merging interaction. The intrinsically interactive nature of real-world merging requires using more advanced behavioral metrics which need to capture the dynamics of the interaction of two (and possibly more) drivers, covering tactical and operational characteristics of their behavior 
(Siebinga et al., 2023)
.
Second, our task did not provide participants with any feedback on their decisions. In particular, if a participant made a decision that would result in a collision, they did not experience any consequences, much unlike real-life merging. For this reason, had our participants been asked to perform real-life merging under the same kinematic conditions, they would have probably exhibited less risky behavior, resulting in lower probabilities of accepting a given gap (compared to 
Figure 5)
. However, such a difference in the baseline gap acceptance probability would not have impacted any of our conclusions regarding the relationships between the kinematic variables, decision outcomes, response times, and gaze allocation.
Third, our participants had a much simplified visual representation of the information relevant for the merging decision. Importantly, they did not have an option to look over their shoulder or in the rear-view mirror. Furthermore, the shape, size, and location of the rear-view mirror in our task was different from that in a real vehicle. These differences mean that our findings on attention distribution (e.g., 
Figure 4
) cannot be directly translated to real-world merging. At the same time, while including the rear-view mirror, a more realistic side mirror, or the ability to look over one's shoulder would have improved the ecological validity of our setup, this would not have provided the driver any principally new task-relevant information (as the information on the distance to and TTA of the overtaking vehicle was already available in the side mirror).
We acknowledge that the process of decision making in our task is different from real-world merging in many regards. At the same time, it was not our intention to capture all intricacies of real-world merging in this study. Our goal was rather to distill the real-world task to such an extent that we can examine in close detail one key aspect of it. Specifically, the fundamental feature of the real-world merging gap acceptance task that our setup does replicate is the presence of at least two distinct sources of task-relevant information. In our simplified merging task, the information about the overtaking vehicle is available only in the side mirror, and the information on the end of the merge lane is available in the front view. Our participants thus needed to sample visual information from more than one source in order to make an informed decision -this is the main aspect of the real-world merging task that our experimental paradigm aimed to capture. The goal of our somewhat extreme simplification was therefore to enable rigorous measurement and analysis of the association between attention and decision making. Had the merging task been replicated with all its real-world nuances, it would have hampered our ability to measure and understand this association.
This trade-off between mundane realism and the ability to rigorously control the perceptual experiences of participants and directly measure the cognitive processes of interest is inherent to studies of human behavior in traffic (see, e.g., the discussion by 
Eisma et al., 2022;
Jokhio et al., 2024)
. While results of any laboratory-based study of driver behavior need to be interpreted with caution in the context of real-world behavior, numerous previous studies have demonstrated that simulator-based experiments on drivers' decision making and attention revealed functional relationships that are consistent with those in real-world driving (e.g. 
Hughes and Cole, 1986;
Miller et al., 2022a,b;
Eisma et al., 2022;
Zgonnikov et al., 2024a)
. For instance, one of the classical studies in the field has concluded that "the absence of a driving task has no substantial effect on attentive behaviour suggesting that the visual information presented by the movie film is sufficient to generate attentive processes characteristic of driving" 
(Hughes and Cole, 1986)
. Similarly, our study replicated the effects well-known from the literature on real-life merging: as the distance or TTA to the overtaking vehicle increased, or time budget in the merging lane decreased, the gap acceptance probability increased 
(Daamen et al., 2010;
Marczak et al., 2013)
. This suggests that the videobased gap acceptance paradigm we developed presented participants with the task that is similar enough to real-life merging to have evoked qualitatively similar behaviors, at least in regard to our measures of interest.


Generalization to real-world driving
Our research questions and main claims in this study concerned functional relationships, i.e., the qualitative effect our manipulations (distance, TTA, time budget) have on decision outcomes and response times, as well as the relationship between these measures with the gaze-based metrics. Hence, our experimental paradigm was designed with the intention to capture these qualitative effects while sacrificing the mundane realism required to accurately reflect these effects quantitatively.
As a result, the quantitative aspects of our results are unlikely to generalize outside of the narrow task we considered. Specifically, the characteristic values (intercepts) of our dependent variables (gap acceptance probability, response times) and magnitude of the effects we found are likely to be affected by all the factors that were excluded or simplified in our study. The differences in perceptual characteristics of the stimuli (e.g., due to the size and shape of the side mirror, narrow field of view, the lack of opportunity to look over one's shoulder), the interactive nature of the task (e.g., accelerating while making the decision vs constant speed of the ego vehicle in our task), the presence of other sources of potentially relevant information (e.g., the rear-view mirror) -all of this means that if one were to measure our variables of interest in the real-world analogue of our task, the effect sizes would very likely be different.
At the same time, based on the above considerations, we believe that the qualitative relationships we found in our study would generalize to real-world driving. In particular, we expect the directions of the following effects in real-world driving to be consistent with our study: the effect of distance, TTA, and time budget on response times - 
Figure 5
, Tables 2 and 3, and the relationship between dwell time on the side mirror and decision outcome - 
Figure 7
, 
Table 4
. Of course, to validate these predictions, in the real-life task the measures of attention and decision-making should be designed differently. For instance, to characterize the amount of time the driver perceives the information about the distance and TTA to the overtaking vehicle in real life, the dwell time on the side mirror would need to be augmented with the duration of glancing over the shoulder and possibly on the rear-view mirror. Similarly, the gap acceptance decision (as well as its timing) is more difficult to define in real life, as it could involve, e.g., gaps that were accepted but then aborted due to reassessment of the situation. Still, based on the results of our study we predict that if one were to measure these quantities taking into account the complexities of real-life merging, the relationships between them would be qualitatively similar to our findings. The necessary next step is then to validate our qualitative insights in interactive simulated driving and then in the real-world merging.
More practically, our statistical models cannot be directly used for applications in designing driving automation and driver assistance systems due to the fundamental differences between our task and real driving. Instead, our contribution to the design of such systems lies in the increased understanding of the relationship between gaze behavior and decision making. Specifically, the very knowledge about, e.g., the association between the duration of glances in the side view mirror and the decision making outcome (even in a simplified task like ours) could guide the initial steps in designing systems such as automated pre-emptive braking based on driver attention. Of course, if one were to directly implement, e.g., a statistical model quantifying the association between gaze and gap acceptance into the design of such a system, such a model would first need to be calibrated on the data collected in the circumstances directly capturing the context of operation of the system.


Other limitations
Besides the general considerations related to simplifications of our video-based task, an important limitation of our experimental setup is the lack of control over participants' gaze behavior in the beginning of the trial. The fixation cross was displayed in between the trials for 0.3 s; although we instructed participants to look at the cross, several participants still adopted a strategy of ignoring the cross and gazing at the mirror area of interest in between the trials. This behavior was characterized also by large values of relative dwell time on the mirror, potentially affecting our interpretation of the main findings. In particular, this could have led to differences in probability of gap acceptance for different dwell times 
(Figure 7)
 if the same participants who adopted this strategy also happened to show increased tendency to accept gaps. However, based on 
Figure 9
, this was not the case, which indicates that the relationship between relative dwell time on the mirror and decision outcome is unlikely to result from individual differences between participants. Replicating our experiment with gaze-contingent fixation cross in between the trials can help future studies avoid this potential pitfall.
Our main measures of attention and decision making (eye movements, response times, and decision outcomes) are not independent from each other, and are known to interact in a non-linear way even in less dynamic tasks 
(Orquin and Mueller Loose, 2013)
. Therefore, any interpretation of our results is bound be limited to statistical associations rather than causal relationships. Next steps in interpreting our results should necessarily involve modeling cognitive processes underlying the gap acceptance task during merging. This can allow one to test alternative process-level explanations of the observed associations, providing a means of interpreting the data in light of competing theories of cognition. We believe that evidence accumulation models in particular would be useful here, as such models have already been used in modeling human behavior in traffic 
(Pekkanen et al., 2022;
Zgonnikov et al., 2024a,b;
Mohammad et al., 2023
Mohammad et al., , 2024
Markkula et al., 2023;
Bontje and Zgonnikov, 2024)
 and also naturally lend themselves to interactions between attention and decisionmaking 
(Krajbich et al., 2010;
Thomas et al., 2019)
.


Conclusion
Overall, our study bridges applied studies on driver behavior and fundamental research on the interplay between attention and decision making. We highlighted that gap acceptance during merging is a dynamic process (rather than an instantaneous decision) which can play out differently depending on where a driver looks at; this in turn suggests that duration of glancing at the side mirror could impact the outcome of the merging decision. We believe these findings can help prevent merging-related accidents and aid the design of advanced driver assistance systems.
