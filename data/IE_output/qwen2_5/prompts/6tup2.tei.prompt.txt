You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Pain is a multisensory experience and a homeostatic emotion, prompting behavioural change when equilibrium is disrupted 
[16]
. Acute pain underpinned by nociceptive mechanisms usually signals bodily harm and is typically adaptive, while chronic pain endures long past the initial injury, retaining its unpleasantness and altering decision-making 
[49]
. Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain condition characterised by widespread pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairments 
[62]
 that affects around 2%-8% of the global population, predominantly women 
[52]
. Management of fibromyalgia often involves effortful interventions, such as education and exercise 
[26,
55]
 that have delayed clinical benefit on outcomes such as pain and function. Low adherence to these interventions limits their effectiveness 
[21]
.
Low motivation is typically assumed to drive poor adherence to effortful interventions 
[26]
, but this presumes that motivation is the sole factor driving engagement. Here we are exploring another possibility: that people with fibromyalgia may instead have altered decision-making related to the effort or delay required before receiving the reward. Decision-making research has shown that individuals commonly prefer immediate over delayed rewards, termed delay discounting 
[28]
 and choose low-effort rewards over those requiring exertion, termed effort-based discounting 
[61]
. Such tendencies could be heightened in persistent pain conditions leading to negative consequences, such as reduced activity and suboptimal treatment adherence, as well as increased engagement with low value care such as opioids. For example, people with chronic pain who are at higher risk for opioid misuse show a heightened tendency to discount future punishments 
[56]
. Despite this, little is known about the decision-making process in people with fibromyalgia, particularly when it comes to cognitive and physical effort, key features required for success with recommended treatment.
In a preliminary study, we gathered data from 654 participants, comparing individuals with chronic pain (including fibromyalgia) and pain-free controls on hypothetical self-reported delay and effort discounting. People with chronic pain devalued delayed rewards more than controls and showed a higher preference for effortless rewards, even after accounting for demographic factors 
[25]
. The current study focuses on fibromyalgia specifically, exploring delay and effort attitudes in fibromyalgia patients and matched pain-free controls. Our study extends past work by using real-world tasks scaled to each individual's exercise capacity (e.g., treadmill walking speed adjusted to personal abilities) to assess whether fibromyalgia patients' attitudes toward effort and delay are adaptive (appropriate to individual capability) or maladaptive (excessive avoidance despite suitable adjustments). Further, we also aimed to test attitudes towards cognitive effort to see if altered decision-making is specific to physical activity or extends to other domains. The validity/replicability of these findings was evaluated in a separate cohort, collected via online survey. Together, such knowledge may inform strategies for tailoring interventions, ultimately improving adherence to beneficial long-term treatments for fibromyalgia.


Methods


Study 1
A cross-sectional study involving one in-person testing session at the Clinical Trials Facility at the University of South Australia (UniSA) was undertaken. All procedures were approved by UniSA's 


Participants
Based on our proof of concept data regarding effort-based discounting 
[25]
, we aimed to recruit a minimum of 64 participants: 32 individuals with fibromyalgia and 32 pain-free controls (with d = 0.72, α = .05, 1-β = 0.8). Inclusion criteria for both groups were as follows: aged 18 years old or older, no health conditions that prevent safe participation in physical activity (e.g., severe heart or lung disease, uncontrolled diabetes), no intellectual disabilities or cognitive impairment (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, dementia, etc.), and fluency in English. Individuals in the fibromyalgia group were required to have received a diagnosis of fibromyalgia from a health professional and to have a consistent medication regime (stable for at least the past month). Individuals in the pain-free control group were required to have no history of any persistent pain condition (pain lasting for 3 consecutive months or longer) and had to not currently be taking any medication for pain. Participants were recruited via social media, web-based advertisements, rheumatologists who treat fibromyalgia locally, our existing participant databases, and, in case of some control participants, were recruited directly from experimenters' family and friends. Participants received a $40 voucher for their time and gained an additional $10 voucher at the end of the study (see Procedures section for details).


Procedures: Questionnaires and tasks
All questionnaires were completed via the Qualtrics platform (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). Volunteers interested in participating first completed an online screening form capturing data on basic demographics (including information on sex, age, and number of years of formal education), medical history, including the Patient Self-report Survey for the Assessment of Fibromyalgia, which provides widespread pain index (WPI; a measure of the extent of widespread pain throughout the body) and symptom severity scale (SSS; a measure of the intensity and impact of various symptoms) 
[14,
62]
, smoking, and hormonal status (female participants only). Additionally, self-reported socioeconomic status (SES) was evaluated using the MacArthur 10-step self-anchoring socio-economic status scale 
[2]
. Participants ranked their social standing on the 10-rung ladder, with those at the top frequently described as those who have the most money, the highest amount of schooling, and the jobs that bring the most respect. Then, during the testing session, participants completed questionnaires assessing their affective state, current pain levels, and trait impulsivity, followed by completion of the effort-based (physical and cognitive effort) and delay discounting tasks.


Primary outcome assessments -Discounting Tasks
Participants completed three decision-making tasks, completed in a counterbalanced order, which assessed their preferences towards delayed and effortful rewards modelled after previous effort-based research 
[6]
. Stimulus presentation and response acquisition of the discounting tasks were performed using MATLAB R2019b (MathWorks) with the Psychophysics Toolbox v.3 
[29]
 running on a Windows 10 enterprise computer. The tasks were created as a key pressing game, where participants decide on the level of effort/delay they are willing to endure to obtain varying rewards.
In each task, participants made a series of choices between a fixed smaller reward (5 raffle tickets) available immediately, without any effort, and a larger reward of varying magnitude (a larger number of tickets), available after a trial-specific delay/effort. The reward magnitude was shown as a number of raffle tickets to be received (range: 10 -58). The required effort/delay level (on which participants based their decision) was indicated as the height of a vertical bar (filled in 20%, 50%, 80%, or 100%, 
Fig 1)
. Participants were informed that at the end of the study (following data collection), the raffle would be organised for a chance of winning an additional prize and that more raffle tickets gave higher chances of winning the prize (beyond the $40 voucher that every participant received for participating in the study). The value of the prize was not specified as an identical monetary prize may hold different value for each individual and thus a specific prize amount may induce divergent motivating properties. In reality, no raffle was conducted and every person received an additional $10 voucher at the end of data collection. Every time a participant chose the larger reward, they had to be prepared to undertake the effort or waiting period to obtain the raffle tickets, yet they understood that the choice would not always mean that they would have to complete the task. They were asked to perform the effortful activity/waiting on 33% of trials only, as determined by a randomisation schedule. Participant's accumulated tickets were summed after each trial, with the total score shown at the end of each task.
Each trial consisted of four phases. In the first phase, participants received Cue 1 (either the effort level/wait duration or the reward magnitude), which was presented on a computer monitor for a brief, jittered delay of 1 to 2 seconds (mean = 1.5 seconds). In phase 2, Cue 2 was provided (the opposite of Cue 1; i.e., reward magnitude or effort level/wait duration) for 1 to 2 seconds (mean = 1.5 seconds). In phase 3 (Decision Prompt), participants were then prompted to make their selection: either accept the Effortful/Delayed Option or reject it in favour of the fixed No Effort/Delay Option, which offered a base reward of 5 raffle tickets. In phase 4 (Choice), the participant's selection was displayed. If the larger reward option was chosen and the algorithm determined the effortful task/delay should be undertaken, participants completed the effort/waiting task. Otherwise, the task proceeded to the next trial. The inter-trial interval lasted between 1 and 4 seconds. Since the non-effortful/no wait option was fixed, it was not presented during the task. The order of Cue presentation (effort/delay first or reward first) and the side of cue presentation (right or left) were counterbalanced across trials. Trials were presented in one of four fixed, randomized orders. See 
Fig   1
 for a graphical depiction of the tasks.
Each task lasted approximately 20 minutes and comprised a total of 44 trials. Participants completed an additional five practice trials before starting each task to familiarize themselves with the procedures and ensure the instructions were clear.


Physical Effort Discounting Task (PEDT):
The experimental task was designed to independently assess the behavioural responses to two dimensions of a cost/benefit decision: the effort required (exercising on a treadmill) and the magnitude of the reward. Treadmill walking/jogging was chosen as the physical effort task instead of repeated button pressing 
[57]
 or grip hold 
[24]
 tasks, because this effort type holds greater ecological validity for people with fibromyalgia, who are often encouraged to engage in aerobic exercise as a part of their treatment 
[55]
.
Prior to formal assessment of PEDT, participants underwent a standardized procedure to match perceived exercise intensities to their unique, individual physical exercise capability. Participants rated their perceived level of effort while walking/jogging on a treadmill using Borg's rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale 
[9]
 to four effort levels. RPE accurately reflects physiological responses during exercise like heart rate, breathing rate, sweating, and muscle exertion 
[47]
. The RPE scale ranges from 6 to 20, indicating how hard an activity feels based on these physical signs. It has been validated against heart rate 
[3]
 and found reliable for rating exertion 
[32]
. Participants received standardized instructions and were told to consider their overall whole-body exertion while determining effort levels. For this study, the four effort levels selected for testing within the task, included:
• 9 = 'really easy' exercise which equals walking at a comfortable pace without much effort;
• 11 = 'fairly easy' exercise at which participants can still speak easily while exercising;
• 13 = 'somewhat hard' exercise when participants may experience difficulty speaking while exercising with noticeable breathing;
• 15 = 'hard' exercise, at which participants start to breathe hard. For the PEDT, the required effort level was visually indicated to participants as the height of a vertical bar (20%, 50%, 80%, or 100% indicating the Borge's 9, 11, 13, and 15 perceived effort levels, respectively). The task was performed while participants were standing on the treadmill. The task was self-paced and participants were offered breaks throughout. Participants responded with a two-button response keypad (Motospeed K2 USB Wired Keypad) attached to the treadmill. When participants chose an effortful option and when the algorithm indicated that they had to physically undertake the effortful task, the researcher set the treadmill speed and had the participant walk/jog for 30 seconds.


Cognitive Effort Discounting Task (CEDT):
In this task, the effort option independently varied in the cognitive effort required (performing an N-back task) and in the reward magnitude. There were four levels of effort: 0, 1, 2, and 3-back tasks represented by the height of a vertical bar (20%, 50%, 80%, and 100%, respectively). In the N-Back task, participants were presented with a sequence of letters, appearing sequentially, one at the time in the centre of the computer screen. For the 0-back task, they were required to press the spacebar each time the letter 'X' appeared on the screen. For 1, 2, and 3-back tasks, they were required to decide, by pressing the spacebar, if the current letter was the same as the one presented N letters ago (1, 2, or 3, respectively). Thus, the higher the number, the more effortful the task. It was explicitly stated that the 3-back task is purposely very challenging and participants should not feel discouraged if they find it difficult.
Participants completed five practice trials providing an opportunity to try all effort levels. To ensure participants focused on the task at hand, they were informed that when the effortful option is selected, they have to complete the task with a certain accuracy to receive the raffle tickets for the given trial. The required accuracy was set at 80%. The task was organised into two blocks of 22 trials each, with a self-paced break in between.


Delay Discounting Task (DDT):
In this task, the delayed option varied in wait time needed 
(12, 30, 48, 60s)
 to collect raffle tickets.
Upon choosing the larger delayed reward, participants had a 33% chance of actually needing to wait for the specified duration to obtain their raffle tickets. Participants were informed that the task assessed patience and no talking or distracting themselves with other activities was permitted.


Additional outcomes Pain
Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI), Part A, 
[38]
 identifies key symptoms associated with increased sensitivity of the central nervous system, and quantifies the degree of these symptoms 
[1]
. The Inventory consists of 25 statements related to current health symptoms. Each of these items is measured on a 5-point temporal Likert scale, ranging from never (0) to always 
(4)
. A cumulative score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores associated with a higher degree of symptomatology. CSI Current pain intensity was assessed using an 11-point Visual Rating Scale 
[46]
. The scale was anchored from "0, no pain at all" to "10, worst pain possible". Ratings were completed twice: directly before completion of the tasks and at the very end of the study.


Affective State
Positive Affect/Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) 
[59]
 was completed to capture current emotional state before completion of the discounting tasks. PANAS is a 20-item measure of self-reported positive (PA), and negative affect (NA) experienced at the present moment. PANAS is characterised by high reliability (Cronbach's α ≥ 0.084) and high convergent validity 
[17]
. 
[34]
 is a self-report scale designed to measure the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. The three scales of the DASS have been shown to have high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha ≥ 0.87) 
[5]
.


Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS)


Impulsivity
The Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS) 
[42]
 was used to assess general impulsivity levels. The scale consists of 30 items, broken into three subfactors: (in)attention (the (in)ability to focus on the tasks at hand and cognitive instability); motor (acting on the spur of the moment and perseverance); and non-planning ("self-control" and cognitive complexity) impulsivity. Responses are rated on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = rarely/never to 4 = almost always/always. The internal consistency is high (Cronbach's α ≥ 0.79) 
[42]
 and the BIS subscales are highly correlated with similar self-report measures, suggesting high convergent validity 
[53]
.


Data analyses
Normality of data was assessed by visual inspection.


Questionnaire data
To examine group differences in demographic variables, questionnaires, pain rating and walking on treadmill speed by RPE categories, we used independent samples t-tests, 
2
 , or repeated measures ANOVA (rmANOVA) tests, as appropriate. The analyses were performed in JASP 0.16.1.


Discounting Tasks Analyses
First, to ensure participants in both groups were equally engaged in the tasks and attention checks, we compared the mean reaction times (RTs) and the proportion of completed trials (i.e., when responses were made) between groups using t-tests. Similarly, pain intensity levels at the start and end of the testing session were compared using a repeated measures ANOVA (rmANOVA) to understand if the tasks heightened pain and if this differed between groups. For PEDT, we also compared the speed of walking at each RPEs between the groups with rmANOVA.
For the primary analysis of between group differences in task performance, we investigated the choice behaviour with trial-by-trial analysis of selected options using generalised linear mixed models (GLMM), as the outcome was binary (larger reward selected = 1, smaller reward selected = 0). We included the reward magnitude of the effortful/delayed option, effort/delay level, and group, as well as their interactions as fixed factors. The trial number was used as a covariate to control for possible fatigue in the task. We also included the intercept per participant as a random effect (accounting for their variability). GLMM were implemented in RStudio Version 2023.12.1 
[48]
, with R v. 3.1.1 
[45]
.
Package 'lme4' was used for modelling purposes 
[7]
. Comparisons and visualisation were made using the 'emmeans' 
[33]
 and the 'ggplot2' packages 
[22]
.
Additionally, to test whether any demographic, trait impulsivity, or affective state variables were related to task performance, we computed Spearman's correlation coefficients between the proportion of larger effortful/delayed options chosen and variables of interest were completed. The analyses were performed in JASP 0.16.1. 


Study 2 Study Design


Participants
Participants were recruited online via social media and Prolific.com as a part of a larger investigation of the role of persistent pain in decision-making. Participants with persistent pain (lasting three months or longer) and individuals with no history of long-term pain, were recruited for this investigation. For the purpose of the current study, only individuals with the diagnosis of fibromyalgia (i.e., reported receiving this diagnosis from a health professional) and control individuals without persistent pain were included. The participation involved completing a ~25-minute online study, which could have been completed on a computer or a laptop with access to the Internet (no mobile phone completion was allowed).


Procedures
Participants completed an online survey to capture information about their demographics (age, sex, socioeconomic status) and health (e.g., diagnosis and treatment), and affective state. They then completed two online tasks to capture their preferences between different rewards available after delay/effort. The study was conducted via Qualtrics platform (Qualtrics, Provo, UT).


Primary measures
Effort Discounting: We used a version of the effort discounting questionnaire for physical effort 
[40]
, modified to allow for individualisation of effort. Participants first indicated what they would deem a hard effort defined as the amount of activity that would be difficult to perform and would either require them to breathe hard during the activity or would result in significant fatigue following the activity (i.e., equivalent to Borg's rate of perceived exertion level 16 
[9]
). Several examples were provided for participants to choose from (e.g., 'a slow walk (at your own pace) for 1 km' or 'a fast jog for 1 km') and a free text option was available making it possible for participants to indicate their own personal example. Next, the participants were instructed to imagine that they had to perform their chosen activity to receive a reward. For example, for an effortful reward of $80, numerous values for effortless rewards were used (n=30) that ranged in magnitude from $79 to $0. The proportion of effortful choices made served as an index of greater willingness to expend effort for larger rewards (lower effort discounting).
Delay Discounting: The Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ) 
[28]
 was used to evaluate delay discounting. It asks a series of 27 hypothetical forced-choice questions offering a choice between a smaller reward available immediately versus a larger reward at some time in the future, e.g., "Would you prefer to receive $31 today, or to receive $85 in seven days?". The dependent variable is the proportion of larger-delayed choices selected (out of 27 questions). The MCQ has test-retest reliability (correlations) of r = 0.71 across 1 year 
[27]
. Within the MCQ questionnaire, an attention check question was included, whereby one option was clearly advantageous over the other.
Participants who failed the attention check were excluded from the analyses. Depression and anxiety over the past 7 days were assessed using the 4-item PROMIS depression and anxiety subscales 
[12]
, with items scored on a 5-point Likert scale from "Never" (1) to "Always" (5), giving a range of scores from 4 to 20, with higher scores reflecting greater depression/anxiety. The scale shows good internal reliability as well as strong convergent validity in chronic pain populations 
[31]
.


Additional measures


Data analyses
To examine group differences in demographic variables and questionnaires, we used independent samples t-tests or 2 , as appropriate. Next, linear regressions were completed to determine if group status (Fibromyalgia vs Control) was significantly associated with performance on the discounting measures (EDQ and MCQ, separately), while controlling for the effects of other demographic and trait variables. The analyses were performed in JASP 0.16.1.


Results


Study 1
A total of 157 individuals completed the pre-screening/expression of interest form; of these, 60 individuals with fibromyalgia were potentially eligible to participate. Of the 60, 22 were unable to be contacted or did not respond to messages or phone calls, 11 were ineligible upon further review (e.g., were not cleared for exercise, fibromyalgia was not the primary diagnosis) or were unable to attend an in-person testing appointment (i.e., lived outside of South Australia). Of the 27 individuals with fibromyalgia who were invited to participate, 5 either did not attend the scheduled appointment or withdrew prior to study commencement. Of the 22 individuals with fibromyalgia who attended the testing appointment, 1 withdrew during the study (as the study was not what they expected), 1 was excluded due to high distractibility (did not fully complete any of the tasks) and 1 participant was missing task data due to technical issues (rebooked but never returned to complete the study), yielding a final number of 19 individuals in the fibromyalgia group. Participants in the fibromyalgia group were on average diagnosed 11.8 ± 10.6 years prior to the study (range 0.5 -35 years), however, they reported much longer periods with fibromyalgia symptoms (20.1 ± 13.5 range:
3 -40 years). The median WPI was 11 (out of 19; see S. 
Fig 1 for details)
, range 6-19 and SSS score was 4 (out of 12 possible), range 2-8.
A total of 42 pain-free controls were identified who met the initial criteria; of these, three could not be contacted, eighteen could not be matched to the fibromyalgia group due to age (too young) or sex (male). Of the 21 participants invited to participate, one did not attend the appointment (reason unknown) and another could not make it to the appointment, yielding the final number of participants in the control group of 19.


Demographics and group differences
Groups did not differ significantly in age or sex distribution (see 
Table 1
 for details), there were also no differences in hormonal status or proportion of smokers. There were significant between group differences in SES (fibromyalgia < controls), years of formal education completed (fibromyalgia < controls), PANAS negative affect and DASS scores as well as pain vigilance and central sensitization (fibromyalgia > controls). More individuals with fibromyalgia also reported having more medical diagnoses of psychiatric, neurological, abdominal conditions and than controls. 


95% CI for Mean


Pain intensity check (across the session)
A rmANOVA, evaluating pain intensity ratings (VAS) at the start and end of the testing session, revealed a main effect of group, with the fibromyalgia group (M = 4.54, SE = 0.28) reporting higher pain levels than the control group (M = 0.32, SE = 0.28; F(1, 36) = 116.74, p < .001, η 2 = 0.75). There was no significant main effect of time (F(1, 36) = 11.82, p = .694, η 2 = 0.00), and no interaction (F(1, 36) = 2.95, p = .095, η 2 = 0.001), which suggests that pain was not exacerbated by the tasks 
(Fig 2)
. 


Attention checks and tasks engagement
There were no differences in the number of completed trials (with responses) between the fibromyalgia group and the control group for any of the delay or effort discounting tasks (see S. 
Table   1
 in the supplementary materials for details). This suggests that all participants were paying attention throughout the experiment. Moreover, the mean choice RTs during the tasks did not differ between the groups (see S. 
Table 2
 in the supplementary materials for details). Together these results indicate that participants were paying attention throughout the tasks and the there was equal engagement between groups in the tasks, respectively.


Physical Effort Discounting Task
One participant in the fibromyalgia group was unable to complete the task, as even the lowest speed on the treadmill (2 km/h) was too difficult; therefore, data from 37 individuals were analysed for this task.
PEDT with the group x RPE interaction approaching significance (Greenhouse-Geisser correction applied: F(1.45, 50.80) = 3.41, p = .055, η 2 = 0.01; 
Figure 3
). This suggests that participants adjusted the speed levels as expected: the higher the effort level, the higher the speed on the treadmill. For people with fibromyalgia higher speed levels trended towards being perceived as more effortful, and they were adjusting the speed levels less steeply than the control group. Primary analysis PEDT: The GLMM looking at trial-by-trial choice behaviour, revealed an effect of effort level, effortful reward, group, as well as effort by reward interaction (at higher effort levels), and crucially, effort level by reward by group interaction, indicating that for higher effort levels (RPE 13 and 15), the fibromyalgia group needed higher reward to choose the effortful outcome, compared with the control group. These findings are reported in 
Table 3
 and 
Figure 4
.  
Table 3
. Results of the GLMM analysis in the PEDT task. 


Cognitive Effort Discounting Task
Primary analysis: The GLMM revealed an effect of effort level, reward, as well as trial. Participants were more likely to choose effortful outcomes as the rewards increased and as effort levels decreased. However, there was no difference between groups. The main effect of the trial indicates that participants were less likely to choose effortful rewards as the task progressed. No other significant effects or interactions were found (see 
Table 4
 and 
Figure 4
 
Table 4
. Results of the GLMM analysis in the CEDT task. 


Delay Discounting Task
One participant in the control group did not complete the DDT due to the longer-than-usual length of the study and the participant's increasing fatigue; therefore, data from 37 individuals were analysed for this task.
DD task primary analysis: The GLMM revealed an effect of delayed reward and trial as well as group by reward interaction, whereby with higher values of delayed rewards, groups showed comparable behaviour. However, at lower reward values, the fibromyalgia group was more likely to choose the delayed outcomes than control, suggesting being more motivated by rewards. The main effect of the trial indicates that participants were less likely to choose delayed rewards as the task progressed. No other significant effects or interactions were found (see 
Table 5
 and  0.659 / 0.887 
Table 5
. Results of the GLMM analysis in the DDT task. 


Sensitivity Analysis
To explore whether the findings were driven by participants who do not discount (i.e., always select the effortful/delayed option), sensitivity analyses (of the primary analysis) were undertaken excluding all such participants. The findings were unchanged (see supplementary materials for details).


Additional analyses
There were no significant associations between task performance and the demographic variables (including SES, education, age, DASS, or BIS), suggesting that these variables were unrelated to task performance and thus should not explain any potential group differences in decision-making 
(Table   6
). However, we found a significant relationship between proportion of effortful choices in PEDT and negative affect, CSI score, and PVAQ score, indicating that experiencing more negative affect, higher central pain sensitization, vigilance and awareness is related to fewer effortful decisions in the PEDT task. No such relationship was found for the CEDT or DDT. 


Variable


Study 2
A total of 688 participants completed the online survey of which 134 were ineligible (e.g., not fluent in English, reported cognitive impairment, or had long-term pain in the past, but not anymore), 61
did not fully complete the survey, 13 failed the attention check, and one individual was excluded following survey completion as they indicated no persistent pain condition but reported high acute pain rating of 6 out of 10. In the remaining group, 43 had fibromyalgia, and 168 were assigned as controls. As the groups differed in sex distribution and SES, participants from the control group were matched by sex and SES in R using package 'ccoptimalmatch' 
[60]
, leaving 182 individuals in the final analysis (43 with fibromyalgia and 139 matched controls).
Of the 43 participants with fibromyalgia and the 139 controls, there were no significant group differences in age, sex/gender distribution, SES, or education (see 
Table 7
 for details), however, groups differed on a number of pain and affective state measures. As expected, compared to controls, the fibromyalgia group showed higher rating of pain-related items, higher scores on anxiety and depression measures, lower levels of positive affect and higher levels of negative affect. EDQ: The linear regression model was statistically significant, F(9, 172) = 2.47, p = .011, R² = 0.12.


Control
Grouping status was the only variable significantly predicting choices in effort discounting questionnaire (p < .001), whereby having fibromyalgia predicted less likelihood of choosing larger effortful rewards (see 
Table 8
 for details).
MCQ: The linear regression model was statistically significant, F(9, 172) = 2.27, p = .020, R² = 0.11.
Education was the only variable significantly predicting choices in effort discounting questionnaire (p = .001), whereby receiving more years of education predicted choosing larger delayed outcomes more often (see 
Table 8
 for details).  


95% CI


Discussion
Here we examined effort-based decision-making, across physical and cognitive tasks, as well as delay-based decision-making in people with fibromyalgia. We found that participants with fibromyalgia were significantly less likely to choose effortful tasks than pain-free controls when the effort level was high, even when effort level was individualised to the person. However, these findings were specific to physical effort discounting, with no differences in cognitive effort discounting found between groups, thus challenging the low motivation hypothesis in fibromyalgia 
[26]
. Indeed, we found that people with fibromyalgia were more likely to choose delayed outcomes at low reward values, compared to people without pain indicating heightened motivation toward reward (in certain, potentially 'attainable' situations). Importantly, in an online study we conceptually replicated findings of altered physical-effort discounting in fibromyalgia, using a hypothetical questionnaire with effort individualised to the participant.
Our findings provide new evidence that physical effort discounting in chronic pain, specifically fibromyalgia, is not driven by between group differences in the relative difficulty of the task. That is, our previous work has shown differences in effort-based discounting between those with chronic pain and those without, but the task (i.e., effort level) was identical between groups 
[25]
. Such task set-ups negate the fact that the relative effort for someone in pain to complete a task is typically greater than the effort required from someone without pain.
Our findings thus suggest the presence of a physical-activity specific cognitive bias in people with fibromyalgia. Specifically, increased physical effort discounting (at high effort levels) but not cognitive effort discounting in people with fibromyalgia provides evidence against a generalised decrease in motivation, as was suggested previously 
[26]
. In fact, for delayed discounting, behaviourally (Study 1), people with fibromyalgia showed higher willingness to wait for potential rewards (at lower rewards values) than those without pain. Such findings actually support heightened motivation for potential rewards (the win in our raffle was not certain) or the effect of short delays (in magnitude of seconds). Increased willingness to wait for potential rewards is an important 'real behaviour'-driven finding, as it involved actually waiting for rewards, unlike many hypothetical, questionnaire-based studies. Although the literature supports the use of hypothetical rewards because they are discounted similarly to real rewards across both delay 
[35]
 and effort 
[36]
, previous research has also indicated that hypothetical questionnaire-based measures and task-based measures of point-rewards in exchange of waiting for short durations (< 10s), do not correlate with each other and are not analogous 
[11]
. Indeed, in purely hypothetical situations (i.e., our Study 2), we found no significant differences between people with fibromyalgia and pain-free controls in delay discounting.
Hypersensitivity to reward has previously been reported in people with fibromyalgia 
[58]
, and has been postulated as being a compensatory response for the aversiveness of chronic pain. In support of such a suggestion, there is evidence of altered corticostriatal processing of reward anticipation and in response to decisions outcomes in people with fibromyalgia 
[37,
41]
. However, such findings may also be more context specific. In our pilot study, one of the participants with fibromyalgia suggested that being able to earn money was a boost to self-esteem. That is, given that many people with fibromyalgia have to forgo work because of the unpredictable nature of the disorder, being presented with an opportunity that might both be helpful to people with fibromyalgia in the long run and achievable for which they are rewarded is a positive experience. Although in Study 1 fibromyalgia group reported lower SES, we do not believe this is driving the results as we found no correlation between SES and responses in any of the tasks.
These results extend our previous findings 
[25]
, which used a hypothetical self-report questionnaire and showed that having chronic pain, of any type, is associated with altered discounting decisions.
The results predicted the tendency to devalue greater delayed and effortful rewards, even when controlling for other demographic and/or personality variables. In the present study, focusing on individuals with fibromyalgia, a chronic nociplastic pain condition, we confirmed altered decision-making in terms of physical effort. This shows the importance of differentiating between distinct types of pain and between cognitive and physical effort. Yet, we found different findings regarding delayed discounting: measured with the hypothetical questionnaire, individuals with chronic pain were less willing to wait for larger rewards, while in our behavioural paradigm, we saw a group by reward interaction, whereby at low reward values, people with fibromyalgia were more willing to wait for larger rewards than controls, with no differences at higher reward values. These discrepancies are likely related to a broad pain population studied in our proof-of-concept study 
[25]
, hypothetical decisions in the questionnaire (which involved no waiting and no rewards), or the presence of short durations (in the magnitude of seconds not days, as in questionnaire measures). In our replication study (Study 2), we found no overall group differences in delay discounting between fibromyalgia and pain-free controls, suggesting that the differences might be mainly due to the subgroup of pain population studied.
The present findings that use an ecologically valid task (people have to expend cognitive and physical effort and/or physically wait for a reward) and for which effort is individualised to the participant, provide support for a hypothesis that altered decision making in people with fibromyalgia may be over-protective. In previous tasks where effort is not individualised to the person, differences in effort preferences may reflect appropriate attitudinal shifts in people with pain because the task is, indeed, too difficult (or more difficult than for someone without pain). Here we chose exercise levels that were moderate (a max of 15 on the RPE scale) and scaled to the individual, increasing the possibility that altered effort preferences may be protective beyond that which is required (over-protective). Over-protective attitudes towards effort may be a useful target of education, both to inform expectations about timelines, but also to potentially provide context as to why exercise (and its delayed benefits) may feel so difficult. However, more work is needed. Of those with fibromyalgia who participated in this study, six reported increased levels of pain and/or fatigue in the day following, which suggests that delayed symptoms may also be relevant to consider and may suggest that changes in effort attitudes may still reflect adaptive shifts.
Limitations. For ethical reasons, all recruitment materials included full information about the studies, including the physical effort task in Study 1. This may have discouraged individuals, especially those with fibromyalgia, who struggle with physical activity or find it particularly painful or fatigue-inducing, from participating. Consequently, our sample might be biased towards higher-functioning individuals. Another limitation is the sample size. Recruitment was challenging, not only for the fibromyalgia group but also for finding matched controls. Due to funding-related time constraints and after exhausting all recruitment sources, we had to discontinue recruitment resulting in a smaller sample size than initially anticipated (goal: 32 individuals per group). Yet, the analysis remains robust due to the use of the GLMM. This approach allows us to account for individual trial-level data (44 trials per participant for each of the tasks), rather than relying on aggregated data. The strength of the GLMM lies in its ability to model trial-by-trial variability while accounting for random effects at the participant level, which improves the precision of estimates even with smaller sample sizes 
[8]
. Additionally, we provide conceptual replication of our findings with the online survey in Study 2.
Conclusions and future directions. The behavioural findings provide evidence against a generalised motivational deficit in effort allocation in response to different reward magnitudes. Instead, we found specific, physical-activity-related changes in effort-based discounting, as well as early evidence for hypersensitivity to rewards during tasks involving delay.
These results open a unique opportunity to address this cognitive bias towards physical effort in the clinical setting. We see two potential pathways by which this could be achieved. First, Episodic Future Thinking (EFT) is the act of projecting oneself into the future and vividly imagining possible future events 
[50]
. EFT is related to adaptive behaviours, including far-sighted decision-making and emotion regulation 
[10,
50,
51]
. EFT has been shown to reduce the rate of delay discounting both in the lab setting as well as in the real world, in general as well as in clinical populations, e.g. 
[13,
15,
18,
19,
54,
63]
. These effects are driven by modulation of neural decision-making and EFT networks: EFT increases the activity of the parietal and prefrontal brain regions 
[44]
. Although EFT was found not to affect effort-based discounting in the hypothetical, questionnaire-based task in the general population 
[43]
, future research should test whether imagining oneself in the future being more able and experiencing less pain could be more successful at influencing effort discounting using real effort in pain populations. Second, encouraging treatment engagement should consider utilising the hypersensitivity to rewards experienced by people with fibromyalgia. Many current fitness apps are already using such strategies -often they provide points, achievement badges, and involve an option for competition with other users -and these are sufficient to promote exercise engagement 
[23,
30]
. Ultimately working hand-in-hand with people with fibromyalgia is needed to understand the perceived relevance or benefit of such possibilities, ideally creating any proposed treatment program collaboratively.

Once familiarized with the scale, participants walked on the treadmill, starting at a speed of 2 km/h and an incline of 0, and then adjusted the speed (increasing in increments of 0.1 km/hr) of the treadmill to attain the four RPE levels. Participants walked for 30 seconds at each level. Participants could manually adjust the speed indicator themselves or the researcher adjusted the speed level based on participant's verbal instructions. Treadmill incline remained consistent. To encourage estimates based on bodily feelings, the speed indicator on the treadmill was hidden from view of the participants. Each participant's individualised speed at each RPE level was recorded and used for formal testing.


demonstrates strong psychometric properties (test-retest reliability = 0.82; Cronbach's alpha = 0.88) in a normative population. The pain vigilance and awareness questionnaire (PVAQ) [39] indexes attention to pain. The PVAQ consists of 16 items. Respondents are asked to consider their behaviour over the last two weeks and to indicate how frequently, on a six-point scale from zero (never) to five (always), each item is a true description of their behaviour. The PVAQ shows good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86) and adequate test-retest reliability (r = 0.80).


A cross-sectional online survey was undertaken. Procedures were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of the University of South Australia (Ethics Protocol 205969) as required by the Australian government research requirements, specified in the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007 -updated 2018).


Pain
Current pain intensity was rated using an 11-point Visual Rating Scale
[46]
, as described above.PROMIS Pain Interference instrument Short Form 6b V1.0 [4] is a 5-point scale measuring the self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of a person's life and the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities over a 7-day recall period. The instrument shows excellent internal consistency, high test-retest reliability, and strong construct validity[20]. The Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire (PVAQ) [39] as described above was used to assess attention to pain. Affective state PANAS [59], as described above, was completed to capture participants' current emotional state.
