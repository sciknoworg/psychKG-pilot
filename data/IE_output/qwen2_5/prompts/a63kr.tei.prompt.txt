You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Figures 2a, b) and give a "No" decision otherwise. This sort of decision is called a "Type-1" decision as it refers to the objective states of the external world, <Target> or <Nontarget> 
(Clarke et al., 1959;
Galvin et al., 2003)
. The unidimensional SDT further describes the confidence rating behavior. Figures 2a and 2b illustrate three confidence criteria (dotted lines) on either side of the Type-1 criterion (solid line), allowing for four levels of confidence associated 12 ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE simulations. We set σ 2 Target (= σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget) at 1, 2, and 3, in combination with the bidimensional correlation coefficient (ρ) of -0.5, 0, and 0.5. Under each variance-covariance structure, we manipulated μTarget from 0.25 to 2.5 in the step of 0.25 to systematically evaluate the relationship between Type-1 and Type-2 performances, which resulted in a total of 90 conditions. 
5
 We sampled 100,000 observations from bivariate Gaussian distributions in each condition, and evaluated the performance of three different SDT-grounded observers.
On each trial, observers receive a pair of observation strengths, x = (x1, x2), either from a bidimensional Gaussian distribution of <Target, Nontarget> or <Nontarget, Target>, where x1 and x2 represent the observation strength of S1 and S2 dimensions respectively (Figures 2c-f). A balance of evidence observer represents the most classic and widely used bidimensional SDT model that makes 2AFC and confidence rating based on balance of evidence, x1 -x2 (e.g., 
Macmillan & Creelman, 2005;
Schulman & Mitchell, 1966)
. In accordance with human observers, a response-congruent evidence observer uses balance of evidence, x1 -x2, in Type-1 2AFC, but response-congruent evidence, max(x1, x2), in confidence rating. Accordingly, we see the response-congruent evidence observer as the proxy of human observers in the present paper.
As a reference for comparison, we also portrayed an ideal observer, which has the full knowledge of underlying bidimensional distributions. Upon an observation of a pair of strengths,
x, the ideal observer calculates the likelihood of it having been produced from each of the two bidimensional distributions of <Target, Nontarget> and <Nontarget, Target>. The logarithm of their ratio, log{p(x|<Target, Nontarget>)/p(x|<Nontarget, Target>)}, which quantifies how more likely one against the other external state is to be the cause of the current observation, is used as the decision variable for 2AFC and confidence rating 
(Green & Swets, 1966, p. 66;
Ma, 2010
Ma, , p. 2313
). 
6
 Hereafter, the currently defined ideal observer is to be called "Type-1 ideal observer" as 13 ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE subsequent simulations showed that this observer is optimal in Type-1 accuracy but not necessarily in Type-2 accuracy (see later sections and Footnote 10 for details).
The full distributional knowledge of the Type-1 ideal observer distinguishes it from the balance of evidence and response-congruent evidence observers, which directly base their 2AFC and confidence rating on the weighted observation strengths without knowing the shape of underlying distributions; equal weighting on two observation strengths leads to balance of evidence, while winner-takes-all weighting leads to response-congruent evidence.
In 2AFC, we set the unbiased Type-1 criterion for these three observers. The balance of evidence and response-congruent evidence observers chose S1 as a target whenever S1 observation strength was stronger than S2 observation strength: i.e., x1 -x2 > 0. 
7
 The Type-1 ideal observer chose S1 as a target whenever log-likelihood ratio favored the external state of <Target, Nontarget> over <Nontarget, 
Target>: i.e., log{p(x|<Target, Nontarget)
/p(x|<Nontarget, Target>)} > 0. Furthermore, we set confidence criteria on the absolute values of balance of evidence, response-congruent evidence, and log-likelihood ratio for each of the three observers to produce 20 levels of confidence. In each simulation condition, we first extracted correct Type-1 responses of each observer, calculated 20-quantiles of the relevant decision variables in those correct trials, and used them as confidence criteria. Then, we applied the same criteria to incorrect trials to obtain complete confidence rating data. 8


Performance Measures
We calculated d´ by the formula, z(hit rate) -z(false alarm rate), where z() is the standard z-transformation. As the unbiased Type-1 criterion is assumed here, the hit rate is equivalent to the proportion correct responses, and the false alarm rate is equivalent to one minus the proportion correct responses. Thus, the currently defined d´ can be understood as the monotonic 14 ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE transformation of the proportion correct responses, simply representing the observed 2AFC accuracy; for example, d´ of 2.56 corresponds to the proportion correct of 0.9, and d´ of 1.68 corresponds to the proportion correct of 0.8. That is, whatever variance-covariance structures or 2AFC rules are assumed in bidimensional decision space, the current d´ should be understood as standardized mean difference (or signal-to-noise ratio) in unidimensional equal-variance SDT space 
(Figure 2a
). 9
Observers' metacognitive behavior can be summarized in the Type-2 ROC, which contrasts confidence levels on correct trials against those on incorrect trials 
(Clarke et al., 1959;
Galvin et al., 2003;
Maniscalco & Lau, 2012
. 
Figure 3
 shows Type-2 ROC examples of the three observers. The vertical axis refers to the Type-2 hit rate, which is defined as the proportion of high confidence responses assigned to correct Type-1 responses, while the horizontal axis refers to the Type-2 false alarm rate, which is the proportion of high confidence responses assigned to incorrect Type-1 responses. For each different observer, the left most data point is calculated by only considering the highest rating of confidence (confidence level of 20 in the present case) as the indication of high confidence. The point second from the left considers the highest and the second highest confidence ratings (confidence levels of 20 and 19) as the indication of high confidence, and so forth. Therefore, under the current simulation procedure, each observer gives 19 data points in Type-2 ROC space. The region underneath the curve obtained by concatenating (0, 0), (1, 1) and these cumulative data points is called Type-2 area under the curve (Type-2 AUC). The Type-2 AUC becomes larger as confidence ratings better distinguish correct from incorrect Type-1 responses, and thus it is often used as a nonparametric measure of metacognitive sensitivity. Furthermore, under the equal-variance SDT 
(Figure 2a
), a pair of d´ and Type-1 criterion is sufficient to determine observer's cumulative confidence rating ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE behavior in Type-2 ROC space. Therefore, empirically, one can estimate the d´ value that is most consistent with the observed Type-2 ROC with Type-1 criterion appropriately constrained, which is the SDT-grounded metacognitive sensitivity measure, meta-d´ 
(Maniscalco & Lau, 2012
).
The current form of d´ and meta-d´ are directly comparable as both are expressed in the same measurement unit in unidimensional equal-variance SDT space. A typical interpretation of these measures is that d´ and meta-d´ represent the information available for Type-1 and Type-2 decisions in terms of signal-to-noise ratio 
(Fleming & Lau, 2014)
. The ratio of these measures, meta-d´/d´ is defined as metacognitive efficiency; for example, meta-d´/d´ of 0.8 is considered to indicate 0.8 times as much information was available for Type-2 than Type-1 decisions 
(Fleming & Lau, 2014)
. Grounded on their comparability, we plotted meta-d´ against d´ in the following simulation sections. The pattern of meta-d´ = d´ was often considered to represent ideal metacognitive behavior, because this pattern was expected if all the information used in the Type-1 decision is fully used in Type-2 decision 
(Maniscalco & Lau, 2012;
Fleming & Lau, 2014
). In the context of bidimensional SDT, the balance of evidence rule, which achieves this pattern, was believed to be the optimal rule of confidence (e.g., 
Maniscalco et al., 2016)
. 
Figure 4
 represents the simulated d´ versus meta-d´ patterns (the results are also complemented by Type-1 and Type-2 AUCs in 
Figures S1-S3
). Consistent with the abovementioned SDT perspective, d´ constituted the upper bound of meta-d´ under the σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget of 1. The balance of evidence observer provided the equivalent Type-1 and Type-2 sensitivities with the Type-1 ideal observer, while the response-congruent evidence observer showed poorer Type-2 sensitivity than the others. It is tempting to conclude that the response-congruent 16 ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE evidence heuristic, which gives up one out of two sources of information, is inferior to the balance of evidence rule, which makes equal use of those two. However, surprisingly, the response-congruent evidence observer demonstrated higher metacognitive sensitivity than the balance of evidence observer under the σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget of 2 and 3, surpassing the putative ideal pattern of meta-d´ = d´; 
Fleming and Daw (2017)
 termed the pattern of meta-d´ > d´ as hypermetacognitive sensitivity (refer the following sections for its empirical/theoretical implications).


Larger Target Variance Benefits the Response-Congruent Evidence Heuristic
Under the response-congruent evidence rule, meta-d´ almost linearly increases as a function of d´, and σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget modulates the intercept without affecting the slope in the current coordinates. That is, the response-congruent evidence heuristic allows the "head start", providing good metacognitive sensitivity under high Type-1 uncertainty. This can be considered as an advantage of the response-congruent evidence heuristic, as careful metacognitive monitoring should be required when available information is ambiguous and one is highly likely to make mistakes.
There are some cases in which the response-congruent evidence observer showed slightly better Type-2 accuracy than the Type-1 ideal observer, and this pattern was confirmed by the nonparametric AUC measure ( 
Figures S2 and S3
). In these cases, the Type-1 ideal observer showed higher Type-1 accuracy yet lower Type-2 accuracy (i.e., smaller meta-d´/d´) than the response-congruent evidence observer. Roughly speaking, in some trials where the responsecongruent evidence observer makes incorrect Type-1 responses with low confidence, the Type-1 ideal observer gives correct Type-1 responses with low confidence, which leads to this counterintuitive observation. Predictably, if their Type-1 behaviors are matched, the ideal observer provides superior Type-2 accuracy than the response-congruent evidence observer. 10 ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE As just described, the response-congruent evidence observer makes the crucial prediction that larger target variance leads to higher metacognitive accuracy. To our surprise, this counterintuitive pattern has just been reported in 
Rahnev and Fleming (2019)
, which was published while we were revising the present paper for publication. This variance-induced improvement of Type-2 accuracy is hardly explained by normative theoretical perspectives 
(Green & Swets, 1966;
Macmillan & Creelman, 2005)
, and thus is considered compelling evidence for the response-congruent evidence observer model. Interestingly, this heuristic model further predicts the double dissociation of Type-1 and Type-2 accuracies (larger target variance decreases/increases Type-1/Type-2 accuracies), empirical demonstrations of which will contribute additional support for its validity.
The advantage of the response-congruent evidence heuristic may be prominent in the perceptual decision in the natural environment, where very large variance ratio is expected; there are unknown numbers of possible targets, whose feature parameters are variable and unpredictable. Furthermore, in the context of recognition memory, a great extent of encoding variability should exist in the natural environment (e.g., some things are encountered daily, while others are rarely met), leading to considerably large variance ratio of memory strength. Thus, the response-congruent evidence rule can be considered as a heuristic of adaptive advantage, offering fine metacognitive sensitivity as well as computational simplicity in the realistic environment.
The underlying dynamics of the simulation results are schematically illustrated in 
Figure   5
, constructed with μTarget of 0.5, σ 2 Target of 3, and ρ of 0. It is often said that 2AFC tasks are immune to the variance-inequality of target and nontarget observation strengths. Indeed, in the upper right panel, balance of evidence variables derived from the two different external world ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE states are distributed with equal variance, regardless of the unequal variance in the original bidimensional space. These balance of evidence distributions are used for the calculation of Type-1 accuracy for both the balance of evidence and response-congruent evidence observers, resulting in the d´ value of 0.5. The balance of evidence observer further uses these distributions for confidence construction, showing the meta-d´ of 0.5. On the other hand, conditioned on the choice of S1 or S2, the response-congruent evidence observer uses two different dimensions for confidence construction (left and bottom panels). Variance-inequality survives when S1 and S2 choices are separately considered on the response-congruent evidence axes, which delivers the meta-d´ of 1.5.


Figure 6 summarizes contour maps of log-likelihood ratio in bidimensional decision
space. Under the σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget of 1, log-likelihood ratio monotonically increases along the diagonal just as balance of evidence 
(Figures 2c, d
). Thus, the balance of evidence observer perfectly mimics the Type-1 ideal observer, which explains why the balance of evidence rule was sometimes described as an optimal rule of 2AFC and confidence rating 
(Macmillan & Creelman, 2005, p. 169;
Maniscalco et al., 2016;
Miyoshi et al., 2018)
. However, the balance of evidence observer should be recognized as one of heuristic observers, as it does not have the full distributional knowledge to calculate likelihood ratio. Indeed, as σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget becomes larger, the log-likelihood ratio contour takes more complex shapes, becoming increasingly less consistent with the diagonal balance of evidence axis 
(Figures 2c, d
).


Comparison to Extended Theoretical Frameworks
The former section showed that the pattern of meta-d´ > d´ (hyper-metacognitive sensitivity) can be naturally accommodated by the classic SDT framework by considering empirically plausible variance structures. Before the present simulations, however, this pattern ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE was empirically observed to motivate the extension of SDT with extra mechanistic assumptions.
Maniscalco and 
Lau (2012)
 referred to the possibility that the Type-2 system accesses information unavailable to the Type-1 system to achieve the pattern. Interestingly, we showed that the opposite can also achieve this; the Type-2 system can disregard information used by the Type-1 system to achieve hyper-metacognitive sensitivity. Besides, early SDT literature demonstrated that trial-by-trial criterion variability impairs the observer's performance (e.g., 
Wickelgreen, 1968;
Treisman & Williams, 1984)
. Maniscalco and Lau (2012) considered that hyper-metacognitive sensitivity would be expected if the Type-1 criterion setting is noisier than the Type-2 criterion setting. Furthermore, studies have considered post-decisional evidence accumulation as a possible cause of hyper-metacognitive sensitivity 
(Charles, Van Opstal, Marti, & Dehaene, 2013;
Fleming & Daw, 2017;
Moreira et al., 2018;
Navajas et al., 2016;
Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010)
. For example, by extending traditional SDT, 
Fleming and Daw (2017)
 proposed a post-decisional model, in which a Type-2 decision variable is sampled in addition to a Type-1 decision variable, offering further information to achieve the pattern of meta-d´ > d´.
Among these possible mechanisms, the response-congruent evidence observer model has clear advantages. The model is already validated in different decision-making situations 
(Aitchison et al., 2015;
Koizumi et al., 2015;
Maniscalco et al., 2016;
Miyoshi et al., 2018;
Peters, Thesen, et al., 2017;
Samaha et al., 2017;
Zawadzka et al., 2017;
Zylberberg et al., 2012)
, and it naturally predicts hyper-metacognitive sensitivity without adding extra complexity into classic SDT. Furthermore, importantly, the response-congruent evidence observer's behavior is well constrained by variance-covariance parameters, which offers good empirical testability.
Therefore, we have reanalyzed the data of the formerly-published 2AFC recognition memory study 
(Miyoshi et al., 2018)
 and its replication study, the patterns of which were already 20 ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE found to support the response-congruent evidence observer model. 11 Hyper-metacognitive sensitivity was observed in all four experiments included in the data sets, confirming the adaptive advantage of the response-congruent evidence heuristic that cannot be afforded by the balance of evidence confidence rule 
(Table 1)
. Furthermore, given the large sample size of the replication study (N = 52), we evaluated the empirical d´ versus meta-d´ pattern across subjects ( 
Figure 7
). The dashed line shows the linear prediction of the balance of evidence observer (slope = 1, intercept = 0), and the dotted line shows the response-congruent evidence observer's prediction under the σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget of 1.56 and the ρ of 0 (slope = 0.55, intercept = 0.51, estimated from simulated data). The variance ratio of 1.56 was determined according to the wellknown fact that the z-ROC slope around 0.8 has been typically observed in recognition memory experiments 
(Ratcliff et al., 1992;
Ratcliff et al., 1994;
Mickes, Wixted, & Wais, 2007;
Rotello, 2017)
. This value was reported to be rather constant against the strength of encoding, the length of encoding list, and the number of related items in the encoding list, and consistently observed with d´ values > 0.5, similar to the current performance range 
(Ratcliff et al., 1994)
.
We quantified the balance of evidence and response-congruent evidence models' fits to the d´ versus meta-d´ data by using linear regression. We assigned only one free parameter (error term) to the linear models as their slope and intercept were predetermined as mentioned above.
For comparison, we also constructed a data-driven linear model (solid line in 
Figure 7
) with three free parameters (slope, intercept, and error term). Model comparisons corroborated the validity of the response-congruent evidence model, which achieved the most parsimonious description of the data (see AIC and BIC values in 
Figure 7
). Of course, different combinations of mechanisms could simultaneously contribute to the observation of hyper-metacognitive sensitivity in different decision-making situations. Nevertheless, researchers can consider the response-congruent ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE evidence model as a parsimonious solution before adding extra complexity into their explanations.
On a practical note, we emphasize that hyper-metacognitive sensitivity can be explained by the response-congruent evidence heuristic only in bidimensional (multidimensional) decision problems but not in unidimensional problems. Therefore, empirical observations of meta-d´ > d´ in unidimensional Yes/No detection experiments require the other explanatory schemes mentioned above. Here, we further note that the number of external stimuli does not necessarily correspond to the dimensionality of internal decision space. For example, in 
Samaha et al. (2017)
, Left/Right orientation decision for a single grating is well captured by bidimensional SDT, each dimension of which codes internal "leftness" and "rightness" of a single stimulus.
Also, similar modeling assumptions are often made for Left/Right random dot motion decision (e.g., 
Kiani, Cueva, Reppas, & Newsome, 2014;
Resulaj, Kiani, Wolpert, & Shadlen, 2009)
. Researchers can factor in task formats (Yes/No decision, Left/Right decision, multiple-AFC, etc.), physical stimulus features, neurophysiological constraints on observers, and/or empirical evidence from past modeling works to consider underlying dimensionality for different decision problems.


Error Detection
Confidence rating is sometimes discussed together with error detection in decisionmaking 
(Fleming & Daw, 2017;
Kiani et al., 2014;
Resulaj et al., 2009;
van den Berg et al., 2016)
. For example, 
Fleming and Daw (2017)
 proposed the above-mentioned post-decisional model to simultaneously explain hyper-metacognitive sensitivity and online error detection. After the derivation of a Type-1 decision, this model receives further information to provide a Type-2 decision, which allows hyper-metacognitive sensitivity. For making the Type-2 decision, based ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE on the accumulated evidence, the model makes an inverse inference regarding the probability of the Type-1 decision being correct (Bayesian definition of confidence). In the case of 2AFC, estimated probabilities below 0.5 are assumed to indicate error detection.
In the modeling framework of 
Fleming and Daw (2017)
, post-decisional extra information leads to hyper-metacognitive sensitivity and error detection. However, without such modeling assumption, empirical observations of meta-d´ > d´ do not necessarily indicate the manifestation of online error detection. For example, the present response-congruent evidence observer model has the property to accommodate the pattern of meta-d´ > d´, and yet the pattern is not accompanied by online error detection. Different from Fleming and Daw's Bayesian models, the response-congruent evidence observer model heuristically uses internal observation strengths without making the inverse inference about the probability of the decision being correct. That is, the pattern of meta-d´ > d´ is merely enjoyed by the response-congruent evidence observer in consequence of certain variance-covariance structures of internal distributions, which are not known by this heuristic decision-maker. Therefore, the current response-congruent evidence observer cannot achieve online error detection, even though it demonstrates hyper-metacognitive sensitivity in the post-hoc analysis of Type-2 accuracy.
In a 2AFC delayed match-to-sample task, 
Moreira et al. (2018)
 observed hypermetacognitive sensitivity, together with a qualitative pattern that the lowest confidence level was more frequently assigned to incorrect than correct Type-1 decisions. These observations were interpreted as the indication of error detection, because the results would be expected if subjects could identify their erroneous Type-1 decision to declare the lowest confidence level in some proportion of trials. In accordance with 
Fleming and Daw (2017)
, the authors suggested that post-decisional evidence accumulation should have achieved online error detection to deliver the ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE observed results. However, their observations can also be predicted by the current responsecongruent evidence observer model without assuming post-decisional evidence accumulation or online error detection; in 
Figure 5
, the model demonstrates hyper-metacognitive sensitivity, while the response-congruent evidence in the lowest range is more frequently associated with incorrect than correct responses.


Covariance Parameter Affects the Efficiency of Response-Congruent Evidence Heuristic
Next, we focus on the impact of bidimensional correlation on the response-congruent evidence observer's behavior. In 
Figure 4
, ρ generally modulates the slope of the d´ versus meta-d´ line, and slightly affects the intercept under the σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget of 2 and 3. The smaller the correlation coefficient, the steeper the slope becomes. On closer inspection, under fixed values of μTarget and σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget, ρ almost selectively modulates Type-1 accuracy (d´), leaving metacognitive accuracy (absolute value of meta-d´) hardly affected, which underlies the apparent change of the slope. That is, under the response-congruent evidence observer model, bidimensional correlation affects metacognitive efficiency (meta-d´/d´), not metacognitive accuracy (meta-d´).
Graphically speaking, negative (positive) correlation leads to greater (lesser) overlap of the internal bivariate distributions, making it more difficult (easier) to discriminate the external states of <Target, Nontarget> and <Nontarget, Target>. Mathematically, under the balance of evidence rule, d′ and meta-d′ would be 2( − )/ √ 2 + 2 − 2 ; on the balance of evidence axis ( 
Figure 5
, upper right panel), the numerator represents the difference of the means of two distributions, and the denominator represents the standard deviation of these distributions 
(Wixted et al., 2018, p.84)
. ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE Thus, negative (positive) correlation increases (decreases) the denominator value, inviting greater (lesser) overlap of balance of evidence distributions.
Interestingly, the presence of negative correlation and large target variance is detrimental for the balance of evidence rule, but not for the response-congruent evidence confidence rule 
(Figure 4
). Therefore, under such variance-covariance structure, the response-congruentevidence-based metacognitive system can efficiently complement the underperformance of the balance-of-evidence-based Type-1 system. The advantage of this mutual compensation can be seen in Type-1 AUCs, which reflect both Type-1 and Type-2 accuracies ( 
Figure S1)
; under a wide range of conditions, the response-congruent evidence observer shows greater Type-1 AUC than the balance of evidence observer.
As mentioned earlier, lateral inhibition between two sensory channels is assumed to produce negative correlation in bidimensional decision space 
(Ashby, 1989
(Ashby, , 2000
. Therefore, to the extent that various decision-making problems are powered by such antagonistic codes, the response-congruent evidence confidence rule effectively bucks up the Type-1 decision system.
One possible speculation is that the response-congruent evidence heuristic has evolved to serve adaptive advantages under the representational structures typically constructed in the natural environment.


Considerations on Relevant Phenomena
Regardless of variance-covariance structure, the balance of evidence observer always
gives meta-d´ = d´, and the Type-1 ideal observer also shows similar stable trends. Thus, as far as these normative SDT models are concerned (e.g., 
Green & Swets, 1966;
Macmillan & Creelman, 2005)
, the dissociation of objective decision and subjective introspection is hardly brought into 25 ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE consideration. On the other hand, the response-congruent evidence observer sheds new light on this topic from the perspective of internal statistical structure.


Implicit Recognition Memory
Recent recognition memory literature suggested that memory strengths derived from perceptually similar choice alternatives are positively correlated 
(Wixted & Mickes, 2014;
Wixted et al., 2018)
. If this is the case, the response-congruent evidence observer predicts that 2AFC recognition memory for perceptually similar stimulus pairs would involve poor metacognitive efficiency (small meta-d´/d´). We found a phenomenon termed "implicit recognition" to be consistent with this prediction 
(Voss et al., 2008;
Voss & Paller, 2009)
.
Subjects showed highly accurate responses by pure guessing in 2AFC recognition memory tests for perceptually similar kaleidoscope images (such pattern was not observed for Yes/No recognition memory). In their experiments, 2AFC was followed by Remember/Know/Guess metacognitive decision, and the trials assigned with Guess decision (indication of no confidence and no retrieval awareness) showed quite high accuracy in dissociation with the subjects' introspection. This phenomenon was originally attributed to implicit memory processes that specifically operate for highly similar stimulus pairs 
(Jeneson, Kirwan, & Squire, 2010;
Miyoshi & Ashida, 2014;
Voss & Paller, 2010)
. However, without such mechanistic assumptions, this phenomenon can be largely accommodated within the bidimensional SDT framework as the consequence of the response-congruent evidence confidence construction under strong positive correlation.


Blindsight
Restricted lesions to the primary visual cortex (V1) can cause a loss of visual awareness in the contralesional visual field with some residual abilities to react to visual inputs, a ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE phenomenon called blindsight 
(Pöppel et al., 1973;
Weiskrantz, 2004;
Weiskrantz, Warrington, Sanders, & Marshall, 1974)
. Psychophysically, blindsight features key experimental observations in the damaged visual field, including (1) severely impaired Yes/No Type-1 accuracy with rather preserved 2AFC Type-1 accuracy (e.g., 
Azzopardi & Cowey, 1997;
Yoshida & Isa, 2015)
 and 
2
reduced 2AFC Type-2 sensitivity (e.g., 
Persaud et al., 2011)
. The pattern (1) has been substantiated by the findings that observed Yes/No sensitivity was lower than the SDT prediction made from observed 2AFC sensitivity; typically, Yes/No accuracy is expected to be lower than 2AFC accuracy by a factor of 1/√2 (e.g., 
Macmillan & Creelman, 2005)
. However, this prediction implicitly assumes bidimensional independence 
(Wixted et al., 2018, p. 84)
, and the patterns (1) and (2) can be simultaneously captured by the response-congruent evidence observer model if bidimensional positive correlation is incorporated in SDT decision space.
Neurophysiological studies have reported that V1 lesions reduce neural responses in V2, V3, and V4 regions, leaving sensitivity tuning of those neurons somewhat preserved 
(Schmid, Panagiotaropoulos, Augath, Logothetis, & Smirnakis, 2009;
Schmid et al., 2010
Schmid et al., , 2013
Silvanto, 2015)
. Also, unilateral removal of the macaque V1 region is reported to reduce overall responses of V5/MT neurons in the damaged hemisphere, while direction selectivity of those neurons remains preserved; furthermore, importantly, those V5/MT neurons exhibit increased response variability and highly bursty spontaneous activity 
(Azzopardi, Fallah, Gross, & Rodman, 2003;
Rodman, Gross, & Albright, 1989
).
Based on these physiological findings, we first assumed that V1 lesions reduce overall observation strengths for targets and nontargets 
(Figure 8a
; 
Ko & Lau, 2012;
Persaud et al., 2011)
. In addition, considering the increased neural response variability, we further assume that blindsight patients suffer additional trial-by-trial Gaussian noise 
(Figure 8b
) on both S1 and S2 27 ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE dimensions 
(Figure 8c
). As both the dimensions are contaminated with a same noise sample in each trial, resulting bidimensional representations are positively correlated.
For the blindsight group, Yes/No Type-1 accuracy is selectively impaired due to the noise contamination 
(Figure 8d
), while 2AFC Type-1 accuracy is unaffected 
(Figure 8c
). In the case of 2AFC, the detrimental influence of increased variance is counteracted by the benefit from positive correlation. In other words, trial-by-trial contaminating noises are subtracted out due to the balance of evidence 2AFC rule (just as it is the case in paired t tests). Furthermore, the other observation, reduced 2AFC Type-2 sensitivity, is explained by the response congruent evidence confidence construction 
(Figure 4
 and 
Figure 8c
). 12 Unlike the balance-of-evidence-based Type-1 2AFC, the response-congruent-evidence-based confidence construction is impaired by the increased variance yet not benefited by the positive correlation, resulting in poor metacognitive accuracy; here, both σ 2 Target and σ 2 Nontarget are increased by the noise contamination while σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget remains constant.
The present perspective offers parsimonious explanations for the key psychophysical properties of blindsight, although further behavioral/physiological investigations are required to validate our proposed model. One thing to note is that, in recent attempts to simulate blindsightlike behavior with normal observers, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the visual cortex was shown to cause the selective impairment of 2AFC Type-2 sensitivity 
(Peters, Fesi, et al., 2017)
. TMS is considered to disrupt neural activities and add extra noise to internal observation strength distributions 
(Rahnev, Maniscalco, Luber, Lau, & Lisanby, 2011)
.
Therefore, the TMS-induced Type-2 impairment is considered as supporting evidence for the present model, in which trial-by-trial noise contamination performs a critical role in deriving the behavioral features of blindsight. ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE


Practical Notes for Empirical Experiments
Empirical studies on human subjects often aim to evaluate the individual differences in metacognitive accuracy and efficiency (e.g., 
Fleming, Weil, Nagy, Dolan, & Rees, 2010;
McCurdy et al., 2013;
Rouault, McWilliams, Allen, & Fleming, 2018
). As we discussed earlier, the evaluation of subjects' Type-2 specific information gain and loss can be of particular interest for those studies (e.g., 
Fleming & Lau, 2014)
. Formally, the patterns of meta-d´ > d´ and meta-d´ < d´ were considered to indicate Type-2 information gain and loss respectively 
(Maniscalco & Lau, 2012
. However, our 2AFC simulations have demonstrated that these patterns can be turned out from different combinations of decision rules and bidimensional statistical structures 
(Figure 4)
, which poses an obstacle for empirical evaluations of Type-2 specific information gain/loss. Unidimensional Yes/No detection is free from this problem, although, unfortunately, it also has its own limitation; it often violates the equal-variance assumption of classic SDT as we have already discussed above (e.g., 
Swets, 1986a, b)
. Empirical estimation of meta-d´ basically postulates the assumption of equal variance. Otherwise, theoretically, σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget needs to be estimated in a separate task by using different methods than confidence rating, such as manipulations on target/nontarget presentation probabilities and different incentives for Yes/No responses (for details, see 
Maniscalco & Lau, 2012
. Realistically, however, stable estimation of σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget would be difficult at the individual subjects' level, as empirical ROCs constructed with these methods are usually not as smooth as theoretically supposed to be (e.g., 
Kellen et al., 2018;
Macmillan & Creelman, 2005, pp. 71-72)
.
One practical solution for these problems could be to use unidimensional classification tasks, in which a task-relevant feature of stimuli (e.g., line length) is probabilistically defined by ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE the experimenter (e.g., 
Adler & Ma, 2018;
Maddox, 2002)
. In each trial, a stimulus is generated from either of two distributions of equal variance (C1 and C2 in 
Figure 9
), and subjects are required to classify it into C1 or C2. The external stimulus variations of C1 and C2 should be symmetrically aggregated with subject's internal noise 
(Macmillan & Creelman, 2005, pp. 302-303)
, which leads to internal decision variable distributions of equal variance, suitable for the estimation of meta-d´.
Subject-wise estimation of bidimensional correlation would be even more difficult than the variance estimation in unidimensional tasks. In the 2AFC paradigm, the bidimensional correlation's influence on subject's performances would be well mimicked by different combinations of the other parameters as seen in 
Figure 4
. Indeed, the less-identifiability of bidimensional SDT parameters is already acknowledged in the earliest literature 
(Green & Swets, 1966, pp. 64-69;
Torgerson, 1958)
, which explains why there has not been much empirical/theoretical consideration on the variance-covariance effects on 2AFC performances.
Here again, we consider that bidimensional classification tasks would pave the way for studying the matter. Researchers can prescribe the variance-covariance structure of bidimensional stimulus distributions, and frame their research questions based on qualitative predictions of data trends, not quantitative estimations of model parameters; for example, poorer metacognitive efficiency would be expected under bidimensional positive correlation.


Conclusion
The present paper evaluated the response-congruent metacognitive heuristic under different bidimensional variance-covariance structures. Without additional mechanistic assumptions, various dissociations of objective/subjective decisions can be explained as natural consequences of this simple metacognitive algorithm being applied to different internal 30 ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE structures. Of special importance is that the response-congruent evidence heuristic is discovered to achieve hyper-metacognitive sensitivity, according to high Type-1 uncertainty, larger target variance, and bidimensional stochastic correlation. Given its economical efficacy, it is reasonable that our metacognitive system adopts this heuristic as the default confidence construction algorithm 
(Aitchison et al., 2015;
Koizumi et al., 2015;
Maniscalco et al., 2016;
Miyoshi et al., 2018;
Peters, Thesen, et al., 2017;
Samaha et al., 2017;
Zawadzka et al., 2017;
Zylberberg et al., 2012)
. We hope the present work stimulates future empirical/theoretical investigations of metacognition and consciousness from different perspectives than normative decision theories.


ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE Footnotes
1 Studies have conducted model comparisons to demonstrate that the response-congruent evidence confidence rule is favored over the balance of evidence confidence rule. Therefore, empirically, the established evidence does not necessarily exclude the possibility that responseincongruent evidence also makes a small contribution to confidence construction. Besides, mathematically, these two rules are considered two extreme cases in a single unified model, which has a weighting parameter to stipulate the relative contribution of response-congruent (and response-incongruent) evidence. However, empirical estimation of the weighting parameter may be difficult, as this parameter would have complex interactions with the other model parameters (see 
Figure 4
).
2 Studies have paid little attention to the variance parameter especially when using 2AFC, as this paradigm is known to be "proofed" to bidimensional variance-inequality 
(Macmillan & Creelman, 2005, p. 173)
. This point is detailed later in 
Figure 5
.
3 When confidence-rating-based Type-1 ROCs are used to assess the variance ratio, an unsafe assumption must be made that the Yes/No decision and confidence rating are based on the same underlying decision variable (this assumption holds in 
Figures 2a, b)
; for example, no Type-1-or Type-2-specific information gain/loss is allowed 
(Maniscalco & Lau, 2014;
Mueller & Weidemann, 2008)
. Here, this concern is mitigated as the different ROC construction methods have produced rather consistent results. ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE parameter is constant across the different sessions (e.g., 
Smith & Duncan, 2004)
. We simply followed this convention here (similar approaches can be seen in 
Jang et al., 2009
Jang et al., , 2011
.

 We did not include the condition of μTarget = 0, because such condition is unlikely to enjoy the variance structure of σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget > 1. Arguably, the absence of target evidence (μTarget = μNonarget = 0) indicates that task-relevant features of targets are identical to those of nontargets (e.g., targets are completely absent in visual detection experiments, or targets are never encoded in recognition memory experiments), which should results in the σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget of 1. In line with this, 
Ratcliff et al. (1994)
 reported σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget values around 1 with nearzero d´ and those around 1.56 with d´ > 0.5. See 
Supplementary Material (Figures S4-S7
) for further discussion. ECONOMICAL 
CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE Maniscalco et al., 2016)
. On the other hand, d´ can also be defined as a mean target observation strength parameter under bidimensional SDT 
(Macmillan & Creelman, 2005, p. 169)
, which is manipulated as an independent variable in our simulation (i.e., μTarget). If this definition is employed, a single value of d´ shows one-to-many correspondence to Type-1 and Type-2 accuracies depending on observer's decision rules and variance-covariance structures ( 
Figures   S1-S3)
. Obviously, the present study requires the former definition of d´, a post-hoc Type-1 performance measure, directly comparable to meta-d´ 
(Maniscalco et al., 2012
(Maniscalco et al., , 2014
).
10 As seen in 
Figure 5
, under bidimensional unequal variance, the target dimension is more likely to produce large values as well as very small values than the nontarget dimension 
(Macmillan & Creelman, 2005, pp. 66-69)
, which is reflected as nonmonotonic trends of loglikelihood ratio functions in 
Figure 6
. Therefore, the Type-1 ideal observer's Type-1 behavior is different than the other observers, and in some trials, it can correctly choose S1 (S2) even on the face of x2 > x1 (x1 > x2), showing greater Type-1 accuracy than the others 
(Figure 4
). However, in some simulation conditions, those extra correct responses are frequently assigned with low confidence by the Type-1 ideal observer, which is detrimental in terms of metacognitive accuracy. As expected from this, supplementary simulations showed that the Type-1 ideal observer, if modified to use balance of evidence in Type-1 decision, always shows higher metacognitive accuracy than the other observers ( 
Figures S8-S11
). These series of simulations confirmed that the very classic likelihood ratio ideal observer 
(Green & Swets, 1966, p. 66;
Ma, 2010
Ma, , p. 2313
 is not necessarily optimal in terms of metacognitive accuracy under bidimensional unequal variance. Note that, provided with appropriate prior probabilities, the Type-1 ideal observer gives Bayesian confidence as the true posterior probability of the decision 45 ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE being correct 
(Adler & Ma, 2018;

(b, c) The lesions add noise to S1 and S2 dimensions on a trial-by-trial basis, causing bidimensional positive correlation. The larger variance the noise distribution has, the stronger the positive correlation becomes, leading to more severely impaired Type-2 sensitivity for 2AFC. Type-1 sensitivity in 2AFC is preserved regardless of the noise contamination.

The variance ratio (σ 2 Target/σ 2 Nontarget) is difficult to be estimated in the 2AFC paradigm, which generally offers fewer numbers of data points than the bidimensional SDT parameters(Green & Swets, 1966, pp. 64-69). Therefore, empirical studies often estimate the variance ratio in a separate Yes/No session to explain the data from a 2AFC session, assuming that the variance


The log-transformation was made for simplicity, and does not affect simulation results.7  Studies have reported that the observers' Type-1 criterion can be biased in 2AFC tasks (e.g.,Jou, Flores, Cortes, & Leka, 2016;
Yeshurun, Carrasco, & Maloney, 2008)
.Yeshurun et al.    further suggested asymmetric mean observation strengths for S1 and S2 dimensions; μTarget needs not be constant for the distributions of <Target, Nontarget> and <Nontarget, Target>. Thus, in preliminary simulations, we have confirmed that moderate levels of these asymmetries hardly affect simulation results.8  This procedure equates vertical data points in Type-2 ROC space across all the simulation conditions; Type-2 false alarm rates can be compared across the conditions while Type-2 hit rates are always fixed.9  Two different definitions of d´ are often used in 2AFC studies for different purposes (e.g.,
Yeshurun et al., 2008)
. We simply defined d´ as z(hit rate) -z(false alarm rate), a post-hoc performance measure interpretable in the context of unidimensional equal-variance SDT (e.g.,


The data sets are available from, https://osf.io/y3fhx/. In the present analysis, data from three different comparison conditions are aggregated for each subject.12  InFigure 8, Type-2 sensitivity is found to be higher in Yes/No detection (meta-d´ = d´ = 1.0) than in 2AFC (meta-d´ = 0.67). However, this qualitative trend does not generally hold and, depending on parameter values, 2AFC can lead to higher metacognitive accuracy than Yes/No detection. For example, if the mean difference is reduced to be 1 and the target variance is increased to be 2 inFigure 8a, the blindsight condition results in the 2AFC meta-d´ of 0.71 and the Yes/No meta-da (= Type-1 da) of 0.47; here, da was calculated based on unequal-variance SDT(Macmillan & Creelman, 2005, pp. 57-64).
