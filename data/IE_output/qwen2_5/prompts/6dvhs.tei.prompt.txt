INTRODUCTION
Persistent choice for drugs at the expense of healthier rewards is a cardinal pathology in substance use disorders (SUDs) 
(1)
. Indeed, it has been argued that SUDs are, in essence, pathologies of choice and decision-making 
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
. A fundamental question about SUDs thus concerns the neurobehavioral mechanisms guiding these choices: why do decisions to use drugs continue, often despite negative consequences?
Novel approaches to this question have recently come from the fields of neuroeconomics and decision science, which have made substantial progress in characterizing the neural processes guiding choices for various rewards in healthy humans 
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)
. A major focus has been neural representation of subjective value (SV). This emerges from a fundamental computational problem that must be resolved by the brain during choices: how to compare qualitatively different options 
(9)
. A central tenet of economics is that individuals make choices 'as if' using a single SV scale, calculated as a 'common currency'. Moreover, economists hold that this SV scale is revealed in the choices themselves 
(10)
, such that an individual who chooses a bag of cannabis over $10 must -by definition -have a greater SV for that amount of cannabis than for $10, under those precise circumstances.
Within the past 20 years neuroeconomics has investigated the neurobiological basis of SV calculations in healthy populations. Intriguingly, results indicate that the brain appears to calculate SV signals as predicted by standard economic theory 
(11,
12)
. There is strong evidence that SV signals are parametrically encoded during decisions in the ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC) 
(10,
11,
13)
, the Ventral Striatum (VS), and dorsal Poster Cingulate Cortex (dPCC) 
(11,
12)
. These findings are particularly relevant for addiction, given that individuals with SUDs are believed to overvalue drugs while simultaneously undervaluing other rewards 
(14)
(15)
(16)
(17)
. Dysregulated encoding of SV may thus be a key substrate for continued decisions to take drugs. A small number of studies have investigated the neural correlates of drug-related decisions 
(18)
(19)
(20)
(21)
(22)
. To our knowledge, only one has investigated neurobiological SV signals during drug-related decision-making, and that was in cigarette smokers 
(19)
. SV encoding for other substances remains unexamined.
A second key outstanding question concerns the degree to which neural processing underlying drug-related decisions differs from that during choices about other rewards. Blunted valuation of non-drug rewards coupled with heightened drug valuation is theorized to contribute to the maintenance of SUDs 
(14)
. The only prior study assessing this question observed, in frequent cigarette smokers, normative SV signals for cigarettes but not for shop vouchers 
(19)
.
A preferential disruption to valuation processes underlying non-drug versus drug reinforcers may influence treatment response 
(23)
(24)
(25)
, especially for treatments like contingency management, which requires that patients be motivated by non-drug rewards 
(26)
.
A third question concerns the mechanisms underlying the influence of drug-related cues on choices for drugs. In preclinical models, exposure to drug-paired stimuli elicits drug-seeking 
(27)
. In humans, conditioned drug-related stimuli ('cues') elicit craving, and cue exposure usually, though not always, increases drug-taking 
(17,
28,
29)
. Despite the link between cue exposure and drug use, nothing is known about the impact of cues on SV encoding during drug choice.
Here, we used a highly-controlled experimental medicine approach to address these questions in a population that uses drugs. We studied cannabis-related choices because cannabis is the most commonly used controlled recreational drug globally, and problematic use continues to rise against a backdrop of changes to the drug's legality 
(30,
31)
. We aimed to examine: (1) drug (cannabis) neural SV signals relative to (2) non-drug reward (snack food) neural SV signals, and (3) the influence of cues (cannabis, snack food, neutral) on drug and real. This approach ensures that choices have meaningful consequences and are perceived as independent 
(13,
32)
.
The schedule 
(Table 1
) was timed to avoid cannabis withdrawal onset, ensuring that participants would find the cannabis reinforcing but that choices would not be impacted by withdrawal. On choice days, participants were maintained on a low salt, sugar and fat diet, i.e., they were not hungry, but the snacks would remain reinforcing. Participants knew that the only way to receive cannabis or palatable food on choice days was via their decisions. 
Table S1
 presents a schedule for choice days. Participants underwent visual cue exposure and then completed the behavioral choice task, which informed the individualized monetary alternative for the subsequent fMRI task. They were then escorted to the NYSPI MRI, where they were exposed to multisensory cues, before completing the fMRI choice task.
That afternoon, participants completed up to two cannabis/snack sessions, in which they received the rewards from the two randomly-selected decisions implemented. If their choice in an implemented decision was money, they received the money and had no cannabis/snack session.


Rewards: Cannabis and Snack Sessions
Cannabis (5.6% ∆ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol; <0.1% cannabidiol) was administered using standardized paced puffing from a cannabis cigarette 
(33)
. Up to six puffs were administered in each session; one every 14 minutes 
(20,
34)
. During snack sessions, participants ate their selected snacks at 14-minute intervals. Each snack had 50-100 calories.
Subjective mood was measured repeatedly during cannabis/snack sessions (see Supplement).


Cues 8
Visual cues preceding the behavioral task comprised 30 pictures of cannabis or people smoking cannabis (cannabis cues), snacks or people eating snacks (snack cues), or neutral images, e.g., furniture (neutral cues). Multisensory cues preceding the fMRI task comprised visual, olfactory, tactile, and auditory stimuli. For cannabis, participants rolled a blunt/joint and smelled it. For snacks, they unwrapped, smelled and touched the snacks. For neutral cues, participants touched and smelled a scented candle and then gift-wrapped it (see Supplement).
Subjective effects of cues were measured with Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) before and after both the visual and multisensory cues.


Behavioral Choice Tasks
The behavioral choice tasks served to determine the fixed, individualized monetary alternative for that day's fMRI choice task, which was calculated as the estimated indifference point for 3 cannabis puffs or 3 snacks i.e., the monetary value equivalent to the worth of 3 puffs/snacks for that participant on that day (see Supplement). Participants made 30 choices between 0-6 puffs/snacks (dependent on condition) and monetary values from $0 to $30 to enable this calculation.


fMRI Choice Tasks
We used novel event-related fMRI tasks, based on previous work 
(32)
, in which participants repeatedly chose between 0-6 cannabis puffs/snacks (dependent on condition) and the fixed monetary alternative determined in the behavioral task. A stable monetary alternative was used so that fMRI signal changes could be attributed to the changing SV of the cannabis/snack options. The individualized monetary value for 3 puffs/snacks was used as the alternative to ensure that choices would vary, and to approximately normalize choice behavior in the fMRI tasks so that differences in SV encoding could not be attributed to differences in behavior. fMRI tasks consisted of four runs of 35 choices presented in randomized order. The tasks ( 
Figure 1
) started with an Options screen presenting the cannabis/snack and monetary options; followed by a Choice screen, requiring a 1-5 response, where 1 (strong yes) or 2 (yes) was a choice for the left option, 4 (yes) or 5 (strong yes) was a choice for the right, and 3 (neutral) was determined by a coin toss (32); followed by a Decision screen, which highlighted the participant's choice; then a jittered inter-trial-interval. The decision strength ratings provided a behavioral measure of the participant's SV for that cannabis/snack option relative to the monetary option 
(6,
32)
, and was subsequently used for parametric modulation in analyses.


MRI Acquisition
MRI data were collected using a GE 750 3T magnet. Functional images (Blood Oxygenated Level-Dependent; BOLD) were collected from 32, 3.5mm thick slices (0.5mm gap) parallel to the AC/PC plane, using a T2*-sensitive spiral in-out acquisition sequence (TR=2000msecs, TE=27msecs, 64x64 matrix, 23cm FOV, 77° flip angle) to maximize signal-to-noise ratio and minimize susceptibility artifacts in regions of interest. Voxels were 3.59x3.59x3.5mm. A highresolution 3D FSPGR Anatomical Sequence T1-weighted scan was also collected.


Statistical analyses Behavioral Data
Data were analyzed and graphed using RStudio version 1.2.5042, SPSS version 26.0, and GraphPad Prism version 8.
We analyzed: (1) effects of cues on cannabis/snack craving (operationalized as 'I want cannabis' and 'I want a snack' VAS ratings); (2) the monetary value equivalent to 3 cannabis puffs/snacks in the behavioral tasks; (3) the proportion of choices for cannabis/snacks versus money in the fMRI tasks; and (4) subjective responses to cannabis puffs and snacks during sampling sessions using repeated-measures (RM) ANOVAs or, for major departures from normality, non-parametric Wilcoxon-Signed Ranks tests.


fMRI Data
One participant's fMRI data were lost; fMRI results are reported for 20 participants. Data were pre-processed using standard approaches in FSL (FMRIB Software Library, version Primary outcomes comprised neural SV signals for cannabis and snacks in three regions of interest (ROIs; vmPFC, VS, dPCC identified by meta-analysis) 
(11)
. SV signals were statistically isolated using parametric modulation terms, within General Linear Models (GLMs), where the parametric modulator was the decision strength for that choice (rated 1-5). This identified brain areas where activity was correlated with the strength of the decision in favor of cannabis/snacks.


First-level analysis
We modelled Options and Choice epochs in separate GLMs. Models included the following regressors: the options/choice event, the parametrically modulated options/choice event, temporal derivatives of these regressors, six motion parameters as regressors of no interest, and a confounding regressor to scrub movement >0.9mm (see Supplement).


Second-level analyses
Fixed-effects averages from the four runs in the same condition were computed for the Options and Choice parametric modulation terms.


Third-level analyses
We first conducted one sample t-tests (cannabis SV>0; snack SV>0) to assess if cannabis and snack SV signals could be detected. We then conducted 2X2 RM ANOVAs, examining the interaction between and main effects of reward (cannabis, snack) and cue (active, neutral) on the neural SV signals (i.e., the parametrically-modulated terms). When the interaction and main effect non-directional F-tests were significant, we followed up with directional t-tests.
We masked third-level analyses with the ROIs and corrected for multiple comparisons within ROIs using voxelwise False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction.
This allowed us to examine, within three putatively canonical SV regions: (1) if cannabis and snack neural SV signals could be detected; 
(2)
 if SV signals differed between cannabis and snacks; and (3) how these were affected by cue exposure.
To further probe the primary analyses, we extracted the average beta values for the parametrically-modulated terms in the three ROI masks in both Options and Choice epochs and conducted 2X2 RM ANOVAs. We also conducted exploratory whole-brain third-level analyses.


RESULTS
Participants were, on average, 29 years old, with 13 years of formal education. They smoked cannabis on average 6.5 days/week (8 'joints'/day; see 
Table 2
).


Behavioral Data
Effects of cues on subjective state ( 
Figure S3a-c)
 As expected, the snack and cannabis cues increased craving for snacks and cannabis (respectively). For 'I want a snack' ratings, there was an interaction between cue and time (F3,60=4.505, p=0.012, ηp 2 =0.184) and a main effect of time (F3,60=5.321, p=0.007, ηp 2 =0.210).
On the active cue day, the multisensory cues increased snack craving ratings compared to both before the multisensory cues (t20=3.584, p=0.011) and after the earlier visual cues (t20=3.250, p=0.024). There was no such effect on the neutral cue day.
Similarly, on the active cue day, ratings of cannabis craving were increased after the multisensory cues compared to before the visual cues (Z=3.062, p=0.002). Neutral cues did not increase ratings of wanting cannabis.


Behavioral choice task estimated indifference points for 3 cannabis puffs/snacks (Figure S4)
There was a main effect of reward (F1,20=4.425, p=0.048, ηp 2 =0.181), with the estimated monetary value for 3 cannabis puffs ($1.46) greater than that for 3 snacks ($1.34). There was no significant interaction and no effect of cue (active/neutral) on indifference points.


Proportion of choices for cannabis/snacks versus money in the fMRI choice task
Choices for cannabis or snacks were 39%-45% of total, on average, across the four conditions. There was no significant interaction, and no main effect of cue or reward on the proportion of choices for cannabis/snacks. This indicates that the use of individualized monetary alternatives in the fMRI task normalized choices across conditions as intended.


fMRI results -ROI masked results


Options epoch
A one-sample t-test revealed cannabis SV signals in the vmPFC, dPCC and VS ( 
Figure   2a
, c-d & 
Table 3a)
. No SV signals for snacks were observed. No main effects or interactions from the RM-ANOVA reached significance.


Choice epoch
In the vmPFC, a one-sample t-test revealed a significant cannabis SV signal 
(Figure 2b
).
Furthermore, in the vmPFC, there was a main effect of reward, driven by a stronger cannabis SV than snack SV signal 
(Table 3b
). All other tests were null.
In the dPCC, there was a significant interaction between reward and cue (Table 3b & 
Figure   2e
). This result was driven by a stronger cannabis than snack SV after neutral cues, with other pairwise comparisons null.


Extracted betas from ROIs (Figure 3a-f)


Options epoch
In the vmPFC, a positive cannabis SV signal (t19=2.121, p=0.047, Mean=1.221, SEM=0.576) and a negative snack SV signal were observed (t19=2.160, p=0.044, Mean=1.078, SEM=0.499). There was a main effect of reward (F1,19=8.487, p=0.009, ηp 2 =0.309); the cannabis SV signal was greater than the snack SV signal. There was also a main effect of cue 


DISCUSSION
SUDs can be conceptualized as pathologies of decision-making 
(3)
(4)
(5)
. We used an experimental medicine approach to study the neural valuation of drug (cannabis) and non-drug (snack) rewards in people who use cannabis on a near-daily basis, following neutral and active (cannabis/snack) cues. We found positive cannabis SV signals within pre-specified ROIs (vmPFC, dPCC and VS), but the expected positive snack SV signals could not be detected. In the vmPFC and VS, cannabis SV signals were larger than snack SV signals. Additionally, within the dPCC, active cues had differential effects on cannabis and snack SV signals.
Numerous studies 
(13,
32,
36)
 and meta-analyses 
(11,
12)
 have demonstrated that SV signals exist in a valuation network including the vmPFC, striatum, and dPCC. We observed cannabis SV signals in these regions, revealing that the brain's computation of value for cannabis functions as expected in near-daily cannabis users (comparable to that for non-drug rewards in other populations). This is contrary to theories that in addiction the valuation of drugs is impaired, with decision-making habitual 
(37)
. The only prior study to directly investigate neural SV signals in relation to substance use (19) also observed expected cigarette SV signals in cigarette smokers. Moreover, three other studies -while not modelling SV encoding -found that cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco users recruited valuation circuitry during drug purchase decisions 
(18,
20,
22)
. This converges with current findings to indicate that the brain's computation of drug value is not "impaired" in frequent drug users.
Conversely, the expected snack SV signals were not observed. Several studies have investigated value computation guiding choices for food rewards (e.g., 
13,
32,
36)
; these have overwhelmingly reported SV signals for palatable food in the regions investigated. We therefore expected to observe positive snack SV signals. That these could not be detected with the fMRI measure employed -either in ROI-based or exploratory whole-brain analyses -may be indicative of dysregulation of the neural valuation of non-drug rewards in our sample. Similarly, weaker SV signals for shop vouchers (but not cigarettes) were found in the PCC of dependent compared to occasional cigarette smokers in a prior study 
(19)
. Together, these results support theories that non-drug reward value processing may be compromised in SUDs 
14
, i.e., valuation system function may be moderated by reward type. It is possible that progressive changes to non-drug reward SV signaling plays a causal role in the pathophysiology of addiction, such that relative SV encoding for drug vs. non-drug rewards shifts during development of addiction 
(17)
. Disrupted SV processing for non-drug rewards may also have implications for treatment modalities aiming to engage patients with alternative rewards, like contingency management.
At a behavioral level, participants interacted with snack rewards in a typical way, as they did with cannabis rewards. They were motivated to receive snacks, willing to forego money in favor of snacks in choice tasks, and they responded to snack cues with increased craving.
Hence, the apparent lack of a typical SV signal for non-drug rewards warrants further investigation as a potential early marker of choice dysregulation in cannabis and other substance-using populations.
How might near-daily cannabis use itself affect valuation processes? The endocannabinoid system is thought to modulate reward circuitry 
(38,
39)
 and CB1 receptors are expressed densely in the vmPFC and VS 
(40)
. Frequent recent cannabis use could, via downregulation of the CB1 receptor (41), alter neural reward processing, as has been shown in some (42), but not all 
(43)
, studies of people who regularly use cannabis. However, it remains unclear why such effects would preferentially affect SV encoding for non-drug, but not drug, rewards.
Our results are concordant with literature demonstrating that people who frequently use drugs are oftentimes economically rational, and not compulsive, when they use drugs 
(44)
(45)
(46)
.
Although the value assigned to drugs is higher in people with SUDs 
(44)
 and the SV signals potentially stronger 
(19)
, value-based decision-making about drugs remains intact.
Findings did not support our hypothesis that active cues would preferentially augment cannabis SV signals. In the dPCC, there was an interaction between reward and cue; the cannabis SV signals were differentially affected by the presence of active cues relative to snack SV signals. The PCC is thought to be particularly sensitive to cues and craving 
(47,
49)
. A similar pattern was also observed in whole-brain analyses in the angular gyrus, another region considered important in the valuation network 
(11)
. This may indicate that the presence of cues weakens the relationship between encoding in some regions and subjective valuation of cannabis rewards. However, the current results do not present a clear picture regarding cue effects; further investigation into the impact of cues on drug SV encoding is therefore warranted.
As the first investigation of SV encoding in relation to cannabis use, this study had limitations. We did not include a non-cannabis-using control with which to compare the nondrug SV signals of the cannabis users. However, a wealth of evidence indicates that healthy participants show positive non-drug-reward SV signals in these ROIs 
(11,
13,
36)
, including snack SV signals observed during a similar task 
(32)
. A second limitation was cue exposure occurred outside of the scanner, with some small delays between exposure and scan initiation.
This may have contributed to the relatively minor effects of the cues observed. To counter this, cues were designed to be highly potent (e.g., multisensory including engagement with personalized cannabis paraphernalia). However, future studies could valuably explore the possible impacts of value-encoding during choices for drugs in the presence of drug-paired cues, rather than after exposure. A third limitation is that we did not have sufficient power to assess the impact of factors such as gender, or variables known to be clinically-relevant markers in cannabis use, such as tobacco smoking.
Limitations notwithstanding, the current results suggest that this novel, controlled, multidisciplinary methodology represents a promising approach to further elucidate the neurobehavioral choice processes subserving the development and maintenance of substance use and SUDs. There are numerous potential avenues for future research. It remains unclear whether similar patterns of preferentially disrupted SV encoding would be observed in people using drugs other than cannabis and cigarettes 
(19)
. Similarly, the effects of state factors like withdrawal on SV encoding for drug and non-drug reinforcers in different populations remains unknown. A key question for future investigation will be the extent to which this apparent dysregulation is reversed over the course of treatment. To recover from SUDs, individuals need to engage with non-drug rewards; hence the extent to which SV encoding of non-drug rewards normalizes with treatment could have important implications for treatment outcomes.
This was the first study to investigate neural SV signals for a real, tangible, illicit drug: other studies of drug-related choice used hypothetical rewards 
(44)
 or drug images 
(48)
 or studied legal drugs 
(19,
22)
. In near-daily cannabis users, cannabis SV signals were intact, while snack SV signals could not be detected, suggesting dysregulation of these neurobiological choice processes. Results suggest that near-daily cannabis use is associated with normative valuation of cannabis but compromised neural valuation of other rewards, providing support for the relevance of choice and decision processes in the pathophysiology of addiction.

 behavior, such that differences could be attributed to encoding, rather than behavioral differences 
(12)
. Each condition focused on either cannabis or snack decisions (not both), so that we could isolate the SV signal for cannabis or snacks, relative to the common currency of money, without disruption from the other reward.


Day


.... 17
In the behavioral choice task, participants made 30 choices between 0-6 cannabis puffs/snacks (dependent on condition) and monetary values from $0 to $30. One choice from the behavioral choice task was randomly selected and implemented during the first administration session that afternoon i.e., if the item randomly selected was a decision between $5 and 3 puffs and the participant chose puffs, they would receive 3 puffs of cannabis in the first administration session that afternoon. If they chose money in the selected decision, they received $5 cash (added to their study payment) after the scan and remained in the laboratory without undergoing the first administration session.
fMRI Choice Task 
(12)
 Participants repeatedly chose between 0-6 cannabis puffs/snacks (dependent on condition) and a fixed monetary alternative (the indifference point estimated in the behavioral choice task). The fMRI choice task consisted of four runs of 35 choices each, making a total of 140 choices; each run lasted for 8 mins 22 secs (see 
Figure 1
).
Using the individualized indifference point for 3 puffs/snacks as the fixed alternative aimed to result in participants choosing cannabis/snacks when there were 4, 5, or 6 puffs/snacks available, and the monetary option when there were 0, 1, or 2 puffs/snacks available, with choices for 3 puffs/snacks versus the monetary option equally likely. In 22 of 80 scans, the initial reference option (indifference point) estimated by the behavioral task did not result in variable choices during the first run; in those cases, an increased or decreased monetary option was entered for runs 2-4 to increase response variability and only those runs were used for analyses.
One choice from the fMRI task was randomly selected and implemented during the second administration session that afternoon as follows: 1 and 2 responses received the item on the left, 4 and 5 responses received the item on the right, and 3 (neutral) responses resulted in a coin flip to determine which option was received. If the participant chose money in the selected decision, they received that amount of money (added to their study payment) after the scan and remained in the laboratory without undergoing the second administration session.


Second behavioral choice task
There was a second behavioral task, which enabled examination of the economic rationality of choices in this population; these data will be reported separately.


Subjective Mood State
Subjective mood state in response to the reinforcers (cannabis and snacks) and the cues was measured with Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). The VAS (13) employed during sampling and administration sessions comprised 35 items (rated from 0 to 100 on a 100mm computer-presented scale) that were grouped together into seven cluster scales by calculating the arithmetic means of individual items. These seven clusters (and individual items) were: high (good drug effect & high), miserable (depressed, irritable & miserable), tired (clumsy, sedated, sleepy, withdrawn, unmotivated & tired), on edge (anxious, jittery, restless, stimulated & on edge), bad effect (blurred vision, chills, dizzy, headache, heart pound, nauseous, stomach pain, upset stomach & bad drug effect), content (alert, energetic, mellow, self-confident, social, talkative & content), and confused (can't concentrate, forgetful & confused). We also collected VAS data for I want cannabis and I want a snack.
Subjective responses to cues were assessed with 3 VAS measuring ratings of I want cannabis, I want a snack and aroused.


Experimental protocol


Screening
Volunteers underwent comprehensive examination including electrocardiogram, blood/urine analysis, physical examination, psychiatric assessment, urine toxicology, alcohol breathalyzer, carbon monoxide, and pregnancy tests.


Choice days (days 1, 2, 5, & 6)
Participants were provided with their selected breakfast. The same breakfast, lunch and dinner was provided on each choice day. Participants were allowed to eat unlimited servings, however all meals on scanning days had low salt, fat, and sugar content to ensure that the snacks available were reinforcing. After breakfast, lunch, and during the afternoon administration sessions, cigarette smokers were allowed to smoke a cigarette to prevent nicotine withdrawal 
(14)
. Participants ate dinner at 5.30pm before being returned to the inpatient unit. Nothing other than water was consumed after dinner until the following day.


Days 3 & 4 (no choices)
Days 3 and 4 comprised weekend days. On these days, participants underwent a single experimenter-administered cannabis session, receiving six cannabis puffs. This ensured that no participant went more than two days without cannabis, limiting effects of cannabis withdrawal on choices. Participants ate dinner at 5.30pm before returning to the inpatient unit. Nothing other than water was consumed after dinner until the following day.


Cannabis and snacks
Cannabis (5.6% ∆ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol; <0.1% cannabidiol) cigarettes were provided by the National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA). Vital signs were monitored throughout sampling and administration sessions for safety. Cannabis was well-tolerated and did not produce changes in vital signs that required medical attention.
During training, participants were given a list of 38 snacks including hot (e.g., fries), cold (e.g., chocolate), and frozen (e.g., ice pops) options, all between 50 and 100 calories. They selected their 10 favorite snacks from the list, which were then stocked prior to their inpatient admission. During snack sessions, participants could choose to eat any of the 10 snacks they had previously selected.


Cues
Different cues were used for the behavioral and fMRI tasks to avoid habituation. The visual cues preceding the behavioral task were presented on the laptop screen for 10 seconds each (total -5 mins). Cannabis and snack cues were customized for this study; neutral cues were selected from the International Affective Pictures System 
(15)
. Visual cues were presented immediately before the behavioral choice task.
For multisensory cannabis cues, preceding the fMRI task, participants were given approximately 1.5 grams of active cannabis with their preferred 'blunt' or 'joint' papers and asked to roll a blunt/joint and then hold and smell it. For multisensory snack cues, they were provided with samples of their 10 chosen snacks (heated if appropriate) and asked to unwrap, smell, and touch the snacks. For the two neutral cue sessions, participants touched and smelled one of two differently scented candles prior to wrapping the candle as a gift. Immediately following cues, the participant was taken into the scanning room and the was scan started. During initial localizer scans and between choice task runs, participants viewed more cue pictures and listened to auditory stimuli according to that day's condition to facilitate continuity of cue effects during scanning. Auditory stimuli were customized for this study and consisted of people smoking/talking about cannabis (cannabis cues), eating/talking about food (snack cues), and background noise/talking (neutral cues).
No cue stimuli were repeated. We used visual cues before the behavioral economic task to minimize habituation effects that might have occurred had we used the multisensory cues twice.
Before and after both the visual and the multisensory cues, participants were asked: 'RIGHT NOW do you want cannabis/a snack?' and 'RIGHT NOW are you aroused?'. Scales were rated from 'Not at all' (0) to 'A lot' (100).


Statistical analyses


Behavioral Data
When data met relevant assumptions, they were analyzed using repeated-measures (RM) ANOVA. RM-ANOVA used within-subjects factors of reward (cannabis, snack) and cue (active, neutral), and, depending on the analysis, time. The Greenhouse-Geisser correction was employed when Mauchley's test of sphericity indicated departure from sphericity. Alpha was set at 0.05 for the omnibus ANOVAs. Significant main effects and interactions were followed up with local Bonferronicorrected t-tests. When data did not meet relevant assumptions, non-parametric Wilcoxon-Signed Ranks tests were conducted, with manually Bonferroni-adjusted alpha thresholds.
All behavioral data apart from demographic and drug use data were subject to winsorizing. Outliers were identified using Tukeys' method as data points that were greater than three times the interquartile range (IQR) from the lower quartile or upper quartile. These outliers were replaced with the closest non-outlying data point. Data were holistically examined for normality using: visual inspection of histograms; skewness and kurtosis scores >1; and Kolmogrov-Smirnov tests.
Graphs were produced using winsorized data. All data are graphed using means and standard errors, even if data were non-normal.
Missing data were left missing in a pairwise fashion and not imputed. Missing behavioral data are highlighted in the relevant Results sub-sections.


Subjective effects from sampling sessions (Figure S2)
The following clusters/variables were analyzed with RM ANOVA with within-subjects factors of time (1-8) and reward (cannabis, snack): tired, on edge, content and want cannabis. The following clusters were analyzed with Wilcoxon-Signed Rank tests due to substantive departures from normality: high, miserable, bad effect and confused. Within these four clusters, several outliers that were winsorized. Four participants were excluded from these analyses due to incomplete datasets (leaving n=17).


Subjective effects of cues (Figure S3a-c)
For want cannabis, there was a substantive departure from normality, so we used nonparametric Wilcoxon-Signed Ranks tests. We compared pre-visual and post-multisensory cues want cannabis ratings within each cue day separately. Four outliers were winsorized in the postmultisensory cannabis-active condition. Data were missing for one participant (n=20).
For aroused, we conducted a RM ANOVA with factors of time (pre-visual cues, post-visual cues, pre-multisensory cues, post-multisensory cues), cue (neutral, active) and reward (cannabis, snack). For want snack we conducted a RM ANOVA with factors of time and cue, for the snack days only.


Indifference points and proportions of choices for cannabis/snacks in behavioral and fMRI choice tasks
For both indifference points and the proportion of choices for cannabis/snacks in the behavioral and fMRI choice tasks, we used RM ANOVA with within-subjects factors of reward (cannabis, snack) and cue (active, neutral).


fMRI Data
One participant's fMRI data was lost, leaving n=20.


Results


Behavioral results
Subjective mood state during the sampling sessions (Tables S2 and S3, 
Figure S2
)
Of all eight variables, only high was affected during the sampling sessions. At baselinebefore sampling commenced -there was no difference in high ratings between cannabis and snack sessions. At every other timepoint, high ratings were greater during cannabis than snack (ps<0.001). 
Figure S3a-c)
 For want cannabis, data were missing for one participant (n=20). On the active cue day, want cannabis was greater at post-multisensory cues compared to pre-visual cues (Z=3.062, p=0.002), but on the neutral cue day this was not the case (Z=1.060, p=0.289).


Subjective effects of cues (
For want snack, there was a significant interaction between cue and time (F3,60=4.505, p=0.012, ηp 2 =0.184) and a main effect of time (F3,60=5.321, p=0.007, ηp 2 =0.210). On the active cue day, want snack was higher at post-multisensory cues compared to post-visual cues (t20=3.250, p=0.024) and to the pre-multisensory cues (t20=3.584, p=0.011), but there were no significant differences on the neutral cue day. The main effect of time was driven by greater want snack ratings at postmultisensory cues compared to pre-multisensory cues (t20=3.559, p=0.012).
For aroused, data were missing for one participant (n=20). The only significant effect was time (F3,57=4.181, p=0.019, ηp 2 =0.180). All other terms were non-significant (ps>0.095). Post-hoc t-tests showed that, compared to post-multisensory cues, all other timepoints had non-significantly lower aroused levels (pre-visual vs. post-multi: t19=2.495, p=0.132; post-visual vs. post-multi: t19=2.554, p=0.116; pre-multi vs. post-multi: t19=2.585, p=0.115).
This demonstrates that the cues increased craving for snacks and cues (operationalized as ratings of want cannabis and want a snack), with no effect on subjective arousal.
Indifference point in the behavioral choice task ( 
Figure S4)
.
We conducted an RM-ANOVA with factors of reward and cue. There was no interaction between reward and cue (F1, 20=1.452, p=0.242, ηp 2 =0.068). There was no main effect of cue (F1, 20=1.164, p=0.294, ηp 2 =0.055). There was a main effect of reward (F1, 20=4.425, p=0.048, ηp2=0.181), with the indifference point for cannabis (Mean=USD1.46, SEM=0.229) higher than that for snacks (Mean=USD1.34, SEM=0.219).


Proportion of choices for cannabis/snack (vs. money) during fMRI task
The average proportion of choices for cannabis or snacks were similar in each condition. Following active cues, cannabis was chosen 45.0% (SD=12.0) of the time, and following neutral cues, cannabis was chosen 40.7% (SD=16.7) of the time. Following active cues, snacks were chosen 41.8% (SD=11.0) of the time, and following neutral cues, snacks were chosen 39.4% (SD=18.8) of the time. There was no significant interaction between reward and cue (F1,19=0.097, p=0.758, ηp 2 =0.005) and no significant effect of cue (F1,19=2.588, p=0.124, ηp 2 =0.120) or reward (F1,19=0.370, p=0.550, ηp 2 =0.019). This demonstrates that the individualized indifference points worked in standardizing the proportion of choices for cannabis/snacks in all conditions during the fMRI choice task.


Whole brain fMRI results (unmasked)


Options Epoch
One-sample t-tests showed there were cannabis SV signals in the superior frontal gyrus and occipital regions.


Choices Epoch
There was an interaction between reward and cue in the right angular gyrus. This was driven by more negative snack SV signals following active cues than neutral cues, but more positive cannabis SV signals following neutral cues than active cues.
There was a main effect of reward, with cannabis value signals stronger than snack value signals, in regions with peaks in the superior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus and superior parietal lobule.

Data were subject to within-subjects analysis at three levels using FSL FLAME. First-level analyses modelled brain activity within each run separately; events were modelled as boxcar functions and convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response, using the double-gamma function. Second-level analyses averaged brain activity across runs within conditions. Third-level analyses tested differences in brain activity between conditions.

(F1,19=7.321, p=0.014, ηp 2 =0.278); SV signals following neutral cues were stronger than SV signals following active cues. The interaction term was null. Within the dPCC, there was a main effect of cue (F1,19=5.043, p=0.037, ηp 2 =0.210); SV signals following neutral cues were stronger than SV signals following active cues. Other tests were null. In the vmPFC, a positive cannabis SV signal (t19=4.110, p=0.001, Mean=9.129, SEM=2.221) and a negative snack SV signal were observed (t19=2.274, p=0.035, Mean=-9.945, SEM=4.373). There was a main effect of reward (F1,19=12.921, p=0.002, ηp 2 =0.405); cannabis SV signals were stronger than snack SV signals. Other tests were null. In the VS, a negative snack SV signal was observed (t19=2.363, p=0.029, Mean=6.186, SEM=2.619). The cannabis SV signal was greater than the snack SV signal (t19=2.591, p=0.018). the dPCC, there was an interaction between reward and cue (F1,19=7.853, p=0.011, ηp 2 =0.292), with the cannabis SV signal greater than the snack SV signal following neutral (t19=3.183, p=0.005) but not active cues. Moreover, active cues reduced the positive cannabis SV signals (t19=2.380, p=0.028), but increased negative snack SV signals (t19=2.203, p=0.040), bringing both close to zero. There was also a main effect of reward (F1,19=5.865, p=0.026, ηp 2 =0.236); cannabis SV signals were stronger than snack SV signals. Exploratory whole-brain results are presented in the Supplemental information (Figures S5, S6, S7; Tables S6, S7, S8). Of note, positive SV signals for snacks did not reach significance in whole-brain analyses.

Methods


Participants
Inclusion criteria were: (1) smokes cannabis ≥4 days/week (self-report and positive THC urine toxicology); (2) smokes ≥2 cannabis cigarettes/day-of-use; (3) aged 21-50 years old; (4) righthanded; and (5) using effective contraception (if female). Exclusion criteria were: (1) uses illicit drugs other than cannabis (>2 days/week); (2) regularly smokes cannabis in forms other than 'blunts' or 'joints'; (3) requesting drug treatment; (4) current DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorder (1) requiring medical intervention; (5) contraindicated medical illness or medications; (6) contraindication for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); (7) clinically-significant dietary restraint (2); and (8) pregnant.


Measures


Demographic assessments
Educational level was measured as years spent in formal education. Race was self-reported as one of the following categories: Caucasian, African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, or Mixed. Ethnicity was self-reported as Hispanic or non-Hispanic.


Mental health assessments
During screening, Axis 1 psychiatric disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) 
(1)
 was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) (6). Depression symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (3) total score. Anxiety symptoms were measured using the State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (4) total score. Exposure to traumatic events was measured using the Trauma Assessment for Adults (5) total score.


Drug use assessments
Cannabis use was quantified via structured interview as: days/week of cannabis consumption, 'joints'/day on days when cannabis was used, and amount spent weekly on cannabis (USD). Alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking were measured with days/week of use. Problematic cannabis consumption was measured using the 21-item Cannabis Problems Questionnaire (7) and the Marijuana Problem Scale 
(8)
. Problematic alcohol consumption was measured using the Short Michigan Alcohol Screening Test 
(9)
. Recent drug use was assessed using urine drug screens (5-Panel drug screen, All Test North America, Gilbert, AZ), alcohol breathalyzer tests (Select S80, BACTrack, San Francisco, CA), and a carbon monoxide monitor (Vitalgraph, Lenexa, KS).


Other baseline assessments
Biologically female participants were tested for pregnancy using a urine pregnancy test at screening and admission (Alere hCG Dipstick, Alere, Orlando, FL). All participants completed clinical blood tests and electrocardiogram during screening to assess for contraindicating medical conditions.


Choice tasks


Behavioral choice tasks
A behavioral choice task was completed on each choice day before the fMRI scan. The purpose of this task was to estimate that participant's monetary value (i.e., the indifference price point) for 3 cannabis puffs or 3 snacks (dependent on condition) on that day. This represented the dollar value at which the participant was equally likely to choose 3 puffs/snacks or money. It was calculated using a logistic regression method 
(10,
11)
. This value was then entered into the fMRI task as the stable monetary alternative 
(12)
. The value for 3 puffs/snacks was chosen as the midpoint between the total number of puffs/snacks available in the fMRI task (which had a range of 0-6 puffs/snacks), so that participants would vary their choices in the scanner and choice behavior between conditions would be approximately normalized. This aimed to allow us to isolate SV neural activity from


Pre-processing
Pre-processing was carried out using FSL (FMRIB Software Library, version 5.0.9, www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) as in a previous study 
(16)
. For quality control, the raw fMRI data were first inspected to detect scanner or intensity inconsistencies, and to detect any obvious movement; next translational and rotational movement were checked for each run of data; and the two-step registration process was checked. Data were all acceptable, specifically no run of data showed a maximum movement of greater than 3.5mm (the size of one dimension of the voxel).
Standard pre-processing was applied, including brain extraction, motion correction (MCFLIRT), slice-timing correction, high pass temporal filtering (90-second cut-off) and spatial smoothing (5 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel). The anatomical images were subject to inhomogeneity correction using N4 bias field correction processes (ANT, http://picsl.upenn.edu/software/ants/) and FSL's Brain Extraction Tool (BET) process. Manual adjustments were made if required, to ensure that the brain was accurately extracted.

)


Masking using Regions of Interest (ROI) (
Previous meta-analysis 
(17)
 showed the vmPFC had three centers of activity: 
[-2, 40, -6]
, 
[4, 30, -16]
, 
[-4, 60, -10]
; the ventral striatum had two centers of activity: 
[-10, 8, -6]
 and 
[10, 12, -10]
; and the dPCC had one center of activity: [0, 
-34, 42]
. Spheres were formed around these centers and combined to create three separate masks. The average diameter of the vmPFC spheres was 21mm, the average diameter of the ventral striatum was 15mm, and the dPCC sphere had a diameter of 15mm. These were used as masks for the primary analyses.


First level analyses
The confounding regressor was used to scrub volumes exceeding a framewise displacement threshold of 0.9mm. The events were modelled as boxcar functions with the whole duration of the event and convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response, using the double-gamma function.


Secondary ROI analyses
We conducted secondary analyses in which we extracted average betas for SV signals from the ROIs described above. We analyzed the extracted betas using 2x2 RM ANOVAs. Extracted betas were winsorized before analysis.


Whole brain analyses without masking
For hypotheses generation for future studies, we conducted exploratory whole-brain analyses using the same 2X2 RM ANOVAs, but without masking the third-level analyses with ROIs. We used a cluster-defining threshold of z=2.3 and a corrected cluster extent threshold of p<0.05 using FWE.
