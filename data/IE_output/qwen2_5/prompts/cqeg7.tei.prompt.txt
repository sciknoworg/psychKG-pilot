You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Responsiveness to feedback is a fundamental aspect of learning (e.g., 
Pashler, Cepeda, Wixted & Rohrer, 2005)
. Principles of operant conditioning clearly express the common ways in which the outcome of current behaviour influences future action 
(Thorndike, 1911)
. While changing action as a consequence of negative outcome (ie, lose-shift) and repeating action as a consequence of positive outcome 
(ie, win-stay)
 seem to be two sides of the same coin, punishment and reinforcement remain anatomically 
(Thapa & Gruber, 2018)
, evolutionarily 
(Bolles, 1970;
West & Lebiere, 2001
) and mechanistically 
(Kubanek, Snyder & Abrams, 2015;
Dyson & Ahad, 2021)
 distinct. In addition to operating in environments such as gambling and educationwhere feedback is both salient and explicitly negative or positive-there are other cases where information regarding our performance is often ambiguous or incomplete 
(Müller, Möller, Rodriguez-Fornells & Munte, 2005)
. The interpretation of outcomes that do not have a clear valence, either as a result of the absence of feedback (ambiguous; 
Gu, Feng, Broster, Yuan, Xu, & Luo, 2017)
 or the explicit delivery of neutral feedback, such as the zero value assigned to drawing against an opponent 
(Dyson, Steward, Meneghetti & Forder, 2020)
, is a neglected feature of the decisionmaking literature.
The behavioural and neural responses following supposedly 'neutral' outcomes have provided a number of unique insights into the subjective aspects of decisionmaking. Within a simple case where three possible outcomes of a competitive interaction are assigned different values (win = +1, draw = 0, lose = -1), a draw may co-opt aspects of positive or negative outcomes as a result of the transient state of the Behavioural profiles following feedback 4 organism (see 
Na, Zhang & Dyson, in preparation)
. 
West & Lebiere (2001, p. 225)
 express this interpretive tension generated by draws as "to tie is to fail to win, but on the other hand to tie is to avoid a loss." Thus, a draw may be perceived as worse-thanexpected in the context of not winning, or better-than-expected in the context of not losing. This need for personal interpretation means that individuals-in otherwise identical environments in which they encounter the same types and frequencies of outcomes-can form different subjective states where they experience more successes than failures (i.e., [win = draw] > lose), or, more failures than successes (i.e., win <
[draw = lose]). This is important for at least two reasons. First, given the inherent ambiguity of draws, these responses can speak to the degree of optimistic bias or depressive realism held as a trait 
(Allan, Siegel & Hannah, 2007;
Cazé and van der Meer, 2013;
Sharot et al., 2007)
. Second, draws play a critical component in determining gambling behaviour, since a draw could be equally perceived as either a near-win or a near-loss thereby perpetuating erroneous beliefs in performance success 
(Dixon et al., 2013;
Ulrich & Hewig, 2018)
. Given the ubiquity of traditional operant conditioning responses to clear gains and losses (win-stay, lose-shift), it seems probable that the behavioural profile for draw outcomes has its hallmark in these more hard-wired reactions. We can start to understand the subjective interpretation of draws by comparing performance with explicitly positive and negative outcomes, in addition to reviewing the previous literature in terms of a number of metrics including decision times, neural flexibility, and, the quality and optimality of action following outcome.
With respect to decision time, we can draw from the literature on post-loss slowing / speeding (c.f., impulsivity; 
Verbruggen, Chambers, Lawrence & McLaren, 2017;
Eben, Chen, Vermeylen, Billieux & Verbruggen, 2020;
Dyson, 2021)
. Here, Behavioural profiles following feedback 5 differences in future decision time are determined by the type of outcome caused by the current action: post-loss slowing is defined as increased decision time following losses relative to wins, and, post-loss speeding is defined as decreased decision time following losses relative to wins. A contributing factor in the observation of slowing or speeding is the degree to which failure is rare 
(Notebaert, Houtman, Van Opstal, Gevers, Fias, & Verguts, 2009)
. For example, if an individual interacts with an opponent who cannot be beaten (unexploitable), or interacts with an opponent who can be beaten (exploitable) but who the participant fails to beat, then performance is characterized by post-loss speeding. In contrast, the degree to which individuals successfully exploit an opponent increases the magnitude of post-loss slowing (see 
Dyson, Sundvall, Forder & Douglas, 2018
; 
Figure 1
). However, outcome frequency does not provide a complete account of post-loss slowing since post-loss slowing is intact when positive and negative outcomes are experienced to the same degree (eg., 
Eben et al., 2020)
. Previous data utilizing draw outcomes further show that when participants engage with unexploitable opponents where long-run outcome frequencies were equivalent, decision times following wins were slower than decision times following both losses and draws (i.e., post-draw speeding; 
Dyson, Wilbiks, Sandhu, Papanicolaou & Lintag., 2016;
Forder & Dyson, 2016)
. Therefore, decision time speeding data establish a connection between neutral (draw) outcomes and explicitly negative (lose) outcomes.
A second metric to ascertain the subjective interpretation of draws is the flexibility of responding following outcomes. Feedback-related negativity 
(FRN;
Miltner, Braun & Coles, 1997
) is a scalp-recorded electrical potential related to dopaminergic influences on anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; 
Luft, 2014)
 and is a Behavioural profiles following feedback 6 reliable index of the positive or negative nature of trial outcome 
(Holroyd et al., 2006)
. Paradigms directly using neutral outcomes have shown that FRN amplitudes generated following draws are often statistically indistinguishable from unambiguously negative (i.e., lose) outcomes (e.g., 
Dyson et al., 2020;
Holroyd et al., 2006;
Kreussel et al., 2012)
. In contrast, both lose and draw trials generate larger FRN amplitude than unambiguously positive trials (i.e., win; e.g., 
Gentsch et al., 2009;
Nieuwenhuis et al., 2004)
. Therefore, event-related potential data also align draws with a negative rather positive interpretation.
Of final interest is the flexibility of behaviour exhibited following outcome.
Operant conditioning dictates the tendency to repeat action following success (winstay) and the tendency to switch action following failure (lose-shift). Under baseline conditions (win = +1, draw = 0, loss = -1), the degree of win-stay behaviour approximates the optimal proportion (33.3%) as predicted by a mixed-strategy-style approach guaranteeing the absence of exploitation (see 
Dyson et al., 2016;
Dyson et al., 2020, Experiment 1)
. In contrast, the degree of lose-shift behaviour exceeds the optimal proportion (66.6%), making participants more predictable following loss. In follow-up studies 
(Forder & Dyson, 2016)
, the objective values of losses and wins was manipulated relative to baseline (see also 
Kubanek et al, 2015;
Brockbank & Vul, 2021)
. Data produced by these schemes showed that value manipulations changed behaviour for wins but not for losses 
(Forder & Dyson, 2016;
Kubanek et al, 2015)
.
Specifically, even when the objective cost of losing was reduced to half the gain of winning (-1, +2), participants still exhibited robust lose-shift behaviour to the same degree observed in a baseline condition (-1, +1) or a condition in which the objective cost of losing was doubled relative to the gain of winning (-2, +1). In contrast, win-

Forder & Dyson, 2016
) and
neural 
(Gentsch et al., 2009;
Holroyd et al., 2006)
 hallmarks similar to objectively negative outcomes (losses), moving the value to +1 should be a more salient manipulation than moving the value to -1.
Changing draw value from 0 to +1 or -1, and evaluating performance against an unexploitable opponent in Experiment 1, we make the following predictions. This is guided by data from 12 previously published experiments that use a similar win Behavioural profiles following feedback 9 (+1), draw (0), lose (-1) outcome value assignment against an opponent who cannot be beaten 
(Dyson et al., 2016;
Forder & Dyson, 2016;
Dyson, et al., 2018;
Srihaput, Craplewe & Dyson, 2020;
Dyson, 2021)
. First, reaction times following draws should be faster than reaction times following wins (post-draw speeding). Second, actions following draws should be more likely to elicit shift than stay behaviour, once again aligning with the consequences of losing rather than winning. Third, the degree to which participants stray from optimal performance should be greater for draw-shift than win-stay, consistent with the behavioural suboptimality often associated with negative relative to positive outcomes. The expected value for win-stay is 33.3% and the expected value for both lose-shift and draw-shift is 66.6%. Fourth, if draws are interpreted as negative when assigned the value of 0, changing the value of the draw to +1 (i.e., moving from subjectively negative to objectively positive) should alter behaviour more than changing the value of the draw to -1 (i.e., moving from subjectively negative to objectively negative).


Method
40 participants provided informed consent for Experiment 1 (37 provided demographic information: 28 women, 32 right-handed; mean age = 19.03, sd = 1.11).
Participants received course credit and were only eligible to take part in one experiment in the following series. The protocol was approved at the University of Alberta under Research Ethics Board 2 (Pro00083768). Sample sizes were estimated with 80% power (cf, Brysbaert, 2019) using G*Power 
(Faul, Erdfelder, Lang & Buchner, 2007)
  +1, 0, -1) in a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (see right-hand panel of 
Figure   1
). Only a significant main effect of outcome was revealed [F(2,78) = 6.334, MSE = 107065, p =.003, ƞp 2 = .140], with significant speeding for draws (502 ms) relative to wins (hence, post-draw speeding; 650 ms; Tukey's HSD, p = .002) but not between losses (553 ms) and wins (p = .062). The main effect of draw value [F(2,78) = 0.327, MSE = 207042, p =.722, ƞp 2 = .008], and, the interaction between draw value x outcome [F(4,156) = 2.136, MSE = 43307, p =.003, ƞp 2 = .052] were not significant.
The proportion of shift behaviour following wins, losses and draws was calculated from the last 119 trials in each block (the first trial has no history; see 
Table 1
). In this way, an observed value less than the expected value of 66.6%
represents a bias towards stay behaviour, where an observed value more than the expected value of 66.6% represents a bias towards shift behaviour. Shift proportions were compared across outcome (win, lose, draw) and draw value (+1, 0,-1) in a twoway repeated-measures ANOVA (see left-hand panel of 
Figure 1
; the horizontal grey line represents the expected value of 66.6%). The main effect of draw value was not 


Discussion
Experiment 1 establishes a number of key observations with respect to the subjective interpretation of draw outcomes. First, there was a clear indication of postdraw speeding, in alignment with negative rather than positive valence interpretation.
Second, behaviour following draws was characterized by shift (70.70%) rather than stay (29.30%) behaviour, again consistent with reactions to negative (i.e., lose-shift)
rather than positive (i.e., win-stay) outcomes. Third, in terms of the quality of behaviour as a consequence of outcome, shift proportions following draws were closer to optimized MS performance compared to losses. This leads us away from the wholesale adoption of the view that draws are functionally equivalent to losses.
Finally, we note changing the value of a draw to -1 did not significantly impact behaviour less than changing the value of a draw to +1. Instead, an examination of 
Table 1
 shows a non-significant increase of shift behaviour when draws were assigned -1 (73.6%), relative to when draws were assigned both 0 (69.5%) and +1 (69.0%).

Experiment 2
The data from Experiment 1 identified distinct behavioural effects that underline the ambiguities associated with draws. Draws were aligned with negative outcome in that future actions were characterized by speeding rather than slowing, and, shift rather than stay behaviour, similar to losses. However, draws did not generate identical states as losses, since the degree of shift behaviour was equivalent to MS performance in the former case. Draws were also weakly aligned with positive outcomes in that the degree of shift behaviour was constant when the value of the draw was made explicitly positive but rose (non-significantly) when the value of the draw was made explicitly negative. In Experiment 2, we focused more specifically on the hypothesis that shift behaviour should increase-away from MS performance-via the explicit assignment of draw value equivalent to losses (-1) compared to wins (+1; c.f., 
West et al., 2006)
.
We also considered the contribution of a potentially hidden variable in Experiment 1-namely, the presence of a cumulative score. In addition to the immediate effect of adding or subtracting individual points on a trial-by-trial basis, cumulative scores provide a longer-range index of success or failure. This subjective,
Behavioural profiles following feedback 16 longer-range evaluation of outcome has support at a neural level, given the observation that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) represents current outcomes against the broader context of average task value 
(Holroyd & McClure, 2015)
. In particular, the presence of such cumulative scores may have been particularly important in Experiment 1 exactly due to the manipulation of draw value. Since MS opponents were used in all three conditions, participants experienced a broadly equivalent number of wins, draws and losses. Therefore, the degree of success / failure was equivalent across conditions. However, when draw outcomes were assigned to non-zero values, the use of +1 guaranteed an increasingly positive score as the block progressed, in contrast to the use of -1 guaranteeing an increasingly negative score. This is clearly borne out in the data from Experiment 1: the final average score when draw = 0 was -3.00 (SE = 1.30), when draw = +1 was +39.25 (SE = 1.85), and, cumulative score (present, absent) varied. Blocks were now 90 trials (4 conditions) rather than 120 trials (3 conditions) used in Experiment 1. Participants also reported their subjective impression of each condition along a visual analog scale from total luck to total skill, as part of a larger empirical exercise to be reported elsewhere. All other parameters in Experiment 2 were identical to Experiment 1.


Results
As in Experiment 1, the comparison of wins (33.39%), losses (33.75%) and
draws (32.85%) was not significant [F(2,708) = 0.757, MSE < .001, p = .473, ƞp 2 =
.021]. Median trial n RTs were submitted to a three-way repeated-measures ANOVA featuring draw value (+1, -1), cumulative score (present, absent) and outcome on trial n-1 (win, lose, draw). Only the two-way interaction between cumulative score x outcome was significant: [F(2,70) = 5.42, MSE = 18945, p = .006, ƞp 2 = .134]. The interaction showed both post-loss speeding (384 ms) and post-draw speeding (434 ms) relative to RTs following wins (510 ms) but only in cases where the cumulative score was present (Tukey's HSD, ps < .05).
Behavioural profiles following feedback 18 Reaction times when the cumulative score was present following wins were also slower than all outcomes when the cumulative score was absent 
(384,

 ms for losses, draws and wins, respectively). All other comparisons were nonsignificant, with the interaction arising from the magnitude of post-loss and post-draw speeding decreasing without cumulative score. In these respects, the presentation of an increasingly positive-going / negative-going score would appear to be a prerequisite for the reliable observation of speeding following 'negative' outcomes.

Discussion
Across Experiments 1 and 2 we conclude that there is a minor impact of adding 1 to a neutral draw value of 0, relative to a major impact of subtracting 1. This observation is consistent with the view that losses carry twice the subjective magnitude of their objective value 
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979;
Kubanek et al., 2015;
Yechiam et al., 2015)
. However, if we carry the principle that the negativegoing modulation of value should have a greater impact than the positive-going modulation of value irrespective of the outcome in question, then increasing the cost of loss from -1 to -2 should produce a stronger effect on shift behaviour than increasing the benefit of win from +1 to +2 produces on stay behaviour. Therefore, Experiment 3 applied the same value manipulations to win and loss value, once again combined with the presence or absence of cumulative score. In these regards, this final experiment serves as a test that ambiguous outcomes (draws) are more sensitive to value manipulations than explicit outcomes (wins, losses). 


Results
As in all previous experiments, the occurrence of wins (33.16%), losses Reaction times when the cumulative score was present following wins were also slower than all outcomes when the cumulative score was absent (498, 405, 453 ms for wins, losses and draws, respectively). Post-loss speeding was also significant in the cumulative score absent condition (Tukey's HSD, p = .030) and all other comparisons were non-significant.
All other ANOVA main effects and interactions were not significant: x outcome interaction [F(2,70) = 1.357, MSE = 39730, p = .264, ƞp 2 = .037], and, the three-way interaction [F(2,70) = 2.298, MSE = 31233, p = .108, ƞp 2 = .062].
Shift proportions were analysed across value (win-heavy, loseheavy),cumulative score (present, absent) and outcome (win, lose, draw) in a threeway repeated-measures ANOVA (see 
Figure 1)
 


Discussion
The data from Experiment 3 show that wins and losses do not respond to value manipulations in the same way as draws (Experiments 1 and 2). Contrary to expectations, increasing the cost of loss from -1 to -2 did not produce a stronger effect on shift behaviour than increasing the benefit of win from +1 to +2 in order to change stay behaviour (contra 
Forder & Dyson, 2016)
. As such, ambiguous outcomes (draws) appear more amenable to value manipulations than explicit outcomes (wins, losses).
Moreover, this cannot be due to the average absolute score achieved in the different It remains possible that the comparison between Experiments 2 and 3 is not exact, as the subjective change from 0 to +1 (or -1) in the case of draws is not as dramatic as the subjective change from -1 to -2 in the case of losses, or, from +1 to +2 in the case of wins (cf, Prospect Theory; 
Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)
. Indeed, more
Behavioural profiles following feedback 26 radical pay-off matrices regarding the value of wins and losses can be proposed (eg 
Pulford, Colman & Loomes, 2018)
. However, such refinements will reintroduce the confound of different average absolute scores across different conditions. Thus, the aim to equate the subjective rather than objective value of outcomes also has a number of hidden assumptions that will require consideration.


General Discussion
In the absence of explicit reinforcement or punishment, we must still evaluate the relative success or failure of our actions and prepare for future behaviour accordingly. The current data speak clearly to outcome instances which are-on the surface-neither gains nor losses.
Previous data have strongly argued for the draw experience to elicit negative rather than positive responses. For example, models of human performance are better when draws are directly punished in the same way as losses (that is, assigned the value of -1), rather than being neither punished nor rewarded (assigned the value of 0; 
West, Lebiere & Bothell, 2006)
. Similar profiles for draws and losses are shown in terms of a speeded bias towards shift behaviour, further implying their subjective interpretation as negative rather than positive (e.g., 
Cohen, Elger & Ranganath, 2007;
Forder & Dyson, 2016)
. While our data also support the contention that responses following draws will be initiated faster than those following explicit wins, and, that draws produce a future response switch (rather than stay) bias, the experience of draws is not wholly negative. This is borne out in the logic that fast rather than slow reaction times following loss represent a self-imposed limitation on future decisionmaking time that makes automatic, sub-optimal performance more likely 
(Yechiam & Hochman, 2013, p. 511;
Dyson et al., 2020;
Dyson, 2021)
. However, the post-draw Behavioural profiles following feedback 27 speeding observed in the current experimental series did not produce the same suboptimal performance as that observed for post-loss speeding. The average proportion of draw-shift behaviour was equivalent to that predicted by mixed-strategy performance wherein all three possible response associations between consecutive trials were equal (draw-stay ≈ 33.3%; draw-shift ≈ 66.6%). Such performance guarantees loss minimization and matches the approximation of mixed-strategy performance often observed following wins.
Moreover, draws allowed for a greater degree of behavioural flexibility relative to outcomes that were clearly marked as negative. Our data show that changing the value of draws also leads to changes in behaviour-specifically, assigning draws the value of explicit wins (+1) enabled an approximation of optimal behaviour (see above). In contrast, assigning draws the value of explicit losses (-1) lead to an increase in shift bias thereby placing the participant in a potentially precarious and exploitable competitive position (see 
Figure 1
). These comparisons strongly suggest another way in which draws can behave like wins rather than losses. The suggestion that the draw outcome as chameleon-like in nature, however, must be tempered by additional observations. Based on a reviewer's suggestion, we examined the degree of shift behaviour following wins (+1; 61.99%) in Experiments 1 and 2 against the concomitant behaviour generated by draws (+1; 66.62%) within those same conditions. We noted a significant reduction in win-shift behavior relative to drawshift behaviour, when both categories were assigned a constant value of +1 t[75] = -3.051, p =.003. Similarly, we examined the degree of shift behaviour following losses (-1; 74.10%) in Experiments 1 and 2 against the concomitant behaviour generated by draws (-1; 73.69%), we noted a non-significant difference in lose-shift behavior Behavioural profiles following feedback 28 relative to draw-shift behaviour, when both categories were assigned a constant value of -1: t[76] = 0.292, p =.771. Our reading of these results are that draw outcomes may more readily co-opt the behavioural signatures of explicitly negative, relative to explicitly positive, outcomes when the same values are assigned. If a +1 draw does not have the exact same properties as a +1 win, then value in and of itself cannot completely predict the behavioural consequences of outcomes.
Thus, the study of neutral outcomes will continue to represent an important addition to decision-making for two reasons. First, our current data imply a cognitive flexibility following draw trials that is not triggered by more clearly valenced wins and losses. This provides a clear route to studying the subjective aspects of outcome response, and how reaction to neutral trials may be shaped by preceding trial history.
For example, we have recently shown that relative to draw-draw trials, the trial outcome sequence of win-draw causes an increase in shift behaviour whereas the sequences of lose-draw causes a decrease in shift behaviour 
(Na, Zhang & Dyson, in preparation)
. The concomitant increase and decrease in shift behaviour appears to us as an objective manifestation of the subjective nature of signed prediction error theory 
(eg, De Loof, Ergo, Naert, Janssens, Talmsa, Van Opstal & Verguts, 2018;
Niv & Schoenbaum, 2008)
. In other words, draw trials preceded by a win are interpreted as worse-than-expected (making the draw appear more negative) whereas draw trials preceded by a loss are interpreted as better-than-expected (making the draw appear more positive). Second, introducing a third outcome (draw) requires a concomitant increase in the number of responses within the decision-making space. This is important as there are growing concerns as to the degree to which the modal use of binary decision-making paradigms severely limits our understanding of more Behavioural profiles following feedback 29 naturalistic, non-binary decision spaces 
(Yoo, Hayden, & Pearson, 2021
; see also 
Dabney, Kurth-Nelson, Uchida, Starkweather, Chassabis, Muno & Botvinick, 2020)
.
In sum, mitigating the adverse emotional and cognitive consequences of negative outcomes remains an important goal in the context of education, gambling and economics. However, our data show that moving away from binary conceptualizations of outcome is critical to understanding the full palette of subjective responses elicited by decision-making. Specifically, our consideration of draws highlights the subjective aspects of decision-making, and the ways in which supposedly neutral outcomes take on the hues of more clearly valenced results. The processing cascade generated by neither being explicitly reinforced or punished produces a complex behavioural profile containing elements found in both explicitly positive and explicitly negative results. The reaction to draws appears more flexible than those produced by wins and losses, and generates a response signature that is simultaneously positive and negative, but apparently never 'neutral'.

This was confirmed by further analysis of the degree of draw-shift as a function of draw value (+1, -1) and Experiment (1, 2 [score present conditions only]) via a mixed, two-way ANOVA.

The two-way interaction between cumulative score x outcome found in Experiment 2 replicated in Experiment 3: [F(2,70) = 3.340, MSE = 48207, p = .041, ƞp 2 = .087] in addition to a main effect of outcome: [F(1,35) = 7.321, MSE = 85044, p = .001, ƞp 2 = .173].As in Experiment 2, post-loss speeding (519 ms) and post-draw speeding (481 ms) relative to RTs following wins (658 ms) were only observed in the condition where the cumulative score was present (Tukey's HSD, ps < .004).

value conditions. The assignment of values as win +1, draw +1, lose -1 in Experiment Behavioural profiles following feedback 25 2 (mean final score = 29.67, standard error = 1.03) was functionally equivalent to the assignment of values as win +2, draw 0, lose -1 in the win-heavy condition of Experiment 3 (mean final score = 30.35, standard error = 1.37), just as the assignment of values as win +1, draw -1, lose -1 in Experiment 2 (mean final score = -30.86, standard error = 1.00) was functionally equivalent to the assignment of values as win +1, draw 0, lose -2 in the lose-heavy condition of Experiment 3 (mean final score = -31.44, standard error = 1.37). This was supported by the results of a twoway, repeated measures ANOVA with final score as the dependent variable. This yieldeda main effect of value [F(1,70) = 2163.64, MSE = 62.2, p < .001, ƞp 2 = .969] in the absence of main effect of experiment [F(1,70) = 0.002, MSE = 47.4, p = .966, ƞp 2 < .001], and in the absence of an interaction [F(1,70) = 0.231, MSE = 62.2, p = .632, ƞp 2 = .003].Although the presence / absence of a cumulative score does not play a role in the quality of decision-making, a consistent picture emerges from Experiments 2-3 in that the presentation of an increasingly positive-going / negative-going score plays a role in the speed of decision-making-namely, accentuating speeding following 'negative' outcomes. This reinforces the idea that individual moments of feedback are compared against a backdrop of historic performance (c.f.,
Holroyd & McClure, 2015)
, reminding us that reactions to outcome are idiosyncratic, and influenced by the salience of both internal and external signals.


from two recent studies described above, in which reduction in shift behaviour following draw relative to loss trials were observed: Dyson (2021): dz = Behavioural profiles following feedback 10 0.6894, one-tailed, yielding n = 15, and,Dyson, Stewart, Meneghetti & Forder   (2020): dz = 0.4217, one-tailed, yielding n = 37. ,78) = 1.274, MSE < .001, p = .286, ƞp 2 = .031], suggestive of long-run equivalence of outcomes in Experiment 1. Median RTs on trial n following wins, loses and draws at trial n-1 were compared across the three conditions (draw value:

Static pictures of blue-gloved (left; opponent) and white-gloved (right;

2016) were displayed center screen at approximately 12° x 6°, with participants sat
approximately 57 cm away from a 22" ViewSonic VX2757 Monitor. Stimulus
presentation was controlled by Presentation 20.2 (build 07.25.18) and responses were
recorded using a keyboard.

Participants completed 3 counterbalanced blocks of 120 trials. Within each block, the computerized opponent played Rock, Paper, Scissors 40 times each in a random order. With wins consistently assigned the value of +1 and losses consistently assigned the value of -1, the only difference between the conditions was the value assigned to draw trials (+1, 0, -1). At the beginning of each block, participants were informed how much game outcomes were worth. At the start of each trial, the participant was presented with a fixation cross and cumulative score for the opponent (bottom left) and player (bottom right). After pressing 4, 5 or 6 on the number pad (representing Rock, Paper, Scissors), the choices made by the opponent and the participant were displayed for 1000 ms. Choices were cleared over a 500 ms period, after which the outcome of the trial was displayed for 1000 ms. Scoring was updated during 500 ms and the next trial began.2.2 Results Statistica 13.3 (TIBCO Software) was used to analyze the data. The comparison of wins (32.92%), loses (33.97%) and draws (33.12%) collapsed across condition was not significant according to a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA


significant [F(2,78) = 0.215, MSE = .029, p = .807, ƞp 2 = .005], nor was the interaction between draw value x outcome [F(4,156) = 2.420, MSE = .010, p = .051, ƞp 2 = .058]. A significant main effect of outcome [F(2,78) = 16.874, MSE = .025, p < .001, ƞp 2 = .302] demonstrated that the degree of shift behaviour for wins (64.35%) was smaller than that for both losses (76.17%) and draws (70.70%). The degree of draw-shift behaviour was also significantly smaller than the degree of lose-shift behaviour (all Tukey's HSD, p < .05).Observed shift proportions following wins, losses and draws were also compared to the expected value predicted by the participant playing according to MS (66.6%) via one-sampled t-tests. Neither win-shift (t[39] = 0.875, p = .387) nor draw-
shift (t[39] = 1.885, p = .067) was significantly different from expected value, but
lose-shift (t[39] = 5.163, p < .001) proportions did supporting a significant bias
towards shift behaviour following losses.

Experiment 3
4.1 Method
36 participants were analyzed for Experiment 3. For the 35 individuals who
provided demographic information, 24 were women, 30 were right-handed, and the
mean age was 19.83 (sd = 2.85). All parameters in Experiment 3 were identical to
Experiment 2, apart from the value assignments of outcomes. In one condition, wins,
draws and losses were assigned +2, 0, -1, respectively, while in a second condition,
