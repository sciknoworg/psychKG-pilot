You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

exceptional performance involves asking experts to reflect on their skills and behaviours.
While introspection and self-reporting methods can provide some insight into human cognition, they may not always yield accurate information. This is due to the fact that people often have limited conscious access to their own mental processes, raising concerns about the reliability of these methods 
(Nisbett & Wilson, 1977)
.
Protocol Analysis provides an alternative to introspective methods, aiming to capture real-time cognitive processes with greater scientific rigour 
(Ericsson & Simon, 1980
, 1993
, Fox et al., 2011
. Unlike introspection, which relies on retrospective accounts, Protocol Analysis captures concurrent verbal data through the "think-aloud" method. This method involves asking subjects to verbalise their thoughts while performing a task, offering a more systematic way of capturing cognitive activity as it happens. While the think-aloud procedure has its limitations-it may not capture a complete record of cognitive processes-it is a nonreactive method. This means it doesn't alter performance or the cognitive mechanisms that mediate task performance 
(Fox et al., 2011)
. By studying the evolving thoughts of experts while they perform a task, we can gain detailed insights into the mechanisms that drive their performance.
Protocol analysis has been in illuminating various domains of expertise. De Groot's seminal work in 1946 established that chess experts do not instantly identify the best move; instead, they engage in elaborate planning and evaluation. Think-aloud protocols revealed that the players' memory skills-specifically, the ability to hold and manipulate chess positions in memory-were a critical aspect that contributed to their expertise 
(de Groot, 1946
(de Groot, /1978
Ericsson et al., 2000)
. The think-aloud methodology has also been applied to medical reasoning and diagnosis, another traditional area for studying expertise.
Think-aloud protocols have shown that expert medical practitioners often engage in "inductive forward reasoning," where they make a tentative diagnosis based on pattern recognition of symptoms, while novices employ more resource-intensive approaches to reasoning 
(Schmidt & Rikers, 2007)
. Similarly, think-aloud studies in the game of bridge reveal discernible differences between experts and novices. Expert bridge players, when planning a hand, perceive problems and constraints more accurately and plan more extensively than their less skilled counterparts 
(Charness, 1989)
.
Considering the insights gained from think-aloud protocols in various fields, this approach may be valuable in understanding the cognitive processes at play in fingerprint analysis. Our study aims to apply this technique to shed light on how fingerprint examiners navigate their decision-making. While we recognise that this method has its own limitations, it presents an opportunity to explore elements of the practice that could benefit from increased transparency and scrutiny.


Method


Design
This experiment was preregistered before data collection (see: https://osf.io/kz475/).
We used the Think Aloud technique to investigate the evolving thought processes of experts and novices as they engaged in fingerprint analysis. This method, proposed by 
Ericsson and Simon (1980)
, allows for the capture of sequential thought processes as participants verbalise their decision-making process. We adhered to the recommended instructions and procedures for protocol analysis, which include initial instruction, warm-up procedures, reminders to keep talking, and directing the participant to focus on the presented task rather than introspect and describe their thought processes 
(Ericsson & Simon, 1980
, 1993
.


Participants
A total of 44 qualified practicing fingerprint experts (25 females and 19 males, mean age = 43.64 years, SD = 8.41, mean experience = 14.89, SD = 7.75) from the Australian Federal Police, Victoria Police, and New South Wales Police participated in this experiment. We also tested 44 novices (25 females and 19 males, mean age = 43.64 years, SD = 8.67) who were matched with the experts in terms of age, gender, and education but had no formal experience with fingerprints. Both experts and novices completed this experiment, along with a suite of other tasks during the same testing session. Each novice received the identical trial sequences and completed each task in the same random order as their matched expert. Novices were recruited from The University of Queensland, The University of Adelaide, and Murdoch University communities, and the general Australian public and were paid $20 for their participation.
To further motivate novice participants, we offered them an additional $5 if they could reach or exceed the performance of their matched expert.


Materials
Our fingerprints were sourced from the NIST Special Database 300 
(Fiumara et al., 2018)
. The collection included both plain and fully-rolled impressions that were originally obtained in real-world policing settings, ensuring a representative variability in print quality.
We also used latent ("crime scene") and rolled ("arrest") prints from the Forensic Informatics Biometric Repository 
(Tear et al., 2010)
. These high-quality prints with known ground truth were collected from undergraduate students. Rolled exemplars were captured using ink onto standard 10-print cards, fully rolling each finger from nail-edge to nail-edge.
Latent prints were lifted from common crime scene surfaces (identified through examiner consultation) including gloss-painted timber, smooth metal, glass, and plastic. To approximate real crime scene variation, participants made contact by actions like "pushing on timber to open a door" or "safely grabbing a knife blade." Thus, interacting with objects generated realistic latent prints. In summary, the fingerprint stimuli comprised forensically relevant latent and rolled prints collected under controlled conditions from student volunteers.


Procedure
Participants were filmed using two Zoom Q2n video recorders. Before starting the experimental tasks, they were given pre-recorded video instructions on how to "think aloud". They were also presented with a series of warm-up problems, which allowed them to receive feedback on their verbal reports. They then proceeded to complete six trials, during which they were instructed to verbalise their thoughts while deciding whether two fingerprint impressions belonged to the same finger or two different fingers. The trials varied in difficulty (easy, medium, difficult), with half of them containing prints that matched, and the other half containing non-matching pairs. The easy pairs consisted of two fully rolled prints, while the medium and difficult comparisons presented a crime-scene print on the left and a rolled print on the right. One of our expert collaborators on the project assisted by categorising each pair of prints as easy, medium, or difficult, but did not participate in the experiment.


Data Analysis
Each participant's verbal reports were transcribed verbatim, and segmented into simple statements that reflect the natural bounds of phases in their speech. Portions of the text that did not reflect verbal thoughts, such as when the participant read the task instructions, as well as any other verbalisation not relevant to the task were eliminated from the segments. In addition, fillers such as "ehh, "umm" were removed. To extract common themes among the experts, we used an inductive thematic coding approach. This involved immersing ourselves in the data to become acquainted with the overall dataset and to identify recurring patterns. A coding scheme was created and applied to the entire dataset, and common themes were identified, extracted, and named based on these codes. The appropriateness of the resulting thematic structure was confirmed by inter-rater agreement.


Results


Performance Accuracy Analysis
We started our analyses by comparing the performance of experts and novices in correctly identifying whether two fingerprints belonged to the same person or not. The average performance of each participant across the 6 trials is represented in 
Figure 1
. We performed a one-sample t-test to compare the mean proportion of correct scores of experts and novices to a chance level performance (50%). Our results show that both experts (M = 93%, SD = 11%) and novices (M = 71%, SD = 22%) performed significantly above chance as indicated by the dotted line in 
Figure 1
, t(43) = 26.15, p < .001, d = 2.09 and t(43) = 6.32, p < .001, d = 1.03, respectively. A between-groups t-test revealed that experts' performance was significantly better than novices' on this fingerprint identification task, t(62.73) = -5.87, p < .001, d = -1.25, suggesting that experts excel compared to novices at determining whether two prints belong to the same person.

The dotted line indicates chance performance (50%), and the error bars represent the standard deviation. Each line connects two data points that belong to the same expert-novice pair, who completed the identical set of 6 trial sequences.


Verbal Protocol Analysis
Next, we analysed the think-aloud data. We identified 12 codes covering four general dimensions within the verbal protocols: feature search and comparison, planning and knowledge application, problem representation, and decision-making processes A definition and example of each code is presented in 
Table 1
 and the pie charts in 
Figure 2
 represent the proportional use of different codes in the verbal protocols of experts and novices. The verbal protocols were analysed in two phases: (1) a quantitative phase, where we analysed the proportion of each code used by expert and novice participants;
and (2) a qualitative phase, where we closely examined the content of each code to understand the nuanced differences in the decision-making strategies and thought processes of experts and novices. The results of both analyses are reported in turn.  


Global characteristics
The subject is iteratively analysing and comparing global characteristics of the two prints (e.g., pattern type, flow of ridges, general references to the core or delta, or references to other, global, yet superficial aspects of the images including size, colour, and orientation).
! "The shape of the arch is consistent" (Novice_35)
! "Not the same, different colours, one brighter than the other, even though the centre pattern looks similar", Novice_52).


Local characteristics
The subject is iteratively analysing and comparing local characteristics of the two prints (e.g., specific ridge details such bifurcations, dots, ridge endings, as well as the presence of scars, sweat pores and other finer level details).
! "I can see a bifurcation coming down between, probably halfway between the delta and the core that doesn't appear in the other one, not on the same spot anyway," 
Expert_47
Planning and knowledge application


Declarative and Procedural Knowledge
The subject states facts, rules and/or explicit procedures from memory to clarify decisionmaking.
! "I can't tell the pattern type. However, I do have a delta, so I can rule out that it's an arch. Arches don't have deltas," (Expert_24).


Planning and goal setting
The subject verbalises a goal or plan to proceed with their judgement, which may be tied to a specific or non-specific aspect of the print. It encompasses both the formulation of detailed, feature-oriented plans and broader, more general strategies that are not localised or feature-directed.
! "Now, it's possible that this may be a lot higher than where I'm looking, so I'm not getting a start down here, I'm going to look a lot higher." 
Expert_01
Problem representation


Print quality
The subject mentions an obstacle which makes it more difficult to make an identification, including reference to the poor quality of prints such that they ! "There's also a bit of a loop attached to the arch and it's hard to tell if that loop is also attached to the arch on the left-hand side are distorted, smudged, blurry, partial, or otherwise difficult to analyse.
because it's a bit smudged or something,"
Task limitations The subject acknowledges a barrier related to the limited availability of imagine manipulation tools such as altering the image colour, size, orientation or marking up the prints.
! "That's a big problem, not being able to zoom in nor make any adjustments,"


Uncertainty
The subject is unsure how to move forward with the judgement process, expresses confusion, uncertainty or is contradicting themselves.
! "They're similar but I don't think that they're the-oh, I don't know," (Novice_27).


Causal factor
The subject states a causal factor; factors that play a role in producing a problem/outcome. Causal factors may involve the biology of ridge formation, or the mechanics of fingerprint deposition, which include creasing, slippage, and distortion.
! "These ridges are definitely a lot fatter than these ones, which makes you think there's added bit of pressure." 
Expert_25
! "The core seems to be on a slightly different angleâ€¦ That may or may not mean anything, because when a finger moves on a surface, it's always the core that grips," (Expert_16)
Decision-making processes


Hypothesis generation
The subject makes an initial guess or makes a tentative decision typically early on in their analysis and often before they have considered all the evidence. The language used may be speculative, less decisive, or confident but not final.
! "By first impression, I'm thinking not from the same person," (Expert_04)
Validating data The subject identifies information needed to come to a solution to the problem or they are seeking more data to verify whether information gathered is correct and complete.
! "I'm already loving these two, but I love to be sure, so I want to find something unique." (Expert_62)


Falsification and Alternative explanation
The subject is looking for evidence to disconfirm their initial hypotheses or they identify an alternative explanation to a problem.
! "Now going to continue looking for differences to see if there is any differences before I would call an identâ€¦" (Expert_34).
! "Sometimes, differences can occur in the core because it's-of the pliability of fingerprints. Sometimes, staples could look like curves, vice versa, so I need something more solid than just looking at staples."
Critical appraisal The subject is weighing the evidence, making a statement about the quality, reliability and strength of the evidence or their level of confidence or risk associated with the evidence.
! "It's got quite unusual ridge formations, and here, in this sort of platform ridge area, we call it, and that's quite unusual. That gives me a lot of confidence that, yes, it's an identification." (Expert_16)

Code Frequency of Experts and Novices Note. Each data point represents the average use of each code used by one participant, with experts in purple and novices in yellow. The half violin plot shows the distribution of scores for each group, with a wider area indicating a higher density of scores. The error bars represent the standard deviation. Each line connects two data points that belong to the same expert-novice pair, who completed the identical set of 6 trial sequences.


Quantitative Analysis
To compare the use of each code by group, we first analysed the proportion of each code used by each individual and then calculated the average across each group. We used between-groups t-tests, applying Bonferroni correction, to compare the average proportion of each code used by experts with the average proportion of each code used by novices. During preliminary testing of assumptions for parametric statistical analysis, several variables failed to meet the criteria of normality and/or homogeneity of variances.
These variables include hypothesis generation, validating data, uncertainty, declarative and procedural knowledge, global characteristics, and critical appraisal. For these variables, we employed Welch's t-tests, which does not require the assumption of equal variances, instead of the conventional t-test. The numerical analyses are summarised in 
Table 2
 and 
Figure 3
 visually captures the code frequency of experts and novices.  Planning and Knowledge Application. Both experts and novices used planning and goal setting during their fingerprint analysis with comparable frequency. However, the depth, quality, and adaptability of these plans differed greatly between the two groups.
Experts demonstrated high adaptability in their problem-solving approach, characterised by continual reassessment and adjustment of goals and tactics. For instance, Expert_12's statement "I'm going to go in the other direction because I'm not really happy with the clarity down there" shows a willingness to modify goals based on specific challenges like clarity. Similarly, Expert_13's comment "Now, it's possible that this
[feature] may be a lot higher than where I'm looking, so I'm not getting a start down here;
I'm going to look a lot higher" reveals readiness to question and revise assumptions.
Additionally, their planning involves nuanced evaluation of evidence. Statements like "I'm going to go somewhere else because I like this crease here, that's standing out to me as well to follow from there" (Expert_12) and "Trying to find a start point, I'll be looking for things on both prints that are more discriminatingâ€¦details that might have a bit more discriminating power" (Expert_19) show how experts set specific goals related to feature quality and significance, not just searching for features but are considering their utility.
They are prepared to shift their focus based on the perceived importance.
In contrast, novices exhibited more limited adaptability, often coupled with uncertainty. Unlike experts who continually re-evaluate and adjust plans based on nuanced understanding of evidence, novices generally react to immediate obstacles as they arise. For instance, the comment "It doesn't feel right. Even the line-maybe if I go further out, further out, in that direction" (Novice_15) indicates novices often modify course only when directly confronted with challenges or uncertainties. Other statements like "I'm just trying to look for something in there that might be similar" (Novice_02) reflect novices' more observational approach rather than strategic, proactive planning. This lack of proactive planning results in a more fragmented, less structured problem-solving process.
Beyond adaptability in planning and goal setting, experts also stood out through their reliance on declarative and procedural knowledge. Experts occasionally drew upon a well-defined set of facts, rules, and procedures to guide their decision-making, planning, and goal setting. One example is the concept of "delta danger," a term experts used to indicate risks associated with analysing deltas. Deltas on different fingers can often have very similar minutiae patterns, increasing the risk of false positives. As Expert_50 noted, "Once again, starting off at the delta-and we always talk about delta danger, so we work out from the delta very quickly." This reflects the expert's use of both declarative knowledge (the concept of 'delta danger') and procedural knowledge (the strategy of working out from the delta quickly) to mitigate risks.
Additionally, experts typically adhered to established protocols, beginning their investigation with the "crime-scene" fingerprint and identifying potential features to compare with the known exemplar. Their analysis often shifted systematically from global to local features, highlighting a structured approach. Statements like, "We're supposed to work from the not known source to a known source so that you're not biased by one or the other" (Expert_05), reveal this rule-based approach. However, some experts acknowledged exceptions, valuing flexibility when warranted. For instance, one expert remarked, "Although I know we are supposed to go from the latent to the ink set, you can't help but notice-and it saves time-if you notice there's another one on there" (Expert_12). Another added, "Traditionally, even though I normally would like to go from the left to the right, the right is actually clearer, so I'm taking a few more visual clues from the right than I am on the left" (Expert_15).
Novices tended to base their knowledge and procedures on personal experiences and intuitions formed during the experiment. Their statements often reflected more experiential understanding compared to experts' formalised knowledge. Their direction of analysis was inconsistent, and focus between global and local features varied. This lack of a rule-based framework resulted in a more fragmented, less structured problem-solving process. This disparity demonstrates the importance of formal training and experience in shaping the cognitive strategies for complex tasks such as fingerprint analysis.
Problem Representation. How problems and obstacles were conceptualised and articulated emerged as key in fingerprint analysis for both experts and novices. This covered four dimensions: task limitations, print quality, uncertainty, and causal factors.
Both groups acknowledged task limitations like the inability to manipulate images at similar rates. However, proportional differences were observed in the other three dimensions.
Novices made a higher proportion of statements expressing uncertainty, indicating greater ambiguity in their decision-making process. Similarly, more of their comments related to print quality, focusing on perceptual challenges like smudging on the images.
Experts, instead, made more statements referencing causal factors-elements contributing a problem or outcome. These factors encompassed biological and mechanical aspects, from ridge formation biology to fingerprint deposition mechanics, including creasing, slippage, pressure, and distortion. For example, Expert_10 noted causal factors for ridge thickness variations: "some of the ridges are a lot thicker, some of them are a lot lighter down here," attributing them to "movement and pressure distortions." This shows that experts go beyond identifying challenges to understand their root causes.
Decision-making Processes. The process of reaching a decision during fingerprint analysis involves several cognitive steps across four key dimensions: hypothesis generation, validating data, falsification and alternative explanations, and critical appraisal.
Both experts and novices formed initial hypotheses or preliminary decisions early on.
While experts often used qualifiers like "By first impression" and "My initial thoughts" to preface their initial hypotheses, novices tended to be more definitive. This difference in tentativeness could indicate experts' deeper cognitive evaluation and awareness of complexities. The novices' less tentative approach may compromise their adaptability when confronted with new evidence, thus potentially affecting the quality of their final decisions.
While novices may settle prematurely on initial judgments, experts more often engaged in process validation. For example, Expert_25 emphasised the importance of performing a ridge count to confirm the spatial relationships between identified markers:
"One thing that I do make sure that I do, even though I'm already convinced that it's an identification, is that I will do a ridge count just to make sure that the spatial relationship between the markers that I've identified is actually correct." Similarly,  Some experts also integrated statistical understanding into their critical appraisal.
Mentions of "rare", "unique" and "discriminating", or conversely "common" and "typical" features or sequences factored into how much weight was assigned to that piece of evidence. As one expert elaborated, "This sequence is very rare and unique, so I'm starting to thinkâ€¦that it's the person, but I need to get a sufficient amount of points to call it a positive identification" (Expert_13).
The experts' evidence appraisal shows metacognition, continuously evaluating not just the evidence but also the quality and reliability of their own analytical processes. This involves adjusting confidence levels and using various evaluation methods. Novices' relative lack of critical appraisal highlights the cognitive depth and complexity expertise brings to analytical tasks like fingerprint analysis.


Discussion
In domains like fingerprint analysis that heavily depend on examiner judgments, understanding experts' reasoning and decision-making is vital to pinpointing their expertise and advancing best practices. Think-aloud protocols give invaluable insights into the cognitive processes underlying complex skills and expertise 
(Ericsson & Simon, 1980
, 1993
Fox et al., 2011)
. By eliciting examiners' thoughts as they analyse fingerprints, we aimed to gather information about the nuanced mental processes separating novices from experts. These insights can indicate training and practice improvements to enhance the validity, reliability, and transparency of this complex, high-stakes field.
Our analysis of think-aloud protocols revealed clear differences between experts' and novices' cognitive processes and strategies. Experts relied more on local print characteristics, showed greater adaptability in planning, and occasionally cited facts and rules guiding their analysis. Novices focused more heavily on global and surface-level characteristics, had more reactive and less structured planning, and based knowledge and procedures on personal experiences and intuitions formed during the experiment. Further differences emerged in problem representation and decision-making. While both groups recognised task limitations similarly, novices focused more on print quality as a challenge source. In contrast, experts identified more nuanced biological and mechanical factors creating analysis challenges. Experts also engaged in more tentative hypothesis formation and rigorous validation processes, critically appraising evidence and displaying metacognitive awareness. Overall, the findings highlight the increased structure, adaptability, domain knowledge, and critical thinking characterising fingerprint expertise.
These findings highlight key themes providing insights into fingerprint expertise while carrying important implications. In the following sections, we discuss these themes to shed light on enhancing the validity, reliability, and transparency of fingerprint analysis through improved training and practice. This discussion identifies gaps in current understanding and provides guidance to promote ongoing advancement of this complex domain.


Experience Shapes Attentional Focus
One key theme was that experience shapes attentional focus in fingerprint examination. Expert and novice analyses differed noticeably in depth and specificity.
Experts focused more on localised characteristics, while novices concentrated on broader global features, sometimes mistaking temporary or superficial details as unique identifiers.
Experts' capacity to disregard ambiguity and surface structure of similar prints to accurately discriminate them may be a hallmark of their expertise.
Research in perceptual expertise shows that with training and experience, there is an evolution in perceptual focus. Over time, experts typically become sensitive to features that best discriminate categories in their domain 
(Goldstone, 1998;
Kellman & Garrigan, 2009)
. Indeed, fingerprint training highlights minutiae like bifurcations as pivotal for identification, whereas global patterns like loops offer less discrimination. But such attentional shifts are not just strategic; they are also deeply rooted in perception.
Perceptual learning studies show diagnostic dimensions become distinctive through relevance, while irrelevant details become less distinguishable 
(Goldstone, 1998;
Haider & Frensch, 1996;
Honey & Hall, 1989)
. In other words, with training, experience and feedback, experts' attention heightens for important features while reducing for less important ones, likely explaining analysts' and novices' differing attentional focuses.
One interesting study shows this difference in attentional focus. Expert fingerprint examiners more often than novices failed to recognise a gorilla embedded in a print's global features 
(Robson & Tangen, 2023)
. This supports the idea that experts may have a narrower attentional window than novices. If largely attending to specific ridge details, experts may be 'blinded' to irrelevant global features like a gorilla or other surface details, constraining their attention to what is important. So how can training aid the development of this perceptual shift and maintain this fine-tuned expert focus?


Implications
Current fingerprint training often focuses on formal classification and identification rules, the standard for decades. While this refines examiners' focus, it lacks the depth of understanding from practical experience. In our study, experts averaged almost 15 years' experience, viewing hundreds of prints daily. This exposure is not just about quantity but diversity. Examiners encounter many superficially similar prints from different people, distinct prints from the same source, and everything in between. They also get feedback from case information (e.g., confessions) and colleagues. This extensive, diverse exposure likely progressively refines perceptions 
(Brooks, 1978
(Brooks, , 2005
Norman et al., 2007)
.
Automation potentially downsides this exposure. Designed for efficiency, automated systems may limit the variety of prints presented, dampening the extensive exposure crucial for expertise. Expanded training sets with diverse matching and non-matching prints, alongside corrective feedback, are needed. While the most effective design is uncertain, a program combining varied prints and formal rules would likely focus attention on pertinent characteristics more efficiently 
(Moxley et al., 2012)
. In other words, this training approach would reinforce the attentional focus distinguishing expert performance.
However, attentional focus is just one facet; how experts employ analytical processes also critically distinguishes their performance.


Experts Harness Analytical Processes
Analytic processes involve systematic, controlled evaluation of evidence before reaching conclusions, thought to improve decision-making by reducing biases 
(Kahneman, 2011)
. In various fields, focusing on articulable features significantly improves accuracy for both experts and novices 
(Norman et al., 1996;
Brooks & Hannah, 2006)
. Fingerprint guidelines similarly advocate methodically marking and comparing features before drawing conclusions 
(Ashbaugh, 1999;
SWGFAST, 2012)
.
In our study, experts clearly demonstrated these broader analytical processes and feature-based strategies. They verbalised both declarative and procedural knowledge, systematically applying established rules and protocols to identify key fingerprint features.
This focused approach likely aids in categorising and interpreting complex information more effectively 
(Brooks et al., 2000)
. Yet, our study also points to the complexities within this seemingly structured approach. While guidelines recommend initiating the analysis with the crime-scene print to minimise potential biases (PCAST, 2016), experts often revisit their initial findings after scrutinising a known sample. This recursive approach was defended by some experts as indispensable for refining their analyses. There might be cases when the known exemplar helps to highlight a significant feature or shows that a detail in the latent print, initially considered as "noise," is actually meaningful "signal."
While this recursive approach helps refine analyses, it also risks introducing circular to reconsider an initial "noise" classification as "signal." Further depth could come from documenting preliminary hypotheses about ambiguous features based on causal factors.
For instance, a feature may look like a lake or a short ridge depending on distortions. This additional causal documentation serves as both an internal check and external transparency, helping to make the case for the validity and reliability of recursion in the analysis process.
While these suggestions are compelling in theory, operational constraints like heavy caseloads and time pressures must be considered. Nonetheless, our findings point to needing a nuanced approach to fingerprint analysis that balances analytical rigour with expert flexibility. The ideal system would blend a robust rule-based framework with specific bias-mitigating documentation procedures while still accommodating expert intuition.


Navigating Biases for Reliable Conclusions
Our study also revealed explicit ways experts and novices attempt to navigate biases, specifically through validation, falsification, and alternative explanations. Early on, both form initial hypotheses. However, for experts, this is done cautiously. While early hypotheses can be useful starting points, they also risk premature closure, reaching conclusions without considering all evidence. To counter this, experts meticulously review and verify information through validation. Yet solely seeking aligning information can lead to confirmation bias.
Both experts and novices engaged in falsification and considered alternative explanations before concluding. However, the depth and basis differed significantly.
Experts' alternatives were rooted in nuanced understanding of causal factors like distortions. Novices based alternatives on surface features like image angle or rotation, often stemming from uncertainty rather than deep understanding.


Implications
Falsification and alternative explanations rigorously test conclusions rather than taking them at face value. Research supports these practices to enhance objectivity and mitigate bias in variety of decision-making contexts 
(Fahsing et al., 2023;
Lord et al., 1984;
Morewedge et al., 2015)
. 


Evidence-based Evaluation
Moving beyond methodological safeguards, understanding experts' evidence evaluation in practice is crucial. Our study shows fingerprint examiners exhibit far greater critical appraisal than novices. This involves weighing evidence, assessing its quality, reliability, and associated confidence or risk levels. Across the board, experts displayed a metacognitive approach, constantly reassessing their analytical methods' reliability.
However, different evaluation approaches and conclusion thresholds were evident among experts.
Many experts expressed the need to identify a sufficient number of points for a conclusion, but the exact number was not noted. This indicates that the thresholds for these decisions can vary among examiners. Some experts emphasise the quality of evidence, taking into account distortions like pressure movements and slippage during their critical appraisal. They might discount seemingly different details if they can be explained by factors such as distortion. Others incorporate statistical reasoning, considering the rarity of certain features as they evaluate a print. For instance, prints sharing a rare feature like a "trifurcation" are more likely to match than those with a common feature like a "bifurcation" 
(GutiÃ©rrez-Redomero et al., 2012)
. While the true statistical rarity of fingerprint patterns and minutiae remains unknown, it is likely that experts develop an intuitive statistical understanding from extensive casework, which aids them in efficiently discerning and processing critical patterns.


Implications
Fingerprint analysis guidelines do not provide a metric for specification of which features should be used for comparison nor does it provide criteria for judging whether the evidence is sufficient to support a conclusion 
(Haber & Haber, 2007;
Mnookin, 2008;
National Research Council, 2009)
. Rather than formal methods or quantified rubrics, examiners rely on their training and experience to make these judgements.
In light of this, there is an urgent need for rigorously collected data that can better inform the weighting of features during the interpretive process. Existing attempts to quantify the rarity of specific fingerprint features (e.g., 
GutiÃ©rrez-Redomero, et al., 2011;
GutiÃ©rrez-Redomero, et al., 2012)
 are fraught with limitations. For one, there is an absence of standardised terminology for identifying and categorising fingerprint features. This results in disparate methodologies across studies, making it challenging to compare or consolidate findings. Additionally, many existing data sets do not account for the positioning of specific features relative to core and deltas, leading to potentially misleading results. For instance, some areas of a fingerprint, like the core and delta, naturally produce a higher number of features.
Given these limitations, research is urgently needed to standardise minutiae terminology and develop more nuanced statistical models. Models should incorporate variables like minutiae density and location, especially relative to cores and deltas, to better capture fingerprint features' true discriminatory power. Such advancements could enable more effective cross-study comparisons and robust model development.
Achieving this could provide two key benefits. First, empirically-grounded guidelines would enable examiners to make more reliable identifications. Second, more robust statistical models would offer the judicial system an improved scientific foundation for evaluating fingerprint evidence reliability, ensuring legally sound decisions.


Conclusion
In summary, our think-aloud study provides important insights into the cognitive processes underlying fingerprint expertise, highlighting key differences between experts and novices. While think-aloud methods do not capture all internal processes, they offer a useful window into complex decision-making. Our findings highlight key themes related to attentional focus, analytical strategies, bias navigation, and evidence evaluation to help advance training, practice, and research in fingerprint analysis. Key implications include balancing intuitive and analytical skills in training, developing more nuanced and transparent documentation procedures, incorporating falsification practices, and driving statistical advancements to aid in evidence weighing. However, more research is required to deepen understanding and translate findings into evidence-based policies and frameworks. The identified themes serve as a foundation for future empirical work aimed at clarifying expertise and strengthening forensic examination.

Feature
Search and Comparison. Feature search and comparison were crucial for both experts and novices in their fingerprint analysis. Most of their statements involved detailed examination and comparison of fingerprint features, categorised as either global characteristics or local characteristics. Global characteristics included pattern type (e.g., arch, loop, whorl), ridge flow, often called Level 1 features, and included broader aspects like size, colour, and orientation. Local characteristics focus on unique Level 2 and Level 3 features such as such as minutiae (ridge endings, dots, bifurcations), sweat pores, incipient ridges, and the presence of scars.Other key differences emerged between experts and novices, particularly in terminology and focus. While experts used precise, domain-specific language, novices often used inaccurate or vague terms when describing fingerprint features, indicating their unfamiliarity with the terminology. Experts took a more granular approach, more often noting local characteristics and their position relative to other features like the core or delta. Novices largely focussed on global characteristics, despite their limited specificity for identification. They were also distracted by irrelevant factors like colour and size. Some novices were misled by scars or distortions, treating them as unique identifiers when they can change over time or between impressions. Experts exercised caution in such cases, as Expert_49 noted: "I need to look at an area away from that to do the comparison because of the scarring. If it's not permanent or if the latent was before the scar, we can't always tell." This shows the depth and specificity experts bring compared to novices' relatively broad, surface-level approach.


Expert_16 seeks further evidence to verify initial conclusions, stating, "At this stage, I'm thinking it's not an identification, but I also like to double-check other characteristics and to double-check my conclusions." This practice indicates a more methodical, evidence-driven approach by experts.Both experts and novices engaged in falsification and considered alternative explanations similarly. This reflective approach involved seeking disproving evidence and exploring different possibilities before settling on a conclusion. However, for experts, these considerations were grounded in nuanced understanding of causal factors, relying on a deep knowledge of underlying mechanics and biology of fingerprint formation. For instance, one expert's exploration of alternative explanations was influenced by factors like distortion and movement, as shown in the statement: "Coming down from that, I've either got a lake or just another short ridge. It will depend on any sort of distortion or movement when I examine the rolled impression" (Expert_50).


Incorporating documentation of initial hypotheses and falsification attempts into reports could directly counter confirmation bias through transparency. Structured protocols combining falsification and alternatives may further reduce subjectivity risks. However, formal research is still needed on integrating documented falsification and alternatives into fingerprint analysis. Controlled studies could assess whether mandated documentation of hypotheses and falsification attempts improves accuracy and transparency. Developing evidence-based guidelines would promote reliable practices.

In contrast, novices' alternative explanations seemed rooted in a sense of uncertainty and low confidence rather than deep understanding. Furthermore, their statements often concerned more superficial elements of print variation, like image angle or rotation. For example, statements like, "The general slant here, it looks slightly different here to me, but that could be that it's on a different angle" (Novice_09) reflect this surfacelevel focus. Unlike experts, who examine causal factors behind observed features, novices seem to fixate on less relevant attributes.Lastly, critical appraisal separated experts and novices. This process informed their evaluations and final decisions by weighing the evidence, assessing its quality, reliability, and associated confidence or risk. Many experts expressed needing "sufficient number of points", suggesting a quantitative element to evidence appraisal, though no exact numerical threshold was specified. This indicated a qualitative dimension also exists, where experts deem certain features more significant in their evaluations.
Experts used multiple methods to evaluate evidence, pointing to a qualitative nature
of evidence appraisal. One expert weighted reliability based on location, noting, "This
looks like a bifurcation, but my weighting is quite low because it's the edge of a print"
(Expert_62). Others considered factors like pressure movements and slippage. As one
said, "Taking into account if there's pressure movements, slippage, that's something
you've got to take into account... You don't just discount it, you keep looking. That's not about making it fit; it's knowing that we can be comfortable as far as whether that's an identification or not" (Expert_60).


ImplicationsGiven the balance between analytical rigour and the flexibility offered by recursive approaches, how can fingerprint processes be refined? The answer lies not just in rigidly adhering to established protocols but in enriching them with the nuanced understanding that experts bring to the table. Our findings suggest that existing frameworks may be too rigid, often neglecting the complexities that experts navigate through recursive analysis. Champod, 2011). Our findings on experts' nuanced causal understanding are invaluable here. If recursive analysis is used, documentation should include specific causal factors, like pressure variations or surface conditions, that led them
This indicates a need for research aimed at developing new protocols that allow for this
flexibility while safeguarding against pitfalls.
One immediate step is enhancing transparency and accountability in analysis.
Examiners should disclose any adjustments to their initial examinations. Specific
procedures like documentation could track iterations for transparency about challenges
and biases that may influence analysis. Existing suggestions already call for a such
documentation (Langenburg &
reasoning and confirmation; examiners may see what they expect to see, rather than what
is objectively there. So, it's a double-edged sword: removing recursion limits biases but
could also limit valuable insights.
While rules and protocols have merits and drawbacks, our study suggests experts
possess additional analytical understanding. This deeper, more nuanced grasp goes
beyond procedural and declarative knowledge. It involves a robust conceptual
understanding of factors causing print variations, like pressure effects on ridge detail. This
conceptual depth enables better distinguishing meaningful signal from irrelevant noise. It
may also safeguard against bias when experts recursively analyse prints. Their nuanced
grasp of causal factors allows more critical evaluation of whether to reconsider a latent
print detail, thereby providing a safety net against biases clouding judgment.
