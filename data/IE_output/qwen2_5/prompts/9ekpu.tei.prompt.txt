You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

The role of attention control when performing complex real-world tasks
A robust finding from the cognitive psychology literature is that the amount of information humans can temporarily hold in consciousness at any given time is severely limited (e.g., 
Atkinson & Shriffrin, 1968;
Broadbent, 1958;
Cowan, 2001;
Jahanshahi et al., 2008;
Lachman et al., 1979;
Miller, 1956;
Shannon & Weaver, 1949)
. 
Miller et al. (1960)
 coined the term working memory to distinguish between the passive holding of information (short-term memory) versus memory involved in planning and carrying out behavior in the service of ongoing mental activity. The concept of working memory was therefore developed to refer to the more controlled and adaptive aspects of information processing. More formally, working memory can be defined as a limited capacity system that allows the temporary storage, manipulation, and maintenance of information in performing complex cognitive tasks (c.f., 
Baddeley, 2000)
 and can be conceived as a description of how short-term memory is used while under cognitive load. 
Baddeley and Hitch (1974;
 also see 
Baddeley, 1992)
 later developed the tripartite model of working memory, which heavily influenced subsequent research on working memory and human cognition more broadly. In this model, working memory consists of two storage systems the phonological loop for verbal information and visuospatial sketchpad for visual/spatial informationand the central executive. The central executive is a flexible system that is responsible for the processing and manipulation of information, such as integrating information from the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad and connecting short-term memory to long-term memory 
(Baddeley, 2000)
. The central executive is also particularly important for managing the flow of information in situations of high cognitive load or demand in which capacity limits are exceeded and selective attention is required (e.g., 
Fukuda et al., 2016;
Unsworth et al., 2004)
.


Working Memory Capacity


Definition and Assessment
The functional capability of one's working memory system is known as working memory capacity and is often indexed in terms of the number of units of information an individual can hold in primary memory at a given time (often referred to as span) while under cognitive load.
Working memory capacity tasks are similar to simple span measures of short-term memory, in which a series of to-be-remembered stimuli are presented followed by immediate recall, but working memory measures must necessarily involve additional cognitive demand 
(Table 1
; see 
Conway et al., 2005;
Oberauer, 2005)
. The purpose of the additional demand is to prevent the respondent from rehearsing to-be-remembered information, thereby requiring them to maintain and manage the memoranda in a manner requiring more controlled processing, thus engaging the central executive. In complex span tasks 
(Figure 1
), this additional demand is in the form of a secondary processing (distractor) task based on the storage plus processing working memory hypothesis laid out by 
Baddeley and Hitch (1974)
. But the additional demand can come in other forms, for example in working memory updating tasks cognitive load is imposed via the requirement to continuously add new information into primary memory at the expense of previously relevant, but now irrelevant, information (see 
Figure 2
 for two examples of updating tasks).


Task Additional Cognitive Demand Classification Notes
Operation Span 
(Turner & Engle, 1989)
 Interwoven processing task (basic arithmetic)
Complex Span Verbal memoranda. Storage and processing tasks are independent. Tends to be less predictive than spatial WMC tasks for higher ability individuals which may be ameliorated by adding larger set sizes 
(Draheim et al., 2018)
 Reading Span 
(Daneman & Carpenter, 1980)
 Interwoven processing task (reading comprehension)
Complex Span Verbal memoranda. Tends to be less predictive than spatial WMC tasks. Processing task may be tied to storage task (e.g., remember the last word of each passage) Symmetry Span 
(Unsworth et al., 2009)
 Interwoven processing task (symmetry judgment)
Complex Span Spatial memoranda. Storage and processing tasks are independent Rotation Span 
(Kane et al., 2004)
 Interwoven processing task (judge whether rotated letter is forward-facing or a mirror image)
Complex Span Spatial and bivalent memoranda. Storage and processing tasks are independent Counting Span 
(Case et al., 1982)
 Interwoven processing task (simple counting)
Complex Span Numerical memoranda. Appropriate for young children. Processing task may be tied to storage task (e.g., remember the counts of each set of stimuli)
Running Span 
(Pollack et al., 1959)
 Continuous dropping of previously relevant information to accommodate new information


Updating
Correlates strongly with complex span tasks and loads onto same factor as complex span 
(Broadway & Engle, 2010;
. Predicts incremental variance in Gf over complex span 
(Shipstead et al., 2014)
 N-back 
(Kirchner, 1958)
 Continuous dropping of previously relevant information to accommodate new information Updating Used widely in neuroscience research. Challenged as a measure of WMC due to weak correlations with complex span and does not load onto same factor as complex span 
(Harrison, 2017;
Kane et al., 2007;
Miller et al., 2009;
Redick & Lindsey, 2013)
 Mental Counters 
(Larson & Saccuzzo, 1989)
 Continuous dropping of previously relevant information to accommodate new information Updating Performance seems jointly attributable to WMC and Gf 
(Colom & Shih, 2004;
Hicks et al., 2016;
Mackintosh & Bennet, 2003)
 Backwards Span 
(Wechsler, 1939)
 Mental transposition of memoranda during recall (report in reverse serial order as stimuli were presented)


Transposed Serial Recall
Combined with forward (simple) span in the WAIS-IV 
(Wechsler, 2008)
 to assess WMC. Results are mixed as to whether it assesses STM or WMC 
(Egeland, 2015;
Engle et al., 1999;
Hilbert et al., 2015;
Oberauer et al., 2000;
Rosen & Engle, 1997)
. St 
Clair-Thompson (2010)
 and St Clair-Thompson and Allen (2013) argue that backwards span is a WMC measure in children but a STM task in adults due to the relative difficulty of mental transposition


Letter-Number Sequencing
Mental transposition of memoranda during recall (report numbers in ascending order then letters in alphabetical order)


Transposed Serial Recall
Included in the WAIS-IV to assess WMC. Like backwards span, challenged as a measure of WMC as mental transposition during recall may not impose a sufficient cognitive load to prevent rehearsal (e.g., 
Egeland, 2015)
 Non-Selective Visual Arrays 
(Luck & Vogel, 1997)
 Rapid visual presentation; attentional capture (with larger set sizes)
Change Detection Performance may be jointly attributable to WMC and attention control 
(Fukuda et al., 2016;
Martin et al., in press)
 Selective Visual Arrays 
(Vogel & Machizawa, 2004)
 Rapid visual presentation; attentional capture; selective attention


Change Detection
Challenged as a measure of WMC as it is argued that individual differences in performance are primarily due to attentional factors 
(Draheim et al., 2021;
Martin et al., 2021
; see 
Fukuda et al., 2016;
Vogel et al., 2005)
. This is discussed further in the section of this article on the measurement of attention control. 
Table 1
. Commonly Used Working Memory Capacity Tasks. WMC = Working memory capacity; STM = short-term memory; WAIS = Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Note that this is by no means an exhaustive list and, in general, if a procedure involves the immediate recall of to-beremembered information, that task or procedure has almost certainly been considered a measure of working memory capacity by someone. Critically, working memory tasks, like tests of most traits, are not all interchangeable, and thus caution must be exercised when evaluating research in which different tasks are used to measure the same underlying ability or construct. 
Figure 1
. Complex Span Tasks. In each task, the storage and processing components are independent. After 2 -9 trials of storage + processing are presented, the examinee is asked to recall the memoranda in the order in which they were presented. Performance is often scored using the partial span score, which is simply the total number of items recalled in the correct position (see 
Conway et al., 2005)
. Pictures are to scale. In running span, to-be-remembered stimuli are presented sequentially and the respondent is asked to recall the last n of them in order. Here, n = 3 and the correct response is "6, 1, 3". (b) In this example of mental counters, the respondent begins each trial by imagining the number "555". Then, a series of cues quickly flash above or below lines that correspond to each counter, indicating that the respondent should update the original number by adding (flash above line) or subtracting (flash below line) 1 from the appropriate counter. In this example trial of set size 3, the correct response is "554". Presentation times in updating tasks are generally quick to prevent rehearsal. Not to scale.


Psychological Importance
Working memory capacity has become an important construct in cognitive psychology as it has been repeatedly shown that it is a broad and domain general ability (e.g., 
Kane et al., 2004)
 that correlates with a wide range of cognitive abilities and real-world behaviors, often above other predictors. Further, many psychopathologies and situational phenomena are marked by deficits in working memory capacity, and it is often suggested that higher levels of working memory capacity provide protective effects. The list of abilities and phenomena associated with working memory capacity is long but include: language and reading comprehension 
(Daneman & Carptener, 1980;
Daneman & Merikle, 1996)
, quantitative ability 
(Engle and Turner, 1989)
, acquisition of native language 
(Gathercole & Baddeley, 1989)
 and second language

To provide some context for the popularity of assessing working memory capacity, our lab website has links to several versions of the complex span tasks for download. They have been downloaded thousands of times and independently translated into over fifteen languages despite the tasks requiring access to proprietary software (E-Prime) and an expensive license.
According to Google Scholar, as of August 22, 2021, the methodological review and guide to measuring working memory capacity 
(Conway et al., 2005)
 has been cited over 3,000 times and the article that introduced the computerized version of the operation span task ) has more than 2,000 citations. Further, the first two papers showing that complex span performance correlates with reading comprehension and scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test combine for over 12,000 citations 
(Daneman & Carpenter, 1980;
Turner & Engle, 1989)
.
Clearly, there is great interest in discovering and explaining associations between working memory and behavior.


Connecting Working Memory Capacity, Fluid Intelligence, and Attention Control


Importance of Attention Control
One of the most notable features of working memory capacity is its substantial correlation with fluid intelligence, which is the ability to reason in novel situations 
(Engle et al., 1999
). The precise magnitude of this relationship has been the subject to debate, but the two constructs typically share at least half of their variance at the latent level (see 
Kane et al., 2005;
Oberauer et al., 2005)
. The relationship is sometimes considered to be causal in that individuals with higher levels of working memory capacity can better store and maintain representations that allow for generating and testing of hypotheses in fluid intelligence tasks (e.g., 
Chuderski et al., 2012;
Kali, 2007;
Kyllonen & Christal, 1990;
Shah & Miyake, 1996;
Verguts & De Boeck, 2002)
. But 
Engle (2002)
 proposed that attentional mechanisms largely account for individual differences in both working memory capacity and fluid intelligence, and therefore attentional mechanisms are the primary and causal reason for the relationship between the two constructs (see 
Barrett et al., 2004;
Engle, 2002;
Engle et al., 1999;
Heitz et al., 2005;
2006;
Shipstead et al., 2016;
; also see 
Burgoyne et al., 2019;
Wiley et al., 2011)
. This executive attention view of individual differences in working memory capacity is notably compatible with 
Kovacs and Conway's (2016)
  To map the executive attention theory of individual differences in working memory capacity to the 
Baddeley and Hitch (1974)
 model, the most important aspect of working memory is the central executive component and not the storage systems. Initial evidence of this claim came largely from extreme-groups studies showing that individuals who perform poorly on working memory capacity tasks also perform worse on attention-demanding tasks that have minimal memory demands. For example, individuals with a larger working memory capacity are better able to avoid looking at a flashing distractor in their peripheral vision to catch a target on the opposite side of the screen 
(Unsworth et al., 2004)
, quicker to narrow the size of their visual lens to only include stimuli in a target area of space 
(Heitz & Engle, 2007)
, better able to ignore their name in a dichotic listening task when it appears in the to-be-ignored channel , better at filtering distracting color words in Stroop tasks 
(Kane et al., 2001)
, and are less likely to experience attentional lapses 
(McVay & Kane, 2009)
.
In a recent elaboration on the executive attention view, 
Shipstead et al. (2016)
 proposed that maintenance and disengagement represent core top-down attentional mechanisms through which working memory capacity relates to fluid intelligence ( 
Figure 3a
). According to this hypothesis, maintenance and disengagement are both necessary in performing working memory capacity and fluid intelligence tasks, but measures of working memory and fluid intelligence place differential demands on one or the other 
(Figure 3b
). Working memory tasks place more demand on maintenance and fluid intelligence tasks place more emphasis on disengagement (see also 
Mashburn et al., 2020)
. While the mechanisms of maintenance and disengagement are in opposition of one another, they work in tandem to facilitate goal-directed behavior. As such, the strong relationship between working memory capacity and fluid intelligence can be explained by their common reliance on a top-down executive attention system, which regulates both maintenance and disengagement. This top-down executive attention system is how attention control is implemented, which we define as the general ability to engage in goal-directed behavior via, 1) maintaining goal-relevant behavior and information, particularly in the face of distraction and interference, and 2) filtering or otherwise blocking irrelevant and inappropriate information and behavior. Therefore, what distinguishes working memory capacity from attention control is that the former places more emphasis on specifically maintaining information in primary memory, whereas attention control refers to how limited-capacity domain-general attention is applied to the management of goal-directed behavior, which may (or may not)
involve the maintenance of multiple pieces of information (also see 
Martin, Mashburn et al., 2020
). In the maintenance/disengagement hypothesis, top-down signals in the form of attention control organize maintenance and disengagement around a particular goal (a). The relative emphasis on maintenance and disengagement in carrying out these top-down goals relies largely on the nature and demands of the to-be-performed task (b). The pie charts show the hypothetical relative proportion of total performance variance attributable to specific processes. For example, working memory tasks will require more maintenance than disengagement, whereas fluid intelligence tasks will require more disengagement than maintenance. The mental counters task (illustrated in 
Figure 2b
) may correlate about as strongly with both fluid intelligence and working memory capacity measures because maintenance and disengagement are required to roughly the same degree. The percentages are for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered veridical.
In the maintenance/disengagement hypothesis, attention control is the commonality between working memory capacity and fluid intelligence and therefore the primary reason that these constructs (and perhaps all higher-order cognitive abilities) are related is due to their reliance on top-down executive attention (see 
Burgoyne & Engle, 2020
; also see 
Conway et al., 2021 and
Rueda, 2018 for similar views)
. It should therefore be the case that, in most situations, attention control is a better indicator of one's overall cognitive capability than working memory capacity and/or fluid intelligence alone. In other words, knowledge of an individual's ability to control their attention should explain more variation in higher-order cognitive behaviors and performance than either working memory capacity or fluid intelligence.
Indeed, several independent lines of research support the theoretical position that attention control underlies higher-order cognition and therefore working memory capacity's broad predictive powers can be largely attributed to attentional factors rather than the maintenance of information specifically (e.g., 
Draheim et al., 2021;
Fukuda et al., 2016
, McCabe et al., 2010
McVay & Kane, 2012a;
Gray et al., 2017;
Rueda, 2018;
Tsukahara et al., 2020)
.
Some of these studies involve measuring various abilities and testing whether attention control can mediate (or account) for the relationships between other cognitive abilities at the latent level.
Examples include 
Draheim et al., (2021)
, a large-scale correlational study of 396 students and community members in which the authors found that the strong relationship between working memory capacity and fluid intelligence was no longer statistically significant when accounting for the shared variance between the two constructs and attention control 
(Figure 4
). Similarly, 
Tsukahara et al. (2020)
 found in each of two independent datasets that the relationships between sensory discrimination ability and working memory capacity -and sensory discrimination ability and fluid intelligence -were both completely accounted for by attention control. McVay and 
Kane (2012a)
 found that the relationship between working memory capacity and reading comprehension was no longer statistically significant after accounting for the shared variance with mind wandering and other attention control measures. And, finally, 
Frith et al. (2021)
 reported results suggestive that individual differences in attention control are the reason for the relationship between fluid intelligence and creativity. Partially based on these findings, we argue that attention control should demonstrate greater predictive power for cognitive behavior and real-world outcomes as opposed to working memory capacity or even fluid intelligence.


Figure 4. Attention Control Mediating the Working Memory Capacity-Fluid Intelligence
Relationship. Structural equation model from 
Draheim et al. (2021)
 showing that the relationship between working memory capacity and fluid intelligence is not statistically significant when attention control is added as a mediator. The numbers on each path between the constructs can be likened to correlations between the latent (unobserved) abilities, with the path between working memory capacity and fluid intelligence representing the relationship between the two abilities that was leftover after the contribution of attention control was partialled out. Each construct was measured with three tasks, which are shown here along with their respective factor loadings (likened to the correlation between each task and its corresponding construct). Note that this study included ten total attention control tasks, and full mediation of the working memory capacity-fluid intelligence relationship was present with multiple combinations of accuracybased attention control measures, but not in models involving reaction time-based attention control tasks. N = 396.


Attention Control or Long-Term Memory?
Our argument is that individual differences in working memory capacity are primarily attentional in nature and that attention control mostly accounts for working memory capacity's strong relationship with an array of cognitive behaviors and phenomena. But, there are competing theories, and it is feasible that working memory capacity has a unique relationship to some aspects of cognitive behavior which cannot be fully accounted for by attention control (e.g., more lower-level processing which depends more on short-term memory capacity than goal maintenance). Examples of phenomena which may be driven more so by individual differences in short-term and working memory capacity than attention control may include rate of encoding into long-term memory 
(Fukuda & Vogel, 2019)
, long-term associative learning 
(Jones & Macken, 2018)
, and creation of false memories (e.g., 
Peters et al., 2007)
. Some models and theories of working memory therefore place less emphasis on the role of attention (see 
Adams et
 al., 2018 for a review) and more on other processes, most notably long-term memory, which is often closely linked with working memory in many theoretical and descriptive models of working memory (e.g., 
Baddeley, 2000;
Cantor & Engle, 1993;
Cowan, 1988;
Lewis-Peacock & Postle, 2008;
Oberauer, 2002;
Ruchkin et al., 2003)
. A well-known example is
Cowan's embedded process model, in which working memory is effectively information in longterm memory that is both activated and within the focus of attention 
(Cowan, 1988;
1999;
 also see 
Oberauer, 2002 and
Ruchkin et al., 2003)
. 
Baddeley (2000)
 also revised the 
Baddeley and Hitch (1974)
 multicomponent model of working memory by adding a fourth componentthe episodic bufferto incorporate the role of long-term memory in working memory (see 
Figure 5
). Baddeley stated that the episodic buffer "â€¦comprises a limited capacity system that provides temporary storage of information held in a multimodal code, which is capable of binding information from the subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a unitary episodic representation" (p. 417). Baddeley's motivation for adding the episodic buffer was to account for more complex aspects of cognition in working memory and emphasize integration of the subsystems rather than their isolation. For example, several studies showed that individuals with short-term memory deficits also displayed long-term memory deficits, suggesting a stronger interaction between long-term memory and short-term memory than assumed under the original model (also see 
Burgess & Hitch, 2005
).  
Baddeley (2000)
. Baddeley updated the multicomponent model to include the episodic buffer, in large part to account for the contributions of long-term memory to working memory. It is noteworthy that, according to Baddeley, the episodic buffer is controlled by the central executive as are the original two storage systems (visuospatial sketchpad and phonological loop), and that the central executive is synonymous with attention control.
Individual differences research supports that one particularly important aspect of working memory capacity is the ability to perform a controlled search of activated information contained in long-term memory (e.g., 
Mogle et al., 2008;
Unsworth & Engle, 2007;
Unsworth & Spillers, 2010)
. For example, 
Unsworth and Engle (2007)
 proposed a dual-component model which postulated that limitations in working memory (i.e., individual differences) arise due to individual differences in: (1) the ability to active maintain information in primary memory (involving both short-term memory capacity and attention control) and (2) the ability to search for and retrieve information from secondary memory. To elaborate on the 2 nd component,
Unsworth and Engle assumed that capacity limitations result in lost and displaced items from the contents of primary memory, thus necessitating controlled search and retrieval from long-term (secondary) memory to recover them. Individual differences in working memory capacity therefore arise partially due to individual variation and limitations in the ability to perform this recovery, for example differing ability to initially encode items in long-term memory or combat proactive interference. These sources of individual variation were argued to be at least partially independent from attention control, and in a test of this idea,  found that a full mediation of the working memory capacity-fluid intelligence relationship was possible, but only when primary memory capacity, attention control, and secondary memory were all included in the model as mediators, and that these three factors each had an independent contribution to the working memory capacity-fluid intelligence relationship (see also 
Unsworth & Spillers, 2010)
. They therefore concluded that individual differences in attention control, memory capacity, and long-term memory retrieval were jointly responsible for producing individual differences in working memory capacity and thus the likely mechanisms behind the strong criterion validity of working memory capacity measures.
While many researchers have linked working memory and long-term memory and shown that long-term memory processes are an important aspect of individual differences in working memory capacity, it is not clear whether the ability to search and recover information from secondary memory into working memory is an independent or separable from the ability to control attention more generally. For example, in discussing the episodic buffer being added to the multicomponent model, 
Baddeley (2000)
 stated that the buffer was assumed to be controlled by the central executive, which he noted was "an attentional control systemâ€¦" (p. 418), and that attentional mechanisms were largely responsible for the binding and integration of information in the episodic buffer specifically and working memory more generally. This is largely consistent with our lab's view and supported by our recent finding that attention control fully accounted for the working memory capacity-fluid intelligence relationship 
(Draheim et al., 2021)
. Further, we would argue that the most parsimonious reason other studies (e.g., 
Unsworth & Spillers, 2010;
 have failed to find a full mediation with attention control alone is due to methodological considerations with how attention control is typically measured, which is the focus of the next section.


Assessing Individual Differences in Attention Control
Even though attention control has been identified as a central and important ability for human cognition (e.g., 
Broadbent, 1957;
Engle, 2002;
Norman & Shallice, 1986;
Posner & Snyder, 2004)
, the role of working memory capacity has largely been studied and emphasized more so for explaining real-world behaviors, performance, phenomena, and outcomes. This is likely because the claim that attention control is the most predictive marker or driver of cognitive performance remains contentious, largely owing to how difficult it is for researchers to establish a strong and coherent factor of attention control and related mechanisms 
(Draheim et al., 2021;
Friedman & Miyake, 2004;
Hedge et al., 2018;
Rey-Mermet et al., 2018;
. We have argued that this difficulty has not been because of theoretical or substantive reasons, but instead because most measures of attention control are psychometrically poor (see 
Draheim et al., 2019;
. In this section, we discuss the challenges investigators face when trying to assess individual differences in attention control and describe some recent work aimed at addressing these challenges.


Challenges with Measuring Attention Control
Perhaps the most widely used working memory capacity measures, complex span, were theoretically motivated tasks specifically developed for individual differences research 
(Daneman & Carpenter, 1980;
Kane et al., 2004;
Turner and Engle, 1989)
. They work well for this purpose because between-subjects variance is sufficiently large and reliability is high, producing strong individual differences and therefore adequate statistical power to detect correlations of interest (see 
Cronbach, 1957
 for the differences between the experimental and individual differences approach). Subsequent research in individual differences in working memory capacity were successful thanks to the availability of psychometrically strong and validated tasks, and it was soon found that working memory capacity was strongly associated with intelligence and myriad other abilities. On the other hand, investigators studying individual differences in attention control were not afforded the same luxury. Studies of attention control often failed to show shared variance among tasks designed to measure inhibitory processing (e.g., 
Earles et al., 1997;
Friedman & Miyake, 2004;
Kramer et al., 1994)
. Because of the continued failed attempts for researchers to establish a coherent factor using attention tasks, some researchers have questioned whether the same inhibitory and attentional mechanisms are involved in performing different tasks (e.g., 
Hedge et al., in press;
. Most notably, 
Rey-Mermet et al. (2018;
 found little evidence of a common cross-task attentional ability and argued that it was time for researchers to simply stop thinking about "inhibition" as a unitary concept. In other words, they concluded that a general ability to control attention does not exist.
At present, the issues of measurement of attention and whether attention control is a psychometric construct are topics of debate among researchers. This is further complicated in that studies of attention control often operationalize it in terms of "inhibition", and it is not entirely clear if what is labeled as inhibition is equivalent to what we and others call attention control (i.e., jingle-jangle fallacies; 
Kelley, 1927
, also see 
Conway et al., 2021
 for terminology confusion in this area). On the surface, it would appear so because, (a) many of the same tasks are traditionally used to measure these abilities (such as Stroop, flanker, antisaccade; see 
Figure   6
), (b) inhibition appears to be a common way to conceptualize broad attention control (e.g., 
Rey-Mermet et al., 2018;
von Bastian et al., 2020)
, and, (c) some authors seem to use attention and inhibition interchangeably (e.g., 
Friedman & Miyake, 2004)
. On the other hand, it may be that what is commonly called inhibition is a specific and much narrower ability than attention control (c.f., 
Friedman & Miyake, 2017;
Draheim et al., 2021)
. To facilitate discussion, throughout this article we assume that what is called inhibition is similar enough to our view of attention control, namely because the same tasks are being used to measure an underlying ability, and inhibition is often considered one of the most important functions or facets of the more general attention control. But it should be noted that the term inhibition does appear to be overly used in the literature, and likely reflects a wide variety of measurement tasks and mechanisms (see 
Bjork, 1989)
. We also argue strongly that attention control is much broader than inhibition.
For example, one aspect of attention control that may not be encompassed by a narrower conceptualization of inhibition is the ability to maintain current task goals and avoid attentional lapses. Such lapses can be internally driven via intrusive and task-unrelated thoughts which disrupt task performance (known as mind wandering). Research suggests that individual differences in mind wandering are distinct, but correlated, with susceptibility to external distraction (e.g., 
Unsworth & McMillan, 2014)
 and correlated with both working memory capacity and fluid intelligence 
(Kane & McVay, 2012;
McVay & Kane, 2012a;
Unsworth & McMillan, 2014)
. Mind wandering researchers often emphasize that attentional lapses in the form of intrusive and task-unrelated thoughts are a sustained attention failure which result in extremely slow reaction times and therefore poor performance (known as the worst performance rule, see 
LÃ¶ffler et al., 2021;
McVay & Kane, 2012b;
Welhaf et al., 2020)
. Another aspect of attentional lapses may be more on the micro-level, for example when performing an antisaccade task (see 
Figure 6a
) the respondent has a very brief window to execute the appropriate saccade away from the distractor and toward the target on the other side of the screen. Any attentional lapse, even for a fraction of the second, can have a deleterious effect on performance if said lapse occurs at a critical part of the trial (i.e., just before or as the distractor appears). We hypothesize that part of the reason for our finding from 
Draheim et al. (2021)
 that attention control fully mediated the working memory capacity-fluid intelligence relationship was because our attention control battery involved measures which heavily tapped the ability to avoid not only macro-level attentional lapses but also micro-level ones, thereby affording higher ability participants to apply intensive attentional resources to the trials as needed. 
Figure 6
. Attention Control Tasks. (a) In this version of the antisaccade task 
(Hutchison, 2007)
, the respondent is asked to start each trial by looking at the center of the screen. A distractor appears on one side of the screen and then a target letter (Q or O) appears for only 100 ms on the other side. The respondent is asked to identify the letter. Accuracy rate is the dependent variable for this version, although some versions are scored using reaction time, difference scores (in reaction time or accuracy, using prosaccade trials as baseline), or eye-tracking with no behavioral response. For added effect, the distractor may blink several times while on screen. (b) In the color Stroop task, a color word is presented and the respondent is asked to indicate the color of the ink in which the word is printed. On congruent trials, the word and ink color match. On incongruent trials, they do not. The dependent variable is usually the difference in reaction time between incongruent and congruent (baseline) trials, although accuracy differences are sometimes used.   
Hedge et al., 2018;
Paap & Sawi, 2016;
Rey-Mermet et al., 2018;
von Bastian et al., 2020)
.
At the core of this problem is that individual differences in attention have historically been assessed using paradigms born out of the experimental approachthe epitome of which is the Stroop task 
(Stroop, 1935;
Figure 6b
). In the basic version of this task, the test-taker is asked to resist the automaticity of reading a color word to instead name the color of ink in which the word is printed. For example, they see "RED" in blue ink and are asked to respond by pressing a key corresponding to the response "BLUE". One of the most robust and almost universal findings from this paradigm is known as the Stroop effect, which is that responses are slower and more error-prone when the color word is incongruent with the color of ink it is printed in (e.g., "RED" in blue ink), as opposed to when the two are congruent (e.g., "RED" in red ink). The Stroop task, and similar measures such as flanker 
(Figure 6c
; 
Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974
) and
Simon 
(Simon & Wolf, 1963
; collectively known as conflict or interference tasks) have a rich history within the experimental literature and are successful in experimental research 1 for the very same reason that makes them poorly suited to individual differences researchthe minimization of between-subjects variance (see 
Cronbach, 1957;
Draheim et al., 2019;
Hedge et al., 2018)
. The typical finding that tasks which exhibit strong and robust experimental effects fail to produce strong and reliable individual differences was dubbed "the reliability paradox" by 
Hedge et al. (2018)
, and there are several reasons for this phenomenon. We have argued that the primary reasons for why popular experimental tasks are typically poorly suited to correlational research are the use of difference scores and reaction times to assess task performance in many widely used measures of attention, as well as the failure for researchers to account for speedaccuracy interactions (see 
Draheim et al., 2019
 for an extensive review and analysis of this problem).


Difference Scores
The logic of using difference scores follows the 
Donders (1868
Donders ( /1969
) subtraction methodology, in which the difference is taken between two related but different variables to separate out cognitive processes (or, sometimes, to assess change over time), with one variable serving as the baseline or control. This method has been criticized for not isolating processes of interest as well as believed (e.g., 
Sternberg, 1969;
Verhaeghen & De Meersman, 1998)
. Further, while difference scores can maximize statistical power when comparing performance at the group level, making them particularly useful in experimental designs 
(Overall & Woodward, 1975
; but see 
Mashburn et al., 2020)
, they are clearly suboptimal for individual differences pursuits (see 
Cronbach & Furby, 1970;
Draheim et al., 2016;
Edwards, 2001;
Hedge et al., 2018;
Lord, 1956;
Paap & Sawi, 2016)
. This is because subtraction effectively removes the (generally strong) correlation between the two component scores, which, by nature, is reliable variance, thereby increasing the overall proportion of unreliable variance in the resulting difference score. The extent to which reliability is lost depends primarily on (1) the reliability of the component scores, and

Reaction Time and the Relationship between Speed and Accuracy
Another factor that we argue contributes to problems with attention measures is the use of reaction time, specifically regarding individual differences in speed-accuracy emphasis (see 
Draheim et al., 2018;
Heitz, 2014;
Luce, 1986;
Wickelgren, 1977)
. Individuals naturally differ on the extent to which they prioritize speed and accuracy (e.g., 
Forstmann et al., 2011;
Starns & Ratcliff, 2010)
, and diffusion modeling studies from Hedge and colleagues have shown that individual differences in speed-accuracy emphasis are correlated across attention tasks even in young adults 
(Hedge et al., 2019;
in press)
. At issue is that most attention measures are scored not only using difference scores, but difference scores in reaction time, as is the case with conflict tasks in which the dependent variable is usually the difference in reaction time between incongruent and congruent trial performance. This is problematic in that the underlying processes reflected by reaction times have been shown to be multiply-determined and not process pure (e.g., 
Hedge et al., 2019;
Miller & Ulrich 2013;
Verhaeghen & De Meersman, 1998)
. Further, accuracy rates are often completely ignored and unaccounted for in these measures, meaning that respondents with the same general ability to control their attention will score differently on, say, a Stroop or flanker task if they have differences in baseline speedaccuracy emphasis and/or if they adjust their speed-accuracy emphasis during the task. Scores will also be affected by the extent to which any speed-accuracy relationships and interactions are systematically related to cognitive ability, for example if higher ability individuals slow down on a task after making an error to minimize the chances of committing subsequent errors (e.g., 
Draheim et al., 2016)
. To that end, 
Hedge et al. (in press)
  To summarize, we believe that applied research has emphasized the role and importance of working memory capacity more so than attention control for two primary reasons. The first is simply inertia, early research on individual differences in working memory capacity was successful in establishing it as a broad and domain-general construct and other researchers were quick to expand this work when it was shown that working memory capacity correlated substantially with intelligence. Second, the availability of several psychometrically sound and accuracy-based measures of working memory capacity facilitated this surge of research. In contrast, assessing individual differences in attention control has not been so straightforward.
Researchers interested in individual differences in attention control adopted established paradigms from the experimental literature, which proved to be poorly suited for correlational research for a variety of reasons. In our estimation, the lack of psychometrically strong attention control measures has undoubtedly stunted theoretical advancements in this area and likely set research back decades, just as 
Friedman & Miyake (2004)
 predicted could happen if improved measures were not developed. However, the problems are being addressed, and the possibility exists that assessing individual differences in attention will soon be as streamlined as assessing differences in other notable abilities such as working memory capacity and fluid intelligence.


Overcoming the Challenges
Despite the controversy over measurement of attention control, we argue that there are reasons to be optimistic. One reason is that a pair of psychometrically sound attention control tasks has existed for some time. The first, the antisaccade task, is an instructionally simple yet highly difficult task that requires the respondent to look away from a flashing distractor on one side of the screen to instead catch a target on the opposite side before it is masked (see 
Hutchison, 2007
; 
Figure 6a
). If the respondent looks in the direction of the distracting stimulus for even a moment, they will be unable to identify the target. This design is effective because animals are evolutionarily wired to look at something flashing in our environment, as this suggests movement which could indicate the presence of either danger or food (e.g., 
Howard & Holcombe, 2010)
. Therefore, the respondent must override or otherwise inhibit this strong evolutionarily engrained behavior to look toward the distractor, a quintessential example of a situation in which the control of attention is required. Another paradigm, visual arrays, is a change detection task in which stimuli are very briefly flashed on the screen and then re-appear after a short delay 
(Figure 7)
. In a typical visual arrays task, one of the stimuli change in some manner from the first display to the second on half the trials, and the respondent's job is to judge whether something has changed. Performance on visual arrays is usually transformed into a capacity (k) score which is an estimate of how many items the individual can hold in primary memory (see 
Cowan et al., 2005)
.
Psychometrically speaking, the appeal of the antisaccade and visual arrays tasks are that they are entirely accuracy-based measures that do not involve difference scores for measuring performance. Because speeded responding is not required, the aforementioned issues with reaction time are avoided (see 
Draheim et al., 2019;
. Chiefly, individual differences in speed-accuracy emphasis and processing speed should be minimally impactful on the overall accuracy score. These desirable characteristics are shared with many successful measures of working memory capacity and fluid intelligence, and thus reliability and criterion validity of antisaccade and visual arrays approach that of measures such as complex span and matrix reasoning tasks (see 
Draheim et al., 2021)
. Unfortunately, many versions of antisaccade are employed -some variants involve reaction time and/or difference scores, and characteristics (namely visual angle and presentation timings) of the task need to be properly tuned to produce sufficient individual variation. As such, antisaccade tasks only sometimes display high reliability, strong inter-correlations and factor loadings, and strong correlations to other cognitive measures (see Appendix B of Rey-Mermet et al., 2018; also see 
Hutton & Ettinger, 2006
 for a review of antisaccade). As for visual arrays, this paradigm is often thought to be a measure of visual working memory capacity, which is evident in that performance is usually transformed into capacity (k) scores 
(Cowan et al., 2005)
. This classification is sensible given the task involves holding target stimuli in primary memory, but a growing body of research supports our contention that individual differences in performance of some types of visual arrays tasks are due more to attentional factors than memory (e.g., 
Balaban et al., 2019;
Cusack et al., 2009;
Draheim et al., 2021;
Fukuda et al., 2016;
Fukuda & Vogel, 2011;
Martin et al., 2021;
Souza & Oberauer, 2015;
Vogel et al., 2005;
Wheeler & Treisman, 2002)
. Critically, visual arrays tasks can be broken down into two categories, selective and non-selective (see 
Figure 7
). Non-selective visual arrays do not involve distractors and therefore place no demand on filtering irrelevant stimuli. On the other hand, selective versions of visual arrays include distractors, and generally a prompt before each trial indicates which subset of the to-be-presented stimuli should be selected and which subset should be ignored. For example, the respondent might see "BLUE" just before the presentation of the first array consisting of both red and blue stimuli, which means they should only attend to the blue items and ignore the red ones. While the case can be made that individual differences in non-selective visual arrays performance are jointly attributable to working memory and attentional mechanisms, what is clearer is that individual differences in selective visual arrays are primarily attentional in nature (c.f., . Several studies have shown that the additional filtering demand produces large individual differences attributable to selective attention, as performance is greatly reduced for individuals who do not attend to the selection cue (also possibly due to mind wandering or lack of ability to sustain attention) and/or are unable to properly select the target stimuli and ignore/filter the irrelevant stimuli (see 
Draheim et al., 2021;
Fukuda et al., 2016;
Martin et al., in press;
Vogel et al., 2005)
. Additionally, 
Fukuda and Vogel (2009;
2011)
 found that individual differences in selective visual arrays performance were in part due to individual differences in the ability to recover from attentional capture. 
Fukuda and Vogel (2011)
 noted the similarities of resisting attentional capture in visual arrays with the demand to override prepotent eye movements toward distractors in the antisaccade, and we would argue both tasks place a strong demand on avoiding micro-level attentional lapses to intensely focus attention at a critical point in each trial. Supporting this, we recently found in 
Draheim et al. (2021)
 that antisaccade and selective visual arrays performance correlated strongly (r = .45), loaded onto an attention factor in the .60 -.70 range, and had statistically equivalent correlations to working memory capacity and fluid intelligence composite scores. These were very strong effect sizes for two very different tasks, and much larger than the typical correlations of around r = .10 -.20 and factor loadings below .40 for Stroop and flanker tasks (e.g., 
Friedman & Miyake, 2004;
Rey-Mermet et al., 2018)
. 
Figure 7
. Visual Arrays Task. In this version of the task (see 
Shipstead et al., 2014)
, an array of rectangles briefly appears, disappears, and then re-appears with one rectangle probed with a white dot. The respondent is asked to indicate whether this probed rectangle changed orientation from the initial display. Accuracy performance is typically converted into a capacity (k) score to estimate how many items the respondent can hold in primary memory. The trial shown is set size 3, and so 100% accuracy on a series of such trials would produce a k score of 3, whereas 50% (chance) performance would produce a k score of 0. (a) No distractors present (non-selective visual arrays); (b) Respondent is cued to attend to only a subset of the to-be-presented stimuli, and distractors are presented with the targets (selective visual arrays). Not to scale.
Another reason for optimism is recent and ongoing developments to create and validate new measures of attention control. In 
Draheim et al. (2021)
 we argued that developing new and modified tasks was a straightforward way to tackle the challenges in assessing attention control (c.f., 
Friedman & Miyake, 2004)
. We reasoned that avoiding difference scores and either controlling for accuracy (using adaptive procedures) or pushing all performance variance into accuracy (by making reaction time irrelevant) would increase the chances of the task having psychometric properties on par with measures of working memory capacity and fluid intelligence. We administered a combination of ten existing, new, and modified attention tasks.
Included among these were modified versions of the Stroop and flanker tasks that involved adaptive response deadlines or presentation times and were designed to assess how quickly one could respond or how brief the presentation of the target stimulus could be at the same level of accuracy for each participant. We also included an accuracy analog of the psychomotor vigilance task, which is a reaction time-based sustained attention task which asks the respondent to press a key as soon as a timer on the screen begins counting up from zero. While we found that the two strongest attention measures (according to the criteria we outlined in the paper 2 ) were the pure accuracy versions of antisaccade and selective visual arrays tasks, the accuracy analog of the psychomotor vigilance task was just behind them, and the three modified Stroop and flanker tasks were also clear improvements to their reaction time and difference score counterparts. To quantify the relative improvements, performance in the antisaccade and visual arrays tasks each had about five times as much reliable and predictive variance as the traditional 
Stroop and 2
 The criteria we used to assess the relative strength of each attention task were as follows: (1) reliability (both internal consistency and test-retest), (2) average correlation with all other attention measures, (3) average factor loading when testing all possible tri-indicator combinations of the ten attention tasks, and (4) average correlation with Z-score composites of working memory capacity (three complex span) and fluid intelligence (Raven's, number series, and letter sets).
flanker tasks and the three modified Stroop and flanker tasks had around three times as much. By using these more reliable measures of attention control, we found that attention control fully mediated the relationship between working memory capacity and fluid intelligence at the latent level ( 
Figure 4
). Importantly, we only found this full mediation when the attention control factor was composed of tasks with accuracy-based dependent variables that did not it is yet to be established that this finding can be replicated, ideally across labs and with different populations and diverse tasks for the relevant constructs.
The central claim of this article is that these recent developments in the understanding (e.g., 
Shipstead et al., 2016;
Tsukahara et al., 2020)
 and measurement (e.g., 
Draheim et al., 2021;
Martin et al., 2021)
 of attention control provide a solid foundation from which to argue that attention control is more important than working memory capacity for explaining higher-order cognitive performance, both in and outside the laboratory (see also 
Burgoyne & Engle, 2020;
Mashburn et al., 2020)
. In the following sections, we outline several areas of research in which working memory has been identified as an important predictor of real-world outcomes. For each, we provide explicit reasoning for why we think attention control better explains these phenomena.


Review of Working Memory and Attention in the Real World
In the following review of specific areas of applied research, we encourage the reader to keep in mind that the quality and nature of measurement may vary substantially across studies.
Researchers often employ different tasks to measure the same construct, use the same tasks but
give a different label to the underlying ability, use only one task but frame their findings as if they had measured a construct, administer too few trials to too few participants (see Rouder &
Haaf, 2019), do not have a representative sample, and so on. In the following review we will generally grant that constructs have been assessed with some validity so as not to distract from the overall argument, but on occasion it will be necessary for us to mention methodological considerations to properly evaluate a study and the authors' conclusions.
A recurring theme throughout this literature review is that working memory and attention are intertwined 
(Engle, 2002)
 and therefore difficult to disentangle. It is commonplace for researchers to hypothesize that behaviors are driven by attentional mechanisms but use working memory tasks (e.g., operation span) to index "executive attention" or as a proxy for attentional mechanisms. This practice is understandable given that many theories of working memory involve attention as a central component (see 
Baddeley, 1992;
Engle, 2002)
. But because attention tasks with minimal storage demands (e.g., measures of attention control) are often less reliable and predictive than, say, complex span tasks, researchers who used working memory tasks as a proxy for attention were more likely to find significant results than researchers who instead used the traditional, and flawed, measures of attention control. This is relevant throughout this review, and we encourage the reader to keep in mind that individual differences studies of attention control and inhibition have historically relied on psychometrically poor measures, and so correlations involving these tasks are expected to be highly attenuated and thus conclusions drawn by the investigators using these measures may minimize the role of attention control in favor of other abilities (often working memory capacity and/or intelligence). 3


Education, Learning, and Child Development
Working memory is a powerful explanatory tool for children's learning, classroom performance, and overall academic achievement, as illustrated by the opening lines of chapter 5 in Dehn 
2008
:
"Working memory capacity is more highly related toâ€¦ learning, both short-term and long-term, than is any other cognitive factor" -P. Kyllonen
Educational and psychological research on working memory (e.g., 
Gathercole et al., 2006;
Swanson et al., 1990)
 over the past 20 years has repeatedly affirmed the hypothesis that working memory processes underlie individual differences in learning ability.
Working memory is required whenever anything must be learnedâ€¦ (p. 92)
Indeed, there is a solid basis for these claims and some research has shown that working memory capacity is an even better predictor of early academic achievement than psychometric intelligence (e.g., 
Alloway & Alloway, 2010;
Cockcroft, 2015)
. The formation of new concepts and accumulation of information involves the manipulation of information and eventual storage into long-term memory, which requires information passing through working memory. Working memory has thus historically been viewed as a portal to long-term memory, particularly in early 
3
 Intelligence is also widely used in applied research as both a predictor and an outcome. However, the scope of the present article is generally limited to the literature using working memory and attention as explanatory or predictor variables for real-world behavior, we will refer to intelligence only when necessary to facilitate the conversation regarding working memory and attention.
stages of development when learning is most important due to low levels of knowledge and automatized skills 
(Cowan, 2014;
Forsberg et al., in press
). An individual with low working memory capacity will struggle to combine capacity, speed, knowledge, and strategies necessary for problem solving, inference making, and learning of complex skills and concepts 
(Alloway, 2006;
Cowan, 2014;
Halford et al., 1998;
Reid, 2009)
. It is therefore not surprising that working memory capacity predicts an array of behaviors important for learning and classroom performance, such as reading comprehension 
(Daneman & Carpenter, 1980)
, reasoning ability 
(Kyllonen & Christal, 1990)
, direction following 
(Engle et al., 1991)
, long-term memory retrieval , and language acquisition 
(Gathercole & Baddeley, 1989
).
To quantify these relationships, according to the Woodcock-Johnson III Technical Manual 
(McGrew & Woodcock, 2001
), working memory capacity has an aggregate correlation over r =
.50 with eleven specified achievement clusters for children and adolescents in the domains of reading, writing, comprehension, reasoning, and mathematics.
Working memory is therefore often implicated as a cause of learning disabilities, and students with low working memory capacity generally perform poorly in classroom settings (e.g., 
Cowan, 2014;
Gathercole et al., 2006;
Sabol & Pianta, 2012)
. Reduced working memory capacity is viewed as a causal source of the co-occurrence of inattentive behavior and working memory problems 
(Diamond, 2005;
Gathercole et al., 2008)
 and may mediate the (negative) relationship between trait anxiety and academic performance 
(Owens et al., 2008)
. Some researchers argue that working memory limitations are the primary cause of learning disabilities (see 
Dehn, 2008)
, whereas another argument is that both working memory capacity and fluid intelligence contribute to learning disabilities because they work together to support problem solving in facilitation of learning and educational achievement 
(Cockcroft, 2015;
Cowan, 2014
).
If we interpret this argument with the lens of the maintenance/disengagement framework 
(Shipstead et al., 2016)
, then it would be expected that attention control is the primary driving force behind learning and, by extension, scholastic achievement.
It is often hinted or implied that scholastic achievement and learning difficulties have an attentional origin. Working memory is sometimes fractionated into different components, such as visuospatial working memory, verbal working memory, and executive working memory 
(Dehn, 2008
). 4 Executive working memory refers to the central executive system of the 
Baddeley and Hitch (1974)
 model and is synonymous with executive attention/attention control. It has been argued that executive working memory is by far the best predictor of learning ability. For example, Dehn (2008) stated, "Research has consistently found students with specific learning difficulties to be most deficient in the executive processing components of working memory 
(Swanson et al., 1990
)" (p. 96) and "Executive-loaded working memory tasks provide the best discrimination between children with and without learning disabilities 
(Henry, 2001
)" (p. 96).
Supporting these assertions, 
Gathercole and Pickering (2000)
 tested 6-and 7-year-old children and reported that scores on their central executive subtest scores predicted performance on arithmetic, vocabulary, and literacy a year later above and beyond scores on the phonological or visuospatial subtests.
There is also extensive and diverse research more explicitly outlining the role of attention in learning and academic achievement. For example, it has been shown that higher levels of anxiety result in worse academic performance and working memory capacity is thought to 
4
 While this practice may be questioned due to the body of research establishing the domain-generality of working memory capacity (e.g., 
Chein et al., 2011;
Colom & Shih, 2004;
Kane et al., 2004)
, evidence and utility for domainspecificity has been reported (e.g., 
Demir et al.,2014;
Mackintosh & Bennett, 2003;
Shah & Miyake, 1996)
. 
Harrison et al. (2015)
 noted that while the bulk of the reliable performance variance in working memory tasks reflect a domain-general and unitary underlying ability, roughly 1/3 of the variance in each task can be attributed to narrower abilities. It should also be noted that short-term memory tasks appear to involve more modality-and domain-specific processing than working memory. mediate this relationship 
(Owens et al., 2008)
. But another hypothesis is that anxiety produces specific attentional deficitssuch as the propensity for a student high in anxiety to divide attention, devoting attentional resources to task-irrelevant thoughts and behaviors (see 
Beilock, 2007)
. A systematic review by 
Polderman et al. (2010)
 found that attentional factors were strong correlates of academic achievement even after controlling for intelligence, socioeconomic status, and comorbid disorders. Similarly, 
Steinmayr et al. (2010)
 found that scores on a sustained attention test moderated the relationship between intelligence and grades in high school students, and that error rates on this sustained attention test predicted overall school performance above and beyond intelligence. In a longitudinal study, 
Rhoades et al. (2011)
 reported that kindergarteners' attention level was a strong mediator of their preschool emotional knowledge and their 1 st grade academic achievement, even after accounting for socioeconomic status and verbal skills. 
Bull and Espy (2006)
 reported that inhibitory control substantially predicted mathematical performance in preschoolers even when age, verbal intelligence, and maternal education were factored out, and inhibition also accounted for 12% of variability in mathematical skills in preschoolers above and beyond working memory capacity. Finally, St Clair-Thompson and  administered a battery of executive functioning tasks to middle schoolaged children and found that working memory capacity and inhibition each uniquely predicted various measures of scholastic achievement and attainment in mathematics, science, and English.
Other scholars have argued that reading comprehension is heavily dependent on attention specifically the ability to discard previously relevant but now irrelevant information (e.g., De
Beni & Palladino, 2000; 
Carretti et al., 2009;
Savage et al., 2006)
. For example, difficulties in mathematics and problem solving may arise less so due to working memory factors and instead due to limitations in the ability to filter or otherwise block irrelevant information (e.g., 
Passolunghi et al., 1999;
Passolunghi & Siegel, 2001)
. In a review on the role of working memory in learning disabilities, 
Swanson and Siegel (2011)
  and secondary tasks when put into a divided-attention situation. Finally, 
Fenesi et al. (2015)
 argued that researchers interested in education and learning often too strongly emphasize the short-term storage aspects of the 
Baddeley and Hitch (1974)
  have difficulties with reading comprehension, which can be misinterpreted as a working memory issue and therefore misdiagnosed as dyslexia, resulting in parents and teachers attempting to correct a suspected reading problem when the underlying issue is instead attentional in nature.
Another example they offered was in the domain of mathematical performance, in which individuals with worse attention control are more drawn to superficially relevant, gardenpathing, and distracting aspects of the problem, particularly in word problems, hence affecting their ability to stay on-track and solve the problem at hand. Highlighting relevant parts of a mathematical problem was shown to help students focus their attention and improve mathematical performance in those with attentional problems 
(Kercood & Grskovic, 2009)
.
Still, work in the areas of academic learning and achievement generally examines the role of working memory and storage-based deficits for learning difficulties and poor academic performance, with generally less emphasis on the more fundamental deficits in attentional abilities (unless the deficits are severe enough to be considered pathological, such as with ADHD). Potential remediations are therefore designed to address and target working memory more so than attentional deficits. These include working memory training, teaching of mnemonic and other memory strategies, reducing the working memory demands of classroom activities and assignments, and providing regular positive feedback (see 
Alloway, 2006;
Cockcroft, 2015;
Cowan, 2014;
St Clair-Thompson et al., 2010)
. While targeted approaches such as memoryrelated strategy training and reducing the working memory load of material may be helpful, attention-based remediations would be expected to have more generalizable benefits. Attention deficits, such as those in individuals with ADHD, are more generalized because they manifest as a global problem with maintaining goal-directed thoughts, information, and behaviors as well as blocking inappropriate and/or now-irrelevant ones, whereas working memory deficits may involve more specific issues with maintaining, processing, and/or storing information. Because we argue that attention control is the basis for both working memory capacity and fluid intelligence, researchers, educators, and parents may find more success if they focus on the underlying attentional deficits in students. Attentional-specific interventions are more likely to produce broad and farther-reaching benefits for the child.


Cognitive Training
The repeated demonstration that working memory capacity is correlated with a host of other cognitive behaviors has resulted in widespread testing of the hypothesis that training or otherwise boosting one's working memory capacity ought to result in long-term improvements to general cognitive and intellectual functioning. The idea of cognitive training is certainly not new and was argued to be ineffective over a century ago (e.g., 
James, 1890;
Thorndike & Woodworth, 1901)
, but researchers now had a new realm in which to test it -operating under the assumption that working memory capacity is a causal source of individual differences in other domains such as reading comprehension, mathematical skills, language ability, and fluid intelligence (c.f., 
Melby-LervÃ¥g et al., 2016)
. The holy grail of working memory training is to establish far-transfer, which is training-induced improvement on untrained and novel tasks of a different ability, to measures of intelligence. Some studies purported to find just that (e.g., 
Jaeggi et al., 2008;
Klingberg et al., 2002)
, resulting in a flurry of scientific interest and funding devoted to working memory training as well as commercial brain training products which purport to improve cognitive functioning by way of working memory training.
Unfortunately, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have consistently shown a lack of evidence for far-transfer to intelligence after training neurotypical individuals 
(Dougherty et al., 2016;
Melby-LervÃ¥g & Hulme, 2013;
Melby-LervÃ¥g et al., 2016;
Schwaighofer et al., 2015;
Shipstead et al., 2010;
Soveri et al., 2017)
. It is often observed that the relatively few studies that report far-transfer to intelligence have severe methodological limitations (see 
Dougherty et al., 2016;
Harrison et al., 2015;
Melby-LervÃ¥g et al., 2016;
Rodas & Greene, 2021;
Shipstead et al., 2010;
Simons et al., 2016)
, and that any training-induced improvements are typically limited to the tasks that were directly trained (or highly similar tasks) and short-lived (e.g., 
Melby-LervÃ¥g & Hulme, 2013;
Soveri et al., 2017)
. In other words, the most robust finding is that people get better on the tasks they practice but not much else. As a result, researchers are highly skeptical that working memory training or brain training products can improve general cognitive functioning (see 
Simons et al. 2016)
. For example, Stojanoski et al.
(2021) surveyed over 8,000 individuals regarding their use of brain training programs and then administered a battery of cognitive tasks to each. They found no relationship between any of those cognitive measures and participant engagement (use and duration) in brain training, even for the most committed brain trainers and those who fully expected it to work. Despite the overwhelming evidence against working memory training, it still receives a good deal of interest from researchers and companies offering "brain training" programs continue to be highly successful.


Why Working Memory Training does not Work
A central challenge for the working memory training hypothesis is that, for training to be effective, it must first be shown that working memory capacity can indeed be improved through training, sometimes referred to as moderate or intermediate transfer 
(Harrison et al., 2005;
von Bastian et al., 2013)
. That is, effortful and intensive practice and/or training on a subset of working memory tasks should lead to robust and lasting improvements in performance on another subset of untrained working memory tasks, and improvements must not be due to the application of highly specific strategies common across the two subsets of tasks (c.f., . There is little reason to believe that the broad ability of working memory capacity can be improved after training, and thus evidence for moderate transfer is sporadic and inconsistent among the relatively few studies that properly assess it; some report strong moderate transfer (e.g., 
Holmes et al., 2009)
, some report moderate transfer for a subset of tasks but not others (e.g., 
Harrison, Shipstead et al., 2013)
, and many report no moderate transfer (see 
Simons et al., 2016)
.
Another challenge is that even if moderate transfer could readily be achieved it must be the case that working memory has a causal influence on other cognitive abilities such as fluid intelligence. As noted by 
Shipstead et al., (2016)
, it was not clear why working memory capacity and fluid intelligence were so strongly related yet the underlying assumption that working memory capacity determined their fluid intelligence was rarely questioned (c.f., 
Burgoyne et al., 2019;
Harrison et al., 2015)
. As such, some scholars have been critical of the hypothesis that a more efficient working memory system causes higher performance on fluid intelligence tasks due to the ability to maintain more information in the form of partial solutions, hypotheses, and sub-goals (e.g., 
Burgoyne et al., 2019;
Cusack et al., 2009;
Wiley et al., 2011)
. Alternatives therefore need to be considered. As discussed in the introduction, the theoretical framework that we are operating with is specifically that limitations in both working memory capacity and fluid intelligence are primarily due to individual differences in attention control.


Training Narrower Abilities and Skills
While reviews have consistently found that working memory training is ineffective, it should be possible to teach and train specific strategies, which could result in desirable outcomes to the extent that those strategies are shared across different tasks and cognitive domains (see 
Bailey et al., 2008
 for a discussion of the strategy affordance hypothesis). Ideally, individuals would also be able to modify and improve their strategies and apply them to novel situations, further increasing the benefit of strategy training. Several studies support this notion (e.g., 
Dunning & Holmes, 2014;
Paas, 1992;
Turley-Ames & Whitfield, 2003;
Uttal et al., 2013
; also see 
Ceci & Papierno, 2005)
, including some from our lab. In a training study that expectedly found no evidence of far-transfer, 
Foster et al. (2017)
 noted that there was evidence that spatial abilities were improved after training for individuals of higher ability, as variance in spatial ability increased after twenty days of training. This finding is consistent with 
Uttal et al.'s (2013)
 meta-analysis of 217 studies showing that the average effect size of spatial training was just shy of half a standard deviation and that training-induced transfer to untrained spatial tasks is routinely reported. In a study aimed at assessing the role of proactive interference in working memory training and transfer, 
Redick et al. (2020)
 reported strategy-specific benefits on transfer in tasks specifically involving letter stimuli. In another training study, 
Harrison, Shipstead et al. (2013)
 found that individuals who trained on tasks involving retrieval from secondary (longterm) memory performed better than controls on both complex and simple span tasks. They offered two possible explanations: either working memory training improved a component of working memory (such as secondary memory), or participants developed strategies that were applicable to some tasks but not others, thus resulting in sporadic training effects. In a nontraining study of strategy discovery and implementation in immediate free recall, 
Harrison, Hertzog et al. (2013)
 reported two interesting findings. First, most participants were able to implement a particular organizational recall strategy after being informed of it. Second, the relationship between working memory capacity and memory recall was stronger after participants were informed about the organizational strategy than when no specific strategy instructions or information were given. This study further supported the viability of strategyspecific training and showed that such training may be particularly useful for higher ability individuals who are able to successfully execute said strategy and generalize it to other tasks (see also 
Ceci & Papierno, 2005)
.
In most of the above examples of strategy training, the goal was to train individuals on strategies specifically related to either general memory capacity (short-term and long-term) or modal information 
(verbal or visuospatial)
. This sort of memory-training should still be viewed with skepticism, as it has not been established that training effects will transfer to other areas or produce real-world significance (e.g., 
Stieff & Uttal, 2015)
. This is summed up quite well in a pessimistic review of memory strategy training in children by 
Bjorklund et al., (1997)
 who argued that training children was often successful in teaching a strategy, but children rarely showed any measurable benefit of said training. We instead propose that training of strategies of an attentional nature has a higher chance to succeed than training ones related to memory capacity or modalities, as the prospect of chunking or mnemonic training resulting in widespread cognitive improvements remains dubious. There are a handful of studies showing benefits of training and interventions that are more targeted towards attention and self-regulation than capacity, but less attention has been given to this area from researchers who study individual differences in executive functioning. We think this area warrants further research, particularly
given theoretical and methodological advances in the realm of individual differences in attention.


The Potential for Attention-Based Training
In clinical psychology, attention-based interventions and training are often shown effective by way of identifying individuals with a specific vulnerability and targeting remediation for that particular domain. This will be discussed in more detail in later sections, but relevant here is that attention-based training has also been shown to be effective in neurotypical individuals, most notably by Verbruggen and colleagues 
(Lawrence et al., 2015;
Porter et al., 2018;
Stevens et al., 2015;
Verbruggen et al., 2012)
.

 In a novel and adaptive gambling procedure, 
Verbruggen et al. (2012)
 offered participants monetary incentives for successful gambling decisions. On each trial of the gambling task, participants could choose to bet six different amounts, and participants were informed that their bets would be less successful the more they gambled. Before the gambling task, participants were trained for thirty minutes on a separate identification task in which they were occasionally (25% of total trials) prompted to either withhold responding just before they would normally execute an identification response (stop group) or make an additional keypress and then their normal identification response (double-response group). For the stop group, the authors reasoned that, "â€¦occasionally stopping motor responses should induce a general state of cautiousness that may propagate across cognitive domains. When preparing to stop, people make proactive adjustments and become more cautious in executing motor response" (p. 807). They further elaborated that any overlap between mechanisms regulating motor cautiousness and controlling gambling behavior could result in increased cautiousness transferring to other domains, such as encouraging risk-adverse behavior. After training and a short break, the two training groups and a control group (which received no training) performed 84 trials of a gambling task. As predicted, they found that the stop group took 10-15% less monetary risk on the gambling task than did the double-response and control groups (that is, the stop-group made more cautious bets). They also found that training-induced cautiousness effects were still present when the gambling task was administered 
5
 Rueda and colleagues 
(Pozuelos et al., 2019;
Rueda et al., 2005;
 have also demonstrated transfer using attention-based training in young children. The generalizability of these studies is difficult to evaluate due to methodological factors. Specifically, 
Rueda et al. (2005;
 had under 20 participants for each of their training groups and Pozuelos et al. had around 30 participants for each of their three groups (two training, one active control). Pozuelos et al. did report far transfer to a fluid intelligence measure after attention training (but not in the control). Their effects were larger for the training group that received metacognitive assistance from a trainer in addition to the attention training. However, attention training (without the metacognitive assistance) did not result in transfer to their measures of verbal intelligence, composite intelligence, or working memory.
two hours after training. These findings indicate that even brief motor cautiousness training can influence gambling decisions, resulting in less risky gambling behavior. They suggested that future studies should examine these sorts of effects when using other forms of cautiousness and inhibition, for instance in the realm of speed-accuracy tradeoffs. Of note is that working memory training studies often involve tens of hours of training on a multitude of cognitively demanding tasks, whereas 
Verbruggen et al.'s (2012)
 training was modest in terms of duration and demand.
As such, we would expect larger training effects with more intensive and sustained training efforts, perhaps using a variety of procedures designed to improve different types of attentional behavior. To that end, it is not surprising that a follow-up study by 
Verbruggen et al. (2013)
 found that these training effects virtually disappeared 24-hours after training, and that some other training is yet to be firmly established or refuted.
In summary, despite the vast resources devoted to working memory training this century,
properly conducted studies and reviews clearly fail to show that working memory capacity can be increased or that subsequent far-transfer (particularly to intelligence) is possible. Narrowing the scope to memory-specific training such as chunking and mnemonic strategies offer some promise, but evidence is scant. Conversely, we argue that successful training and interventions within the realm of attention, if attainable, have the potential to produce farer-reaching positive benefits than memory-specific training. Several studies have provided tentative evidence in support of this view, and increased focus on attentional interventions and improved methods could provide a breakthrough in the coming years. It does however need to be stressed that we are by no means suggesting that it is possible to train and improve attention control at a broad or construct level, as there is no convincing evidence to suggest that this is attainable given current methods and scientific knowledge. Rather, our argument is that identifying and training various attention-related aspects such as impulsive behaviors is a more principled approach and more promising than the ones taken in many working memory training studies, given both our claim that attention control is a more fundamental aspect of cognitive performance and that some research supports the efficacy of attentional-based interventions. In this vein, we now turn to the clinical literature and some successful efforts to improve cognitive functioning in populations with specific deficits associated with symptoms of psychological disorders.


Psychological Distress
Psychological distress has been identified as a leading cause of disability, morbidity, mortality, and economic burden (The US Burden of Disease Collaborators, 2018). Clinical researchers have identified deficits in "cognitive control" as a potential risk factor for a wide variety of psychological disorders 
(Barch, 2005;
Harvey et al., 2004;
Keilp et al., 2013;
Mathews & MacLeod, 2005)
. 
Koster et al. (2017)
 defined cognitive control as "executive processes that allow information processing and behavior to vary adaptively over time depending on current goals" (p. 80), similar to our view of attention control, but they conceptualized it as involving all three of the executive functions from the 
Miyake et al. (2000)
 framework (inhibition, shifting, and updating). According to 
Conway et al. (2021)
, cognitive control is a "broad construct that refers to the regulation of information processing during goaldirected behavior" (p. 7), and they also classified attention control as referring to individual differences in cognitive control. In the following sections, we will refer to the broader concept of cognitive control and then narrow it down to working memory and attentional mechanisms more specifically.
We discuss the role of cognitive control in clinical disorders organized by the latent class structure identified by 
Caspi et al. (2014)
. They used confirmatory factor analysis to assess the structure of psychopathology in a large sample (N = 1,037). They identified a tripartite factor structure, consisting of internalizing disorders (including anxiety disorders and depression), externalizing disorders (including substance use disorders and conduct disorder), and thought disorders (including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder). Similar to the general factor of intelligence (g), the authors also identified a higher-order p factor, which is defined as a broad (transdiagnostic) risk factor for psychological distress that was associated with greater impairment in function, increased heritability, more adverse childhood experiences, and more compromised brain function during early development (particularly deficits in selfcontrol and emotion regulation). Further, the authors reported significant correlations between p and low self-control factor in childhood (r = .26), working memory as measured by the WAIS-  
Table 2
 for a list of disorders that include difficulties related to concentration and attention among the diagnostic criteria). Additionally, several researchers have routinely found an association between cognitive control processes and many different disorders (i.e., demonstration of multi-finality), including psychotic disorders and suicide 
(Barch, 2005;
Harvey et al., 2004;
Keilp et al., 2013;
Mathews & MacLeod, 2005
 Neurodevelopmental disorders (namely ADHD)
Inattention (e.g., "is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli"), hyperactivity, and impulsivity.


Neurocognitive disorders
Criteria are divided by cognitive domains, including complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual motor, and social cognition. 
Table 2
. Disorders with symptoms related to impaired attention. List of various disorders and the specific criteria associated with attention. Note that all criteria are not listed for each disorderonly the ones specific to attention are shown. 1 Taken verbatim from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5 th edition. Improvement in cognitive control may therefore represent a mechanism through which therapeutic interventions for a variety of disorders contribute to improvement in symptoms of psychological distress. For example, cognitive training programs have successfully been applied to the treatment of several different disorders, including schizophrenia, ADHD, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (see 
Keshavan et al., 2014
 for a review). As such, researchers are increasingly exploring how interventions designed to improve cognitive control may be used to enhance therapy. The current section reviews evidence in support of the role of cognitive control in the development, maintenance, and treatment of psychological distress across disorders, including internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, thought disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders. We will also consider the role of cognitive control in the context of minority stress and racial trauma. Particular emphasis will be dedicated to internalizing disorders, which are among the most prevalent disorders 
(Kessler et al., 2005)
 and have robust literatures devoted to cognitive processing. We will argue that better understanding of the role of attention control, specifically, may enhance theoretical models and treatments for psychological disorders.


Internalizing Disorders
Internalizing disorders, including anxiety disorders and depression, are characterized by behavioral over-control 
(Kovacs & Devlin, 1998)
 and emotion dysregulation 
(Aldao et al., 2010;
Hostinar & Cicchetti, 2019)
. Emotion regulation refers to the ability to interact with emotions in a way that is consistent with personal goals 
(Gross, 2015)
 Improved cognitive control may be the mechanism through which interventions shown to effectively treat symptoms of internalizing disorders also improve emotion regulation.
Transdiagnostic treatments for internalizing disorders, such as the Unified Protocol 
(Barlow et al., 2017)
, are thought to promote adaptive emotion regulation and improve symptoms via interventions that promote cognitive reappraisal, behavioral exposure, and mindfulness.
Cognitive reappraisal is considered to be an adaptive emotion regulation strategy during which individuals make more realistic evaluations of situations, thoughts, and core beliefs. For example, a catastrophic thought, "If I don't finish my part of the manuscript on time my firstauthor spouse will divorce me," may be reappraised to be more realistic and/or helpful, "If my contribution to the manuscript is late, it is highly likely that my first-author spouse will be understanding, and the likelihood is low that it will negatively impact our relationship in the long-term." Cognitive reappraisal is considered to be a primary mechanism through which cognitive behavioral therapy, one of the most effective forms of treatment for internalizing disorders, contributes to symptom improvement 
(Smits et al., 2012)
. Notably, cognitive reappraisal may depend on cognitive control capabilities, particularly attentional processes . For example, research has shown that larger working memory capacity was associated with greater ability to engage in cognitive reappraisal (e.g., 
Schmeichel et al., 2008)
. Exposure therapy, which has been shown to be effective in treatment of anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders, improves symptoms through promotion of "inhibitory learning," which we will argue reflects attention control 
(Craske et al., 2014)
. Finally, mindfulness-based interventions have also been shown to be effective for treatment of internalizing disorders 
(Khoury et al., 2013)
 difficulties began after receiving a new assignment to a highly stressful and competitive environment. Matt noted his supervisor was a "micromanager" who would criticize every mistake of his. He began experiencing symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder which included frequent and excessive worrying about a variety of domains (e.g., finances, work, his health, loss of a loved one), that coincided with difficulty falling asleep, muscle tension, being easily fatigued, irritability, feeling "on edge," and difficulty concentrating. Though he had since transferred to a more supportive working environment, he continued to worry constantly. Matt stated he started experiencing moments of his mind going blank and being unable to complete simple tasks. Meta-worries (worrying about the fact that he was worrying too much) exacerbated his symptoms and made it more difficult for him to focus on his work and more prone to making mistakes, which reinforced his worry. This scenario, loosely based on clinical experiences of the third author, highlights the dynamic interaction between cognitive control and symptoms of anxiety disorders.


Several theories of anxiety disorders indicate that impairments in cognitive control may
lead to the development of symptoms of anxiety disorders (e.g., 
Mathews & MacLeod, 2005)
.
For example, evidence from longitudinal research indicates that reactive cognitive control strategies may increase risk for later development of anxiety symptoms whereas proactive or more goal-directed cognitive control may prevent symptoms 
(Troller-Renfree et al., 2019)
. In addition, 
Bredemeier and Berenbaum (2013)
 found that n-back performance predicted selfreported worry measured at a later time-point even after controlling for worry measured at Time 1. Further, Stout and Rokke (2010) reported a significant association between selective visual arrays and self-report measures of anxiety, rumination, and depression for those with low working memory capacity but not for those with high working memory capacity.
Cognitive processes have also been shown to maintain symptoms over time; for example, people with social anxiety disorder commonly engage in post-event processing following a social encounter. Post-event processing involves mental rehearsal of a past social encounter that emphasizes attention to potential threat or embarrassment (see Wong, 2016 for a review).
Experimental manipulation of post-event processing conducted by 
Vassilopoulos and Watkins (2009)
 demonstrated how the nature of post-event processing, concrete or abstract, contributed to symptoms of psychological distress such that more abstract thinking exacerbated symptoms and more concrete thinking (reflective of more cognitive control) minimized them.
Notably, symptoms of anxiety may also negatively impair cognitive control. For example, Visu-Petra et al. (2014) report evidence that self-reported anxiety predicted performance on a digit span task measured nine months later. Further, several experimental studies using anxiety induction strategies (Trier Social Stress Test and affective video clips) have demonstrated increased impairment in performance on working memory measures among participants in anxiety induction conditions relative to controls 
(Gray & Braver, 2002;
Oei et al., 2006;
Qin et al., 2009;
Schoofs et al., 2008)
. As such, the relationship between anxiety and cognitive control is likely bidirectional.
Reduced working memory capacity is often identified as one of the primary cognitive deficits exhibited in individuals with anxiety. However, some researchers have argued that cognitive symptoms of anxiety are best explained by impairments in attention control more broadly (e.g., 
Berggren & Derakshan, 2013)
. A meta-analysis by 
Moran (2016)
 provided the strongest evidence of this. Moran found that self-reported symptoms of anxiety were related to impairments in working memory capacity across a wide variety of measures, but the overall effect size was relatively small (g = -.33). On the other hand, the effect size was more than twice that when analysis was restricted to studies examining the relationship between anxiety and attention control (i.e., filtering efficiency; g = -.70). Another meta-analysis by 
Shi et al. (2019)
 also demonstrated a significant negative relationship between anxiety and attention control measured by a variety of tasks, including those with limited reliability such as the Stroop task (g = -.58). Further supporting the relationship between anxiety and attention control, several studies have shown that increased cognitive load impairs performance among anxious individuals to a greater degree relative to non-anxious individuals specifically when the secondary task requires activation of attentional processes 
(Eysenck et al., 2005;
Hayes et al., 2008;
Rapee, 1993;
Stefanopoulou et al., 2014)
.
Theories highlighting the role of attentional processes on symptoms of anxiety disorders have informed the development of cognitive treatments. For example, many researchers have argued that biased attention towards threatening stimuli may contribute to symptoms of anxiety disorders 
(Armstrong & Olatunji, 2012;
Bar-Haim et al., 2007;
Cisler et al., 2009;
Cisler & Koster, 2010;
Mathews, & MacLeod, 2005;
Pergamin-Hight et al., 2015;
Van Bockstaele et al., 2014;
Weierich et al., 2008
; but see 
Kruijt et al., 2019)
. Based on the assumption that attentional vigilance towards threat contributes to symptoms of anxiety disorders, researchers have developed interventions designed to train attention away from threatening stimuli, termed attention bias modification (see 
MacLeod et al., 2002)
. Unfortunately, these types of attention bias modification programs have demonstrated limited efficacy on symptoms 
(Beard et al., 2012;
Cristea et al., 2015;
Fodor et al., 2020;
MogoaÅŸe et al., 2014;
Van Bockstaele et al., 2014)
. Some researchers have used an emotional variant of the antisaccade task to clarify the nature of attention bias in anxiety 
(Chen et al., 2014;
Derakshan et al., 2009;
Jazbec et al., 2005;
Liang, 2021;
Reinholdt-Dunne et al., 2012;
Wieser et al., 2009)
. Findings from these studies highlighted that attention bias in anxiety is multifaceted and more dynamic than hypervigilance towards threat. As such, attention bias modification programs that simply train attention away from threat may fail to adequately target the specific attentional mechanisms that contribute to symptoms of anxiety. Consistent with this view, 
Mogg and Bradley's (2016)
 review highlighted that attention bias modification interventions may be improved by better targeting top-down processing and goal-directed inhibitory control (i.e., attention control) rather than simply training attentional avoidance of threat. For example, positive search training interventions instruct participants to search for positive images and ignore threatening image distractors 
(Dandeneau et al., 2007;
De Voogd et al., 2014;
Waters et al., 2013;
Waters et al., 2015;
Waters, et al., 2016)
. Studies utilizing positive search training paradigms have demonstrated better efficacy relative to typical attentional avoidance training paradigms . These findings highlight how nuanced understanding of the specific cognitive processes that contribute to symptoms of psychological distress can better inform therapeutic interventions.
Exposure therapy is one of the most effective treatments for anxiety disorders and may promote reduction in symptoms by enhancing attention control. Exposure therapy helps people to overcome their fears by repeatedly facing them, in a variety of contexts, and without engaging in any subtle avoidance behaviors (i.e., safety behaviors). For example, a person with a specific phobia of spiders may confront their fear by engaging in progressively fear-inducing exposure sessions (e.g., looking at images and videos of spiders, walking up to a spider web and taking a picture of it, holding a spider in their hand), repeatedly and in a variety of locations and emotional states. They will also need to refrain from engaging in any safety behaviors, such as imagining the spider is not real or dissociating (mentally checking out) that may limit their ability to learn that the feared outcome is not as likely to happen, nor is it as insurmountable, as they expect. This new safety learning competes with initial fear learning and is termed "inhibitory learning" 
(Craske et al., 2014)
. Arguably, attention control is required to promote inhibitory learning (by refraining from engaging in safety behaviors) such that those with greater attention control capabilities may be more likely to benefit from exposure therapy, or they may benefit from it more quickly. The inhibitory learning that develops through exposure therapy may also promote attention control when someone with an anxiety disorder is faced with a feared stimulus, allowing for inhibition of a fear response. In support of this view, research shows that exposure therapy leads to increased activation of prefrontal brain regions associated with cognitive control and decreased activation of the amygdala and other brain regions associated with fear learning and threat-response 
(Bishop, 2007;
Sotres-Bayon et al., 2006)
. Further, medications such as D-cycloserine and methylene blue that have been shown to enhance new safety learning during exposure 
(Mataix-Cols et al., 2017;
Zoellner et al., 2017)
, have also been shown to repair working memory deficits in quinolinic acid hippocampal-lesioned rats 
(Schuster & Schmidt, 1992)
.
A common theme across these findings is that attention control in the presence of emotionally threatening stimuli may represent a mechanism in the development, maintenance, and treatment of anxiety disorders. Reliable measurement of deficits in attention control may be useful for identifying those at risk for development of later psychopathology 
(Hutton & Ettinger, 2006
) and could potentially be used to inform preventative interventions. Further, interventions that promote more adaptive attention control strategies have promise to enhance treatments.
Depression. Symptoms of depression are similarly theorized to develop as a result of deficits in cognitive control (e.g., 
Siegle et al., 2007)
. In support of this view, longitudinal research of 4,192 participants in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health found that better working memory capacity was associated with decreased risk for later development of depressive symptoms 
(Crandall et al., 2018)
. Similarly, 
Kertz et al. (2015)
  Zetsche 
& Joormann, 2011)
. In addition, deficits in cognitive control have been identified among those at higher risk of developing depression 
(Joormann, Talbot, & Gotlib, 2007)
.
If deficits in cognitive control represent an underlying risk factor for depression, we would also expect these deficits to persist following recovery from a major depressive episode, particularly among those who experience recurrent episodes. Some studies have found that cognitive control deficits persist following recovery from a depressive episode 
(Demeyer et al., 2012;
Joormann, 2004;
Levens & Gotlib, 2015;
Paelecke-Habermann et al., 2005;
Vanderhasselt & De Raedt, 2009)
. Other studies find evidence of deficits in cognitive control among participants who are currently depressed but not for those whose symptoms have remitted 
(Gotlib & Cane, 1987;
Hedlund & Rude, 1995;
Merens et al., 2008;
Quigley et al., 2020)
. Reliable measures of attention control may help clarify these conflicting findings. For example, 
Vanderhasselt & De Raedt (2009)
 did not detect group differences in reaction times nor error rates on a Stroop task among participants who had never experienced depression relative to those with a history of depression. Measurement of conflict-related modulation abilities using event related potentials, however, reflected greater impairments among formerly depressed participants, particularly for those with multiple recurrences of major depressive episodes.
Meta-analytic studies further support the association between depression and deficits in cognitive control. A recent meta-analysis identified a small overall effect (g = -0.31) that was stronger with age 
(Dotson et al., 2020)
. Further, a meta-analysis of the association between depression and n-back performance revealed depressed participants performed worse relative to controls across varying levels of cognitive load 
(Nikolin et al., 2021)
. Of note, greater deficits in cognitive control, particularly with regard to attention control and working memory capacity, have been shown to be associated with history of suicide attempts among a sample of individuals with major depressive disorder or bipolar I disorder 
(Keilp et al., 2013)
. As such, improving cognitive control is likely important for improving the efficacy of current treatments for depression 
(Roiser et al., 2012;
Siegle et al., 2007)
 and may even play a role in preventive interventions 
(Ronold et al., 2019)
. In addition, measurement of cognitive control may inform who is more likely to benefit from treatment. For example, research conducted by 
Tozzi et al. (2020)
 has supported the role of functional connectivity associated with response inhibition as a predictive biomarker for response to antidepressant treatment of major depressive disorder.
Limited cognitive control in depression is thought to be the result of hyper-accessibility of negative emotional content in working memory due to poor inhibition (i.e., impairments in attention control; see Gotlib & Joormann, 2010 for a review). Irrelevant, negative emotional stimuli may subsequently be more difficult for depressed individuals to suppress or intentionally forget 
(Hertel & Gerstle, 2003;
Joormann & Gotlib, 2008;
Power et al., 2000;
Yang et al., 2016)
.
Notably, there are robust literatures supporting biased recall of negative information 
(Mathews & MacLeod, 2005)
 and overgeneral autobiographical memory in depression 
(Williams et al., 2007)
.
Hyperaccessibility of negative emotional stimuli in working memory may contribute to these negative biases in long-term memory .
Rumination, or the tendency to engage in repetitive, self-focused, negative thinking patterns, has been identified as a key mechanism through which deficits in cognitive control contribute to symptoms of depression 
(De Raedt & Koster, 2010;
Joormann & D'Avanzato, 2010;
Joormann & Vanderlind, 2014;
Mor & Daches, 2015)
. Rumination has been shown to be a proximal risk factor for a variety of disorders including anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and eating disorders 
(Nolen-Hoeksema & Watkins, 2011)
. Rumination is stable over time and has been shown to predict the onset of major depressive episodes 
(Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008)
. Rumination is also considered to be "an intensely attention-demanding process," 
(Hertel, 2004, p. 187)
. The relationship between rumination and attention control has been reviewed by 
Whitmer and Gotlib (2013)
 and 
Roberts et al. (2017)
 The relationship between rumination and impairments in attention control may be bidirectional. For example, rumination induction has been associated with more stereotyped counting responses in a random number generation task 
(Watkins & Brown, 2002)
 and with impaired performance on a standard Stroop task 
(Philippot & Brutoux, 2008)
. In contrast, evidence from an experiment that used cognitive bias modification to train participants to either engage in inhibition or to not engage in inhibition suggests that impairments in attention control may lead to rumination, which subsequently contributes to negative biases in long-term memory 
(Daches et al., 2019)
. Notably, the negative effects of rumination on memory may be reversed when participants are directed to complete a task that facilitates attention control during encoding 
(Hertel & Rude, 1991)
, even when presented with rumination inducing stimuli during encoding 
(Hertel et al., 2012)
. Attention training has also been shown to protect against rumination-related biases in long-term memory 
(Daches et al., 2019)
. These findings indicate (3) incorporation of emotional stimuli in training paradigms. For example, the authors reviewed two studies conducted with clinical samples that demonstrated that cognitive control training improved emotion regulation and symptoms of depression 
(Siegle et al., 2007;
Siegle et al., 2014)
. These improvements corresponded with better connectivity between prefrontal regions of the brain and the amygdala and, importantly, were maintained across time. 
Koster et al. (2017)
 also speculated that attention control may represent an essential component for maximizing the effectiveness of cognitive control training on symptoms: "Within training it seems key that individuals are engaged with training that demands activating frontal areas such as the [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex] which are implicated in attention control, while ignoring taskunrelated stressful thoughts" (p. 89). Taken together, research on these training paradigms demonstrates the applicability of attention control in the prevention and treatment of emotion dysregulation (e.g., rumination) and subsequent symptoms of depression.


Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is unique in that the diagnosis is dependent on experiencing a traumatic event. Among those who experience trauma, relatively few go on to develop clinically significant symptoms 
(McFarlane, 2000)
. Several factors have been identified that may help explain why some people develop PTSD and others do not, including experience of traumatic events that are chronic, unpredictable, and perceived as uncontrollable 
(Mineka & Zinbarg, 2006)
. Cognitive factors may also inform risk and resilience to PTSD, and to that end several studies have established a link between cognition (measured prior to exposure to trauma) and resilience to PTSD following exposure to trauma (e.g., 
Brewin et al., 2000;
Jha et al., 2010;
Kremen et al., 2007;
Macklin et al., 1998)
. Further, 
Kremen et al. (2007)
 found that genetic factors fully accounted for this cognitive risk or resilience. Notably, many of these studies focused on intelligence and so they offer limited insight into the underlying processes that convey risk and resilience for PTSD. Assessment of attention control may be important for clarifying risk and resilience since attention control is possibly the link between intelligence and


PTSD.
Research from studies exploring the more specific relationship between PTSD and cognitive control have revealed mixed findings (e.g., 
Gillie and Thayer, 2014)
. Evaluation of deficits in attention control may help clarify understanding of the relationship between symptoms of PTSD and impairments in cognitive control. For example, 
Leskin and White (2007)
 found positive associations for inhibition tasks among participants with PTSD relative to controls, but not for measures of task-switching, alerting, or orienting.
The most effective treatments for PTSD include those that incorporate exposure therapy 
(Cusack et al., 2016)
. As was described above in the anxiety disorder section, exposure therapy is thought to improve symptoms through development of new safety learning that promotes "inhibitory learning" 
(Craske et al., 2014)
. Cognitive training programs also show promise for treatment of PTSD. For example, 
Schweizer et al. (2017)
 found that adolescents diagnosed with PTSD who completed affective working memory training demonstrated improved attention control, decreased symptoms, and increased utilization of adaptive emotion regulation strategies.
Targeting attention control may also be important for early psychological interventions designed to protect against the development of PTSD following exposure to trauma, which, to date, have demonstrated limited efficacy 
(Roberts et al., 2019)
.


Racial Trauma and Minority Stress
Early life stress such as childhood abuse, more commonly experienced in marginalized groups, has been shown to predict working memory impairments in adulthood regardless of clinical status (see 
Goodman et al., 2019
 for a systematic review and meta-analysis). Similarly, sexual abuse, more commonly experienced by those who identify as women 
(Smith et al., 2018)
, and particularly by those who identify as transgender 
(Stotzer, 2009)
, has also been shown to correlate with working memory impairments independent from symptoms of PTSD 
(Blanchette & Caparos, 2016)
. More nuanced understanding of factors that contribute to psychological distress beyond social categories such as race or gender is necessary to facilitate culturally informed theories and treatment. For example, experiences of stigma and discrimination have been theorized to contribute to negative mental health outcomes 
(Meyer, 2003)
 and have been associated with several health-related indicators of chronic stress including cardiovascular health 
(Panza et al., 2019)
 and accelerated aging 
(Carter et al., 2019)
. Notably, researchers have also reported an association between chronic stress and deficits in working memory capacity 
(Evans & Schamberg, 2009;
Mika et al., 2012)
. In addition, researchers have reported evidence of negative effects of discrimination on cognition, including impaired performance on a Stroop task 
(Bair & Steele, 2010;
Salvatore & Shelton, 2007)
. These findings highlight the importance of considering how factors that negatively impact minoritized groups (such as racial trauma, discrimination, and minority stress), affect cognitive functioning and, in turn, increase risk for symptoms of psychopathology.
Stereotype confirmation concerns, defined as fear that one's social behaviors will elicit judgments consistent with common stereotypes about a social group to which they belong 
(Contrada et al., 2001)
, represent one such potential mechanism that may explain negative health and mental health disparities among minoritized groups. The construct of stereotype confirmation concerns is similar to stereotype threat, defined as a reduction in task performance when a stereotype about an individual's social group is made salient 
(Steele, 1997)
, but stereotype confirmation concerns are considered to be more enduring whereas stereotype threat is acute. Notably, working memory capacity has been shown to mediate the effect of stereotype threat on performance 
(Aronson et al., 1999;
Schmader & Johns, 2003;
Steele & Aronson, 1995;
Steele, 1997)
. In addition, results from a survey of 353 adults who identified as lesbian, bisexual, or gay indicated experiences of discrimination, concealment, and internalized homophobia were positively associated with psychological distress, which, in turn, was significantly related to selfreported impairments in working memory capacity 
(Jones, 2017)
. Importantly, the synergistic effect of intersection of identities is important to consider. For example, the effect of microaggressions on working memory may be compounded by multiple salient identities that may contribute to stereotype threat simultaneously 
(Harrison & Tanner, 2018)
; for example a Black, immigrant, young woman and first-generation college student being told she should not get her hopes up for applying to medical school by a White American middle-aged man who is her academic advisor (multiple identities may be relevant in this situation). Measures of attention control may represent valuable tools for exploration of the role of intersectionality in increased risk for psychological distress. In addition, validation of psychological distress that results from discrimination in the form of microaggressions is theorized to lessen cognitive load and may facilitate rupture repair between a therapist and a client following a microagressive communication by the therapist 
(Gaztambide, 2012)
. Identification of evidence-based strategies to promote resilience in response to stigma and discrimination, both within and outside of therapeutic contexts, is sorely needed 
(Metzger et al., 2021)
. Psychometrically strong measures of attention control may reduce adverse impact compared to more commonly used cognitive measures (also see 
Burgoyne et al., 2021)
, and could potentially serve as valuable benchmarks of effectiveness for such interventions. We expand on this point in the upcoming section on psychological testing.


Externalizing Disorders
Disinhibition, defined by deficits in self-regulation, is considered to represent a core vulnerability factor for externalizing disorders, including conduct and antisocial disorders, substance use disorders, and risky behaviors (see Mullins-Sweatt et al., 2019 for a review).
Impulsive behaviors characteristic of people with externalizing disorders may result, in part, from deficits in the ability to keep potential future consequences of behavior in mind 
(Barkley, 2001;
Finn, 2002)
. As such, working memory is implicated in behavioral disinhibition 
(Bogg & Finn, 2010;
Finn et al., 2002;
GrÃ©goire et al., 2012)
, and has been hypothesized to represent a mechanism through which personality traits, such as disinhibition, contribute to externalizing behaviors and psychopathologies 
(Finn, 2002)
. 
Young et al. (2009)
, however, found that response inhibition (measured by the antisaccade task, stop-signal task, and Stroop) was a better predictor for externalizing symptoms relative to working memory updating and task shifting, highlighting the value of evaluating attention control. 
Finn's (2002)
 cognitive-motivational theory identifies underlying mechanisms including working memory that may increase risk to the development of alcohol-use disorder. Based on this theory, attention control may represent a mechanism for impulsivity/novelty seeking (difficulties resisting strong appetitive urges) and low harm avoidance (impairment in behavioral inhibition in response to punishment). In support of this view, worse performance on a Go/No-Go task were observed among individuals with early onset alcoholism who exhibited antisocial traits, but not for those without antisocial traits 
(Finn et al., 2002)
. Poor attention control was also associated with increased impulsivity/novelty seeking and low harm avoidance.
Additionally, improvements in working memory capacity have been observed following abstinence and treatment for substance use disorder 
(Bell et al., 2017;
Vonmoos et al., 2014)
, and working memory training has been argued to be effective in treatment for substance use disorder 
(Bickel et al., 2011;
Brooks et al., 2017;
Verdejo-Garcia, 2016)
. Effect sizes, however, have been moderate and cognitive interventions for substance use disorders may benefit from greater emphasis on attention control (Verdejo-Garcia, 2016).


Thought Disorders
Findings from 
Caspi et al. (2014)
 demonstrated that thought disorders are best explained by individual differences in the p factor, which was strongly correlated with measures of cognitive control. Therefore, cognitive control may play a particularly important role in understanding of the development and treatment of these disorders. In support of this view, robust findings across more than 40 studies consistently found that people with schizophrenia tend to make more errors on the antisaccade task relative to healthy controls, including those with recent onset of symptoms and those who have never received pharmacological treatment (e.g., 
Harris et al., 2006;
Hutton & Ettinger, 2006;
Kleineidam et al., 2019;
Radant et al., 2007)
.
In fact, Hutton and Ettinger have argued that difficulties in performing antisaccade tasks may serve as an endophenotype, or indicator of genetic risk, for development of schizophrenia.
Consistent with this view, impaired performance on antisaccade has been observed among nondisordered biological relatives of those with schizophrenia 
(Calkins et al., 2004)
 as well as those considered to have clinical high risk for symptoms of psychosis 
(Nieman et al., 2007)
.
Additionally, deficits in attention control and working memory have been associated with increased genetic risk for development of schizophrenia in a twin study conducted by 
Cannon et al. (2000)
. Measures of attention control may also be valuable for informing evaluation of pharmacological interventions for thought disorders by serving as benchmarkers for improvement 
(Hutton & Ettinger, 2006;
Lesh et al., 2011)
. For example, improved symptoms of schizophrenia from antipsychotic medication has been associated with improved Stroop task performance as well as functional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex 
(Cadena et al., 2019
), a brain region associated with various attentional mechanisms such as conflict monitoring, error monitoring, and goal-directed behavior more generally (e.g., 
Devinsky et al., 1995;
Weissman et al., 2003)
.


Neurodevelopmental Disorders
Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism and especially ADHD, are uniquely characterized by deficits in cognitive functioning, including working memory and attention. Researchers have posited that impairments in working memory capacity and "response inhibition" may represent endophenotypes for ADHD 
(Aron & Poldrack, 2005;
Castellanos and
Tannock, 2002, Crosbie et al., 2008;
McAuley et al., 2013;
Nigg et al., 2018;
Vaurio et al., 2009)
. Despite a pattern of mixed findings, meta-analytic studies evaluating group differences in performance on measures of working memory capacity revealed significant and sizable effects in both children 
(d = .69 -.74;
Kasper et al., 2012)
, and adults 
(d = .49 -.55;
Alderson et al. 2013
).
Alderson et al. discussed factors that may have contributed to the pattern of mixed findings: "A more rigorous operational definition that emphasizes attentional shifts between stimuli and the processing component of the task might have improved power to predict between-study [effect size] heterogeneity" (p. 298). This highlights the potential value that an increased focus on attention control could have for this literature. For example, treatment studies evaluating the effects of methylphenidate (a stimulant medication commonly used to treat ADHD) on attention control found evidence of improved antisaccade performance 
(Klein et al., 2002;
O'Driscoll et al., 2005)
. In contrast, the effect of methylphenidate on attention control among non-disordered individuals is negligible (g = .20; 
Ilieva et al., 2015)
. In sum, incorporation of measures of attention control has the potential to advance our understanding of the development and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders.


Summary of Attention Control and Psychological Distress
To summarize, across various presentations of psychological distress, measurement of attention control shows great promise in advancing understanding of risk and resilience as well as informing treatment. A particular strength of this approach is the broad, transdiagnostic applicability of attention control across disorders, suggesting that interventions targeting this construct may offer widespread benefit. Future research should explore the extent to which different therapeutic interventions contribute to improvements in attention control, how well benefits are maintained over time, and how improvements in attention control contribute to symptoms, functioning, and quality of life. We also argue that early identification of risk and preventative interventions may be made more feasible through assessment of attention control during early development and among high-risk populations. Cognitive training interventions targeting attention control may subsequently be utilized to prevent psychological distress prior to reaching clinical significance.


Psychological Testing


Predicting Real-World Success
Psychological testing is often used in the real world in making important decisions such as school admittance; employee hiring and promotion; military personnel selection, placement, and enrollment into training programs; family court rulings; and criminal culpability (e.g., 
Amrein & Berliner, 2002;
Erickson et al., 2007;
Hartmann et al., 2003;
Heilbrun, 1992;
Nwafor & Adesuwa, 2014)
. A consistent finding in this area is that general mental ability (namely, psychometric intelligence) is the best predictor of academic performance, training success, job performance, and career potential 
(Bosco et al., 2015;
Gottfredson, 1986;
Kuncel et al., 2004;
Ree & Earles, 1992;
Schmidt & Hunter, 1998;
Schmidt et al., 2016;
Song et al., 2010)
, hence why many personnel selection tests place heavy demands on accumulated knowledge (crystalized intelligence) and reasoning ability (fluid intelligence).
Some researchers have advocated for the use of working memory tests either instead of or in addition to measures of intelligence for predicting relevant outcomes including academic achievement 
(Alloway & Alloway, 2010;
Aronen et al., 2005;
Cockcroft, 2015)
, performance in air traffic control 
(Ackerman & Beier, 2007)
, and multitasking ability (a proxy for job performance; 
Colom et al., 2010;
Hambrick et al., 2010;
KÃ¶nig et al., 2005;
Redick et al., 2016)
. 
Lemonaki et al. (2021)
 reported that reduced working memory capacity, but not intelligence, was associated with job burnout, and moreover that working memory capacity mediated the negative relationship between burnout and job performance.
The effectiveness of attention control measures more specifically has been less emphasized in the realm of psychological testing. But studies have shown that attention control is a good predictor of mathematical ability in preschools (e.g., 
Bull & Espi, 2006)
, predicts scholastic attainment and achievement about as well as working memory capacity 
(St. Clair-Thompson & Gathercole, 2006)
, and correlates with multitasking ability above and beyond both performance on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB; a widely used selection test administered by the United States Military) and intelligence tasks 
(Martin, Mashburn et al., 2020)
.


Test Fairness and Adverse Impact in High-Stakes Testing
Test Fairness. A notable finding in psychological testing is that scores on many cognitive tests differ among various groups of individuals 
(Roth et al., 2001
). This is of particular concern when scores are substantially lower for individuals of a protected group (based on sex/gender, race, ethnicity, etc.) and in high-stakes testing, in which the examinee's test scores are likely to have significant and direct personal consequences 
(Amrein & Beliner, 2002;
Burgoyne et al., 2021;
Nunnaly, 1964)
. As such, not only should standards of test reliability and validity be higher when tests are used in high-stakes situations 
(Nunnally, 1964)
, but practitioners need to be especially cognizant of the extent to which their measures may be inequitable for certain populations 
(Ceci & Papierno, 2005)
. When test scores have substantial subgroup differences, using them for selection purposes can result in adverse impact, which means that individuals are disproportionally selected over others based on race, ethnicity, sex/gender, religion, or other protected status (see 
Burgoyne et al., 2021;
Schmitt et al., 1997;
Zedeck, 2011)
.
The reasons for subgroup differences and adverse impact are debated and likely multifaceted, but are thought to be largely due to systematic inequalities and societal marginalization. As a result, some groups of people have, on average, less socioeconomic status 
(Ryan & Siebens, 2012)
 and therefore less access to social resources such as quality schooling and education, supplemental instruction, nutrition, healthcare, and other opportunities for learning and enrichment 
(Bradley & Corwyn, 2002;
Burgoyne et al., 2021;
Outtz & Newman, 2010)
. Systematic inequalities and marginalization may also result in mistrust of authority, stereotype threat, test reluctance, and test suspicion, all of which could manifest as decreased motivation or ability to perform well on a psychological test 
(Arthur et al., 2002;
Chan, 1997;
Chan et al., 1997;
Edwards & Arthur, 2007;
Hausknecht et al., 2004;
Spencer et al., 2016;
Steele & Aronson, 1995)
. Further, psychological tests are often normed and validated using largely homogenous and non-minority samples 
(Graham, 1992;
Okazaki & Sue, 1995)
. Personnel selection tests are believed to be sensitive to systematic inequalities because performance to some extent relies on things such as accumulated knowledge (crystalized intelligence), language ability, and acculturated learning, of which individuals with lower socioeconomic status will generally have less due opportunity and circumstance 
(Burgoyne et al., 2021;
Ployhart & Holtz, 2008;
Roberts et al., 2000)
.


Attention Control Measures May Improve Test Fairness and Reduce Adverse
Impact. Unfortunately, psychological testing cannot immediately solve great societal injustices.
But it is still imperative from a legal, moral, and practical (e.g., economical) standpoint that researchers and practitioners strive to minimize the extent to which these differences are reflected in test scores, and consequently the extent to which tests result in adverse impact (see 
Burgoyne et al., 2021;
Ceci & Papierno, 2005)
. Critical reviews and examinations have found that one of the most effective strategies for combating subgroup differences, and thus adverse impact, is to use non-cognitive selection methods such as personality assessments (e.g., integrity and conscientiousness), biographical data, and structured interviews, as these methods can reduce or even eliminate subgroup differences and may improve prediction of job performance when used in addition to cognitive tests 
(Bobko et al., 1999;
Newman & Lyon, 2009;
Ployhart & Holtz, 2008;
Pulakos & Schmitt, 1996;
Roth et al., 2001;
Schmidt, 2016;
Schmitt et al., 1997;
Sinha et al., 2011)
. However, adding non-cognitive tests is not universally practiced because it results in increased administration time and some practitioners are concerned that using this approach reduces overall predictive validity (the so-called diversity-validity dilemma, see 
Campion et al., 2001;
Ployhart & Holtz, 2008)
. Another way to improve test fairness is to more carefully select which cognitive tests are used, which can be easily combined with non-cognitive methods. Specifically, some scholars have advocated for the use of tests which assess fluid abilities (including working memory capacity and attention control) over existing selection tests, as tasks of fluid cognition rely less on factors that correlate with socioeconomic status and instead are purer measures of cognitive potential 
(Bosco et al., 2015;
Burgoyne et al., 2021;
Nelson, 2003;
Held et al., 2014;
Hough et al., 2001)
.
A notable study in this area was 
Bosco et al. (2015)
 who tested a large sample of undergraduates and bank employees and found that "executive attention" (combined performance on operation span, reading span, and flanker) predicted supervisor ratings and a simulated job-performance task as well as the Wonderlic Personnel Test (an intelligence test often used for selection purposes). Further, subgroup differences in scores between Black and White participants were around 40% smaller for the executive attention scores compared to Wonderlic performance. Another study found that attention control predicted multitasking ability above and beyond fluid intelligence and ASVAB scores while also reducing Black-White score differences by also around 40% compared to the differences observed in ASVAB 
(Martin, Mashburn et al. 2020
; see also Burgoyne et al., 2021 for unreported analyses).
When considering the goal of reducing subgroup differences, attention measures seem to have a major advantage over working memory measuressimplicity. Consider the operation span task in which instructions and practice alone take over nine minutes on average (see 
Table 5
 from 
Foster et a., 2015)
 in the standard administration and involve explaining multiple aspects of the task: the primary task (maintain the to-be-recalled items in mind), the response s"""
