Introduction
Trial by jury is a long-standing democratic institution that relies upon lay citizens to decide the outcomes of criminal and civil cases. Juries are used in criminal cases in more than fifty countries around the world ; juries in civil cases are more limited in scope but continue to decide important disputes in a number of countries 
(Vidmar, 2000)
. There are multiple justifications for including lay participants as legal decision makers 
(Vidmar & Hans, 2007)
. Supporters note that juries are sound fact finders who bring community knowledge to bear on the interpretation of evidence and the resolution of legal disputes. Their verdicts in criminal cases provide community judgments about whether actions constitute wrongdoing. In civil cases, juries consider whether the parties' actions depart from community norms of responsibility and evaluate the worth of a plaintiff's injuries. Juries also serve as a check on jaded, biased, or corrupt judges. The community's involvement helps to promote civic engagement and enhance the legitimacy of the justice system, in part because jurors become more positive about the legal system and more likely to engage in other forms of civic activity following their service as jurors 
(Gastil et al., 2010;
Hans et al., 2014)
. National surveys confirm substantial public support for and confidence in the jury system in the countries that use it 
(Roberts & Hough, 2011
).
Yet some question why a group of lay citizens with no relevant background or law training should decide legal cases. They point out that although the involvement of lay citizens might have made sense at an earlier time, when there was a dearth of legally-trained judges, legal experts are plentiful in contemporary times in most countries and thus it is no longer necessary to rely on laypeople. Some critics raise concerns about the competence of the jury in understanding trial evidence and legal instructions, especially if the case is complex 
(Bornstein & Greene, 2017)
. Others worry about racial, gender, and other prejudices that may infect jury decisionmaking. Compared to White Americans, Black and Latinx Americans show less support for the jury as a trustworthy decision-making body 
(Rose et al., 2008)
. In civil cases, plaintiffs face juries who often doubt the veracity of their testimony; in contrast, business and corporate defendants say they do not get a fair shake from juries who are inclined to reach into deep corporate pockets to compensate plaintiffs 
(Hans, 2000)
. The jury selection process, some fear, is inadequate in identifying biased prospective jurors; indeed, it is thought to be a site where race discrimination flourishes.
Psychology and law research has played a significant role in the debates over trial by jury. Researchers have empirically examined the arguments of supporters that juries are competent fact finders, and that participation helps to shore up civic engagement. They have also tested claims about jury biases and prejudices. A major challenge in assessing arguments over the jury is that, in many cases, because the determination of defendant responsibility and the dollar value of a plaintiff's injury are contextual social judgments, it is often impossible to say whether the jury is "correct" in its decisions. Even so, 
Hastie, Penrod, and Pennington (1983)
 identified a set of criteria that can be used to assess the reasonableness of jury decision-making, including the counterbalancing of biases, accurate comprehension and application of the law, accurate interpretation of the evidence, and robust deliberation.
Psychology and law researchers have relied heavily on the experimental method of mock juries to test competence and fairness claims 
(Bornstein & Greene, 2017)
. The method has some limitations, such as whether the findings from experimental research are generalizable to real world jury decision-making. 
Hunt (2015)
 has further argued that mock jury research likely understates jurors' racial bias. Fortunately, other methods of jury research have also emerged, including comparisons of judge and jury verdicts, post-trial interviews, case studies, and archival research. The collected research has confirmed some of the strengths of the jury as a fact-finding body that incorporates and reflects community judgment. It has also highlighted continuing challenges to the jury's competence and fairness.


How Juries Function: Psychological Models of Juror and Jury Decision-Making
In order to understand how jurors process evidence and come to sound decisions in criminal and civil cases, psychologists have developed several evidence-based models. Some are focused on the individual level of the juror, while others address the group decision-making process of the jury.


Individual Juror Decision Models
The most common theory of jury decision-making at the individual juror-level is the Story Model, which offers a compelling descriptive account of how jurors interpret and integrate trial evidence 
(Pennington & Hastie, 1986
Penrod & Hastie, 1979)
. Trials are information-rich events with an array of compelling details presented by the two adversaries. The Story Model posits that as they hear the evidence, jurors actively organize it into a chronological narrative 
(Pennington & Hastie, 1986
. Instead of passively absorbing the information they are being fed, jurors continuously distinguish between the evidence that they think is consistent with their predispositions and worthy of attention, and the evidence they believe is irrelevant, incorporating only the former into their narrative accounts 
(Devine, 2012;
Green & Swets, 1966)
.
During a trial, evidence is often presented in a non-chronological fashion, which can be cognitively taxing. Jurors take these disjointed facts and put them together, creating a causal sequence of actions that link an original cause to its subsequent effects. Jurors interpret evidence in line with their preexisting views and knowledge about the world as they build a cohesive narrative of the case 
(Hastie et al., 1983)
. They use their prior associations regarding common sequences of events, actions, and people, through schemas and stereotypes, to place the evidence within an episodic structure 
(Pennington & Hastie, 1993)
. Once jurors construct their narrative account for the events of the case, they look for the best match between the account and the available verdict alternatives to arrive at a final decision.


Group Decision Models
After jurors have developed their individual stories based on their interpretation and integration of the evidence, the group deliberation becomes an open discussion in which jurors share their respective narrative accounts of the underlying events 
(Devine, 2012;
Levett & Devine, 2017;
Stasser, 1988)
. They sample from each other's accounts to either bolster or modify their own account of the details and verdict preferences. In turn, these stories play an influential and persuasive role in the jury's deliberation. In this section, we will review the models that take this next step of examining the group deliberation process. 
Levett and Devine (2017)
 observed that many jury decision-making models stop at the individual level and do not attempt to connect the individual verdict preferences of jurors to the group context. Their multilevel theory of jury decision-making links phenomena at the level of the individual juror with the experiences in the jury's group deliberation. This model acknowledges that jurors' individual differences matter and thus that they are not interchangeable commodities. Further, the model depicts how social influence operates through deliberation and describes the influence of majority factions on group verdicts.
Another multilevel theory of group decision-making regarding juries is the DISCUSS Model 
(Stasser, 1988)
 which is built atop several predecessors that each added an essential component to the model. The first predecessor, the Social Decision Schemes framework, provided a foundation for examining how juries come to a collective decision 
(Davis, 1973)
.
This model examined the probability of a verdict given the distribution of the individual jurors' initial preferences. The Social Decision Schemes framework established that a robust "strengthin-numbers" or majority effect exists; the probability of a certain verdict being selected is directly proportional to the initial number of jurors who prefer that verdict. A subsequent model, Social Transition Schemes, built upon this finding to better understand how the distribution of verdict preferences can shift over time 
(Kerr, 1981)
, and another model, Social Interaction Schemes, further highlighted how individual jurors' confidence in their preferred verdict can wane during deliberation 
(Stasser & Davis, 1981)
.
The current DISCUSS model adds to these initial models by emphasizing the importance of the deliberation process as the jurors come to a final consensus. This model incorporates a participation parameter that reflects each juror's willingness to speak and influence over the initial preference distribution. Oral participation and influence are not equally distributed among jurors 
(Levett & Devine, 2017;
Stasser, 1988)
. Instead, the deliberation room reflects the social dynamics of American society. Research has shown that the jurors who speak more during deliberation tend to be extroverted, White, and male; they tend to have higher socioeconomic status and a higher need for cognition 
(Levett & Devine, 2017;
Rose et al., 2008;
Hastie et al., 1983;
Shestowsky & Horowitz, 2004;
York & Cornwell, 2006)
. When jurors of color and women jurors offer a dissenting opinion, they are more likely to be discredited, particularly when they are perceived as angry 
(Salerno et al., 2019)
.
The comprehensive nature of the DISCUSS Model has made it a prominent model of jury-level decision-making. Given the complexity of group dynamics, more elements may be added in the future to account for factors such as the weight that certain jurors' comments receive, the discounting of others' positions, and the resolution of conflict when unanimity is required.


Jury Size and Decision Rule
Psychologists have contributed to important legal debates over the jury's size and whether it is required to reach a unanimous or majority decision. In the 1970s, the traditional 12person jury required to reach a unanimous verdict came under scrutiny after U.S. Supreme Court decisions finding that a jury of 12 persons was not constitutionally required in state courts 
(Williams v. Florida, 1970
 (upholding six-person jury in state court criminal case); Colgrove v 
Battin, 1973
 (upholding six-person jury in state court civil case)). In a pair of decisions, the Court concluded that unanimity was not required either 
(Apodaca v. Oregon, 1972;
Johnson v. Louisiana, 1972)
. Among other justifications, the Court asserted the similarity of juries of different sizes and decision rules as one of the reasons to permit smaller and nonunanimous juries. However, a substantial body of research -some undertaken by psychologists studying group processes in their research laboratories -showed multiple ways in which smaller and nonunanimous juries were inferior 
(Devine et al., 2001;
Hans, 2001;
Saks & Marti, 1997)
. Larger juries do a better job representing the community; they are better factfinders as well 
(Diamond et al., 2009;
Higginbotham et al., 2021)
. Research shows that deliberation under a unanimity requirement offers a better platform than majority rule for minority voices and promotes careful and thorough jury deliberations 
Ellsworth, 1989)
. Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed course on jury unanimity, concluding that it was required for serious cases in state court criminal jury trials (Ramos v. 
Louisiana, 2020)
. Judges have also urged their fellow judges to empanel larger juries when they have the discretion to do so 
(Higginbotham et al., 2021)
.


Legal Instructions and Commonsense Justice
Though the Story Model and the DISCUSS Model offer streamlined descriptions of juror and jury decision-making processes, in practice, jury trials can be complex. In the courtroom, the two sides and their witnesses often present conflicting information. Jurors receive legal instructions from the judge in a process that has been described as "being doused with a kettleful of lawâ€¦ that would make a third-year law student blanch" (Skidmore v. 
Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 1948, p. 64;
Diamond et al., 2012)
. Jurors must take in all of this information and then apply the legal standards to arrive at a verdict 
(Daftary-Kapur et al., 2010)
.
Research suggests that the cognitive tasks in jury decision-making can be difficult 
(Lieberman & Sales, 1997)
. Jurors find many legal instructions challenging to understand and apply 
(Elwork et al., 1982;
Reifman et al., 1992)
. They are often presented only orally at the end of the trial evidence, and typically include substantial amounts of unfamiliar language and legalese. Instructions about how jurors should weigh the evidence in determining whether to give a death sentence or life imprisonment to capital defendants are particularly difficult to comprehend 
(Hans, 1988)
.
Concerns about jury comprehension of the law have led many jurisdictions to draw on psycholinguistic principles to develop model jury instructions that promote clearer expressions of the law 
(Tiersma, 1993)
. Reforms like providing jurors with written instructions in conjunction with the judge reading them aloud 
(Sand & Reiss, 1985)
, and giving substantive legal instructions to jurors at the beginning and conclusion of the trial, rather than just at the end 
(Smith, 1991a)
, can all help increase juror comprehension and reduce jurors' reliance upon their own intuitions and biases, as jurors understand instructions less well when they conflict with their intuitions 
(Daftary-Kapur et al., 2010)
. Arizona is one of the states that has revised its model jury instructions to make them more understandable; a recent estimate based on analysis of Arizona civil jurors' deliberation comments indicates that most (79%) comments regarding the legal instructions were accurate 
(Diamond et al., 2012)
.
As jurors assess whether the facts in the case fit the legal elements included in the judicial instructions, jurors may turn to their own intuitive notions of the legal concepts. The idea of commonsense justice 
(Finkel, 1995
(Finkel, , 2000
 reflects the tendency of a juror to apply their general understandings of the law to the legal concepts that are presented to them in the trial. To match their own intuitive ideas of the law, jurors may construe legalistic language in ways that the law may not have intended 
(Finkel, 1995)
. Jurors' understanding of the law is best when the law aligns with their intuitions. This process also extends to their prototypes of the offense at hand 
(Finkel & Groscup, 1997)
. Just as jurors have an intuition regarding the meaning of legal concepts, such as "beyond a reasonable doubt" and "mitigating circumstances," they also hold prototypes of legal offenses, like assault, kidnapping, and murder 
(Smith, 1991b)
. Jurors hold prototypical conceptions about who typically commits certain crimes and subjective beliefs about how people commit legal offenses 
(Finkel & Groscup, 1997;
Gordon & Anderson, 1995;
Sunnafrank & Fontes, 1983)
. The product of societal knowledge, these prototypes may differ from the way that the offenses actually occur in society 
(Gerbner & Gross, 1976)
. The prototypicality of a crime is significantly related to conviction rates; when the circumstances and details of a crime fit jurors' expectations, they are more likely to convict the defendant 
(Smith, 1991b
(Smith, , 1993
.


Importance of Diverse Jury Selection
Structural, cultural, and identity factors all combine to shape jurors' views and perceptions of how the world works 
(Oyserman & Lewis, 2017)
, which in turn inform their interpretation of evidence and their decision-making. Different jurors from different walks of life bring different perspectives and legal intuitions into the deliberation room. Considering the influence of these individual factors, the selection of the jury is an important phase of the trial and can play a significant role in promoting sound and fair factfinding.
Increasing the representativeness of a jury brings in critical perspectives that are often missing or overlooked and encourages members to consider alternative perspectives that may not have been salient to them. Consider the experiment conducted by 
Sommers (2006)
 in which all-White or racially-mixed White and Black mock juries listened to a trial with a Black defendant.
Compared to the all-White mock juries, the racially-mixed mock jury deliberations were longer, covered more case facts, and were more accurate. In a representative jury, the details jurors recall and the narratives they construct may meaningfully differ, which can lead to a richer exploration of the evidence during deliberation 
(Hastie et al., 1983)
. Including a heterogeneous array of perspectives in the jury box may reduce the negative effects of some jurors' preexisting implicit and other biases 
(Vidmar & Hans, 2007)
. 
Hunt (2017)
 points out, though, that research on juries' racial composition, and research on juries and race more broadly, has tended to focus mostly on Black-White comparisons. She acknowledges the value of this research given the long history of African-Americans' racial oppression and unequal treatment in the U.S. legal system. However, she also urges researchers to move "beyond the Black-White binary" 
(Hunt, 2017, p. 89)
 to examine the experiences of and reactions to other racial and ethnic groups, and to consider how race and ethnicity intersect with gender, socioeconomic status, and other characteristics.
Despite the factfinding and legitimacy benefits of jury diversity, research on real-world jury selection practices shows that they often fall short of summoning representative cross-sections of the population to serve 
(Diamond & Hans, in press
). It is difficult to mount a successful challenge to a jury pool's nonrepresentative character 
(Hannaford-Agor & Waters, 2011)
. And the legal approach used to manage unconstitutional race-and gender-based peremptory challenges under Batson v. 
Kentucky (1986;
see discussion in Gertner et al., 2020)
 is widely considered to be ineffective.


Jury Competence
Psychologists have also investigated the issue of jury competence. As we noted, a complicating factor in assessing the accuracy of jury decisions is that in many criminal and civil cases, there is no single correct case outcome and decision accuracy may not be ascertainable.
Many criminal and civil trials require juries to come to social judgments as jurors often can't determine "ground truth," which may make it difficult to say definitively whether a jury came to the "right" decision. In order to address these concerns, researchers have developed several methods to assess jury competence. We discuss three prominent means to assess jury competence.
Some researchers have assessed the rate of jury-judge agreement on trial outcomes.
Given that judges are legal experts and most jury members are legal novices, comparing the verdict that a judge would come to with the jury's actual decision provides a metric to evaluate the jury's performance. In judge-jury agreement studies, researchers survey trial judges presiding over jury trials and ask them to record details about the evidence, parties, and jury's verdict, as well as what verdict they would have reached if they had been deciding the case themselves 
Hans et al., 2003;
Heuer & Penrod, 1994b;
Kalven & Zeisel, 1966)
.
Agreement rates between judges' hypothetical verdicts and juries' actual verdicts are high, with judges agreeing with juries' liability and damages verdicts about 75% to 80% of the time in civil and criminal cases. These agreement rates are about the same in straightforward cases and more complex cases, suggesting that divergent decisions are not due to misunderstanding the evidence in the trial 
(Eisenberg et al., 2005;
Heuer & Penrod, 1994b;
Kalven & Zeisel, 1966)
. Instead, disagreements between judge and jury verdicts occur primarily in cases with evenly balanced evidence, where either verdict might be justified. Judges in evenly balanced criminal cases are more conviction-prone than juries 
(Eisenberg et al., 2005;
Kalven & Zeisel, 1966)
.
Another way to assess jury competence is to measure the quantity and strength of evidence in a case and assess the extent to which it is associated with jury verdicts (e.g., 
Devine et al., 2007)
. Multiple studies of jury decision-making have found that the best predictor of the jury's eventual verdict is the strength of the evidence presented at trial 
Eisenberg et al., 2005;
Hannaford-Agor et al., 2002;
Heuer & Penrod, 1994b)
. A large-scale meta-analysis of the factors that influence jury decisions showed that there is a strong positive correlation between the strength of evidence against a defendant and the jury coming to a guilty or liable verdict 
(Devine et al., 2001)
. That offers some reassurance that jurors comprehend and judge the evidence in line with the weight of the trial evidence. Nonetheless, navigating extremely complex trials with multiple parties and complicated legal and evidentiary issues can be challenging.
Lastly, some researchers have used interviews and experiments to test comprehension and bias in evidence evaluation 
(Vidmar, 1997)
. Post-trial surveys and interviews of jurors provide rich data on the deliberation process, while experiments with mock juries allow researchers to cleanly test the impact of various factors regarding the case on juror comprehension and treatment of evidence. For example, studies have investigated the effect of expert testimony on mock jurors, finding that juries carefully assess expert evidence despite finding it challenging 
(Devine et al., 2001)
. Economic, numerical, and statistical evidence presented by experts can be especially difficult to comprehend, underscoring the potential value of using visual aids to communicate the meaning of numbers and allowing jurors under controlled circumstances to ask questions of the expert witnesses 
(Helm et al., 2017)
.
Although juries are generally sound decision-making bodies, jurors are not impervious to societal biases that may have an impact on their decisions. Researchers have applied systematic research techniques to the jury setting, obtaining information about the factors that affect jury decision-making; they also offer ways to test possible improvements to the jury decision-making process.


Jury Fairness
Even though the general report card on juries is good, psychological research has confirmed the influence of implicit and explicit biases 
(Hunt, 2015
(Hunt, , 2017
. Jurors are active information processors who bring their prior knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes with them into the courtroom. In the presence of uncertainty, jurors may turn to their own intuitive notions of the law and the world, and these notions can detrimentally affect their decision-making. Individual differences among jurors may influence their attention to the evidence, their narrative construction, their participation in the deliberation, and their verdict preferences. Emotional reactions to the parties and the evidence may also affect decision-making 
(Salerno, 2021)
. The elaboration likelihood model suggests that humans engage in different information processing strategies, depending on their ability and motivation to use effortful processing 
(Petty & Cacioppo, 1986)
. When people do not engage in effortful processing, they rely on mental shortcuts or heuristics to simplify the task at hand. Cognitive heuristics such as anchoring, the availability bias, hindsight bias, and confirmation bias can all lead to erroneous conclusions about the probative value of evidence 
(Bornstein & Greene, 2011
, 2017
.
Defendant characteristics such as criminal history, individual differences among jurors including their attitudes towards crime control and due process, and types of evidence can bias jury decisions. For instance, extensive negative pretrial publicity about the case and parties involved can shape interpretations and weight of trial evidence during jury deliberation 
(Vidmar & Hans, 2007)
. Moreover, the jury's awareness of a defendant's criminal record increases the likelihood of a conviction 
(Eisenberg & Hans, 2009;
Steblay et al., 2006)
. Jurors' emotional reactions to evidence influence decision-making; experimental research varying mock jurors' exposure to gruesome photographs or other vivid evidence of injury has found that mock jurors respond with disgust and that emotional reaction leads them to be more likely to blame and punish the defendant in both criminal and civil trials 
(Salerno, 2021)
. Victim impact evidence may increase empathy for the victim and lead to increased recommendations that the defendant be sentenced to death, mock jury research shows 
(Paternoster & Deise, 2011)
.
When faced with a complex decision-making task that requires effortful processing, jurors may rely on stereotypes to simplify the process and determine what is relevant evidence to be remembered and what is irrelevant evidence to be ignored 
(Bodenhausen & Lichtenstein, 1987)
. In complex trials where the race of the defendant differs from that of the individual juror's race, racial stereotypes have been shown to exert a strong influence on juror decisionmaking processes 
(Bodenhausen, 1988;
Bodenhausen & Lichtenstein, 1987)
. The similarityleniency effect manifests in the tendency for jurors to make more lenient decisions for same-race defendants and harsher decisions for other-race defendants 
(Devine & Caughlin, 2014;
Mitchell et al., 2005)
. When juries are composed of greater numbers of people who are dissimilar to the defendant, defendants are significantly more likely to be convicted of the crime 
(Bradbury & Williams, 2013;
Flanagan, 2018
; but see 
Taylor & Hosch, 2004
, who did not find a similarityleniency effect or the reverse "black sheep effect" of harsher within-race decisions in Texas jury verdicts). In Canada, Australia, and the United States, indigenous peoples are overrepresented as defendants and underrepresented as jurors in criminal trials 
(Anthony & Longman, 2017)
. In Canada, these communities have historically been barred from serving on juries, undermining the goal of building representative and impartial juries 
(Israel, 2003)
.
Implicit racial preferences can affect judgments of tort injuries. In one mock juror experiment that varied stereotypically White and Black names of tort litigants, the higher a participant's IAT score indicating a preference for White over Black faces, the less likely a White defendant was to be held liable 
(Cardi et al., 2020)
. There was some evidence of devaluation of tort injuries suffered by Black plaintiffs as well. The awards for the injuries suffered by Black plaintiffs were lower than awards for White plaintiffs who experienced the same injuries 
(Cardi et al., 2020)
. A field study analyzing noneconomic damage awards for plaintiffs of different (imputed) races also found that Black plaintiffs received less in economic damages than White plaintiffs, even when the researchers controlled for the amount of economic damages 
(Girvan & Marek, 2016)
. The psychological research on implicit and explicit biases in both criminal and civil contexts again underscores the importance of seating representative juries.


Research Findings on Jury Reforms
In addition to researching the impact of individual and group phenomena in juries, psychologists and legal scholars have studied innovations aimed at strengthening the jury decision-making process. Earlier, we discussed jury size and decision rule. In addition, research has shown that the inclusion of jurors from diverse racial backgrounds in the jury box has implications for the amount of time spent deliberating, the quality of deliberation, the verdict reached, and the overall salience of race for their fellow White jurors 
(Sommers, 2006
), yet these groups are continuously underrepresented in the jury box. Although juries today are more heterogeneous than they have ever been 
(Guzy, 2012)
, they are not fully representative along racial and ethnic lines 
(Diamond & Rose, 2018;
Flanagan, 2015)
. Reliance on a single list of citizens' names (for example, voter registration lists) and limited follow-up in sending out jury summons both tend to create nonrepresentative jury pools. Therefore, the use of multiple source lists, multiple follow-up communications, and community outreach efforts have all been recommended 
(Diamond & Hans, 2023;
Mize et al., 2007)
.
The influence of potentially biasing backgrounds, experiences, and attitudes suggests the need to question prospective jurors about these factors during the voir dire phase of jury selection in the courtroom. A survey of current U.S. practices, however, shows that courtroom jury selection varies widely. Some courts engage in minimal questioning by the judge alone, and rely on prospective jurors to self-identify their biases, whereas other courts allow attorneys along with the judge to engage in more extensive questioning to probe potential juror biases 
(Mize et al., 2007)
. 
Salerno et al. (2021)
 examined the relative benefits of minimal versus extended voir dire questioning and judicial rehabilitation in a mock juror study using civil cases. Minimal voir dire questions, which relied upon prospective jurors to volunteer their own biases, did not predict participants' judgments, in contrast to the predictive success of the expanded voir dire questions, which tapped attitudes about civil justice. That indicates the benefit of expanded voir dire to identify jurors whose views could potentially bias their interpretations of evidence. A short judicial rehabilitation video was ineffective in reducing the impact of attitudinal biases on case decisions. Thus, expanded jury selection procedures which allow for both open-ended and closeended questioning of prospective jurors permit better identification of jurors whose existing biases could lead them to prejudge the case 
(Vidmar & Hans, 2007)
.
Psychologists and legal reformers have begun investigating ways to reduce or eliminate implicit and other biases, especially racial bias 
(Paluck et al., 2021)
. Some courts have developed debiasing videos for prospective jurors that feature judges explaining the concept of implicit bias and encouraging jurors to monitor themselves to ensure their decisions are unaffected by bias (United States District Court, Western District of Washington, 2021). It is too soon to tell whether such instructions are effective in the real world 
(Elek & Hannaford-Agor, 2013
.
Further, in an effort to account for implicit bias, the state courts in Washington state (Wash. R.
Gen. Application 37, 2018) and California (A.B. 3070, 2020) have passed new laws that state if an objective observer would conclude that race or gender was a factor in a peremptory challenge, then the peremptory challenge shall be denied.
In addition to these efforts, researchers have tested a variety of trial innovations, such as permitting jurors to take notes during the trial 
(Heuer & Penrod, 1994a;
Rosenhan et al., 1994)
, allowing jurors to discuss the evidence amongst themselves during trial breaks 
(Diamond et al., 2003;
Hannaford-Agor et al., 2000)
, and giving jurors the opportunity to ask questions of the witnesses 
(Heuer & Penrod, 1994a)
. Jurors react favorably to these decision-making aids, and in some instances, such aids can improve jury competence 
(Forsterlee & Horowitz, 2003;
Rosenhan et al., 1994)
.


Conclusion
Trial by jury remains a significant element in the legal systems of the U.S. and in many other countries. It permits a measure of community participation, which in turn increases support for the legitimacy of the legal systems. Although psychological research confirms that, on the whole, representative juries possess many strengths, some studies also point to areas of concern.
Future research should consider methods for further enhancing the competence and fairness of jury trials. Testing different approaches to presenting complex evidence and to debiasing jury decision-making would be valuable contributions in the next generation of jury research.
Much of the research on the institution of the jury has been conducted in the U.S., England, and Canada. However, with more than fifty countries relying on juries to decide serious criminal cases, and still others using laypeople as lay magistrates or as lay members of mixed courts, there are good reasons to expand the research beyond these common law countries . Comparing and contrasting diverse approaches to the use of lay citizens as decision makers may offer new insights about ways to strengthen the community's voice in legal cases.
