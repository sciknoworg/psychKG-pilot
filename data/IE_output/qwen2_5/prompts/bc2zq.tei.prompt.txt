You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Public Significance Statements
• This study presents an evidence accumulation model that generates testable predictions for multi-alternative decision-making, applicable across diverse cognitive domains.  


Pseudo-Optimal Evidence Accumulation as a Foundation for Multi-Choice Irrationalities
A principled understanding of human decision-making is a central issue in behavioral science, with implications for statistics, economics, cognitive psychology, and computational neuroscience 
(Bogacz et al., 2006;
Gold & Shadlen, 2001;
Green & Swets, 1966;
Luce, 1959;
Savage, 1954;
Tajima et al., 2019)
. One major challenge, however, is that human decision behavior often cannot be described by simple statistical norms 
(Hoven et al., 2019;
Kellen et al., 2020;
Miyoshi et al., 2024;
Rahnev & Denison, 2018;
Zheng et al., 2022)
. This is particularly evident in multi-choice scenarios (i.e., choice among three or more options), and finding the roots of such non-normative behavior is considered a crucial step toward elucidating the fundamental laws of decision-making 
(Chang et al., 2019;
Charman et al., 2011;
Furl, 2016;
Louie et al., 2013;
Windschitl & Chambers, 2004)
. To advance this goal, this study presents mathematical modeling of non-normative threechoice behaviors, considering choice proportion, response time (RT), and decision confidence.
This study revolves around two critical phenomena within the relevant disciplines. The first is the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) axiom (e.g., 
Luce, 1959)
. Typically, this phenomenon manifests as a change in the relative choice proportion between the first alternative (target stimulus with the greatest intensity) and the second alternative (distractor stimulus with the second greatest intensity) with varying intensities of the third alternative (dud stimulus with the lowest intensity) 
(Chang et al., 2019;
Furl, 2016;
Louie et al., 2013)
. This observation challenges broad decision-making models operating on the ratio-of-strength principle (e.g., the softmax transformation as a notable implementation of this principle) and is considered a pivotal topic in the literature 
(Dagsvik, 2016;
Furl, 2016;
Gluth, Kern, Kortmann, et al., 2020;
Louie et al., 2013)
.
However, previous studies reporting the IIA violation have produced mixed results on whether the target vs. distractor choice proportion increases or decreases with respect to the third alternative's intensity 
(Chang et al., 2019;
Cox & Kable, 2014;
Furl, 2016;
Gluth et al., 2018;
Gluth, Kern, Kortmann, et al., 2020;
Holper et al., 2017;
Louie et al., 2013;
 STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 4 
Rustichini et al., 2017;
Webb et al., 2020)
. One potential reason for this inconsistency is that these studies predominantly focused on value-based decision-making, where stimulus intensity is defined through participants' subjective rating or bidding. These measures themselves are outcomes of subjective decision process and are prone to random internal fluctuations. Therefore, the present study scrutinized the IIA violation in three-alternative dot numerosity discrimination, where objective physical quantity defines stimulus intensity 
(Figure 1)
. In this psychophysical experiment, we manipulated the intensity of the third stimulus over a broader range than in previous research.
This approach allowed us to thoroughly characterize the impact of the third alternative on participants' choice behavior and provided robust constraints for testing our proposed model. Another phenomenon of interest is a so-called dud-alternative confidence boost, wherein subjective decision confidence irrationally increases with the inclusion of an additional, clearly incorrect alternative in choice lineups (e.g., 
Charman et al., 2011;
Hanczakowski et al., 2014;
Windschitl & Chambers, 2004)
. Adding an extra alternative should not improve actual decision accuracy but unreasonably inflates subjective confidence, highlighting a stark dissociation between objective vs. subjective senses of decision accuracy (i.e., metacognitive miscalibration). This phenomenon contradicts ideal probabilistic computation 
(Ma, 2010;
Meyniel et al., 2015;
Pouget et al., 2016)
 and thus offers valuable insights into human metacognitive processes (for a comprehensive review on confidence and metacognition, see 
Miyoshi et al., 2024)
. Moreover, this phenomenon has practical implications in areas such as face lineup memory, contributing to the development of fair eyewitness identification procedures 
(Wixted et al., 2018
(Wixted et al., , 2021
Wixted & Wells, 2017)
. Despite recent research across various cognitive domains 
(Comay et al., 2023;
Horry & Brewer, 2016)
, the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon remains elusive. This paper proceeds as follows. We begin by presenting behavioral data from a preregistered three-choice dot discrimination task, focusing on the IIA violation and the dud-alternative confidence boost (see 
Table A1
 for the preregistered protocol). Next, we introduce our computational model, developed based on pilot data (see 
Figure S1
) and grounded in the evidence STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 5 accumulation framework (e.g., 
Bogacz et al., 2006;
Gold & Shadlen, 2001;
Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008;
Tajima et al., 2019)
. We then validate the model using the three-choice data, assessing its alignment with the preregistered behavioral trends. Finally, to further evaluate the model's generalizability, we test its predictive accuracy on separate two-choice data, employing parameters derived from the three-choice experiment.
Our model features three independent evidence accumulators and employes a max vs. next (MVN) algorithm, which renders a decision when the difference between the top two evidence values reaches a threshold. This algorithm is known in statistics for providing an asymptotically optimal multi-hypothesis sequential probability ratio test under specific conditions 
(McMillen & Behseta, 2010;
McMillen & Holmes, 2006)
. While several studies have employed this algorithm to describe human decision-making behavior (e.g., 
Ditterich, 2010;
Krajbich & Rangel, 2011)
, our study is the first to explore its connection to the IIA violation by manipulating the third stimulus intensity across a broad range.
To date, accumulator modeling of confidence has largely been confined to two-choice scenarios (though see 
Ratcliff & Starns, 2013)
. Moreover, most computational studies have attributed confidence formation solely to evidence accumulation during the post-decisional phase 
(Fleming & Daw, 2017;
Hellmann et al., 2023;
Maniscalco et al., 2021;
Navajas et al., 2016;
Pereira et al., 2020;
Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010;
Yu et al., 2015)
. In contrast, we posit that confidence arises from both the post-decisional phase and the period immediately following stimulus presentation.
The importance of this early period in shaping confidence has been highlighted in experimental studies 
(Cai et al., 2022;
Hoven et al., 2022;
Shekhar & Rahnev, 2018;
Xue et al., 2023;
Zylberberg et al., 2012
), yet this insight has not been integrated into contemporary computational research. Additionally, our pilot results indicate that this early-stage component may contribute to the dud-alternative confidence boost (see 
Figure A1
). This study, therefore, examines the STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 6 effectiveness of our proposed confidence rule in capturing participants' confidence rating behavior across varying stimulus intensities.
In summary, this study seeks to elucidate the dynamics of non-normative multi-choice behaviors through a grounded computational framework-a milestone not yet attained in related research. By incorporating the early-stage development of confidence, our model offers fresh insights into the computations underlying metacognitive monitoring. Therefore, successfully validating our proposed model would mark a significant advance in unravelling principled laws of decision-making.


Method


Participants
We recruited 24 participants (12 males, 12 females; aged 19-24, M = 20.88, SD = 2.19). The sample size was determined through a power analysis based on pilot data. Data from one participant were excluded according to preregistered exclusion criteria (see Supplementary Material).
Participants took part in our experiment for a total of four days and were compensated with 1,500 yen for their participation each day.


Ethics Information
The research protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the Graduate School of Informatics at Kyoto University. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants.


Apparatus
We used the free software PsychoPy 3 (version 2022.2.4) to conduct the experiment. Stimuli were presented on a 23.8-inch LCD monitor with a display resolution of 1920 x 1080, set against a black background. Participants viewed the monitor from a distance of 57.3 cm in a darkened room.
Additionally, Tobii Pro Spectrum was used to record participants' eye movements at a 120 Hz STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 7 sampling rate. Note that the eye-tracking data were not the primary focus of this study, and we used eye-tracking only to ensure that participants maintained appropriate engagement with the task.


Procedure
Participants performed dot numerosity discrimination tasks spanning four days. The initial three days involved a three-choice experiment, designed as an exact replica of our pilot experiment 
(Figure 1)
. On the fourth day, participants conducted a two-choice experiment, intended as a generalization test for our proposed model trained in the preceding three-choice experiment. 


Three-Choice Experiment
The experiment spanned across three days, with participants completing a minimum of six practice trials followed by a main experiment consisting of eight blocks of 72 trials per day.
Participants had at least a one-minute break between the blocks. They received correct/incorrect performance feedback after each practice trial, but no feedback was provided during the main experiment. Before each block, participants underwent eye-tracking calibration under the default settings of PsychoPy 3. If eye-tracking recording was interrupted during an experimental block, the block was restarted to ensure that every participant completed eight blocks in total. This resulted in a total of 1,728 trials per participant.


STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 8
At the beginning of each trial, participants fixated on a white fixation cross measuring 0.5° of visual angle. The fixation cross was placed 1.5 cm below the center of the screen to ensure proper display of all stimuli. An invisible area of interest (AOI) was defined spanning 2° around the fixation cross. Once participants maintained their gaze within the AOI for 500 ms, the fixation cross disappeared and two or three white-rimmed circles of a 10° diameter appeared. The circles remained on the screen for 3,000 ms or until a response was made. These circles were evenly spaced and positioned at the upper middle, lower left, and lower right of the fixation point. The centers of the circles lay on the circumference of an invisible circle of a 20° diameter, centered at the fixation cross. Each circle contained specific numbers of white dots of a 0.15° diameter, representing a choice option corresponding to the target (numerosity = 100), distractor (numerosity = 90), and dud stimulus (six within-participant conditions: numerosity = 0, 
27, 45, 63, 76, or 86)
. The configuration of the dots was randomized across trials, presented at randomly selected grid points inside each circle. Notably, the dud condition of 0 represented a two-alternative choice between the target and distractor, with only the two circles being visible.
During each trial, participants were required to choose the stimulus of the greatest numerosity by pressing the up, left, or right arrow key as quickly as possible. They had 3,000 ms to make their choice, and if they failed to respond within this time, a warning message appeared, and the trial was excluded from subsequent data analyses. After responding, they reported confidence in their choice on a four-point scale. They were instructed to use the entire range of the confidence scale throughout the experiment, and there was no time limit for the confidence report. After the confidence report, a 300 ms interval followed before the next trial started. The order of the trials was randomized across participants, with the dud value (six conditions) and the location of each option (six different patterns of target, distractor, and dud positions) being fully crossed within each block (each of the 36 different combinations was repeated twice within each block).


Two-Choice Experiment
STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 9
On the fourth day, participants completed eight two-choice blocks, each composed of 72 trials. Prior to the main trials, participants underwent a practice session and eye-tracking calibration, following the same protocol used in the three-choice experiment.
The procedure for the main trial mirrored that of the dud = 0 condition in the three-choice experiment. Two circles were presented, positioned either at the upper middle, lower left, or lower right of the fixation point, prompting participants to select the circle containing a larger number of dots. The critical manipulation involved setting the target value to 92, 96, and 100, while the distractor value remained constant at 90. Trial sequences were randomized across participants, ensuring that the target value (three conditions) and the location of each option (six different patterns of target and distractor positions) were fully crossed within each block (each of the 18 different combinations was repeated four times within each block).
This experimental design aimed to investigate a confidence trend known as the double increase pattern (e.g., 
Rausch & Zehetleitner, 2019)
. According to the normative signal detection theory model 
(Green & Swets, 1966, pp 40-43)
, as the intensity of the target increases with constant distractor intensity, confidence in correct choices increases while confidence in incorrect choices decreases. However, empirical studies have documented instances where confidence increased both for correct and incorrect choices 
(Kiani et al., 2014;
Maniscalco et al., 2016;
Miyoshi et al., 2018;
Rausch et al., 2018
Rausch et al., , 2020
Stolyarova et al., 2019;
van den Berg et al., 2016;
Zawadzka et al., 2017)
.
Through computational modeling, the present study sought to understand the conditions and mechanisms that lead to this non-normative metacognitive behavior. To summarize, this experiment is designed as a generalization test to assess whether our proposed model, trained on three-choice data, can effectively generalize to two-choice data with special emphasis on participants' confidence rating behavior.

Three-Choice Experiment
STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 10


Behavioral Results
First, we analyzed three-choice data from 23 participants 
(Figure 2)
 regarding preregistered Hypotheses 1-4. All tests below were two-sided, with the significance level α set at .05. For mixed model analyses, we used maximum possible random effect structure 
(Barr et al., 2013)
. All the analyses were performed on the free statistical software R (version 4.2.2). Details of the preregistered analysis protocols are provided in 
Table A1
. 


STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 12
To test Hypotheses 1-2, we fit two variants of multinomial models 
Webb et al., 2020)
 to individual participants' data. These models predict the choice probability for each alternative using the softmax transformation of the stimulus utility (only the target and distractor were considered when the dud numerosity was zero).
[ , , ] = ( , , )
(1)
Here, the utility of each alternative Ui is calculated by the following transformation of each stimulus's numerosity Vi, where ΣjVj indicates the sum of all alternative values.
= + � = , , = , , �
(2)
A standard logit model estimates only the constant term λ with the relative coding parameter ω constrained to be 0. This is the classic implementation of the multinomial logit regression, which operates upon the IIA axiom 
(Luce, 1959;
Dagsvik, 2016)
. On the other hand, a relative coding model estimates both λ and ω as free parameters. With the inclusion of the ω parameter, this model deviates from the standard multinomial logit regression and allows for the violation of the IIA axiom. Specifically, the relative proportion of target vs. distractor choices increases against the dud value when ω < 0, whereas it decreases against the dud value when ω > 0
(the latter case is often discussed in its relation to divisive normalization, see 
Gluth, Kern, Kortmann, et al., 2020;
Louie et al., 2013;
Webb et al., 2020)
.
The model fitting showed that the relative coding model yielded a better AIC value than the standard logit model 
(Figure 3a)
, indicating the occurrence of the IIA Violation. Additionally, a one-STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 13 sample t-test indicated that the mean estimated ω parameter was significantly smaller than zero (t(22) = 2.41, p = .025; 
Figure 3b
), confirming that the relative proportion of target vs. distractor choices increased against the dud value. To test Hypothesis 3, we conducted a mixed linear regression on RT, incorporating choice outcome (two levels: target, distractor), dud value (six levels), and their interaction as fixed effects.
The model also included a random intercept and random slopes for choice outcome and dud value.
Likelihood-ratio tests revealed significant effects of choice outcome (χ 2 (1) = 38.44, p < .001) and dud value (χ 2 (5) = 211.78, p < .001), while their interaction was not significant (χ 2 (5) = 2.61, p = .759).
These results confirmed Hypothesis 3, indicating that mean RT was faster for target choice than distractor choice.
Next, to test Hypothesis 4, we performed a mixed linear regression on confidence, considering choice outcome, dud value, and their interaction as fixed effects. The model also incorporated a random intercept and random slopes for choice outcome and dud value. Likelihoodratio tests revealed significant effects of choice outcome (χ 2 (1) = 121.94, p < .001) and dud value (χ 2 (5) = 127.63, p < .001), while their interaction was nonsignificant (χ 2 (5) = 4.84, p = .436). Crucially, STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 14 a mixed model contrast between the dud conditions of 0 and 27 confirmed Hypothesis 4, demonstrating that the inclusion of the dud alternative increased mean confidence (t(32.9) = 4.95, p < .001).


Accumulator Modeling
Next, we conducted accumulator model analyses on the three-choice experiment 
(Figure 4)
.
The model consists of three independent accumulators, encoding the evidence in favor of target, distractor, and dud alternatives (only two accumulators were considered when the dud value was zero 1 ). According to the following equations, the evidence for each alternative evolves as a Markov
Gaussian process, where each time step t corresponds to 1 ms in the behavioral measure.
= −1 + * + (3) = −1 + * + (4) = −1 + * + (5)
The evidence accumulation rate for each alternative depends on the stimulus numerosity Vi, which is modulated by a scaling coefficient d 
(Gluth, Kern, Kortmann, et al., 2020;
Krajbich & Rangel, 2011)
. Additionally, there is Gaussian noise e t i with a standard deviation σ. For each time step, a noise was sampled independently for each accumulator according to Equations 6-8. Following the accumulator modeling convention (e.g., 
Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008)
, the scaling coefficient d was allowed to vary across trials, being sampled from a Gaussian distribution with a mean μd and a standard deviation σd.

We also introduced variability in the starting points of the accumulators. For each trial, the starting point of each accumulator was independently sampled from a zero-centered uniform distribution with its width defined by a parameter β. Namely, the starting points varied not only between trials but also among accumulators within each trial.
0~ (− , )

0~ (− , )

(12)
Our model employed the following max vs. next variable for decision-making, which is given by the evidence difference between the first-and second-place accumulators at each time step t.
= - − -
(13)
A choice is rendered the first time the MVN variable hits the threshold value set at 1 (this only serves as a scaling parameter), where the option of the highest evidence is selected.
ℎ = ( ℎ ) ( = , , )
(14)
Our pilot data have suggested that the MVN algorithm can lead to IIA violations even without the relative coding of stimulus numerosity, in contrast to the static multinomial models in Equations 1-2.
We further posited the development of the MVN variable during the initial 350 ms after stimulus onset as a fundamental basis for confidence construction. This time window broadly aligns with findings from transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies 
(Cai et al., 2022;
Shekhar & Rahnev, 2018;
Xue et al., 2023
; see Discussion for further details).
- = 350 − 0
(15)
This confidence variable represents the difference in the MVN variable between the two time points, indexing the net increase in the MVN variable during this period. This signifies the idea that the speed at which the initial decision variable develops is crucial in shaping decision confidence ( 
Figure A1
 illustrates how this confidence variable explains the dud-alternative confidence boost).
We assumed that the net increase of the MVN variable within the first 350 ms after decisionmaking also contributes to confidence formation (Equation 16). The assumption of post-decisional confidence formation aligns with earlier modeling work (e.g., 
Fleming & Daw, 2017;
Navajas et al., 2016;
Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010)
, and this specific time window is broadly consistent with behavioral and physiological findings from previous studies 
(Boldt & Yeung, 2015;
van den Berg et al., 2016)
.
- = ℎ +350 − ℎ
(16)
The MVN terms in Equation 16 were calculated contingent on the order of the accumulators at the time of choice. The minuend corresponds to the option ranked first, while the subtrahend STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 18 corresponds to the option ranked second. This choice-conditionality allows the model to review its decision correctness through post-decisional evidence accumulation.
We additionally posited that the model's confidence is established through a linear combination of these two confidence variables, with their relative contributions governed by the parameter γ. A high or low confidence rating was assigned by evaluating the combined confidence variable against the confidence threshold θ.
= × - + (1 − ) × - (17) = � ℎ ℎ > ℎ (18)
Finally, we introduced a non-decision time parameter τnd to account for the time required to form internal stimulus representations and execute a motor response. Thus, the current model has a total of seven free parameters, summarized below in 
Table 1

Validating the MVN model necessitates comparisons with other candidate models of asymptotic optimality. One such contender is the max vs. average (MVA) model 
(Ditterich, 2010;
McMillen & Holmes, 2006)
, which employs a decision variable defined as:
= - − - + ℎ - 2
(19)
However, this model did not align well with our pilot data. The MVA decision variable exhibited an excessive increase when the dud condition shifted from 0 to 27, failing to offer a seamless explanation for two-and three-choice data.


STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 20
Consequently, we have opted for an alternative asymptotically optimal model for comparison. This model utilizes a decision variable outlined in Equation 20, approximating the posterior probability of the first-place option being the target; refer to Equation 32 in 
McMillen and Holmes (2006)
 for details. In our current implementation, this model triggers a decision when the decision variable reaches a threshold set at 0.9. Henceforth, we will refer to this model as the posterior probability approximation (PPA) model.
= ( - ) � - � + � - � + � ℎ - �
(20)
Except for the decision rule, the PPA and MVN models share the identical structure, enabling a direct comparison of their goodness-of-fit indices. Essentially, these models represent very similar sequential probability ratio tests. While the PPA variable approximates the posterior probability of the first-place alternative being the target, the MVN variable refers to the ratio of the posterior probabilities of the first-and second-place alternatives 
(McMillen & Behseta, 2010;
McMillen & Holmes, 2006
).
There is one concern with the PPA model regarding the derivation of post-decisional confidence. Once the threshold is reached, the PPA variable has limited room for further development as it approaches the upper boundary of 1. To address this boundary issue, we employed the inverse cumulative Gaussian transformation (z-transformation) of the PPA value for deriving confidence variables (Equations 21-22). This transformation yields unbounded underlying variables, introducing desirable variability for modeling confidence. The remainder of the fitting procedure for the PPA model was identical to that for the MVN model.
- = ( 350 ) − ( 0 ) (21) STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 21 - = ( ℎ +350 ) − ( ℎ ) (22)


Model Fitting
We fit the MVN and PPA models to choice, RT, and confidence data aggregated across participants. 2 In the fitting process, we first calculated the 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 quantiles of grand RT data, collapsed by the dud value, choice outcome (target, distractor, or dud choice), confidence rating, and participant identity. For fitting simplicity, we concatenated confidence levels of 1-2 and 3-4 into low and high confidence categories. Then, we constructed an observation table counting a response frequency for each combination of the dud values (six conditions), choice outcomes (three alternatives), confidence categories (low or high), and above-calculated RT quantiles (six categories).
The models were fitted through iterative simulations, minimizing the χ 2 loss between observed and predicted response frequencies summarized in these 216 cells (e.g., 
Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008)
. For each dud value condition, we observed 6,624 trials, aggregated over 288 trials from 23 participants. To ensure stable model fitting, we simulated 66,240 trials for each dud value condition. Then, one-tenth of the simulated frequencies for the 216 response cells was used as predicted frequencies. To ensure consistency with behavioral data, simulation trials with RT > 3000 ms were excluded from the model prediction. The fitting process was implemented using the "optim()" function in R, with the iterative model simulations continuing until parameter estimation converged. The parameters σd, β, and γ had only nuanced impacts on the models' behavior. Thus, for
2 To enhance modeling precision, fitting individual participants' data is generally preferred. However, our focus on the dud-alternative effect in the three-choice paradigm posed a specific challenge: infrequent dud choices in many conditions (see 
Figure 2a)
. This scarcity resulted in numerous zero cells at the individual level, leading to unstable parameter estimates. Consequently, we opted to use data aggregated across participants. STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 22 modeling stability, we estimated these parameters through grid searches with relatively large step sizes. We now examine the effectiveness of our proposed MVN model in capturing participants'

behavior. The solid curves in 
Figure 2
 represent the predictions from the fitted MVN model and As shown in 
Figure 2c
, the MVN model explained RT data reasonably well (for full RT distributions, see 
Figure A2
). Notably, within the dud value range of 0-45, RTs remained relatively flat before exhibiting a sharp increase. This non-linear pattern is difficult to explain using decision rules like the PPA algorithm, which treats all options equally (see Equation 20). In contrast, the MVN algorithm, which considers only the top two accumulators, can readily account for this non-linearity (see Equation 13).


Hypothesis 8: The MVN model captures the nonlinear increasing trend of RTs against the dud value,
with target choice faster than distractor choice.
Furthermore, as predicted in Hypothesis 9, the MVN model offered a decent description of the confidence data, capturing the confidence boost triggered by the inclusion of the dud alternative 
(Figure 2d)
. The behavioral data exhibited a non-monotonic trend, with the initial confidence boost followed by a gradual decline after the dud value of 45. The MVN model qualitatively captured this non-monotonic trend, though not perfectly. Upon closer inspection, this up-and-down pattern was present in the early-stage confidence variable 
(Figure 5a)
. The post-decisional confidence variable did not demonstrate this non-monotonic trend but showed greater metacognitive accuracy ( 
Figure   5b)
. Thus, the combination of these two variables provided a reasonably accurate description of participants' confidence rating behavior.  Regarding Hypothesis 10, the MVN model faced some difficulty in fully explaining the relationships among all three variables 
(Figures 2e and 2f)
. Specifically, it struggled to capture RTs for low-confidence target choices and high-confidence distractor choices. Since these trials comprised a relatively small proportion of the total trials (27% for the former and 7.8% for the latter), the misfits for these conditions likely had limited impact on the overall model fit.


Hypothesis 10: The MVN model captures the relationship between RT and confidence.
Lastly, we compared the early plus post-decisional rule of confidence (Equation 17) to the conventional post-decisional only rule (e.g., 
Fleming & Daw, 2017;
Navajas et al., 2016;
Pleskac & STAGE
 
2 REGISTERED REPORT 25
Busemeyer, 2010). To do so, we repeated the same fitting protocol as above, replacing the confidence variable in Equation 17 with that of Equation 16. Since the post-decisional only model involves one fewer free parameter (γ), the model comparison was based on AIC. Using the estimated parameters of both models, we simulated 66,240 trials for each dud condition, generating predicted probabilities for the 216 response cells. We then calculated the quantile log-likelihood 
(Heathcote, Brown, & Mewhort, 2002)
 to obtain AIC values. As expected in Hypothesis 11, the early plus postdecisional confidence rule provided a better fit to participants' metacognitive behavior (AIC = 235996.6) compared to the post-decisional only rule (AIC = 236158.5).
Hypothesis 11: The early plus post-decisional confidence model gives a better fit than the postdecisional only confidence model.

 shows data from the two-choice experiment averaged across 23 participants. The solid curves illustrate MVN model predictions, based on the parameter estimates from the threechoice data ( 
Table 2)
. The MVN accurately predicted choice and confidence data 
(Figure 6a, c)
, which supports its generalizability across different choice formats. The model did, however, mispredict RT data by incorrectly suggesting a decrease in RT for distractor choices with increasing target intensity 
(Figure 6b
, see 
Figure S4
 for full RT distributions).


Two-Choice Experiment
Our primary focus in this experiment was on participants' confidence rating behavior. As outlined in Hypothesis 12, we originally expected to observe a double increase pattern of confidence, where confidence for both correct and incorrect choices increases with target intensity 
(Kiani et al., 2014;
Maniscalco et al., 2016;
Miyoshi et al., 2018;
Rausch et al., 2018
Rausch et al., , 2020
Stolyarova et al., 2019;
van den Berg et al., 2016;
Zawadzka et al., 2017)
. However, we instead observed a STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 26 "folded X" pattern, where increasing target intensity leads to increasing/decreasing confidence for correct/incorrect choices 
(Rausch & Zehetleitner, 2019)
.
Hypothesis 12: The MVN model successfully predict the double increase pattern of confidence in the two-choice experiment.
In our preliminary modeling for the pre-registration, the early-stage confidence variable of the MVN model exhibited a double increase pattern. However, in the present modeling, the earlystage confidence variable did not display this trend 
(Figure 6d)
, while the post-decisional confidence variable clearly demonstrated a folded X pattern 
(Figure 6e)
. 


Discussion
This study developed an evidence accumulation model incorporating the pseudo-optimal max vs. next algorithm 
(Ditterich, 2010;
Krajbich & Rangel, 2011;
McMillen & Behseta, 2010;
McMillen & Holmes, 2006)
 to simultaneously account for choice, RT, and confidence in threealternative dot numerosity discrimination. Our modeling aimed to provide grounded explanations for non-normative behaviors unique to multiple-choice problems, including the violation of the IIA axiom 
(Dagsvik, 2016;
Furl, 2016;
Gluth, Kern, Kortmann, et al., 2020;
Louie et al., 2013;
Luce, 1959)
 and the confidence boost driven by the dud alternative 
(Charman et al., 2011;
Comay et al., 2023;
Hanczakowski et al., 2014;
Windschitl & Chambers, 2004
).
In the current three-choice scenario, the IIA axiom states that the relative choice proportion between two options remains unaffected by the presence of the third alternative. This axiom is
represented by the ratio-of-strength principle in Luce's choice theory 
(Luce, 1959)
 
Furl, 2016;
Louie et al., 2013;
Webb et al., 2020)
.
In contrast, within cognitive psychology and neuroscience, decision-making is widely recognized as a temporally evolving process, which has led to the development of evidence accumulation models (e.g., 
Bogacz et al., 2006;
Gold & Shadlen, 2001;
Pereira et al., 2020;
Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010;
Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008)
. These dynamic models provide greater flexibility in describing the relationships between stimulus intensity and choice probability, without being constrained by the axiomatic ratio-of-strength principle. Our study showed that the proposed accumulation model, utilizing the pseudo-optimal MVN algorithm, naturally accounts for the IIA violation without necessitating additional mechanistic assumptions.
It is worth noting that prior studies have explored IIA violations in three-choice problems through approaches distinct from ours 
(Trueblood et al., 2013
(Trueblood et al., , 2014
. These studies delved into socalled context effects (i.e., attraction, similarity, and compromise effects) within multi-attribute decision-making scenarios (e.g., preference choice based on products' quality and price). Our study also focused on the dud-alternative confidence boost, where introducing an extra choice option irrationally elevates subjective decision confidence. While confidence in multi-choice problems has recently garnered attention, research on its computational foundations remains limited (e.g., 
Comay et al., 2023;
Ratcliff & Starns, 2013)
. To address this gap, we employed the evidence accumulation framework to provide a grounded explanation for the dud-alternative confidence boost. Specifically, the speed of initial decision formation immediately following stimulus presentation was shown to play a key role in shaping this confidence bias (see 
Figure A1
).
This early-stage confidence component is not merely an ad-hoc construct improvised to explain the dud-alternative boost. 
Shekhar and Rahnev (2018)
 demonstrated that consecutive TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) at 250, 350, and 450 ms after stimulus presentation affected confidence levels. 
Xue et al. (2023)
 also found that single TMS to the dlPFC at 200, 300, 400, or 500 ms after stimulus onset impacted confidence levels. 
Cai et al. (2022)
 further reported that single TMS to the monkey dlPFC 100 ms post-stimulus influenced the efficiency of confidence rating.
These empirical findings have been incorporated into the present modeling, providing a coherent explanation for the previously elusive dud-alternative confidence boost.
Our model combined the early confidence component from the post-stimulus period with the conventional post-decisional component 
(Fleming & Daw, 2017;
Hellmann et al., 2023;
Maniscalco et al., 2021;
Navajas et al., 2016;
Pereira et al., 2020;
Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010;
Yu et al., 2015)
, offering a decent description of human confidence rating behavior 
(Figure 2d)
. The early confidence component accounted for the non-normative dud-alternative boost, while the postdecisional component ensured appropriate metacognitive accuracy (e.g., 
Clarke et al., 1959;
Galvin et al., 2003;
Guggenmos, 2022;
Maniscalco & Lau, 2012;
Miyoshi et al., 2022)
 by retrospectively STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 30 evaluating the correctness of the decision made. Notably, our study manipulated dud values over a broader range than previous studies, throughout which our model offered a reasonable explanation of the observed non-monotonic trend of confidence.
While the post-decisional confidence component serves for deliberative metacognitive monitoring, the early-stage component can be characterized as a heuristic (and thus bias-prone) element, offering a quick assessment of the likelihood that one's decision will be correct. In controlled laboratory environments, this early heuristic component may contribute limited metacognitive accuracy. Specifically, aside from the dud manipulation, stimulus intensities were fixed at target = 100 and distractor = 90 in the present experiment, resulting in small variation in decision-making difficulty across trials. Consequently, much of the variability in the early confidence component was driven by subtle internal fluctuations in the evidence accumulation rate and starting point parameters (i.e., σd and β), and thus the early confidence variable did not strongly track trialby-trial choice correctness. However, in natural environments, stimulus intensity is likely to vary considerably, leading to greater fluctuations in decision-making difficulty 
(Miyoshi & Lau, 2020;
Webb et al., 2023)
. In these cases, the early confidence component should exhibit greater variability across different decision-making occasions and more accurately track subsequent choice correctness. Therefore, the ability to rapidly estimate choice correctness during the early poststimulus phase of decision-making, without prolonged post-decisional evidence gathering, would offer an adaptive advantage in real-world settings.
It is worth emphasizing that the MVN model seamlessly described the complex patterns of choice, RT, and confidence across a broad range of dud alternative values. This likely reflects the inherent selectivity of the MVN rule, which focuses exclusively on top two accumulators. In particular, the RT trend remained nearly flat across the dud values around 0-45, and the MVN rule effectively captured this pattern by ignoring the influence of the dud alternative. Algorithms that treat all options equally are sensitive to slight variations in the dud value, making it difficult to capture the observed non-linear RT trend ( 
Figure S2)
. These findings highlight the selective nature of human information processing, which prioritizes task-relevant information and minimizes cognitive load by filtering out irrelevant inputs. This adaptability may be a key to unraveling the intricacies of multi-alternative decision-making.
Despite these successes, the present findings also come with some limitations. First, our use of noisy multi-choice accumulators necessitated iterative simulations for model fitting, introducing randomness in parameter estimation. Our case differs from scenarios involving noiseless multichoice accumulators 
(Trueblood et al., 2014)
 or those involving noisy two-choice accumulators 
(Hellmann et al., 2023;
Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010;
Rausch & Zehetleitner, 2019)
, where analytical likelihood functions can be leveraged for precise model fitting. Furthermore, the infrequency of dud choices in our research design demanded extensive iterations in model fitting. These challenges led us to data aggregation, setting aside individual differences, to ensure stable parameter estimation.
The stability issue also restricted our focus to a reduced set of parameters essential for explaining the core behavioral patterns of interest. For instance, we opted not to include trial-to-trial variability in non-decision time, despite its recognized influence on the leading edge of RT distributions 
(Ratcliff & Tuerlinckx, 2002)
. As seen in 
Figure 2
, the MVN model's data description was not entirely flawless, and these factors may be reflected in the residual misfits.
Second, while our definition of the confidence time windows is informed by prior research 
(Boldt & Yeung, 2015;
Cai et al., 2022;
Shekhar & Rahnev, 2018;
van den Berg et al., 2016;
Xue et al., 2023;
Zylberberg et al., 2012)
, it does involve some arbitrariness. Thus, instead of specifying precise timelines, our modeling highlights two critical phases-early-stage and post-decisional periods-in the formation of confidence. This adds qualitative nuance to our modeling approach, which should be acknowledged when interpreting the present findings.
Lastly, aside from the methodological limitations, we did not observe the anticipated double increase in confidence in the two choice experiment; instead, we observed the folded X pattern, STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 32 where confidence in correct responses increased while confidence in incorrect responses decreased with increasing target intensity (e.g., 
Rausch & Zehetleitner, 2019)
. As seen in 
Figure 6
, this folded X confidence pattern reasonably tracks the pattern of choice accuracy, and our MVN model accurately predicted its occurrence. However, humans often exhibit the seemingly unreasonable double increase in confidence (e.g., 
Kiani et al., 2014;
Rausch et al., 2018
Rausch et al., , 2020
Stolyarova et al., 2019;
van den Berg et al., 2016)
 and identifying the conditions that give rise to these two distinct confidence patterns may provide insights into the computations specific to the human metacognitive system. As noted earlier, the early confidence component of our MVN model exhibited a dual increase in the pilot study, though this did not occur in the present main experiment. Exploring the experimental conditions and parameter values that lead to the emergence of the double increase in the initial confidence variable could be an interesting avenue for future research.


Conclusion
This study presented a multi-choice evidence accumulation model that simultaneously explained non-normative patterns of choice, RT, and confidence. Our model applies across a range of decision-making tasks, offering testable behavioral predictions based on relevant stimulus attributes (e.g., physical stimulus intensity in psychophysics, or rated stimulus value in economic preference studies). Consequently, the present work marks a solid step toward understanding the fundamental principles governing decision-making.


Transparency and Openness
The experiments and analyses were conducted in an unblinded manner, with experimenters having full awareness of the research objectives and hypotheses. The data and code are available from, https://github.com/kiyomiyoshi/dud_alternative.    This effect is particularly strong for the second-place evidence, resulting in the smaller MVN variable.
This means that without information from stimuli, the mere presence of three alternatives places the observer under greater uncertainty. (e-h) By t = 350, the dud alternative is quickly rejected, and the MVN variable is no longer influenced by the dud presence, i.e., the observer promptly narrows down the three-alternative problem to two options. In other words, with the rapid rejection of the dud alternative, decision formation progresses to a greater extent from the point where it was lagged behind. (i) The early-stage confidence variable in Equation 15 explains the dud-alternative confidence boost as a product of this abrupt reduction of decision uncertainty (represented by the rightward shift of the blue distribution). We assumed uniform variability for the evidence at t = 0
(see Equations 10-12), but the qualitative effect of the dud-alternative is robust against the distributional assumption.

Example of evidence accumulation in the MVN model. The evidence in favor of three options (target, distractor, and dud) evolves independently over time step t. The evidence accumulation rate for each alternative is contingent on the corresponding dot numerosity. A decision is made when the difference of the first-and second-place evidence reaches a threshold set at 1 (t = 1483 in this case). Two critical time periods, highlighted by the grey areas, are postulated for deriving decision confidence. The development of the MVN variable within these areas collectively contributes to confidence construction.


The MVN model captures the rise in confidence observed when the dud alternative is introduced.

Thus, although the MVN model has the potential to account for the double increase pattern of confidence with a different set of parameter values, this trend did not manifest in the current experimental data and the MVN model accurately predicted its absence, as shown in Figure 6c. Behavioral data from the two-choice experiment averaged across participants. (a) Proportion of target and distractor choices. (b) Mean RTs for target and distractor choices.

(d) Confidence variable calculated during the first 350 ms following stimulus presentation. (e) Confidence variable derived within the initial 350 ms following decision-making.


They explained these effects by assuming attention allocation among different attributes during evidence accumulation. In contrast, our study accounted for the IIA violation in single-attribute dot STAGE 2 REGISTERED REPORT 29 numerosity discrimination as a natural consequence of the MVN decision dynamics, without invoking further assumptions. In essence, our study and the preceding literature have each approached distinct research questions through different modeling perspectives.

These illustrate across-trial evidence distributions at t = 0 and t = 350, with and without the dud alternative (dud conditions of 0 vs. 27). (a-d) At t = 0, before stimulus information is available, the presence of the dud leads to enhanced evidence for the first-and second-place options due to the selection effect.
