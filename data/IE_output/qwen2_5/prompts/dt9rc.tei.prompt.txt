You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Traditionally, perceptual decision making and motor control have been studied as different domains.
This tradition has benefited researchers by simplifying assumptions that regard action as a mere output channel for reporting the higher-order decisions. However, recent developments at the theoretical and empirical level have started to demonstrate that parameters of action, which are not directly related to the sensory input per se, can influence the perceptual decision itself 
[1]
. For example, two studies 
[2]
, 
[3]
 showed that when the response for one of the two options in a perceptual decision is made physically more effortful, participants tend to avoid the decision requiring more effort. Similarly, Turner et al 
[4]
, showed that participants became more confident when a perceptual decision required more physical effort to express. This evidence demonstrates the interdependence of action and perceptual decisions.
In those studies, examining the influence of physical effort on the particular decision the participant has (presumably already) made meant that physical effort was required after the decision. However, the post-decision period is not the only period in which the decision and the action can interact 
[5]
. In real life, as well as under laboratory conditions, there are situations where a decision is required while performing an effortful action. Imagine a monkey hanging from a branch with one hand and using the other hand to pick a fruit deliberating which fruit to pick. Here, the effort (i.e. keeping herself from the branch) is required during the deliberation period of the decision-making, during which perceptual evidence is being accumulated to reach the decision. The effect of physical effort exerted during the pre-decision period on decision making is not well understood. In this study, we examined whether the physical effort required during the deliberation period of the decision making influenced the subsequent decision and the confidence for the decision.
Several different lines of research on the role effort can be employed to formulate contrasting hypotheses for the expected results. In a recent review, Inzlicht, Shenhav and Olivola 
[6]
 have done a wonderful job of describing what they called the effort paradox. On the one hand, prominent models in economics and cognitive sciences hold that effort is aversive. That animals (including humans) prefer to do as little as possible for a given reward. On the other hand, numerous studies spanning all the way from pigeons and rodents to humans, have shown that all of these various animals value effort, in and of itself. People go mountain climbing, run 7 marathons in 1 week, and spend hundreds of hours learning a musical instrument as a hobby. While few would contribute to the cost of a ticket for you to join a charity cocktail party, it is much easier to raise money for joining a charity triathlon. To the standard models of economics that seek to minimise effort this does not make sense: people who love you should be happier if you enjoyed yourself in the cocktail party. It is therefore not surprising that several contradictory hypotheses can be formulated when considering the impact of effort on decision making.
The common currency 
[7]
- 
[12]
 hypothesis proposes to maintain balance between expected accuracy and cost of evidence accumulation. This cost consists of time and effort. In this view, optimal decisions are the ones that achieve a reasonable level of accuracy at an acceptable cost.
Increasing the cost, then, should reduce the bar for what is the acceptable level of accuracy. This would predict that under higher effort, participants would adjust evidence accumulation to collect less evidence, leading to lower accuracy, faster reaction times and lower confidence under high effort.
The second hypothesis is derived from the ideas of 17th century Dutch philosopher Baruch (Benedictus) Spinoza. In his book of Ethics 
[13]
 Spinoza proposed that individuals are motivated to be the adequate cause of their states. A consequence of this kind of motivation is that the power of actions and the satisfaction driven from the choices that those actions execute are inextricably intertwined. Spinoza's idea of the association between power and joy is reflected brilliantly in the social psychological research on the role of self-determination and control in self efficacy 
[14]
- 
[16]
.
Recent findings in neuroeconomics have shown that having a choice, in and of itself, is rewarding 
[17]
, 
[18]
 . This account is perhaps most directly supported by the evidence from a recent study by Turner et al 
[4]
 who showed that participants expressed higher confidence when deciding required more physical effort. In this view, exerting effort would have a metacognitive, evaluative impact on the decision process that does not affect the accuracy and reaction time but the evaluation of the decision. This hypothesis proposes that evidence accumulated under high effort would be evaluated as more valuable or of better quality because it has cost the participants more and the participants has obtained the evidence through effort and control. Thus, higher effort would impact neither accuracy nor reaction time per se but increase decision confidence.
Finally, an interference hypothesis is also plausible and would predict that higher effort would specifically interfere with the relationship between confidence and accuracy. Fleming and colleagues 
[19]
 examined the impact of transcranial magnetic stimulation in interfering with the motor execution of perceptual decisions. They found that, within a narrow and carefully designed range of parameters, one can find a TMS stimulation protocol that leaves perceptual decision accuracy, reaction times and average confidence intact but, critically, disturb metacognitive sensitivity, which is the delicate balance between reported confidence and probability of correct responses. The interference hypothesis driven from these findings, would predict lower metacognitive sensitivity under high (vs low) effort. Apart from using effort (rather than TMS), an important difference between our experimental design and those of Fleming and colleagues is that our manipulation takes place during the perceptual evidence accumulation stage whereas in their work, TMS was applied after the perceptual information had been delivered to the participants .
To test these hypotheses, our participants judged the direction (leftward or rightward) of a dynamic random dot motion stimulus 
[20]
, 
[21]
 whose difficulty (i.e. coherence) level varied randomly across trials. The decision and the subjective confidence of the decision was reported by a key-press using their left-hand. While viewing the dots motion, participants held a handle with their right-hand. The handle produced force to move-away from its initial position, and the participants had to maintain its position by resisting the force 
(Figure 1
). We designed this setup to examine how an ongoing isometric physical effort may interact with the deliberation process of decision making, independent of the decision itself and possible outcomes.
Since we did not have any hypothesis regarding the direction of the effect, a pilot experiment was performed using a small sample of participants. Based on the exploratory analysis performed on the pilot data, the present study is pre-registered to test the following specific predictions (https://osf.io/tykcg). First, we predict that the metacognitive accuracy (Song et al., 2011), the measure of how accurately the confidence is related to the decision accuracy, will decrease when the required effort increases. Second, we predict that the physical effort during the deliberation period will not modulate the reaction time nor the decision accuracy of the task.


Method Participants
A total of 20 volunteers (12 females, mean age = 23.7) participated in the study. Sample size was determined using the result of the pilot experiment (see below). All were right-handed with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, with no prior history of psychiatric problems or medication. 


Estimation of the sample size
Data of 13 participants from a pilot experiment was analysed for the sample size estimation (see below for the detail of the pilot experiment). In this experiment, the metacognitive accuracy for the random-dot motion decision became lower when maintaining the handle position against the force compared to when there was no force applied to the handle (effect size = 0.76). Based on this result, we estimated the required sample size using the power analysis (G-power), targeting for alpha = 0.5 and power = 0.8. Taking into account the estimation noise, we pre-set the sample size to 20.


General setup
Participants were seated comfortably in front of a screen placed horizontally in front of them, which prevented the direct vision of their hands 
(Figure 1
). The visual stimulus was presented on the screen using a projector placed above the screen. The viewing distance was 50cm. To maintain the viewing distance, the upper trunk was constrained by a harness attached to the chair.
During the experiment, participants were asked to hold the handle of the manipulandum with their right-hand (PHANToM Premium 1.5 HF, SensAble Technologies, Woburn MA, USA).
The handle position was displayed as a white cursor (a circle, 6 mm in diameter) on a black background on a horizontal screen located above their hand. The movement of the handle was constrained to a virtual horizontal plane (10 cm below the screen) that was implemented by a simulated spring (1.0 kN/m) and dumper (0.1 N/ms-1).
In the centre of the screen, random-dot motion stimulus was presented 
(Britten et al., 1992)
 ( 
Figure 1A)
. In a 7 deg diameter circular aperture, dots were presented at a density of 3.5 dot/deg2. The speed of the dots was 10 deg/s. For each trial, either 3.2%, 6.4%, 12.8%, 25.6%, or 51.2% of the dots moved coherently to the left or the right. All other dots moved in a random direction, picked for each dot separately between 0 and 360 deg.
Both the visual stimulus and the robotic manipulandum were controlled by an in-house software program developed using C++.


Study design and the procedure
The study was conducted as 5 (sensory evidence level) x 2 (physical effort level) within-subject factorial design. For the factor of sensory evidence, random-dot motion with 5 different levels of motion coherence (3.2% 6.4% 12.8% 25.6% 51.2%) was prepared. The direction of motion was either leftward or rightward. For the factor of physical effort level, either the handle was pushed away from the body with the force of 6N (force condition) or the force to the handle was absent (no-force condition).
To start each trial, the participant held a handle of a robotic manipulandum with their right hand in the starting position. The trials started 500 msec after setting the handle position. In the force condition trials, a force was applied to the robotic handle towards the direction moving away from the participant. Participants were asked to maintain the handle in the starting position, meaning that the participant had to apply an equal force (6N) in the opposite direction. In the no- The results of this pilot experiment are available in the 
Supplementary Material (figure S1
).


Data Analysis
Generalised linear mixture model (GLMM) was applied to analyse the reaction time, decision accuracy and the confidence data. For all of the GLMM models applied here, each participant was considered as a random intercept. Metacognitive accuracy was calculated as in the previous literature (Song et al., 2011), and was compared between different force conditions using t-test.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as policy for dealing with missing data were pre-registered at OSF https://osf.io/tykcg. In detail, any trial with the decision taking more than 2 seconds, and any trial with the handle movement exceeding over 5cm was excluded from the analysis. Any participant's data with the proportion of the excluded trials exceeding 15% of the whole trial was discarded from the analysis.


Prediction
In this study, we test our pre-registered hypothesis. First, we predict that the Metacognitive accuracy will be affected by the physical effort delivered during the deliberation period of the decision-making. Metacognitive accuracy will be reduced by physical effort, compared to when no physical effort is required. Second, we predict that the preceding effort will not influence the objective decision accuracy, or the time it takes for the decision (reaction time). 


Results


Data exclusion
On average, 3.4% of the trials in the non-force condition and 2.8% of the trials in the force condition were excluded from the analysis. None of the participants exceeded the pre-defined exclusion criterion, therefore, were not excluded from the analysis.


Kinematic data
Although participants were asked to maintain the position of the handle during the task, nevertheless, the handle slightly deviated. During the force trials, on average, it deviated 17.5mm Second, decision accuracy and the confidence ratings did not differ between the two force conditions (p> 0.1), which followed our pre-registered prediction. However, the reaction time became slightly faster for the force condition compared to the non-force condition (average RT;
1025ms for the force condition, 1047 for the non-force condition, p<0.001, See table S1 for more details).


Metacognitive accuracy
The metacognitive accuracy 
[19]
 , i.e. how the confidence is correctly associated with the accuracy of decision, was calculated and compared between different force levels. We found no significant difference in metacognitive accuracy between different conditions (t(19) = 0.25, p=0.8). Thus, this result did not support our pre-registered prediction.  


Discussion
In this study, we tested if exerting physical effort during the deliberation period of the perceptual decision making influences the subsequent decision process. We proposed three different hypotheses that made contrasting predictions about this question. Based on a pilot experiment, in the pre-registration we predicted that the physical effort will reduce metacognitive accuracy, without affecting any decision accuracy, reaction time or confidence. However, the hypothesis was not supported by the data. In our experimental setup, we found no evidence that the physical effort during the deliberation period can influence the subsequent decision and confidence. We report this negative result together with the pre-registered methods to help avoid file-drawer problems.
One reason for the discrepancy between the pilot and the main study results may be the few differences in the design elements that we changed in the main study (see 
Supplementary   material
). In the pilot experiment, we examined three force levels (0N, 2.5N, and 5N), whereas in the main experiment, there were two force levels 
(0N and 6N)
. Accordingly, the number of trials per condition also differed between two experiments. These choices were made to increase the power and sensitivity of the experimental paradigm and there is no principled reason to believe that the choices in the main study were problematic. In any case, if such trivial differences were indeed the cause of the failure to replicate the pilot experiment, it would indicate that the effect of physical effort on the decision deliberation is not robust, at least in the given setup of the experiment.
As with the nature of any negative result, our findings do not necessarily discredit the hypothesis. Physical effort during the deliberation period may or may not influence the perceptual decision in general. We consider several issues worth considering in the future studies. First, the pragmatic choices made for experimental design may be responsible for the negative results. The amount of force could have been too low to induce a sufficient amount of effort to influence the participants' decision. In the current setup, we had to make sure that the amount of force is well within the range which the participants can keep holding the handle, since the slip of the handle from the participants' hand will cause the handle to crash into the surrounding devices. This restriction of force level may have made the result unstable. Stronger force level may be necessary to overcome this problem, if using passive resistance to the force as a way to manipulate the effort.
Another pragmatic issue was the way the force was produced in the experiment may have made a difference. We chose passive resistance to the force to manipulate the physical effort, because this allowed us to precisely control the required force level. However, an alternative way would have been to make the participants perform an approach movement, actively producing the force to a set level. One may argue that active effort may impact information seeking more directly. Moreover, there could have been an effector dependency of effort on decision making. Previous studies have manipulated the effort on effector directly involved in the decision, such as by adding physical perturbation to that effector 
[2]
, 
[3]
 or by electrically/chemically perturbing the neural substrate controlling that effector (eye-movement) 
[5]
, 
[22]
. However, in our study, the effector that resisted the force (right-hand) and the effector expressing the decision by the button press (left-hand) differed. Even though the force was terminated after the decision, the relationship between the decision and the force was indirect. Such effector dependency may have played a role in our experiment.
Having discussed the potential reasons for interpreting our results as false negatives, it is also important to discuss the plausible interpretation of them as true negatives too. The three main hypotheses that we raised in the introduction have been summarised in table 1 together with their predictions for the 4 outcome measures of accuracy, reaction time, confidence and metacognitive precision. Our pilot data most closely favours hypothesis 3 
[19]
,which predicts that the effort influences the metacognitive precision but without affecting the perceptual decision itself. Indeed, in our main experiment, physical force did not change the parameters of perceptual decisions per se. Nonetheless, we also found a significant decrease in RTs under high effort without any change in the metacognitive accuracy, which was also not predicted by hypothesis 3. Thus, there certainly could be a possibility that our data is pointing to a different mechanism not captured in the hypotheses, or a mixture of different hypotheses. Another important possible reason why our effort manipulation did not succeed in affecting decisions may be found in recent demonstrations of the role of effort-contingent reward in promoting effort seeking behaviour 
[23]
. In a series of innovative experiments addressing the effort paradox (see Introduction), Clay and colleagues gave their participants a challenging training task (i.e., a working memory test) requiring substantial cognitive effort. In the treatment condition, participants were rewarded proportionally to how much effort they put into the training task. In the control condition, participants received a fixed reward. After this initial training, both groups completed a second, transfer task (math puzzles) for a fixed reward. The results showed that the participants in the treatment (but not in the control) group were later more eager to exert mental effort voluntarily as indicated by choosing more higher difficult level problems to solve. Effortcontingent rewards during training led to demand seeking in the transfer task. These findings raise interesting questions. For example, on a general level, are the findings specific to cognitive, mental effort or do they generalise to physical effort too? With respect to our experiment, our participants received a fixed reward compensation that was independent of their performance. Therefore, our experiment may be considered similar to Clay and colleagues ' control condition. Future experiments that examine the role of effort in decision making would do well to consider and perhaps include the role of reward in their experimental design.
Experiments were undertaken with the understanding and written consent of each participant in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki), and with approval of the National Institute of Communications Technology (NICT) ethical committee (B210042202). Participants were recruited through local advertisements used in the Centre of Neural Networks (CiNet), and were paid 3000 JPY (approximately 10 Euros per hour) for participation. No adverse events occurred during the experiment.


force condition trials, the force was absent and the participant could effortlessly hold the handle in the starting position. In both trial types, once the participant had maintained the handle position for 2000 msec after the start of the trial, then a random-dot motion stimulus was displayed on thescreen. Motion coherence varied from trial to trial. Participants were asked to decide about the net direction of the dot-motion and indicate their decision, as fast and accurately as possible by pressing one of the two keys on the keyboard with their left hand. Visual stimulus and the force were removed immediately after the decision (key-press), or if the decision was not made within 2000ms. Then, participants reported the confidence level of the decision on a scale of 0-6. Reaction time, decision accuracy and confidence were our key dependent variables. Kinematic data of the handle position during the task were also measured and recorded. Each participant went through 24 trials of each combination of the condition (i.e., 2 motion directions x 5 coherence x 2 effort levels ). One block consisted of 60 trials and there were 8 blocks. The order of the trials was pseudorandomized within each block of each participant. Pilot Experiment An earlier version of the experiment was treated as a pilot experiment, in order to estimate the sample size (see above). In this pilot experiment, 15 participants (5 females, mean age = 22.4)volunteered, but 2 were excluded from the analysis, due to the high proportion of non-responding trials. Three different force levels(0N, 2.5N, and 5N)were set, with 200 trials for each force level.


Figure 1 .
1
Schematic drawing of the experimental setup. Participants held a robotic handle underneath the screen. In each trial, a random-dot motion stimulus was presented in the centre of the screen. Throughout the trial, they were required to maintain the handle position, indicated as a cursor position on the screen, in the starting position. In the force-condition trials, a force was applied to the handle towards the direction away from the participant (i.e. the arrow in the drawing).


(s.d. 10.6mm) towards the direction of the force, and 8.9mm (s.d. 6.5mm) towards the right. For non-force trials, such deviation was negligible (-2.0 mm and 1.3 mm, respectively). This shows that there was no particular movement bias for performing the task (i.e. non-force condition), and participants have applied physical effort as instructed to maintain the handle position in the force condition. Decision accuracy, decision confidence and the reaction time Decision accuracy (Figure 2a), confidence data (Figure 2b) and reaction times (Figure 2c) were compared between two different force conditions under different uncertainty levels. First, all three variables were modulated by the difficulty of decision (i.e. motion coherence levels) (p<0.001, GLMM, see table S1 for more details). As expected, this shows that the participant's response is manipulated by the different coherence level (i.e. difficulty level) of the visual stimulus.
