You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Metacognition -"thinking about thinking" -refers to the higher-order cognitive capability that enables us to internally evaluate our own cognitive processes associated with various tasks 
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
[5]
 . Metacognitive abilities allow people to form confidence in the quality of their choices, even in the absence of immediate feedback 
[6]
[7]
[8]
 . Decision confidence, elicited around the time of an individual choice, can be conceptualized as the subjective probability of success given the available evidence (i.e., Bayesian posterior probability of the chosen option being correct) 
[9]
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
 . Previous studies in psychology and neuroscience have focused on the formation of confidence in perceptual 
6,
[14]
[15]
[16]
[17]
 and knowledge-based decisions 
13
 .
Participants in these experiments were asked to indicate their confidence of the correctness of their judgment after each choice. Results showed that self-reported confidence was well captured by the posterior probability of the choice being correct 
[18]
[19]
[20]
 . Abnormalities in decision confidence are known to be related to psychiatric disorders 
21,
22
 .
More recent studies in metacognition have examined whether and how human participants aggregate decision confidence in individual choices to form a "global" selfperformance estimate (SPE). SPE is an overall belief about one's skills and capacities to solve a given task. University students, for example, might integrate their performance in different assignments and exams to form an estimate of their overall academic abilities. It plays a key role in shaping our behaviours 
23
 , selecting goals to achieve 
24
 , and allocating time and resources 
25
 . For instance, finding it hard to achieve some objective after multiple attempts, many people will be inclined to stop investing more time or effort in it and turn to pursue another, more achievable goal.
Rouault and colleagues assessed how SPEs in perceptual decisions are constructed across multiple decisions 
18,
19
 . They found that the feedback about the correctness of decisions affected SPEs significantly in a simple, perceptual decision-making task.
Participants underestimated their performance (i.e., had lower SPEs) in the absence of feedback compared to the case with feedback, even though their objective performance in those decisions was not affected by the presence of feedback; that is, absence of feedback is associated with lower SPEs 
18
 . Computational modelling further suggests that participants formed the global SPEs by integrating decision confidence of each choice over multiple trials in a Bayesian manner 
18
 .
Unlike simple perceptual decisions, many decisions we make are computationally hard. Suppose you have to choose the set of items in a supermarket that maximise your satisfaction while sticking to your budget constraint. In a supermarket stocking just 100 items, assuming that you would only pick an item at most once, there are 2 100 combinations of items to choose from, a computationally intractable task. Another example is constructing investment portfolios by picking stocks listed on the market given a budget or risk constraint 
26,
27
 . There are currently more than 41,000 stocks listed on stock exchanges around the world 
28
 , which makes building portfolios another intractable task. While this kind of decision is ubiquitous in life, which is reflected in modern choice theories (e.g., utility maximization 29 and satisficing 30 ), it requires individuals to solve intractable, that is, computationally complex, problems 
31
 .
The mathematical framework of computational complexity allows the quantification of computational hardness -or computational resource requirements -of tasks such as decisions 
32
 . Behavioral studies to date have shown that the level of computational complexity is negatively related to human performance in decisions -the higher the level of computational complexity, that is, the more computational resources are required to compute the optimal course of action, the lower the performance in those decisions, that is, the less likely people are to choose the optimal course of action 
33
 . Importantly, the computational complexity of tasks, including decisions, can be quantified without reference to any particular algorithm -it is an objective attribute of a task. Furthermore, computational complexity can be quantified in a domain-general way. That is, the measures of computational complexity are not task-specific. It has been shown that such objective, task-independent measures of computational complexity predict both the extent of cognitive effort exerted on a decision as well as performance 
34
 . However, at this point, little is known about 'metacognition' in complex decisions. That is, whether and how humans internally evaluate their own performance in computationally complex decisions remains elusive.
In the present study, we investigated the formation of SPEs in computationally complex economic decisions with reference to that in simple perceptual decisions. In line with previous studies on perceptual decision-making 
18,
19
 , we examined the effects of decision difficulty and the presence/absence of feedback on SPEs. To this end, we conducted a behavioral experiment in which participants solved both a simple, perceptual decision-making task (sample task; 
Fig. 1a
) 
18,
35
 as well as complex, economic decisionmaking task (knapsack task; 
Fig. 1b)
 
34,
36
 . The latter is based on the 0-1 knapsack problem, a canonical (NP-complete) constrained optimization computational problem 
34,
37
 , in which task difficulty is manipulated by a theoretical measure of computational hardness (i.e., "instance complexity" 
34,
36
 ). The knapsack task is closely related conceptually to many daily decisions (e.g., attention allocation, budgeting, task management). The experiment consisted of four different types of blocks ( 
Fig. 1e
): two difficulty levels (easy vs. hard) and two feedback conditions (presence vs. absence of feedback). In each block, participants performed 10 trials of a task 
(Fig. 1f)
. Crucially, at the end of each block, participants submitted a bid in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction 
38
 to purchase the right to complete additional 5 trials 
(Fig. 1c, f)
. Note that, in the additional 5 trials, no feedback was provided, and the difficulty level was the same as in the first 10 trials within the block. The auction procedure allowed us to measure a participant's SPEs in an incentive-compatible manner (see Methods for details). If a participant thought that they could perform well in the additional trials, they should have bid high to secure the chance of attempting the additional trials.
Participants were also asked to report their performance estimation on a Likert scale at the end of each block 
(Fig. 1d, f
). (e) Block types. For each task, we employed a block-wise two-by-two design with two difficulty levels (easy vs. hard) and two feedback conditions (feedback vs. no-feedback).
(f) Schedule of a block. Schematic examples of an easy block with feedback (top) and a hard block without feedback (bottom) are shown. In each block, participants performed 10 trials of a decision-making task (sampling or knapsack task) and then bid in the BDM auction to purchase the right to complete additional 5 bonus trials. Note that, in the additional trials, no feedback was provided, and the difficulty level was the same as the first 10 trials within the block.


RESULTS


Pilot experiment
We first conducted a pilot experiment (N = 17) to determine the sample size of the main experiment. In the sampling task, difficulty affected both objective performance (i.e., the proportion of correct choices) and SPEs (i.e., bid value in the BDM auction) ( 
Fig. 2a, b
). As expected, they were lower in hard trials than in easy trials. Moreover, SPEs were lower in the no-feedback condition compared to the feedback condition, although objective performance remained unchanged. We observed a similar pattern of SPEs when considering self-reported performance ratings instead of BDM auction bids ( 
Fig. 2c
). Overall, participant behavior in the sampling task was consistent with a previous study based on a similar task 18 .
In the knapsack task, objective performance was lower in hard trials compared to easy trials but performance was not affected by the presence/absence of feedback ( 
Fig. 2d
).
SPEs were lower in hard trials compared to easy trials ( 
Fig. 2e
). They were also lower in the absence of feedback (compared to the presence of feedback) but only in easy trials ( 
Fig.   2e
), which is different to the pattern observed in the sampling task 
(Fig. 2b)
. The same pattern is present in self-reported performance ratings ( 
Fig. 2f
).
We estimated generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMMs) of objective performance and SPEs for each task, which we used to compute the sample size of the main experiment 
(Tables S1-4)
. We then determined the sample size in the main experiment to ensure a statistical power of at least 0.8 for the effects of interest (N = 36) (see Methods for details). (e) Self-performance estimate in the knapsack task. The format is the same as in panel (b).

Main experiment: objective performance
We first examined how objective performance in decisions was affected by difficulty and feedback about correctness of a decision. In both the sampling and the knapsack task, objective performance was lower in hard trials compared to easy trials ( 
Fig. 3
; effect of difficulty in the sampling task: b = -0.582 ± 0.048, Pcorr < 0.001; knapsack task: b = -0.861 ± 0.055, Pcorr < 0.001; see Tables S5 and S6 for details). There was no significant difference in performance in the absence of feedback compared to presence of feedback ( 
Fig
 
Table S5
). ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01 (all p-values are Bonferroni corrected).
(c) Objective performance in the knapsack task. The format is the same as in panel (a).
(d) Effects of the difficulty, feedback, and their interaction on objective performance in the knapsack task (see 
Table S6
). The format is the same as in panel (b).


Main experiment: self-performance estimates
In the sampling task, SPEs (bid values in the BDM auction at the end of each block) were significantly lower in hard trials compared to easy trials (effect of difficulty: b = -0.044 ± 0.008, Pcorr < 0.001; 
Fig. 4a, b
; 
Table S7
) and in the absence of feedback compared to the presence of feedback (effect of feedback: b = 0.060 ± 0.008, Pcorr < 0.001 ; 
Fig. 4a, b
; 
Table   S7
). There was no significant interaction between difficulty and feedback conditions (interaction effect: b = -0.018 ± 0.008, Pcorr = 0.085; 
Fig. 4a, b
; 
Table S7
). These findings replicate the results of previous studies 
18,35 .
 In the knapsack task, SPEs were lower in hard compared to easy trials (effect of difficulty: b = -0.077 ± 0.009, Pcorr < 0.001; 
Fig. 4c, d
; 
Table S8
). SPEs were also lower in the absence of feedback compared to the presence of feedback but only in easy trials 
(Fig.   4c
), indicated by the significant interaction between difficulty and feedback (b = -0.030 ± 0.009, Pcorr = 0.005; 
Fig. 4d
; 
Table S8
).
As a robustness check, we confirmed that our findings in relation to SPEs are robust with regards to the measurement of self-performance. We found that they are qualitatively similar when considering self-reported performance ratings instead of BDM auction bids 
(Fig. S1
).
Furthermore, we examined potential effects of learning or experience. To this end, we included a factor variable representing the order of the blocks (i.e., 1 for the 1 st block, 2 for the 2 nd block and so on) into our GLMMs. The additional analysis revealed that the main results above were not affected by block order 
(Tables S9-12
). These results suggest that our findings are robust with regards to the choice of measurement of SPEs and block order.

Discussion
This study investigated metacognition in computationally complex decision-making.
Specifically, we examined the effects of task difficulty and the presence of feedback about the correctness of a decision, on the formation of global SPEs when people are making cognitively simple, perceptual and complex, economic decisions (i.e., the sampling and the knapsack tasks, respectively).
We replicate previous findings about the effects of task difficulty and the presence of feedback in perceptual decision-making 
18,
35
 . In the sampling task, objective performance was lower in harder trials but was not modulated by the presence of feedback 
(Fig. 3a, b
).
Furthermore, SPEs were found to be modulated by both task difficulty and the presence of feedback 
(Fig. 4a, b
): they were lower in harder trials and in the absence of feedback (compared to trials with feedback: i.e., a reduction of SPEs in the absence of feedback).


Most studies of metacognition in perceptual decision-making to date have examined local
confidence in individual decisions 
17,
22,
39
 . Only a small number of studies has investigated global SPEs 
18,
19,
35,
40
 . Our findings thus contribute to the growing literature on the formation of SPEs in perceptual decision-making 
18,19,35 .
 In the knapsack task, a complex economic decision-making task, we found that objective performance was modulated by task difficulty, defined based on a theoretical measure of computational hardness (instance complexity) ( 
Fig. 3c, d
). This finding is consistent with findings about the effects of instance complexity on performance demonstrated by previous studies 
34,
36
 . The present study thus contributes to the growing literature highlighting the importance of formal measures of computational complexity as a predictor of human performance in complex decisions 
34,
36
 .
Similar effects of the theoretical measure of computational hardness were found on SPEs in the knapsack task. Specifically, we demonstrated that SPEs were lower in harder trials, that is, trials with lower instance complexity (instance complexity is inversely correlated with computational hardness 
34,
36
 ) ( 
Fig. 4c, d
). This result indicates that participants were able to sense task difficulty while evaluating the quality of their complex decisions, even though the difficulty level was not explicitly indicated to them in the experiment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that people are capable of internally evaluating their own performance in computationally complex decisions, similar to perceptual decisions 
18,
19
 , knowledge-based judgment 
13
 , motor control 
41,
42
 , and memory retrieval 
43
 .
Moreover, we show that in complex decisions, feedback modulates SPEs differently in easy and hard trials ( 
Fig. 4c, d)
. In easy trials, participants displayed lower SPEs in the absence of feedback compared to the presence of feedback. This pattern of SPEs in easy trials is consistent with the genuine reduction of SPEs in the absence of feedback observed in the sampling task 
18
 , despite the substantial differences between cognitive burden required for solving the sampling (i.e., counting dots and computing the difference) and knapsack (i.e., combinatorial optimisation) tasks. Strikingly, one previous study of perceptual decisionmaking 
18
 suggests such a pattern of SPE may result from a metacognitive process in which people integrate information about feedback (that is, in the presence of feedback) and decision confidence (in the absence of feedback) over multiple trials in a Bayesian manner.
In hard trials, on the other hand, we didn't observe any modulation of SPEs by feedback ( 
Fig. 4c)
. Both in the presence and absence of feedback, participants displayed low SPEs around the chance level (i.e., 0.5) even though objective performance was above chance level 
(Fig. 3c
). This pattern cannot be explained by the same kind of Bayesian integration 18 that can account for pattern of SPEs observed in easy trials 
(Fig. 4c
) and in the sampling task 
(Fig. 4a)
 Our study has several limitations. First, we only collected a limited number of SPEs (i.e., two data points per condition and task), due to the relatively long duration of a trial in the knapsack task (approximately 30 seconds). This makes it difficult to implement advanced data analyses (e.g., computational model fitting) to further elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying the formation of SPEs. Second, the current study used the knapsack decision problem as a representative of computationally intractable problems.
However, it remains an open question whether the results we found here are generalizable to other computationally intractable problems. To explore this question, future studies should test the generalizability of the patters of SPEs found in the knapsack decision task to other NP-complete problems such as Boolean satisfiability problem (K-SAT) 
[44]
[45]
[46]
 and the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) 
47
 . Lastly, the attribution of differences between SPEs of two types of decision-making in the current study needs further investigation. The difference between the two types of tasks may not simply be limited to computational difficulty, but also to perceptual uncertainty, as the stimuli in the perceptual task were only flashed on the screen briefly, while in the knapsack task, they were much longer.
In conclusion, this study provides insights into metacognition in complex decisionmaking by examining the effects of task difficulty and feedback on global SPEs in a computationally hard task. In contrast to perceptual decisions, our findings suggest that people estimate their global performance in complex decisions through distinct metacognitive mechanisms for easy and hard instances. We believe that the current study is the first step towards a comprehensive understanding of how humans learn about their own performance when making complex decisions.

Participants
We 


Experimental task
Overview. Participants performed two decision-making tasks in the experiment (in-person for the pilot experiment and online for the main experiment): the sampling task ( 
Fig. 1a
) and the knapsack task 
(Fig. 1b)
. Details of both tasks are provided below.
The experiment consisted of 16 blocks (8 blocks for each of the two tasks). The blocks differed with regards to two factors: difficulty (easy or hard) and the presence of feedback about the correctness of a decision (presence or absence of feedback). The factorial design resulted in four types of blocks ( 
Fig. 1d)
: easy-feedback, easy-no feedback, hard-feedback, hard-no feedback. Each combination of the four block types and the two decision-making tasks was presented twice in the 16 blocks of the experiment in a random order.
In each block, participants solved 10 trials of the same level of difficulty 
(Fig. 1f)
. After that, they were instructed to indicate their willingness to pay to earn the chance of attempting an additional 5 trials of the same level of difficulty as the preceding 10 trials in the same block using a Becker-DeGroot-Marschke (BDM) auction 
48
 
(Fig. 1c)
. The auction procedure enabled us to measure a participant's self-performance estimates in an incentive-compatible manner 
38
 . Note that no feedback was provided in the additional bonus problems.
Sampling task. In each trial, participants saw two boxes on the screen that contained a number of dots. Participants were asked to decide which of two boxes contained the larger number of dots 
18,
19,
22,
35
 
(Fig. 1a)
. The difficulty of the decision was modulated by the adjusting the difference in number of dots in the two boxes (the differences were 46 and 18 dots in easy and hard trials, respectively). Each trial started with a fixation cross displayed at the centre of the screen (1.2s). On the subsequent screen, two black boxes containing a different number of white dots were briefly flashed (300ms). Participants had 3s to indicate which of the two boxes they thought contained the larger number of dots.
Knapsack task. Participants solved 80 trials of the 0-1 knapsack decision problem 
34,
36
 
(Fig.   1b
). Each trial started with a screen displaying a fixation cross at the centre (1.2s). On the next screen, six items were presented at random locations. Each item has two attributes: a value and a weight. Item values (in dollars) were indicated with dollar bills, and item weights (in kilograms) were indicated with a black weight symbol. The size of both the dollar bills and the weight symbols were proportional to the value and weight, respectively, they indicated.
The weight limit (capacity) of the knapsack in kilograms and the target profit in dollars were displayed inside a green circle at the centre of the screen, and the green circle indicated the time remaining in the trial (maximum of 25s). Participants were asked to indicate whether there exists a subset of items whose total weight does not exceed the capacity, while the total of value is at least as high as the target profit. Once participants had solved the instance, the indicated their response ("YES" or "NO") by pressing a corresponding button on the keyboard (maximum of 3s).
Following previous studies 34 , we defined the difficulty of each trial in terms of 'instance complexity' (IC): the distance between the target profit and the maximum profit attainable in the corresponding instance of the optimization variant of the 0-1 knapsack problem. Note that IC is inversely correlated with computational hardness, which means a lower value of IC corresponds to a higher level of computational hardness. Specifically,
= & − * ∑ " &
where is the target profit of the problem, * is the maximum profit achievable in the corresponding optimization instance (i.e. the highest total value of a knapsack achievable with the given set of items and the given weight constraints), and " denotes the values of ith item. The values of IC were 0.16 and 0.01 in easy and hard trials, respectively.


Self-performance estimates (SPE)
. At the end of each block, participants were asked to indicate their SPEs in two ways: a bid in a BDM auction, and a self-reported rating on a Likert scale. After finishing 10 trials in a block, a participant was endowed with A$1 and made a bid for the chance of attempting an additional 5 trials. These additional 5 trials were of the same difficulty level as the first 10 trials within the preceding block. A participant was rewarded with A$0.2 for each correct decision. In each BDM auction, a counter-bid was drawn randomly from the range A$0-A$1. If the participant's bidding value was equal or greater than the counter-bid, the participant paid the counter-bid and could attempt an additional 5 trials. Otherwise, the participants kept the initial endowment of A$1 and left the block. This auction mechanism is incentive-compatible in the sense that the optimal strategy for a participant is to always bid the number closest to their true belief about the proportion of additional trials they thought they could solve correctly (i.e., SPE; See Text S1). Participants were explicitly instructed in the optimal strategy, and using a questionnaire, we confirmed that they correctly understood it. Participants were also asked to report their selfperformance directly. Specifically, a participant was asked to indicate on a 6-point Likert scale (0 = none of them, 5 = all of them) of how many additional trials they thought they could solve correctly. The order of the BDM auction and the Likert rating was randomized across blocks and participants.


Reward payment
Participants received a show-up fee of A$10 and were a payment of A$0.2 for each correct answer for both the first 10 and the 5 bonus trials in each block.


Data analysis
Pilot experiment. We examined the effects of difficulty and feedback on trial-by-trial objective performance (i.e., mean percent correct) and block-by-block SPEs (i.e., BDM bid value) using generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMMs). We modelled objective performance as follows: logit P(correct) ~ 1 + D + F + D x F + (1 | participants) (see 
Tables   S1 and S3
). Here, P(correct) was coded as 1 if the participant chose the correct option and 0 otherwise. D denotes the difficulty (coded as -1 for easy and 1 for hard problems), F denotes the feedback (coded as -1 for problems without feedback and 1 for problems with feedback),
and D x F indicates the interaction. We added participant random effects on the intercept.
We modelled global SPEs as follows (see 
Tables S2 and S4)
 Main experiment. We examined the effects of difficulty and feedback on trial-by-trial objective performance and block-by-block global SPEs using the same models we used for the analysis of the pilot data (see above).
To examine robustness of our results related to our main study, we added block order as an explanatory variable of no interest to the models of both trial-by-trial objective performance and block-by-block SPEs (see 
Tables S9 and S10
).

Experimental design. (a) Sampling task (simple perceptual decision-making). In each trial, participants indicated which stimulus, left or right, contained the larger number of dots. Task difficulty was manipulated by the difference in number of dots between the two stimuli. (b) Knapsack task (complex economic decision-making). In each trial, participants solved an instance of the 0-1 knapsack decision problem with six items, each of which had two attributes (weight (kg) and value ($)). Participants had to indicate whether there exists a subset of items for which (i) the sum of weights is less than or equal to the weight constraint (the kilogram amount shown in the centre circle) and (ii) the sum of values is at least as high as the target profit (the dollar amount at the centre). Task difficulty was manipulated by a theoretical measure of computational hardness, instance complexity. (c) BDM auction. At the end of each block, participants bid for the right to play an additional 5 bonus trials. (d) Self-reported performance rating. At the end of each block, participants were asked to estimate their task performance in the additional 5 bonus trials if attempted.

. Instead, the pattern of SPEs observed in hard trials can potentially be explained by metacognitive control of cognitive resources. When participants are making hard decisions, a larger proportion of their (limited) cognitive resources is allocated to the decision-making process, leaving little or no resources to other metacognitive and other cognitive processes. In this case, not enough resources are allocated to paying attention to or memorizing feedback (in the presence of feedback) and decision confidence (in the absence of feedback), leading to the failure of incorporating such information into estimates of global self-performance. As a result, participants exhibited low SPEs, around chance level, in hard trials regardless of the presence or absence of feedback. Those findings suggest that distinct cognitive mechanisms may be involved in the estimation of global selfperformance in easy and hard problems in computationally complex decision-making. Future work is needed to examine this conjecture in more details.

The required sample size is N = 36.
