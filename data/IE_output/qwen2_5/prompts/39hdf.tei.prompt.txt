You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Computational modeling serves as a critical tool for understanding the intricacies of the human mind 
(Busemeyer & Diederich, 2010)
. By abstracting and formalizing complex cognitive processes into mathematical algorithms and formal structures, computational models allow researchers to generate precise predictions about human behavior and underlying neurocognitive processes. Often, such models bridge between formal theories or hypotheses of cognition and empirical data, providing a framework to test and refine our hypotheses about human decision-making processes. Thus, computational approaches facilitate the comparison of multiple theories and suggest best accounts for observed empirical data. Computational modeling not only advances our theoretical understanding of the human mind but also paves the way for practical applications in areas such as artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, and mental health 
(Huys et al., 2016;
Montague et al., 2012)
.
Traditionally, researchers have developed various laboratory tasks, which are highly controlled and comprised of often hundreds of trials, to assess behaviors and decision-making processes. The central idea is that individuals compute and make actions based on their subjective values on such laboratory tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) tasks and algorithms are excellent examples. RL algorithms propose that subjective values are updated based on feedback from the environment, such as rewards and punishments, often on a trial-by-trial basis. Using the RL framework, researchers have investigated decision-making tendencies associated with multiple systems, such as the Pavlovian, instrumental, and habitual systems. For example, studies have employed a decision-making task known as the Two-Step Task 
(Daw et al., 2011)
 to illustrate the conflict between the habitual system (model-free) and the instrumental (model-based) system. With computational modeling, we can estimate how a participant's decisions are influenced by a balance between goal-directed actions and habitual responses. Other tasks that have been widely used in psychological sciences include the Iowa Gambling Task 
(Bechara et al., 1994)
, the Cambridge Gambling Task 
(Rogers et al., 1999)
, and Choice under Risk and Ambiguity task 
(Levy et al., 2010)
 and we can reveal latent processes and quantify related individual differences using model parameters -such as risk aversion, loss aversion, and ambiguity aversion, etc.
Computational approaches are widely accepted in psychiatric research and also in the area of substance use disorders (SUDs) 
(Ahn & Busemeyer, 2016;
Maia & Frank, 2011
). For instance, recent studies demonstrate altered learning from reward and punishment in individuals with SUDs, showing increased learning from punishment and decreased learning from reward (e.g., 
Bağci et al., 2022)
, although some findings diverge.
Also, the imbalance between model-based and model-free behaviors has been linked to alcohol use disorder, which was more prominent in individuals with shorter periods of abstinence 
(Doñamayor et al., 2018)
 and those with chronic alcohol use 
(Nebe et al., 2018)
. Furthermore, the degree of model-based behavior has been shown to predict alcohol relapse in conjunction with alcohol expectancies 
(Sebold et al., 2017)
. Regarding risk-taking, opioid use was associated with increased ambiguity tolerance 
(Konova et al., 2020)
, while reduced loss aversion is associated with gambling, alcohol consumption 
(Genauck et al., 2017)
, and internet gaming 
(Hong et al., 2023)
.
A diverse set of skills including mathematical proficiency and data analytic skills are necessary for computational modeling (e.g., 
Montague et al., 2012)
. Lowering the barrier to computational modeling is of paramount importance because it provides access to advanced computational methods, allowing researchers from even non-computational backgrounds to integrate these methods into their research and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration. In recent years, several approaches and tools have emerged (e.g., 
Ahn et al., 2017;
Daunizeau et al., 2014;
Frässle et al., 2021;
Yang et al., 2020)
 to make computational modeling more accessible to a broader audience including those with limited programming or mathematical background.
As illustrated in 
Figure 1
, we believe a predominant gap in current human decision-making experimental paradigms lies in its overly simplistic and static features in resemblance of the real-world 
(Lee et al., 2024;
Wise et al., 2023)
. Specifically, traditional decision-making tasks (1) are overly simplified and too simplistic to mimic real-world decision-making, (2) often fail to capture the dynamic psychological processes during the decision-making, and (3) rely heavily on secondary rewards (i.e., money).


Figure 1. Current gaps and promising approaches for adddressing the gaps
First, a significant limitation stems from the prevalence of "toy" tasks in psychological research. While these well-controlled, often abstract tasks are valuable for isolating each specific cognitive processes, they may not capture the complexities of decision-making in naturalistic settings. To bridge this gap, there is a growing emphasis on real-time, real-world tasks to better mimic complex human behavior than simple laboratory tasks. These tasks also require the development and application of advanced analytic techniques to handle the intricacies of real-world data. Recent advancements in the field have recognized these gaps and are taking innovative steps to address them.
For instance, real-world tasks including video games are being harnessed to study decision-making in more dynamic environments (e.g., 
Cross et al., 2020)
. Researchers are now employing more naturalistic stimuli like movie watching paradigms and video games, which provide rich, continuous, and engaging contexts, to better approximate real-world decision-making scenarios.
Second, traditional decision-making paradigms have put too much weight on Third, most of the behavioral and fMRI studies on decision-making have used secondary rewards, such as monetary rewards and punishments, to gauge decisionmaking processes. While such monetary rewards may allow us to study various aspects of decision-making, they might be limited in reflecting the motivations and consequences associated with primary rewards (e.g., nicotine) especially in the context of addictive behaviors 
(Modak et al., 2021a)
.

Rapid and efficient computational markers in an EMA setting
Upon an extensive body of preceding studies, there has been a growing interest toward development of reliable predictors of various conditions in addiction. Accounting for complexity and dynamicity in addictive decisions, Empirical studies have motivated the utility of EMA and computational makers to predict addictive drug use patterns. Using a long-term temporal window, such that smaller ambiguity tolerance characterizes increased odd of opioid use disorder relapse 
(Alvarez et al., 2022;
Konova et al., 2020)
.
A major challenge of conducting an EMA study with participants' low engagement and their cognitive burden.
A promising approach to address the issue is the use of a machine learning algorithm called adaptive design optimization (ADO; 
Myung et al., 2013)
, which fine-tunes experimental design on the fly, which enables an efficient and reliable estimation of the model parameters. Specifically, unlike traditional tasks that consist of hundreds of trials, the implementation of ADO can reduce the required trials to just 20-30, thereby dramatically alleviating the burden on participants for daily data collection 
(Ahn et al., 2020)
. Our recent study 
(Lee et al., in preparation)
 investigated computational markers of smoking utilizing EMA and ADO-based decision-making tasks during 5-6 weeks of data collection. With ADO, we were able to ask participants to complete decision-making tasks on a daily basis. The results revealed that ADO-based computational markers, such as ambiguity aversion and delay discounting rate are important predictors of future smoking behavior.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can capture the dynamic changes of computational markers with ADO and just one week of ADO-based computational markers are sufficient for predicting the success of smoking cessation in 5-6 weeks.


Delivering actual drug rewards to humans in a laboratory setting
As part of ongoing efforts to address the inherent limitations of highly controlled laboratory experiments (i.e., reduced ecological validity and compromised generalizability), several attempts have been made to employ experiments utilizing addictive substances or primary rewards. Largely motivated from animal studies, deficits in action inhibition toward addictive substances and devaluation of other primary rewards (i.e., food) have been implicated in addiction studies 
(Carelli & West, 2014)
.
Until recently, most of the laboratory paradigms adapted monetary reward to account for appetitive motivations for human participants. While the field has advanced the understanding of shared neural mechanisms of dysfunction of the reward circuit in addiction 
(Goldstein & Volkow, 2011)
, most of the studies used financial reward to understand the neural mechanisms of decision-making underlying addiction. A most wellknown paradigm that engages drug cues is a cue-reactivity paradigm, where participants' behaviors and neural activity during exposure to drug or related cues are measured 
(Kühn & Gallinat, 2011;
Tiffany et al., 2000)
. However, even with the cue-reactivity paradigm typically does not deliver real drug reward to a participant.
Following previous efforts, there is an increasing trend to enhance the ecological validity and realism of laboratory paradigms. To this end, a few recent attempts have set participants to receive actual drug rewards (i.e., vape e-cigarettes) inside the MRI scanner 
(Lim et al., 2020;
Modak et al., 2021b;
Wall et al., 2017)
. The results suggest distinct neural circuits are engaged when processing drug and monetary rewards. In 
Modak et al. (2021)
, recruitment of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during nicotine anticipation was in line with the previous findings of the ACC's role in increased craving with drug availability 
(Rose et al., 2013)
. Experimental environments of actual drug-use would contribute to increased craving level compared to non-drug reward or delayed availability of addictive drugs 
(Gu et al., 2016)
. Use of actual drug rewards to participants with addiction is expected to expand generalizability in a sense that it is more naturalistic and alike with actual situations when participants decide to smoke.


Conclusions and future directions
Previous studies highlight the pivotal role of computational modeling in elucidating the complexities of human cognition and decision-making. However, the advancements including EMA, artificial intelligence, and naturalistic paradigms in the field have marked a significant shift in our approach to understanding human cognition and decision-making. This body of work not only highlights the traditional strengths of computational methods but, more importantly, underscores the innovative strategies employed to address the limitations of conventional approaches.
We can think of several promising avenues for future research, informed by both recent works and the limitations identified by many researchers. Importantly, future research should focus on developing tasks that more closely mimic real-world decisionmaking scenarios. This includes the use of dynamic, real-time tasks and stimuli that provide richer, more engaging contexts. Efforts should be directed towards integrating these real-world tasks with advanced analytic techniques to handle the complexities of real-world data. This endeavor can be combined with methodologies that can capture the dynamic nature of psychological states during decision-making. Techniques like EMA and mobile technology should be further explored and refined to understand how decision-making processes evolve over time. In addition, we believe future studies should seriously consider employing a broad range of experiments that utilize primary rewards, especially in the context of addictive behaviors and related psychopathology.
This approach could provide deeper insights into the motivations and consequences associated with primary rewards, thereby enhancing the ecological validity of the addiction research. Lastly, the application of artificial intelligence including deep neural networks to human and animal research represents a promising frontier. This combination can effectively model complex associations between states and actions in real-time tasks, offering a nuanced understanding of internal reward systems and preferences in human decision-making.
In conclusion, the field stands at a promising juncture, with computational modeling and newly developed techniques offering a powerful tools for investigating the intricacies of the human mind. As we move forward, it is imperative to continue innovating and refining our approaches, ensuring that our models and tasks are as nuanced and realistic as the behaviors they seek to understand.

"snapshots" of human behavior. In other words, researchers would analyze isolated moments or singular instances while human psychological states are inherently dynamic, fluctuating, and variant. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and digital phenotyping have been powerful tools to may address this by repeatedly sampling individual experiences in a real time manner. By requiring multiple data collection or sampling during various psychological states, it might be possible to capture and understand the dynamic changes of a decision-making process over time.


have developed the "Highway Task", a real-time driving test in which participants control a car on a visual highway and drive as fast as possible without crashing into other car. It was presumed that the Highway Task would assay many traits that are associated with SUDs, particularly impulsivity and sustained attention. Indeed, behavioral performance in the Highway Task was very highly correlated with the self-reported impulsivity, the Barrett Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) (r = -.46, p<0.01). Furthermore, unlike traditional trial-by-trial laboratory tasks, the Highway Task continuously offers interactive trajectories, resembling complex real-world scenarios.In real-world situations that require self-control and attentiveness, a few elements in the environment interact with individual impulsivity, and the Highway Task better captures this pattern compared to traditional measures such as the Go/Nogo task and the delaydiscounting task. Lee et al. used a deep neural network (DNN) based inverse reinforcement learning algorithm, which can represent complex associations between states and actions in real-time tasks to approximate nonlinear reward functions. By integrating DNN with inverse reinforcement learning (i.e., deep inverse reinforcement learning), subjective rewards are inferred in real time for given states and actions. The rewards derived by inverse reinforcement learning can be interpreted as a participant's internal reward or preference, making it a valuable tool for modeling human decision making.
