You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Research translation is a critical yet undervalued area. Data driven decision making can have major impacts on communities and society as a whole. Education particularly can benefit from a wholistic data driven approach to facilitating the learning and development of youth. Social emotional competency is one way to develop adults who are happy and productive members of society. One key factor in creating a classroom climate promotive of social and emotional growth is teacher's awareness of students emotional states 
(Jennings & Greenberg, 2009)
. If applicable, knowledge of student coping and regulation techniques is also important. Many school-based interventions have attempted to do this 
(Goldberg et al., 2019;
Kuypers, 2011)
. The goal of the present application is to track student data and produce simple visualizations in a user-friendly application.


Methods


Implementation
Here a Shiny application is introduced, it is a dashboard that tracks student emotions, feelings about friends and school, and usage of emotional regulation techniques, each of which has its own tab in the application. The following shows a sample dashboard using example data. The dashboard is designed to use daily surveys taken by students in each classroom. That data would then be fed into the application. Each teacher would get their own Shiny application, potentially launched via shiny.io where they can access a link with their individualized classroom dashboard.
The first page of the dashboard shows a waffle plot displaying a macro level view of student stress (see 
Figure 1
 below). This displays class-wide stress levels at a glance. Below is page two which displays student-level coping skill use across the school year (see 
Figure 2
). This will demonstrate which coping skills are most popular for each student and may inform which skills teachers want to prompt when students display emotional dysregulation.


Figure 2. Coping Skill (SEL Technique) Use by Student Across the Semester
• The bars each indicate a different coping skill and a count of how many times the skill has been used this semester by the student. • The plot includes a dropdown menu to look at different students' use of the various coping skills taught in the classroom.
The next page of the dashboard shows each student's feelings about their peers (see 
Figure 3
). This can inform the teacher which children are not feeling good about their peers, which may be an indicator of peer problems and can prompt the teacher to learn more. The orange line indicates the class average, which is a quick way to draw the eye to which students are reporting worse feelings about peers than their classmates. Next is a bar chart showing each student's feelings about school (see 
Figure 4)
. This gives the teacher information about how each student is feeling about school in general. If the student is indicating they don't feel good about school, the teacher may investigate further and determine if something is wrong. The average line can draw the teacher's attention to which students are feeling worse about school than their peers. This page shows student-level stress across the school year (see 
Figure 5
). This line chart shows how high the students' average stress level is for the month. The plot is created using the plotly package in R Shiny which has more options for plot interactivity 
(Sievert, 2020)
. The following figure 
(Figure 6a)
 shows an additional capability of the stress plot referenced above ( 
Figure 5)
. When you double click on a specific student's line, you are able to get a closer look at their stress trajectory. You can double click a second student's line and view both at the same time to compare them.


Figure 6a. Closer Look at One Student's Stress
• After double clicking on a single student's line, or their name on the right-hand side, you can view that student's line in isolation. The axes will auto scale for a closer look.
This 
figure (Figure 6b
) is another capability of the aforementioned stress plot tab. This demonstrates the cursor hover capabilities. By hovering over a line, the popover will display line information including the student's name. This is especially useful in areas of the plot where many lines overlap, and it is challenging to discern which line belongs to which child.


Figure 6b. Hover Capabilities on Student Stress Plot
• When you mouse over a student's line, a popover appears giving student-specific information.
Lastly, the final dashboard tab shows a subset of the Shiny App code for the curious user.

Feelings About Peers• Each bar represents a student, and the height of the bar indicates how they are feeling about their friends.Higher numbers indicate better feelings about friends. • The orange line indicates the classroom average.

Acknowledgements
First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge Gregory M. Fosco as the originial creator of this dashboard idea, without his orignial conceptualization, I would not have been inspried to implment and expand upon it.
I would like to thank Ellen Chen, website co-developer and undergraduate research assistant. Ellen provided a substantial amount of novel code for this project. She is an exceptional research assistant, who has also provided consultation on app components and data visualization.
I would also like to thank Mengyun Chen, graduate research assistant, who harnessing her clinical knowledge provided critical early consultation on app use and data visualization.






Conclusions
This paper illustrates a Shiny application, which is a dashboard for facilitating teacher knowledge of student emotions, feelings about school and peers, and emotion regulation skills use. This application aims to promote teacher knowledge of individual student states as well as ease the cognitive burden of committing each student's status to memory. It intends to promote scaffolding of student emotional regulation by giving the teachers the information needed to detect if students can benefit from prompts to engage in emotional regulation techniques. Powerful tools like this that combine modern technological capabilities to better understand youth are critical in forwarding the field of education. Future directions include widespread improvement and implementation of such tools.
