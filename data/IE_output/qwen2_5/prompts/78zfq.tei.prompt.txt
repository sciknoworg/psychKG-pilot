You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that affects individuals of all ages, genders, and cultural backgrounds. Despite increasing awareness and understanding, persistent misconceptions and stigma continue to challenge the effective care and support of those with ASD. Providing healthcare for individuals with ASD requires more than just addressing medical concerns-it necessitates a comprehensive, patient-centered approach (PCC) that incorporates social, emotional, and educational aspects of care. This study insights from caregivers, the study highlights areas where improvements are needed, particularly in enhancing communication, fostering inclusivity, and addressing the unique challenges faced by those with ASD. The findings emphasize the critical need for a holistic approach that combines empathy, collaboration, and coordinated care. It is essential to consider not only the medical and clinical needs of individuals with ASD but also the broader, multifaceted support required to improve their quality of life and well-being. The study advocates for healthcare providers to engage more actively with caregivers and adopt patient-centered practices that can lead to better long-term outcomes for individuals with ASD and their families.


Methodology
This study employed a survey-based approach to gather data from caregivers of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) regarding their experiences with healthcare services.
The survey design included both structured and open-ended questions, allowing for a mixedmethods analysis that captured quantitative trends and qualitative insights.


Participants
The survey was completed by 32 unique respondents, all of whom identified as caregivers or family members of individuals with ASD from Myanmar. Participants were selected through convenience sampling, ensuring that the respondents had direct experiences with healthcare services for individuals with ASD. No exclusion criteria were applied beyond the requirement of being a caregiver to an individual diagnosed with ASD.


Survey Design
Brain Sci. 2025, 01, FOR PEER REVIEW


of 13
The survey comprised 19 questions, encompassing Likert-scale items to evaluate satisfaction, communication, and inclusivity, alongside open-ended prompts for elaboration on specific experiences. Key questions addressed the following areas: 
[1]
 Overall satisfaction with care 
[2]
 Communication quality between caregivers and healthcare providers 
[3]
 Attention to both medical and emotional needs of patients 
[4]
 Consideration of sensory sensitivities during care 
[5]
 Caregiver involvement in decision-making and care planning


Data Collection and Instruments
Responses were collected electronically through an online survey platform to maximize accessibility for caregivers. The survey was designed to take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. Each participant provided responses anonymously to encourage candid feedback.


Data Analysis
A mixed-methods approach was employed for analysis:


Quantitative Data:
Responses to Likert-scale items were analyzed using descriptive statistics to identify trends in caregiver satisfaction, communication effectiveness, and unmet needs.


Qualitative Data:
Open-ended responses were subjected to thematic analysis to uncover recurring themes, such as gaps in provider training and the importance of sensory-friendly practices.

The survey instrument was developed specifically for this study and included validated measures of caregiver satisfaction and communication. Analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel for descriptive statistics and manual coding for thematic analysis of qualitative responses.


Ethical Considerations
Participation was voluntary, with informed consent obtained from all respondents. The study adhered to ethical guidelines for research involving human participants, ensuring confidentiality and data protection.


Results
The analysis of the survey responses from 32 caregivers of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from Myanmar highlighted key trends regarding their experiences with healthcare services. The results revealed both strengths and significant areas for improvement in the healthcare provided to individuals with ASD, with particular emphasis on caregiver satisfaction, communication, care coordination, and involvement in decision-making.


Quantitative Findings
The Likert-scale questions revealed several noteworthy trends:  


3.1.3.Care Coordination:
A clear theme emerged that care coordination was often lacking.
Many caregivers reported doing much of the work in keeping multiple healthcare providers informed, with some feeling overwhelmed by the need to repeatedly communicate the same details to various specialists.


Caregiver Involvement in Decision-Making:
While most caregivers were included in decisions about their child's care, many felt that their input was undervalued. Some reported that the final decisions often seemed to be made without sufficient consideration of their opinions.


Qualitative Findings
The open-ended responses provided deeper insight into the specific challenges caregivers faced:


Lack of Proactive Support:
Many caregivers reported that healthcare providers did not offer proactive support and often waited for caregivers to initiate contact. There was a strong desire for more regular check-ins and guidance, particularly concerning mental health and sleep-related issues.


Inconsistent Understanding of Caregiving Challenges: Some caregivers felt that
healthcare providers did not fully grasp the emotional and physical demands of caring for a child with ASD. This led to feelings of frustration, as providers were sometimes perceived as dismissive or unaware of the challenges faced by caregivers.


Care Coordination Issues:
The lack of effective coordination between primary care providers(PCPs) emerged as a significant concern. Caregivers frequently mentioned that Brain Sci. 2025, 01, FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 13 they had to manage the logistics of scheduling, follow-up, and ensuring that all providers were aware of their child's care needs.


Limited Involvement in Decision-Making:
Although caregivers were often consulted in decisions regarding care, many felt their input was not fully incorporated into the decision-making process. There was a recurring sense that healthcare providers made final decisions without adequately considering caregivers' perspectives.
The results of this study highlight the need for more proactive and coordinated care in the healthcare services for individuals with ASD in Myanmar. Caregivers expressed a desire for more consistent support, better communication, and a more holistic approach to care that includes mental health, sleep health, and emotional well-being. Additionally, there is a strong need for healthcare providers to better understand the full scope of challenges that caregivers face and to actively involve them in decision-making processes to improve care outcomes for both the child and the caregiver. A notable concern raised by caregivers was the lack of holistic care that addresses not only the medical needs of patients but also the emotional and psychological needs of caregivers. This aligns with prior studies that suggest the need for healthcare systems to adopt a more integrated approach to care (Kasari & Smith, 2013). Effective care coordination across various specialists was also identified as a major gap, with many caregivers reporting that they had to manage and track appointments and information independently.


Discussion
While the study highlights these important issues, it also suggests potential solutions. The findings point to a need for healthcare providers to offer more proactive follow-ups, better communication, and more comprehensive care planning that includes both the patient's and the caregiver's needs. Establishing consistent check-ins and ensuring that caregivers feel fully involved in the decision-making process could help reduce the burden they experience.
There are limitations to this study, including a small sample size and potential biases associated with self-reported data. Caregivers' perspectives may also vary depending on their geographical location and access to healthcare resources. Future research should aim to include a larger, more diverse sample and examine the effectiveness of specific interventions designed to improve caregiver support and care coordination.
In conclusion, this study underscores the need for healthcare systems to provide more proactive, holistic, and coordinated care for individuals with ASD and their caregivers.
Implementing these changes could significantly alleviate caregiver stress, improve their satisfaction with healthcare services, and enhance the quality of care for individuals with ASD. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who participated in the survey. Their willingness to share their experiences has been vital in enhancing our understanding of the challenges they face, and I am truly grateful for their time and contribution to this study.

Overall Satisfaction with Care: Caregivers expressed varying levels of satisfaction.A significant proportion indicated that follow-up care was inadequate, especially concerning mental health, sleep health, and a holistic approach to care. Many caregivers noted that they felt isolated in managing their child's health needs.

Communication Quality: Responses were mixed regarding the quality of communication between caregivers and healthcare providers. While some caregivers felt that their healthcare providers were available when contacted, a substantial number Brain Sci. 2025, 01, FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 13 indicated that communication was largely reactive, with little proactive outreach or follow-up.


This study examined the experiences of caregivers of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) regarding their interactions with healthcare services. The results emphasize significant challenges faced by caregivers, particularly in the areas of proactive support, communication with healthcare providers, and care coordination. Caregivers reported frequently needing to initiate contact with healthcare providers, a finding consistent with previous research on caregiver stress (Sicile-Kira, 2004; Denton, 2012). Additionally, the study revealed that providers often fail to understand the full emotional and physical toll of caregiving, which is consistent with existing literature (Eisenhower et al., 2005).
