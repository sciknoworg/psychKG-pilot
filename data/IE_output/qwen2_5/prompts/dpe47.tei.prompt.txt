Introduction


Driver monitoring
As the level of automation in road vehicles increases, the role of the human driver transitions from that of vehicle operators (SAE Level 0; SAE, 2021) towards system supervisor (SAE Level 2 and Level 3; SAE, 2021) or vehicle passenger (Level 4 and Level 5; SAE, 2021) 
(Biondi et al, 2024)
. Through these incremental increases in automation, the lateral and longitudinal dynamics of the vehicle begin to be controlled by the automated system and thus humans are removed from operational control loop 
Mole et al, 2019)
.
Crucially, for SAE Levels 2 (L2), 3 (L3), and 4 (L4), the human is still ultimately responsible for the safe resumption of control when the system has reached the limits of its Operational Driving Domain (ODD). How then, can we ensure that the driver is ready to re-engage with the dynamic driving task following periods of supervision? It is well established from aviation that humans are poor at monitoring systems 
(Parasuraman et al, 1993;
2003;
2018)
.
Furthermore, research has consistently found that driver eye movements tend to be more dispersed and less focused on the road centre as the level of automation increases 
Mole et al, 2019)
, alongside drivers focusing more on non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) 
(Carsten et al, 2012)
.
To alleviate these safety issues vehicle manufacturers have focused on the development of Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS). DMS refers to a selection of sensors and cameras that monitor whether the driver is alert, attentive, and ready to engage if a critical situation arises. If a driver's level of engagement falls below a particular level, a warning is provided; this might be to attend towards the road environment, or to place their hands on the steering wheel. The concept of a driver being "ready", "engaged", and/or "available" is known as Driver Readiness 
(DR)
. DR (also known as driver availability; Marberger et al (2017)) can be defined as the probability of a successful intervention during a takeover situation 
(Georg et al, 2017)
. An assumption of DR is that during automation, a driver is removed from the perceptual-motor control loops that are vital for efficient and safe driving 
Mole et al, 2019)
.
Therefore, drivers might not be capable of resuming control of the dynamic driving task safely after a takeover request (TOR) has been delivered. As such, there has been increased interest in understanding DR; namely, how to estimate it, and what factors impact it during critical situations.
One of the challenges of DR is that it is an abstract concept that cannot be directly measured.
Therefore, it has generally been operationalised via constructs that are associated with a driver's ability to take over from automation 
(Gonçalves et al, 2024;
Hecht et al, 2019)
.
Readiness has often been split into two main categories; motoric and cognitive readiness 
(Gonçalves et al, 2024;
Mioch et al, 2017;
Kim et al, 2022)
. Motoric readiness refers to the driver being physically available to regain control of the vehicular controls. This can manifest itself through body pose (e.g., the head being in a position such that visual stimuli can be perceived and reacted to) alongside hand and feet positioning (e.g., positioning hands and feet such that they can control the vehicle) 
(Mioch et al, 2017)
. This is particularly pertinent for hands-off Level 2 automation, where drivers may not be required to have their hands on the steering wheel. Cognitive readiness refers to the driver having sufficient cognitive resources available to them in order to attend to, and process, relevant information during takeover situations. It is therefore proposed that sufficient DR will result in smoother transitions of control back towards the main driving task.
The driving task has often been described as a collection of driving subtasks (performed sequentially or simultaneously) 
(Engström, 2011;
. Some of these subtasks are said to be automatised and governed by strong neural pathways. Conversely, some subtasks may require cognitive control as they have not been extensively practised or are tasks associated with inherently uncertain situations . The Cognitive Control Hypothesis (CCH) encapsulates how these differing perspectives interact to inform how the loading of cognitive resources may impact manual driving performance. CCH proposes that cognitive load selectively impairs driving subtasks that require cognitive control whilst leaving automatised subtasks unaffected. Support for the CCH has been found in a range of manual driving studies (see  for a review); however, it is unclear how (or even if) the CCH translates to subtasks implicated in takeover situations.


Takeover performance
The safety of a takeover is largely governed by two aspects: the time between the onset of the event and the impending crash (known as the "time budget"), and the effectiveness of driver action 
(McDonald et al, 2019)
. If a driver is motorically and cognitively ready, can decide on an action, and can effectively execute that action within a time budget, the driver is likely to avoid a crash. Whilst crashes are a useful measure of takeover performance from a safety perspective, they provide an "all or nothing" description of takeover quality. In reality, there are instances where a takeover is suboptimal but there has not been a resultant crash. A range of metrics aim to measure the quality of a takeover including lane position statistics (i.e., the standard deviation of lane position, SD LP ), and the average derivatives of control inputs from drivers (i.e., lateral acceleration/jerk or longitudinal deceleration/negative jerk). Extremities in these measures may not result in a crash but will likely impact other vehicles to the side or behind the ego-vehicle, resulting in poor-quality takeover.
The takeover process after an automated system ceases to operate involves the driver regaining motor and cognitive readiness in order to reengage with a number of operational factors including the reduction longitudinal speed, re-grasping the steering wheel, and consequently stabilising the vehicle . A takeover process model proposed by 
Zeeb et al (2015)
 focused on the underlying processes of driver takeover whilst completing a secondary task. The model comprises four main elements; orienting gaze towards the road, motor readiness, cognitive processing (which includes perceiving elements within the visual scene), and the takeover reaction itself. This model assumes that motor readiness and cognitive processing can be completed in parallel and thus detriments of cognitive readiness may not necessarily impact motor coordination. 
Zeeb et al (2016)
 supported this prediction, finding no effect of visual-cognitive non-driving related task (NDRT) type (engaging in email, news, or a video task, as well as a no task baseline) when measuring hands-on reaction time.
Whilst there have been a lot of research on takeover performance regarding "highly automated" or Level 3 automated systems 
(Gold et al, 2013;
, far fewer have investigated the impact of pure cognitive load on takeover performance from Level 2 systems. Cognitive load (sometimes referred to as mental workload; De Waard, 1996) is one construct of DR that has received high interest. Cognitive load typically refers to the quantity of mental resources that are demanded and/or used for task performance. In the context of driving, this may (but not always) relate to the resources demanded by a secondary competing activity 
(Engström, 2011)
. Whilst the driver's eyes might still be on the road during a cognitively loading task, the cognitive resources available to the driver in order to take control of the vehicle during a critical situation might be low. As such, their cognitive readiness may be low, and thus their takeover performance impaired. Despite this implicit expectation, empirical results question the influence that cognitive load might have on takeover performance.  found that cognitive load did not affect crash risk or the percentage of road gaze fixations within 3 s of a takeover request (TOR) when taking over from a hands-off Level 2 automated system.  suggested that higher load could be indicative of less anticipatory responses (i.e., responding after the onset of lead vehicle brake lights) and more crashes, however inferential analysis did not support this claim.  found no effect of cognitive load in steering initiation time or steering wheel variability one second after a lane change during a vehicle avoidance task. 
Choi et al (2020)
 found that subjective workload was negatively correlated with response times; drivers who responded faster reported higher workload. 
Choi et al (2020)
 proposed that this was indicative of cognitive load making drivers more aware of potential danger during automated driving, thus causing drivers to place their hands on the steering wheel faster. However, this implies that higher cognitive load produces more anticipatory responses; the opposite of  proposal. 
Furthermore, Choi et al (2020)
 found that the difficulty of the N-back had no consistent or substantial effects on response time, steering variance between the initiation of the steering to the lane crossing, or steering angle variance after lane crossing for a vehicle avoidance task. One negative effect of cognitive load was the association with an increase in time margin between the initiation of steering and consequential lane crossing; a 300 ms increase for every increment of cognitive load. This indicates that drivers were less ready to initiate their manoeuvre to avoid an obstacle during high cognitive load conditions. Given that lane changes have been associated with elements of cognitive control (i.e., decision making, see 
Gonçalves et al, 2022)
, this latter result from Choi et al (2020) could provide initial evidence that the CCH may apply to transitions of control.
Whilst the effect of cognitive load on takeover performance is largely inconsistent, the criticality of the scenario (operationalised via time budget) reliably impacts takeover performance. A typical finding in the literature is that scenarios with smaller time budgets (i.e., scenarios with higher criticalities) tend to result in faster reactions, but poorer quality takeovers 
(Gold et al, 2013)
. A meta-analysis on studies investigating time budgets for SAE Level 3 systems found that response times increased by .33 s for every 1 s increase in time budget 
(Gold et al, 2018)
. For SAE levels 2-4, McDonald et al (2019) found similar findings; a .27 s increase in takeover time for every 1 s increase in time budget. Manipulating the time budget of an event has also been found to reduce the quality of post-takeover vehicle control. Smaller time budgets have been associated with larger maximum longitudinal decelerations and lateral accelerations 
(Wan & Wu, 2018)
, increased likelihood of crashing 
(Wan & Wu, 2018)
 and larger standard deviations of lateral position and steering wheel angle . Whilst it is clear that the time budget of takeover events influences takeover performance, few studies have investigated whether cognitive load interacts with this effect. 
Wan & Wu (2018)
 found that some of the negative effects of time budget on takeover performance (minimum time to collision) were exacerbated when drivers engaged in secondary tasks. However, these secondary tasks involved taking drivers visual attention away from the forward roadway (reading, typing, watching videos). A study by  found no effect of time budget, cognitive load, or any interaction for takeover times, only larger maximum accelerations for events with smaller time budgets. However, the N-back task used in this study had substantial visual and manual elements to the distraction. In the context of Level 2 automation, it is crucial to understand whether a purely cognitive NDRT interacts with the time budget of a potentially critical scenario. In the real world, it is likely that there will be situations where drivers of Level 2 automated systems will be monitoring the road environment with their eyes on the road, a warning is delivered because the vehicle has reached the limits of its Operational Driving Domain (ODD), and yet the driver's cognitive readiness is depleted due to engaging in NDRTs (such as hands-free phone conversations). The exacerbation, or lack thereof, of negative driver performance due to increased cognitive load must be investigated within the laboratory to fully understand the consequences.


Gaze behaviour
Alongside takeover performance, it is also important to understand how eye movements change during transitions of control. Visual attention is commonly associated with a driver's level of cognitive readiness 
(Gonçalves et al, 2024)
 and is widely considered vital when resuming control of the vehicle. During critical takeovers, drivers transition from a supervisory role to an active control of the vehicle 
(Deniel & Navarro, 2023)
. Without sufficient visual exploration, this could lead to poor decision making, poor steering performance, and ultimately a worse quality takeover. Driver gaze tends to be more constrained when they are cognitively loaded during automated driving; this can manifest as a reduction in the complexity of gaze transitions 
(Goodridge et al, 2024)
 or via a reduction in the dispersion of horizontal gaze 
(Gold et al, 2016;
Wilkie et al, 2019)
. The latter of these effects has been comprehensively observed in cognitively loaded drivers during manual driving 
(Reimer et al, 2009;
2010;
Sodhi et al, 2002)
. It has not yet been established whether the reduction of horizontal gaze dispersion when cognitively loaded is of a similar size in automated driving as it is for manual driving. 
Wilkie et al (2019)
 did investigate horizontal gaze dispersion with and without cognitive load, and in manual and automated driving conditions. Although they did not report an analysis of the interaction effect between these variables, plots of the data seemed to imply that an interaction might be present.
Research has also investigated changes in gaze behaviours following takeovers. Whilst vehicle dynamics data is a key indication of takeover performance, gaze behaviours provide a continuous and temporal indication of driver state during the takeover . Such information may prove useful for predicting future manual driving performance following a takeover. Once again, the criticality of the situation may influence driver state, with reduced time budgets needing more urgency and thus potentially more cognitive resources for adequate takeover performance. A review of the effects of takeover criticality on gaze behaviours notes that the manipulation of criticality largely combines the consequences of failure (head on collisions, deviating from a lane) with time budgets 
(Deniel & Navarro, 2023)
. However, a general finding is that higher criticalities result in drivers being quicker to reorientate their gaze back towards the road centre 
(Hyde, 2017;
Louw et al, 2015)
. Despite this being an optimal reaction, it has been suggested that the exploration of the scene by the driver is more dispersed and less focused on the road 
(Hyde, 2017)
.  investigated whether severe (TTC = 4 s) or less severe (TTC = s) events produced changes in eye movements during takeover transitions. The standard deviation of horizontal gaze was not affected; however, the rate of blinking was found to increase for takeovers with smaller time budgets. The peak of the difference in blinking rate occurred 5 s after the TOR.  claimed that blink inhibition indicated that drivers paid greater attention to critical scenarios with smaller time budgets in order to support decision making.
Support from this comes from work suggesting that blinking decreases when more information is required for processing 
(Veltman & Gaillard, 1996)
. However, there are a number of limitations to this study. Firstly, the statistical model used to analyse these data was misspecified. The degrees of freedom used in the Analysis of Variance imply that the sample size was over 500 whereas the true sample was only 102. Furthermore, the difference in the number of blinks between 4 s and 7 s time budgets was approximately one blink over a 30 s period.
Small effect sizes and inflated degrees of freedom are indicative of pseudo-replication of the sample 
(Lazic, 2010)
, whereby the repeated measures design is not specified correctly within the analytic model structure. Whilst  claim that blink inhibition is indicative of higher arousal for more critical conditions, the biased p values associated with the statistical tests mean these results should be interpreted with caution.


Current work
Whilst previous research has investigated the impact of cognitive load 
(Choi et al, 2020;
Zhang et al, 2019)
 and time budget  on takeover performance, these have largely been investigated independently without understanding their interaction. Studies that have investigated their interaction have usually focused on NDRT variants that have cognitive, visual, and manual elements 
Wan & Wu, 2018)
. Purely cognitive tasks, such as auditory N-back or serial addition tasks  have been focused on less. By "purely cognitive", we refer to a task that does not require the driver to divert their eyes or body away from safety critical driving activities and locations. This study aimed to investigate how drivers responded if they are required to take back control from a hands-off Level 2 automated vehicle. More specifically, what is the impact of increasing cognitive load on the timing and quality of takeovers, the influence on eye movements during automation and during post-takeover manual driving, and whether these effects are exacerbated by the time budget of a potential rear-end collision.


Materials and methods


Participants
41 participants were recruited via the University of Leeds Driving Simulator participant pool.
However, three participants were removed before data analysis, as they did not follow the experimental instructions, or because eye tracking data was not captured correctly. After removing invalid responses (collisions, drivers who had their hands on the wheel during the TOR, physiologically implausible reaction times), a further participant was removed from the dataset. The remaining 37 participants (15 females, 22 males, mean age = 39.05, range = 22-65) all had normal or corrected to normal vision. All participants had a valid UK driving license (mean number of years = 18, range = 4-43) and were regular drivers (mean annual miles = 9067.56, range 5000-20000).


Apparatus and materials
The experiment was conducted at the University of Leeds Driving Simulator (see 
Figure 1
).
The motion-based driving simulator consisted of a Jaguar S-type cab encased within a 4 m spherical projection dome. The dome has a 300° field of view projection to render the driving environment. Driver controls were fully operational, with pedals and steering providing haptic feedback. This provided participants with conditions that replicated real-world driving.
Longitudinal and lateral movement was provided via a hexapod motion base and a m x m X-Y table. Gaze data were collected using a Seeing Machines Driver Monitoring System eye tracker sampling at 60 Hz. The NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) was used to measure subjective mental workload 
(Hart & Staveland, 1988
) and consisted of 6 subscales; mental, physical, and temporal demands, as well as frustration, effort and performance. Event criticality was operationalised by changing the time budget of a potential rear-end conflict. This was manipulated over two levels: a larger time budget for less severe events (time to collision (TTC) = 5 s) allowed drivers to successfully takeover in most critical events, whereas a smaller time budget (TTC = 3 s) produced a severe event that could lead to a rearend collision if the driver was not paying sufficient attention. These specific values were chosen as previous research has demonstrated that a 3 s TTC produces highly critical situations, whereas 5 s TTCs allow drivers sufficient time to takeover 
(Gold et al, 2013;
. The experiment was comprised of two drives on a 3-lane UK motorway.
During one drive, participants completed 2-back during the automated period; the other drive involved no secondary task. Each drive lasted approximately 35 minutes and was comprised of 10 discrete events. Each event consisted of 30 s of manual driving followed by approximately two minutes of automated driving. After two minutes of automated driving, a takeover request (TOR) was delivered by short auditory tone and the shifting of a steering wheel Human-Machine Interface (HMI) icon from green (automation engaged) to flashing red (takeover required) (see 
Figure 3
). Four of these events were critical; two had a TTC of 3 s (deceleration rate of 5.55 m/s 2 ), two had a TTC 5 s (deceleration rate of 2 m/s 2 ). The deceleration of the lead vehicle occurred as soon as the TOR was triggered. The remaining six events were non-critical; two without a lead vehicle and four with a lead vehicle that did not decelerate once the TOR was activated. These were included to guard against learning effects such that the presence of a lead vehicle was not always associated with a critical event. Analysis of the event order revealed no effects for any of the metrics (see supplemental material). Lead vehicles appeared from the left-hand lane before the automated system was engaged and maintained a distance of 25 m (see 
Figure 2
). Ambient traffic in the left and right lanes flowed consistently to provide sufficient bottom-up sensory input to facilitate driver scanning. All 


Procedure
Informed consent was obtained, and standardized procedural instructions were delivered before participants began the study. All procedures were approved by the University of Leeds Research Ethics Committee (Reference code: 2022-0353-206).
Participants completed pre-drive questionnaires (the data for which is not reported within this manuscript). A practice session allowed participants to become familiar with the vehicle dynamics and task requirements. During this session, participants were walked through the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) that indicated the state of the automation (see 
Figure 3
), completed a static N-back, were shown how the automated system engaged, and how they could disengage the automated system. Participants were instructed to remove their hands and feet away from the steering wheel and pedals once the automated system was engaged. During the practice trial, a non-critical takeover with a lead vehicle in front was used; N-back was not completed during the practice drive. Participants started the drive on a motorway slip road and were instructed to position the vehicle in the centre of the middle lane, maintaining a speed of 70 MPH. After 30 s of manual driving, the automated system engaged; participants removed their hands from the steering wheel and their feet away from the pedals. The activation of the automated system was indicated via an auditory tone and the HMI changing from greyed out to green (see 
Figure 3
).
After two minutes of automated driving, a TOR was issued which was characterised by the HMI icon flashing red and an auditory tone. Participants could take over via 3 different modes: turning the steering wheel in either direction by more than 2°, pressing any of the operational pedals, or pressing a micro-switch button strapped to the steering wheel. During piloting, it became obvious that some drivers wanted a way of deactivating the automated system without touching the operational controls; this was particularly true during non-critical trials. Hence the inclusion of the micro-switch button allowed drivers this option. Participants had 10 seconds to disengage the automation, after which the automated system automatically disengaged back into manual driving mode. After the takeover, participants drove manually for approximately 30 s before the automated system reengaged to begin the next trial. Participants were explicitly instructed during the practice to rejoin the middle lane if they left it during their takeover.
Automation would not engage until they returned to the middle lane. Overall, there were 10 discrete events per drive and each drive lasted approximately 35 minutes. After each drive participants filled out a NASA-TLX to measure subjective ratings across each of the 6 subscales (see 
Goodridge et al, 2024)
. At the end of the experiment, post-drive questionnaires we also filled out (the data for which are not reported within this manuscript).


Statistical modelling
2.5.1 Analytic approach A Bayesian modelling approach was used to analyse the data within this manuscript. The posterior distributions were estimated using the No-U-Turn sampler in the brms package in R 
(Bürkner, 2017)
. For model parameters that predicted the expected value of the dependent variable, weakly informative regularizing priors were used. Maximal random effects structures were specified within each of the models to account for between-participant variability. Model fits were assessed via graphical assessment of the posterior predictive checks. The summary of this can be found in the supplemental material. Data and analysis code can be found in the following link (https://github.com/courtneygoodridge/takeover_performance_cogload_time_budget).
Many of the response variables analysed in the following sections follow non-Gaussian distributions. This makes interpreting the parameter values directly difficult because the expected value of the outcome variable is not one of the distribution's parameters (as is the case for a Gaussian model distribution; the expected value is the mean, μ). Therefore, the
Marginal Effects at the Representative values (MER) were computed which referred to the expected value of a takeover metric at a given level of the covariate 
(Heiss, 2022;
Nguyen, 2023;
Perraillon, 2019)
.


Results


Response times


Model fitting
Response times have unique distributional characteristics; they are typically positively skewed and non-negative 
(Wagenmakers et al, 2007)
. Another property of response times is that there are physiological limits to how fast they can be because human response times are not instantaneous. A Shifted Log-Normal distribution was used to model response times, where a shift parameter (δ) was included to account for non-decision time. The inclusion of this parameter produced improved inferences on expected response times alongside adding some mechanistic application of real human responses 
(Lindeløv, 2019)
. Two response time variables were measured in this analysis. Brake reaction time (RT B ) referred to the time from the TOR until the driver applied 1 Newton-metre (nm) of brake force to the brake pedal. Hands-on 
This model set up assumed that was Log-Normally distributed with a mean ( ), a standard deviation ( ), and a shift parameter (δ). The shift parameter moved the entire distribution towards the left or right of the x axis and when δ = 0, the distribution was a Log-Normal distribution with two parameters: and . denoted the response time metric, specified the condition of each variable, specified the participant, and corresponded to the variance and covariance parameters.


Brake reaction time (RT B )
The coefficient posterior means and 95% CIs alongside the probability of direction are shown in 
Table 1
. The model predicted no substantial or reliable effect of cognitive load on brake reaction times. However, the posterior predictions indicated that drivers were slower to initiate braking when TTCs were high (TTC = 5 s; RT B = 1.283 s) versus when TTCs were low (TTC = 3 s; RT B = 1.156 s) (see 
Figure 4C
). The average increase in RT B when TTCs were higher was .127 s (MER RT B = .127, [CI: .016, .235]), however the credible intervals implied that reaction times could have increased by as much as .235 s, or as little as .016 s (effectively 0).  


Hands-on steering wheel reaction time (RT HO )
A similar effect was observed for hands-on steering wheel reaction time. There was no substantial or consistent effect of cognitive load, however participants were slower to place their hands on the steering wheel when faced with higher TTCs (TTC = 5 s; RT HO = 1.427 s)
versus lower TTCs (TTCs = 3 s; RT HO = 1.286 s). There was slightly more uncertainty regarding the direction and magnitude of the effect that time budget had on hand-on steering wheel reaction time. This was reflected in the , which indicated a 97% probability that the effect was positive (see 
Table 2
), and in the 95% CIs ( = .140, [CI: -.016, .299]) which highlighted that some of the most probable parameter values for the effect of time budget could be near 0.  
Model set ups in equations 2 and 3 proposed that was Skew-Normally distributed and Log-Normally distributed, respectively. denoted the post-takeover manual driving metric, specified the condition of each variable, specified the participant, and corresponded to the variance and covariance parameters.


Mean deceleration ( D )
Posterior predictions highlighted that time budget had a substantial effect on braking behaviour following a TOR (see 
Table 3
). Mean deceleration rates were predicted to be smaller when time budgets were larger (TTC = 5 s; D = -1.704 m/s 2 ) versus when time budgets were smaller (TTC = 3 s; -3.222 m/s 2 ) (MER M D = 1.518, [CI: 1.137, 1.880]) (see 
Figure 6
). This suggested that drivers initiated harsher decelerations when time budgets were smaller. Model estimates predicted no consistent or substantial effects of cognitive load on mean decelerations.

Mean lateral acceleration (M LA )
The posterior predictions highlighted a fully crossed interaction between cognitive load and time budget for the effect of mean lateral acceleration. For the critical events with small time budgets (TTC = 3 s), mean lateral accelerations were higher when drivers were not cognitively loaded (M LA = 0.259 m/s 2 ) versus then drivers were cognitively loaded (M LA = 0.209 m/s 2 ).
Conversely, when time budgets were large (TTC = 5 s) mean lateral accelerations were larger when drivers were cognitively loaded (M LA = 0.259 m/s 2 ) versus when they were not (M LA = 0.211 m/s 2 ) (see 
Figure 7
). Whilst this effect was small (an approximate .1 m/s 2 flip across the conditions) it was consistent, with high confidence regarding the probability of direction (see 
Table 4
). This effect implied that for small time budgets, steering manoeuvres were less aggressive when drivers were cognitively loaded. Conversely, when time budgets were higher, drivers who were cognitively loaded produced more aggressive steering manoeuvres.   The coefficient posterior means and 95% CIs alongside the probability of direction are shown in 
Table 5
. The model estimates predicted that the SD LP was lower when TTCs were higher  


Standard deviation of lane position (SD LP )


Gaze behaviours


Model fitting
The standard deviation of horizontal gaze (SD YAW ) was calculated for a 30 s period before the takeover (i.e., during hands-off L2 automation) and a 30 s period following the takeover (i.e.,
during manual driving). The pre-takeover SD YAW was positively skewed, and thus was modelled via a Log-Normal distribution. A parameter modelling the effect of time budget was not necessary because the critical event had not unfolded and thus had no bearing on the drivers gaze behaviour. All pre-takeover data referred to trials with a lead vehicle, as these were the same trials where critical events took place. As such, the model was parameterised with parameters representing an intercept ( 0 ) and the influence of N-back ( ):
~ ( , ) = ( 0 + 0 ) + ( + ) [ 0 ]~ ([ 0 ] , ) = ( 0 2 0 0 2 )
(4)
For post-takeover SD YAW , the data were distributed more normally however initial modelling revealed that the model was predicting negative SD YAW values on some occasions (see supplemental material for more information on this). As SD YAW is a measure of variation in eye movements, it cannot be negative and thus to combat this, it was a modelled with a truncated Normal distribution with the lower bound set as 0 ( = 0). Paramertisation for posttakeover gaze behaviours included an intercept ( 0 ), a parameter for the effect of N-back (when ∈ {0, 1}, ), a parameter for the effect of time budget (when ∈ {0, 1}, ), and the interaction term ( , ); this was the same as the post-takeover manual driving and response  
Table 6
. The model predicted with high certainty that the dispersion in horizontal gaze was reduced when drivers were cognitively loaded during hands-off L2 automated driving. Predictions implied by the model parameters indicated that this effect was large; the standard deviation of horizontal gaze was more than 4° fewer (MER SD YAW = -4.559, .138]) when cognitively loaded (5.438°) versus when only monitoring the road environment (9.998°). This is further highlighted in 
Figure 9
;
contour plots show the average distribution of gaze during 30 s of automated driving before a TOR when drivers were just monitoring the road (A) versus when they were completing the Nback task (B).  concentration towards the location approximated to be the road centre, and there was a reduction in the dispersion of gaze across the horizontal axis. It should also be noted that there was less gaze concentration towards the approximate locations of the rear-view and wing mirrors during the cognitive load condition. The culmination of these effects resulted in an overall reduction in SD YAW when cognitively loaded during hands-off L2 automation.

The model parameters also suggested that cognitive load may have had some carry over effects on horizontal gaze dispersion, resulting in decreases in SD YAW during manual driving periods that follow automated driving during high cognitive load (SD YAW = 9.793) versus monitoring the road environment (SD YAW = 10.552) (MER SD YAW = -.758, [CI: -1.919,

However, given the uncertainty associated with this estimation and the small size of the effect, it cannot be stated with reasonable confidence whether cognitive load produced positive or negative carryover effects in SD YAW during post-takeover manual driving.   the dashboard area for information pertaining to status of the automated system.

Figure 11
 also highlights that the distribution of gaze was slightly more constrained towards the approximate location of the road centre following events with larger time budgets (TTC = 5 s). Despite the model parameters alluding to possible carryover effects of cognitive load-induced visual tunneling from automated to manual driving, this was not visually clear in the average gaze distribution plots in 
Figure 11
. One explanation for this disparity could be variability across the sample. It is possible that whilst some drivers exhibited carryover effects, others driver did not and thus the average gaze distribution plots highlights no evidence for it. A common heuristic used to judge the heterogeneity of an effect is the relative size of the random effect ( ) in relation to the fixed effect ( ) of a multilevel model 
(Bolger et al, 2019)
. 
Bolger et al (2019)
 proposed that if the standard deviation of the effect was .25, or greater, of the average (fixed) effect, the variability of the effect may be worthy of note. For the posttakeover SD YAW model, the relative size for the effect of cognitive load on SD YAW was = 2.32. This indicated that variance in the effect of N-back on post-takeover SD YAW was double the size of the average effect, which suggested a high level of variation for the effect of cognitive load on horizontal gaze dispersion during post-takeover manual driving.
This was further highlighted in the strip plot in 
Figure 12A
. Some drivers (highlighted red) had average reductions in SD YAW in the region of 2°. Conversely other drivers (highlighted green) showed no differences in their horizontal gaze dispersion whether they were cognitively loaded during automated driving, or not. The implications of these effects are highlighted in panels B and C in 
Figure 12
  These participants had reduced horizontal dispersion of gaze during manual driving following trials where they completed the N-back during hands-off L2 automation.


Discussion
This study aimed to investigate whether cognitive load and the time budget of a rear-end scenario influenced the timing and quality of takeover performance, and whether these factors influence gaze behaviours during post-takeover manual control. In general, the time budget of the situation had the largest impact on the timing and quality of takeovers. Takeovers were faster, and post-takeover manual driving performance was more erratic, following events with smaller time budgets. N-back-induced cognitive load did not have strong effects on takeover performance. There was potential evidence of carryover effects of cognitive load on eye movements during the manual drive following a takeover; the model predicted a 90% probability that horizontal gaze dispersion decreased during manual driving following high cognitive load during automated driving. However, given the uncertainty associated with the estimate, neither the direction of this effect, nor it's magnitude, can be stated with any reasonable certainty. Except for a small interaction effect between cognitive load and time budgets on mean lateral accelerations, the remaining timing (RT B , RT HO ), lateral (SD LP ), and longitudinal (M D ) measures of takeover quality revealed no statistical effects of cognitive load, supporting previous research in the area 
(Choi et al, 2020;
Wan & Wu, 2018;
.
The interaction effect between cognitive load and time budget on mean lateral accelerations implied that when time budgets were small (TTC = 3 s), cognitively loaded drivers produced less aggressive steering responses. Conversely, when time budgets were large (TTC = 5 s) cognitively loaded drivers produced more aggressive steering responses. An interesting aspect to this result was that the interaction was dis-ordinal, whereby the effect of one independent variable (i.e., cognitive load) on mean lateral acceleration was reversed based on the levels of the other independent variable (i.e., time budget). One explanation for this could be that whilst drivers had more time to respond when time budgets were longer, their increased cognitive load delayed the reallocation of cognitive resources towards decision making regarding their response. Consequently, drivers had to produce more erratic steering to avoid a potential collision. When time budgets were smaller, a driver who was monitoring the road (and thus potentially had more cognitive resources available for decision making) may have tried to immediately avoid a collision. In doing so, these drivers may have produced more aggressive steering manoeuvres whereas a cognitively loaded driver may have been content with only braking to reduce the imminent danger of the lead vehicle. Building on from this proposal, it might be possible that a combination of a small time budget and high cognitive load made drivers more aware of being out of the loop and thus less likely to attempt an evasive (and potentially more dangerous) steering response that, in turn, would produce higher mean lateral accelerations. 
Choi et al (2020)
 found evidence that drivers who reported higher subjective cognitive load produced more optimal takeover responses in critical situations, implying that a driver's awareness of being cognitively loaded resulted in more anticipatory responses.
The principal prediction of the CCH is that high cognitive load selectively impairs driving subtasks that rely upon cognitive control leaving automatised performance unaffected . Whether this hypothesis applies to takeover performance and more generally, automated driving, is an open question. However, the CCH may be a useful framework for understanding why high cognitive load did not negatively impact the timing or quality of takeovers in the current experiment. Braking in response to rear-end conflicts may be deemed automatised; the CCH would therefore predict that performance would be unaffected by cognitive load. The automatised nature of rear-end conflict responses derives from the strong neural pathways that detect looming. The visual system of insects 
(Peron et al, 2009)
, avians 
(Sun et al, 1998;
Wu et al, 2005)
, and mammals 
(Wu et al, 2005
) is primed to detect looming. The subcortical structures involved in this process facilitate the modulation of motor and visual processing that inform rapid responses to this potentially threatening stimulus 
(Billington et al, 2010)
. Rear-end conflicts produce strong looming signals from the lead vehicle 
(Markkula et al, 2016)
, hence the higher cognitive functionalities that N-back aims to load may not be required for the comparatively simpler response of avoiding a looming lead vehicle. If the CCH is indeed transferable to takeover performance, one prediction would be that higher cognitive load should negatively impact takeover behaviours that rely upon The inclusion of higher automation levels likely inflates the influence of time budget as there is less (or no) onus on the driver to visually monitor the road environment. In general, the current findings support previous research highlighting that reaction times (specifically brake reaction times) in response to rear-end emergencies are strongly determined by the environmental context such visual looming and the kinematics of the situation 
(Markkula et al, 2016
).


The reduction in horizontal gaze dispersion as a function of cognitive load during hands-off
Level 2 automation was very high -an average reduction of over 4° in the SD YAW relative to monitoring the road. This is double the size of effects found in manual driving 
(Reimer et al, 2009;
. One explanation for this could be that driver gaze tends to be more dispersed during automated driving  which resulted in a larger reduction in gaze dispersion when cognitively loaded. A useful takeaway for DMS designers is the pattern of SD YAW following a takeover. The model of post-takeover SD YAW predicted a 90% probability that gaze concentration continued to be constrained during manual driving following driver engagement with a cognitive load task during hands-off Level 2 automated driving. Some of the plausible parameter values for the carryover effect include reductions of SD YAW up to 2°;
this is a similar magnitude to previous research on the effects of cognitive load relative to a noload during manual driving 
(Reimer et al, 2009;
. The heterogeneity intervals imply that some drivers in the population could have carryover effects of up to 4° reductions in SD YAW following cognitively loaded automated driving periods. This indicates that cognitive load on driver state may carry over to post-transition manual control, however some factors must be considered. Firstly, the group level effects implied by the model indicated that the effect of cognitive load on post-transition SD YAW were very variable. Whilst heterogeneity intervals predicted that some drivers would have strong carryover effects, the intervals also implied that some drivers would demonstrate no carryover effects at all. Driver age could be a factor that influences this metric; we found that age predicted the variability in the effect that cognitive load had on the dispersion and randomness of gaze transitions during automated driving 
(Goodridge et al, 2024)
. Furthermore, despite this potential carryover effect, cognitive load did not substantially influence post-takeover driving performance. Therefore, empirical tests still need to establish whether changes in eye movements caused by cognitive load have longerlasting effects on driving performance following takeovers, especially when considering the current study only used 30 s of manual driving data.
A strength of this work is that the modelling technique used takes into account the distribution of the response variables, which allows for improved model fits and improved predictions of driver takeover responses. A specific example of this is the Shifted Log Normal distribution for response times. This distribution included a shift parameter (δ) that effectively modeled "nondecision time" of takeovers. Non-decision time refers to time taken up by processes such as perceptual encoding and motor coordination 
(Evans & Wagenmakers, 2019)
. The model developed in this manuscript provides an additional step of mechanistic plausibility when using statistical models to understand takeover behaviours. The inclusion of a latent parameter that models non-decision time allows for the decomposition of the decision-making process 
(Mulder & van Maanen, 2013)
. As such, researchers can assess changes in the underlying cognitive processes that contribute towards a response, rather than indirectly inferring changes via raw variables such as mean response time 
(Evans & Wagenmakers, 2019)
. However, the current manuscript only modelled non-decision time for the overall distribution of hands-on time (δ = .462) and brake reaction time (δ = .457). At the very least, future research might want to investigate the extent to which non-decision time varies within the population, and/or whether cognitive load and time budget influence the non-decision time during the takeover process. Such an analysis would be particularly beneficial for research designs that involve a decision-making process rather than automatised responses to looming rear-end scenarios. For example, paradigms that focus on lane changes or hazard perception and thus require the driver to make critical decisions based on the predicted movements of other road users. As mentioned above, these behaviours may rely more on cognitive control and thus are potentially more likely to be susceptible to the loading of cognitive resources.
A potential limitation of the current work might be the perceived unrealistic nature of the traffic conflict. For example, vehicles on the market today with L2 functionality also have Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Automatic Emergency Braking capabilities to address rear-end conflicts. According to Euro NCAP, car-to-car rear impacts are among the most frequent types of road accidents, often resulting from driver distraction or misjudgement. The current study selected a car-to-car rear moving (CCRm) scenario; a critical test scenario used by Euro NCAP to evaluate the performance of FCW and AEB systems. However, to focus on assessing driver reactions, these assistance systems were excluded from the driving scenario. Typically, FCW activates at 3 to 3.5 seconds time-to-collision (TTC), which would interfere with our test parameters. Furthermore, the inclusion of FCW and AEB would not contribute additional value, as the primary objective of this study was to measure driver reaction time and takeover performance at early stages.
In conclusion, results from this study suggest that time budget, not N-back induced cognitive load, influenced takeover performance. Drivers were faster to react when time budgets were small, but their post-takeover manual control of the vehicle was more variable. Cognitive load had no effect on takeover timing or performance, which may be due to the scenario used. In other words, the rear-end critical event has a simple response remit: which is to brake quickly and heavily. Therefore, an overtaking scenario might be better for testing the detrimental effects of cognitive load on decision making tasks in driving, given the shifting of attentional resources

Lead vehicles entered from the left lane and matched the ego vehicle's speed at a distance of 25 m. After 2 minutes of automated driving, the lead vehicle decelerated at 5.55 / 2 (TTC = 3 s) or 2 / 2 (TTC = 5 s) for critical trials. For non-critical trials, a TOR was delivered but the lead vehicle did not decelerate.

These icons were used to indicate system status. A green steering wheel indicated the that the automated system (SAE Level 2) was activated. When a TOR was issued, the red steering wheel flashed, indicating that the driver needed to take over. This flashing continued until the vehicle was back into manual driving mode. During manual driving, the steering wheel was greyed out.


steering wheel time (RT HO ) referred to the time from the TOR until the driver placed their hands on the steering wheel. The population mean, , of these response time metrics was modelled via a linear combination of an intercept ( 0 ), N-back ( , ), time budget ( , ), and an interaction term between these variables( ,  ). The N-back task was parameterised as ∈ {0, 1} where = 1 corresponds to the presence of the N-back during hands-off Level 2 automation. Time budget was parameterised as ∈ {0, 1} where = 1 corresponds to the influence of a TTC = 5 s event. The model structure is defined as follows:

C) Marginal Effect at the Representative value (MER) of time budget on ( (SD LP ), mean lateral accelerations (M LA ), and mean decelerations (M D ) were used to assess post-takeover manual driving performance. SD LP was computed by taking the standard deviation of lane position during 30 s of manual driving once the vehicle was in manual driving mode. Mean lateral accelerations and mean decelerations were calculated during the same 30 s period. This is in line with previous research that has focused on driving performance during the first 60 s post-automation (Melnicuk et al, 2021; Merat et al, 2014; Samani et al, 2022). Mean deceleration had unique distributional properties whereby the distribution was negatively skewed and was comprised of negative values. To account for this, mean deceleration was modelled using a skew normal distribution. Skew normal distributions include an extra parameter, , that generalizes the normal distribution to allow for non-zero skewness.

This suggested that lateral control of the vehicle was more variable following a critical event with a TTC of 3 s. Once again, there was no consistent or substantial effects of cognitive load on lane position variability following the takeover.

This is indicative of drivers checking

. The average gaze distribution of participants who demonstrated no carryover effects are similar during post-takeover manual driving, regardless of completing Nback or monitoring of the road environment. Conversely, participants estimated to have strong carryover effects show indications of visual tunneling in post-takeover manual driving following automated driving whilst cognitively loaded.

cognitive control. For example, the decision-making elements involved in commanded lane changes are said to rely on cognitive control because changing to a specified lane based on roadside commands is a non-practiced task (Engström et al, 2017). It stands to reason that commands to change lane following periods of system monitoring, in addition to drivers being out-of-the-loop (Mole et al 2019; Merat et al 2019), may similarly be non-practiced and thus susceptible to poor performance under high cognitive load. Whilst cognitive load had no influence on takeover reaction times, event criticality heavily influenced the speed of driver reactions. An average difference in brake reaction time of .13 s between severe (3 s) and less severe TTCs (5 s) translates into an extra 4 metres before the brake was applied when travelling at 70 MPH. Furthermore, the upper bounds of the model credible intervals indicate that the effect could be even higher, resulting in drivers travelling an extra 7.76 metres before brakes were applied, demonstrating the practical relevance of this modelling. Whilst previous studies have found larger effects of time budget on takeover time, these meta-analyses have focused on an amalgamation of Levels 2-4 (McDonald et al, 2019).
