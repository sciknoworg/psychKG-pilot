You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Differences in Cooperation and Reputation Formation in Heterogeneous and Homogeneous Groups in Public Goods Dilemmas
Cooperation is pivotal for group development, and for the production, and maintenance of public goods 
(De Dreu et al., 2024;
Olson, 1971)
. However, research consistently indicates that diversity and group heterogeneity can reduce public goods contributions and make sustained cooperation difficult to achieve 
(Alesina et al., 1999;
Jackson, 2013)
, which can be related to the human tendency of forming homogenic clusters 
(McPherson, 2001)
. For example, 
Habyarimana et al. (2007)
 found that ethnic diversity undermines public goods provision due to weakened in-group reciprocity norms and sanctioning mechanisms. In homogeneous communities, strong social norms and the ability to easily identify and punish non-contributors, termed "findability," lead to higher levels of cooperation. Conversely, these mechanisms are less effective in diverse communities, resulting in reduced public goods provision.
However, there is still a lack of answers regarding not only why heterogeneity would lead to higher levels of cooperation but what variables or individual traits would create that effect.
We know that traits like age, gender, and race, in their phenotypic representations, affect interaction patterns and cooperation likelihood 
(Axelrod, 1984)
, and their inclusion in experimental tasks can alter cooperative dynamics 
(Sampaio et al., 2023)
. For example, 
Sampaio et al. (2023)
 found that the mere insertion of co-players' face photographs in a public goods game made people react less negatively to bad reputations in public goods dilemmas. However, as pointed out by the authors, little is known as to why faces would have this effect. One possibility is that photographs could reveal such traits of the co-players' to the decision-maker and that those traits would modulate the response to reputational scores. However, the authors did not control the apparent traits of the co-players' (e.g. race, age, and gender). This leads us to our main experimental question: when Mary identifies John Doe, she usually assigns labels pertaining to his age, gender, and race, but would these traits influence how she interprets his actions and forms her impressions of him? Would John's reputation be influenced not only by his actions but also by his identity markers?
It is important to consider that the formation of stereotypes and beliefs is often linked to homophily, the tendency for similar individuals to interact with each other more than with dissimilar ones, significantly shaping social interactions and group formation 
(McPherson et al., 2001
). In addition, when forming groups, individuals tend to categorise others into specific groups, minimising differences within their group while exaggerating those between groups, leading to the "out-group homogeneity effect" 
(Ostrom & Sedikides, 1992)
. This perception makes out-group members appear more alike than those in the in-group, who are seen as more diverse.
Besides that, individuals typically attribute more positive traits to their own group, a phenomenon known as "in-group favouritism" 
(Brewer, 1979;
Tajfel & Turner, 2004)
.
The effects of these traits on cooperation are probably also linked to reciprocity dynamics. The emergence and evolution of cooperative behaviours significantly depend on reciprocity, a core mechanism in human social interaction 
(Gouldner, 1960;
Rand & Nowak, 2013)
. Reciprocity in cooperation involves responding positively to others' prosocial behaviour and also punishing free-riders. This reciprocity can be direct 
(Trivers, 1971)
, when you reciprocate someone's behaviour towards yourself, or indirect 
(Nowak & Sigmund, 1998)
, when you reciprocate someone's behaviour toward someone else.
For indirect reciprocity to exert its role in cooperative behaviour effectively, reputation is the crucial factor 
(Nowak & Sigmund, 1998)
. Reputation can be understood in its simplest form as the probability that someone will have a certain observed type or will take a certain action 
(Camerer, 2003)
 or as the observation of a partner's behaviour 
(Roberts et al., 2021)
; however, in order to differentiate it from personal opinions, reputation is usually assumed to be shared beliefs about someone 
(Emler, 1990)
. The main mechanisms used for the spread of these 'shared beliefs' are direct observation and gossip 
(Wu et al., 2016)
. However, in the absence of specific information about a person, a reputation can be inferred from social group membership 
(Stanley et al., 2012)
. Building on this idea, when specific information about an individual is lacking, people often rely on general traits associated with their social group to form perceptions 
(Tajfel, 1969)
. These group-based assumptions can shape reputations, much like how shared beliefs about someone emerge 
(Stanley et al., 2012)
. As a consequence, traits such as race, gender, or age can not only serve as the basis for reputational judgments when other details are unavailable but also modulate the way people's actions are interpreted. This highlights how group membership can significantly influence how reputations are constructed in social contexts.
Being associated with a stigmatised group can negatively impact a person's reputation; simply being connected to or seen with members of such groups can result in others viewing them unfavourably 
(Dovidio et al., 2006)
. This association often leads to negative judgments, as societal biases and stereotypes influence perceptions and individuals may discriminate against interaction partners based on these traits 
(Lane, 2016)
. Research shows that these facial traits, such as race, often carry implicit stereotypes that modulate perception 
(Ofan et al., 2011;
Ratner & Amodio, 2013)
, suggesting that such stereotypes may significantly affect how individuals perceive the actions of others.
Social beliefs pertaining to age, gender, and race likely play a significant role in shaping how we perceive reputations and influencing reciprocity in cooperative interactions. Individuals often evaluate those within their own group more leniently than those in out-groups ). These social categories not only reinforce stereotypes but also affect perceptions of reputation and responses to others' actions. For example, traits commonly associated with certain age groups or races might be automatically ascribed to individuals from those groups, often overlooking their personal qualities or past behaviour. Despite their apparently phenotypic simplicity, characteristics such as age, gender, and race may significantly impact the social construction of reputation, potentially overshadowing objective assessments of a person's actions and abilities. We propose a study to further investigate how similarity based on these categories (age, gender, and race) affects perceptions of cooperation and its reciprocation across different groups.


Our research
Our research aimed to investigate how group composition (e.g. heterogeneous vs homogeneous) affects perceptions of cooperative behaviour across different groups.
Past research has shown that variables like age, gender, and race influence group formation and prosocial behaviour towards group members 
(Axelrod, 1984;
McPherson et al., 2001
). Furthermore, social distance can affect how prosocial behaviours are perceived; for example, an offer in an UG from a friend may be seen as fairer than an identical offer from a stranger 
(Campanhã et al., 2011)
. Our study comprises three investigations, each focusing on one variable -race (Study 1), gender (Study 2), and age (Study 3) -to assess how these factors influence cooperation dynamics in a Public Goods Game (PGG). Our version of this game involves 10 rounds with the same pre-programmed co-players in all rounds categorised as either similar (same age, gender, or race as the participant) or dissimilar (different age, gender, or race), all cooperating at an identical rate. We sought to determine if reputation perceptions and reciprocation vary based on the similarities shared between participants and their co-players in the PGG.
We hypothesised that participants would perceive similar co-players as more cooperative and less likely to free-ride compared to the dissimilar ones (H1). We also anticipated behaviour in the PGG to vary by group status, with more cooperation towards similar members and less towards dissimilar members (H2). Study 3 added a hypothesis (H3) regarding age, studies show that homophilic similarity tends to diminish over time, suggesting it would more strongly affect younger participants' perceptions of cooperation. The hypotheses and analysis for all three studies have been pre-registered and are available at the following link: https://osf.io/89yqs. Data and code can be found at the following link: https://osf.io/vdqcp. We report all manipulations, measures, and exclusions in these studies.


Methods


Study 1 -Racial Group Composition


Participants
We aimed to investigate the influence of race similarity on participants' perception and reciprocation on cooperation in the PGG. Since one of our main variables is the perception that participants have on the co-players behaviour, we referred to the study by 
Campanhã et al. (2011)
, which used a similar method and initially considered a large effect size (d = 1.3). However, for a more conservative and methodologically appropriate estimate, we chose a medium effect size (f = 0.25) for our sample size calculations.
Using the R package 'pwr' and the 'pwr.anova.test()' function, we calculated the need for 30 participants per group across 8 groups to achieve 80% power, assuming a 0.05 significance level and 0.25 effect size. We set a target of 40 participants per group to allow for potential dropouts or exclusions. 320 Brazilian participants were initially divided based on their self-reported race (Black or White); subsequently, they were randomly assigned to eight different experimental groups that varied both in relation to the race of the participant (similar or dissimilar), and in relation to the type of behaviour of the group with which the participant played a PGG (cooperative or free-rider). Data from 52 participants were excluded for failing attention checks, responding to less than 50% of the PGG trials, providing inconsistent answers to the questions about their race, or having non-Brazilian IP addresses. Detailed demographics and interactions are outlined in 
Table 1
. Online consent was obtained from the participants before enrollment in the study, and the protocol was approved in advance by the Ethics Committee of Mackenzie Presbyterian University (CAAE: 18180919.0.0000.0084), in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments. 


Instruments


Public Goods Game
We chose a four-player iterated PGG similar to the one used by Sampaio et al.
(2023), conducted online using PsyToolkit 
(Stoet, 2010
(Stoet, , 2017
. In this game, each player, along with their usual three co-players, receives a monetary amount that can either be contributed to a public fund (to cooperate) or kept in their individual account (to defect or free-ride), as illustrated in 
Figure 1
. When all players decide about their contribution to the public fund, the group's total earnings are maximised and equally shared among all players. In our version, the co-players' identities and responses were pre-programmed, and participants were informed via an instruction screen that they would not interact in real-time but would see pre-recorded contributions. Their responses would be anonymously recorded for potential future use, as stated in the instructions: "Likewise, your responses will be anonymously recorded and may be used in future studies." The game, comprising 10 rounds, kept the number of rounds undisclosed to maintain uncertainty, a typical element in economic games 
(Luce & Raiffa, 1989)
. Participants interacted with the same three co-players, represented by facial photos, throughout the game. The only phenotypic characteristic consistent among the three co-players was race; gender varied randomly, and their ages ranged from 18 to 40 years old. Study 1 featured co-players who were all Black or all White, using racially validated images from the Chicago Face Database (CFD) 
(Ma et al., 2015)
, and were preliminarily validated to ensure they were perceived as Brazilians (see Supplemental Materials for details).
Each round gave participants a fictional amount of R$ 8 (Brazilian reais) to retain or contribute to a public fund. Contributions were doubled and redistributed evenly among players. Feedback screens after each round displayed the contributions of each player, the fund's total, and individual earnings. Co-player behaviour was preprogrammed: in cooperative groups, co-players cooperated 90% of the time, while in non-cooperative groups they displayed free-rider behaviour 90% of the time. Each trial included four screens: the initial screen revealed players' identities and choices to keep or contribute money, followed by three feedback screens. These displayed the decisions of other players, the total fund, and fund distribution, each for 3 seconds (see Supplemental Materials for details). Note. Illustration created by the authors. In our three studies, we used face photographs chosen to meet the criteria of each experimental manipulation (age, gender, and race). 'Keep' and 'Give' represent the buttons that participants must click to decide whether to contribute to the public fund or not.


Reputation Perception Scale
After the PGG rounds, participants rated the perceived reputation of their group on a 6-point Likert scale from '0' (Not cooperative at all) to '5' (Very cooperative).
We used this measure to assess the shared beliefs of the participants about the group they were playing with.


Dictator Game
Post-reputation assessment, all participants played a round of the Dictator Game (DG) to measure their generosity 
(Forsythe et al., 1994)
. Participants were given R$ 100 and could choose how to divide between themselves and another non-specified individual, reflecting their generosity.


Procedure
Offerwise Brazil (https://www.offerwise.com/), a company specialised in data collection, recruited participants and collected data for all three online studies.
Initially, sociodemographic data was gathered, selecting only participants who self-identified as White or Black. All participants played 10 rounds of a four-player iterated PGG. Participants were allocated to different groups based on their race and the group behaviour, as previously reported. After the PGG, participants assessed group reputation, completed an attention check, and played a round of the DG. The experiment concluded with a debriefing where participants learned that all co-players were simulated, not real.


Statistical Analysis
All analyses were pre-registered (https://osf.io/89yqs). We recorded participants' decisions in each PGG round, coded as 'Response' with '0' for 'Free-ride' and '1' for 'Cooperate.' We identified outliers in the Reputation Scale and Dictator Game using the interquartile range (IQR) method, marking responses outside 1.5 times the IQR from the quartiles as outliers and were corrected as the IQR method.
For H1, we conducted an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to explore the impact of group type (dissimilar cooperative, dissimilar free-rider, similar cooperative, similar free-rider) on reputation evaluations, with post-hoc tests using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction. We also tested if the response on the DG could explain the reputation evaluations among groups.
For H2, we fitted a logistic mixed model using the 'glmer' function from the 'lme4' package 
(Bates et al., 2015)
. The formula was: Response in PGG~Condition + (1|ID/Group), excluding the first response to control for lack of prior feedback and, therefore, the impossibility of reciprocity. Analysis adjusted intercept for the White participants playing with White Cooperative co-players and calculated 95% confidence intervals and p-values using the Wald approximation, all performed in R (version 4.3.1) (R Core Team, 2022).


Results


Reputation Perception
Overall, reputation scores aligned with the cooperative and non-cooperative conditions (see 
Figure 2
). ANOVA indicated a significant group effect on reputation with a large effect size, F(7, 242) = 16.62, p < .001, (ɳp² = .32, 95% CI [.24, 1.00]).
However, contribution in the Dictator Game did not significantly explained the reputation scores attributed in groups, F(1, 242) = .12, p = .730, indicating no substantial impact from individual decisions in this game on the perception of reputation (ɳp² = .01, 95% CI [0.00, 1.00]). Post-hoc tests with FDR adjustment revealed significant differences between non-cooperative and cooperative conditions, with no clear impact from similar versus dissimilar group dynamics on reputation, rejecting H1 for this study.


Predicting cooperation from condition
We applied a logistic mixed model to predict cooperation, using White  
Figure 2)
. Except for the difference detected on the W-BC, which significantly differed from the intercept (W-WC), showing that White participants reciprocated more to white cooperative co-players than to Black cooperative co-players, no consistent intergroup effect was detected, leading to the rejection of H2 for this study. participant counts (n) and mean age (SD), are in 
Table 2
.  


Instruments
Instruments mirrored Study 1, using the PGG via PsyToolkit 
(Stoet, 2010
(Stoet, , 2017
, with pre-programmed co-players' responses. Participants played 10 rounds with three co-players represented by facial photos, maintaining consistent gender within groups. Reputation was assessed on a 6-point Likert scale post-PGG, and generosity measured via the DG.


Procedure
Recruitment, sampling, and data collection followed Study 1, coordinated by Offerwise Brazil. Participants were grouped by gender homophily dynamics (similar/dissimilar) and co-players behaviour (cooperative/free-rider). After the PGG and reputation assessment, participants underwent an attention check and the DG, followed by a debriefing where they were informed that co-players were simulated.


Statistical Analysis
Pre-registered analyses tested the relationship between group types and reputation evaluation (H1) using ANOVA with FDR correction, similar to Study 1. H2
was tested using a logistic mixed model ('glmer' function from the 'lme4' package) to assess the impact of gender-based homophily and cooperative behaviour on PGG cooperation. All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.3.1).


Results


Reputation Perception
Overall, reputation scores aligned with cooperative and non-cooperative co-player conditions. ANOVA results revealed a significant group effect on reputation, F(7, 271) = 20.65, p < .001, with a large effect size (ɳp² = .35, 95% CI [0.26, 1.00]).
However, the impact of the DG on reputation was not significant, F(1, 271) = 0.15, p =
.699, with a very small effect size (ɳp² = < .001, 95% CI [0.00, 1.00]), suggesting no influence from individual decisions in this game on reputation perception. Post-hoc analyses with FDR adjustment demonstrated similar results to Study 1, with significant differences between non-cooperative and cooperative conditions but minimal impact from similar versus dissimilar group dynamics on reputation, also rejecting H1 for this study.


Predicting cooperation from condition
We used a logistic mixed model with maximum likelihood estimation and the Nelder-Mead optimizer, analysing Group as a predictor. Regarding the random effects, had a non-significant positive effect (beta = 0.10, 95% CI 
[-0.49, 0.69]
, p = .739; and Group (F-MNC) showed a significant positive effect (beta = 1.00, 95% CI [0.39, 1.60], p = .001; Std. beta = -1.00, 95% CI 
[-1.60, -0.39]
). Standardised betas and confidence intervals were computed using a Wald z-distribution approximation, reflecting the standardised dataset model fit. Therefore, there was no difference in reciprocity generated by intergroup characteristics, rejecting H2 for this study.  Group details, including participant counts (n) and mean age (SD), are in 
Table 3
. 


Instruments
Study 3 employed the same instruments as Studies 1 and 2, notably the PGG, implemented using a modified version via PsyToolkit 
(Stoet, 2010
(Stoet, , 2017
. The same photos were edited to vary the ages of the photographed individuals in order to keep facial expressions consistent, simulating young and elderly groups. Reputation was assessed using a 6-point Likert scale post-PGG, and generosity was measured via the DG.


Procedure
The procedure for Study 3 closely followed that of the earlier two studies, with modifications for age-based homophily. Participants were divided into two age groups:
elderly (60 and above) and young (18-22), and interacted with co-players represented in age-manipulated photos. Recruitment, sampling, and data collection methods remained consistent with the previous two studies to ensure methodological continuity.


Statistical Analysis
As in Studies 1 and 2, pre-registered analyses explored the effects of group types on reputation (H1) and the influence of age-based homophily on cooperation in the PGG (H2). Using the same type of analysis we also tested the hypothesis that homophily would more strongly affect younger participants' perceptions. Analytical methods were aligned with those used in the previous studies.


Results


Reputation Perception
ANOVA results revealed a significant group effect on reputation, F(7, 288) = 25.36, p < .001, with a large effect size (ɳp² = .38, 95% CI [0.30, 1.00]). Additionally, the impact of the Dictator Game on reputation was significant, F(1, 288) = 4.79, p = .029, with a small effect size (ɳp² = .02, 95% CI [8.62e-04, 1.00]), suggesting a minor influence from individual decisions in this game on reputation perception. Post-hoc tests using FDR adjustment showed significant differences between cooperative and non-cooperative conditions. Three significant results involving participants' intergroup dynamics were found. Young participants playing with Young Cooperative co-players (Y-YC) differ significantly on the reputation evaluation from Elderly participants playing with Elderly Cooperative co-players (E-EC) (t(288) = 2.58, p = .017). The effect estimate was 0.83 with a standard error of 0.30, with mean scores of 4.42 (SD = 0.69) for Y-YC and 3.65 (SD = 1.25) for E-EC, showing that Elderly participants evaluate their similar co-players' cooperation less negatively than Young participants.
Also, Young participants playing with Young Non-Cooperative co-players (Y-YNC) differ significantly on the reputation evaluation from Elderly participants playing with Elderly Non-Cooperative co-players (E-ENC) (t(288) = -2.30, p = .031).
The effect estimate was -0.71 with a standard error of 0.31, with mean scores of 1.73
(SD = 1.22) for Y-YNC and 2.33 (SD = 1.25) for E-ENC, showing that Young participants evaluate their similar co-players' non-cooperation more negatively than Elderly participants.
Young participants playing with Elderly Non-Cooperative co-players (Y-ENC)
differ significantly on the reputation evaluation from Elderly participants playing with Young Non-Cooperative co-players (E-YNC) (t(288) = -2.31, p = .031). The effect estimate was -0.68 with a standard error of 0.29, with mean scores of 1.65 (SD = 1.57) for Y-ENC and 2.33 (SD = 1.72) for E-YNC. This shows that Young participants evaluate their similar co-players' non-cooperation more negatively than Elderly participants. As in studies 1 and 2 there was no significant result that explicitly showed a homophily effect where the same group (Y or E) evaluated their co-players differently based on their shared characteristic. For example, the comparisons in the Y-YC versus Y-EC, Y-YNC versus Y-ENC, E-EC versus E-YC or E-ENC versus E-YNC were all non-significant.


Predicting cooperation from condition
We utilised a logistic mixed model to assess the influence of Group on Response.
Regarding the random effects, the Group:ID variance is 0.64 (SD: 0.80), and ID variance is 0.57 (SD: 0.75). The model revealed a non-significant intercept (Group = Y-YC) at 0.29 (95% CI 
[-0.16, 0.74
 (beta = -0.13, 95% CI 
[-0.75, 0.48]
, p = .676, demonstrated non-significant effects.
Standardized parameters were computed based on a standardized dataset model fit, with 95% CIs and p-values derived using a Wald z-distribution approximation. 


Discussion
In three studies, we investigated whether homophily based on age, gender, and race affects perceived reputation and reciprocity in cooperative behaviour. To our knowledge, this research is the first to experimentally test the direct effects of different forms of homophily identification in group-based cooperation utilising the PGG. Contrary to our initial hypotheses, similarity composition did not modulate reputation perception across all three studies in a consistent manner. Although specific differences in reciprocity were observed, they were primarily linked to varying degrees of leniency or severity in responses to non-cooperators, rather than a consistent in-group bias, except for race. Race significantly influenced the cooperative behaviour of White participants, who cooperated more with their similar cooperative co-players compared to Black cooperative co-players.
Homophily has been evolutionarily important for the management of resources and the protection of the group 
(McPherson et al., 2001)
. The effect of homophily on cooperation has been suggested to be due to an absence or incapacity to reciprocate to those who are different, by creating a difficulty to findability 
(Habyarimana et al., 2007)
. However, in contemporary societies, individuals who are very dissimilar from one another are placed in contexts where they must interact, such as in the workplace, schools, and universities. This raises the question whether these differences matter significantly in these contexts as well.
Our results suggest that, in most cases, while important in initial group formation 
(Joyner & Kao, 2000;
McPherson et al., 2001;
Stehlé et al., 2013)
, homophily does not significantly control perceptions of reputation or reciprocity in cooperative behaviour once groups are formed and dissimilar individuals interact. This attenuation of homophily's influence suggests that diverse groups can cooperate effectively despite initial differences. This finding has significant implications for research on social cohesion and conflict, for example, suggesting that promoting diverse interactions can mitigate the divisive effects of homophily. However, certain factors, such as race, might be less common in contact throughout the lifespan. In the case of racial homophily, this can reduce social cohesion 
(Ramos et al., 2024)
.
Research aiming to promote cooperation should prioritise strategies for facilitating interactions among individuals with diverse characteristics, rather than assuming that cooperation among dissimilar individuals is inherently challenging.
Our results indicate that, within the phenotypic characteristics examined (age, gender, and race), this assumption does not hold true, with the exception of race. We focused on homophily based on characteristics that can be visually perceived by the individuals, so the extent to which our results can be generalised to other types of homophily is something that future research needs to focus on.
Recognising that homophily's influence diminishes over time with continued Our results also show that the results found by 
Sampaio et al. (2023)
, wherein the simple insertion of face photos and interpersonal information about co-players influenced cooperative behaviour, were not due to any age or gender information those photos might have shown. This reinforces the hypothesis that the mere possibility of recognizing someone can be a factor in incentivising cooperation independently of the physical characteristics of the co-players. In this context, the main importance of interpersonal information exchange is the emergence of a 'findability' capacity where individuals will be able to identify and reciprocate to their co-players.
Although issues of ageism and sexism still exist in contemporary societies 
(Hand & Ihara, 2024;
Walker & Zelin, 2021)
, they do not appear to significantly impact cooperation between different genders or generations. We typically interact with people of varying genders and ages within our families throughout our lives, a dynamic that familiarises us with this variability. This exposure might contribute to our comfort and adaptability in engaging with diverse groups beyond the family context. Racial issues, however, have a much profound and still latent historical impact, with legacies from the slave era. It is well-established that ascribed statuses such as race, sex, and age are of fundamental importance in our societies and are intricately linked to the unequal distribution of key stratification variables: income, occupation, and education 
(Palmore & Manton, 1973)
. Nonetheless, racial inequalities are more salient, particularly in the penal system 
(Kutateladze et al., 2014;
Lima et al., 2019)
, and in educational 
(Marteleto, 2012)
 and professional opportunities 
(Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2004)
.
In Brazil and other societies, racial disparities significantly contribute to economic inequalities, largely due to historical and systemic discrimination. Studies indicate that Black Brazilians experience significantly higher rates of poverty, unemployment, and restricted educational opportunities compared to Whites, perpetuating racial socio-economic stratification and hindering national progress towards equity. In previous experimental settings involving U.S. participants, 
Kubota et al. (2013)
 demonstrated that, in the Ultimatum Game (UG), individuals are particularly biased to discriminate against Black proposers, even at a cost to their own financial gain. Our results can be seen as an extension of this finding, illustrating that white participants are more cooperative when playing with co-players of similar racial backgrounds.
While our study provides valuable insights, it also has limitations. The reliance on pre-programmed co-player behaviour in the PGG might not capture the full complexity of real-world social interactions. Future research should employ more interactive designs to explore these dynamics further. Additionally, our focus on dual characteristics for all studies (Black vs. White, men vs. women, 18-22 years old vs. 60+ years old) limits the generalizability of our findings to more diverse groups. Including participants from a broader range of backgrounds in future studies could offer a more comprehensive understanding of these dynamics.
The findings from our research present significant challenges to experimental methodologies and research programs that assume inherent differences in reciprocity and reputation perception among dissimilar individuals who are grouped together.
These results suggest that, contrary to previous assumptions, dissimilar individuals tend to exhibit similar levels of reciprocity and perceive reputation in a comparable manner to their similar counterparts when placed in cooperative decision-making settings. This challenges the traditional understanding that dissimilarity inherently leads to divergent patterns of behaviour and perception. Consequently, research programs that operate under the assumption of such differences may need to reassess their methodologies and theoretical frameworks. Specifically, they may need to reconsider how they design experiments and interpret results to account for the observed similarities in behaviour and perception among dissimilar individuals.

Data from 8 participants were excluded based on the same criteria as in Study 1 and 2.

interaction can help develop strategies to overcome divisions and foster cooperation across diverse social groups. This insight has far-reaching implications for policy design and program development aimed at mitigating polarisation and fostering social cohesion within politically and socially heterogeneous communities. It underscores the importance of research focusing from directly fostering cooperation among experimentally paired individuals to facilitating interactions and cultivating mutual cooperation among dissimilar individuals.

The table shows participant count (n) and mean age (SD) for each group.


Negative significant effects emerged for several groups: White participants with White non-cooperative co-players (W-WNC) had a coefficient of -0.94 (95% CI [-1.58, -0.30], p < .004), White participants with Black cooperative co-players (W-BC) had -0.70 (95% CI[-1.36, -0.04], p = .037),
and White participants with Black non-cooperative co-players (W-BNC) showed -1.17
(95% CI [-1.83, -0.51], p < .001). Significant negative effects were also observed for
Black participants with Black non-cooperative (B-BNC) and with White
non-cooperative (B-WNC) co-players, with coefficients of -0.95 (95% CI [-1.60, -0.30], p
< .004) and -1.55 (95% CI [-2.22, -0.88], p < .001), respectively. Conversely, Black
participants with White cooperative co-players (W-WC) as the reference group (Intercept). Regarding the random effects, the Group:ID variance is 0.52 (SD: 0.72), and ID variance is 0.71 (SD: 0.84). This analysis revealed a significantly positive effect for the Intercept of 0.56 (95% CI [0.10, 1.02], p = .018).participants with Black cooperative co-players (B-BC) had a non-significant effect of 0.05 (95% CI [-0.62, 0.71], p = .893). Black participants with White cooperative co-players (B-WC) showed a non-significant effect of -0.30 (95% CI [-0.94, 0.34], p = .352) (see
