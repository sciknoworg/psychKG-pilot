You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
The goal of primate cognition research is to understand how primates acquire, process, store, and use information 
(Shettleworth, 2010)
. This is an enterprise rooted in the fields of ethology 
(de Waal, 2016)
 and comparative psychology 
(Roitblat, Bever, & Terrace, 1984)
. To fully understand primate cognition from an ethological perspective, we must study its mechanisms, ontogeny, function, and phylogeny 
(Tinbergen, 1963)
; to address each of these elements, large and diverse samples that adequately reflect the full extent of variation in cognitive traits within and between species are essential 
(Martins & Hansen, 1996;
Tomasello & Call, 2011)
. To understand primate cognition from a psychological perspective requires the same need for large samples and diverse species (e.g., 
Beran, Parrish, Perdue, & Washburn, 2014;
Bitterman, 1960;
Dewsbury, 1984;
Wasserman, 1993
Wasserman, , 1997
 However, these approaches are often problematic for single research groups with limited access to study populations.
Historically, attempts to make inferences about cognitive evolution have been severely limited by reliance on samples that are insufficiently large and diverse to adequately reflect the extent of variation in cognitive traits 
(Beach, 1950;
Shettleworth, 2010)
. For instance, to make reliable evolutionary inferences, one must account for the degree of shared ancestry between species. Species with more shared ancestry are expected to perform in a more similar way on cognitive tasks compared to more distantly related species. Failing to account for shared ancestry among species may heighten the risk of over-and under-interpreting apparent species differences, thereby undermining the reliability of inferences about primate cognitive evolution. Moreover, even when an adequate number of species is sampled, it is often difficult to rule out alternative explanations for between-species variation in cognitive performance, such as differences in motivation and perceptual ability 
(Mackintosh, 1988)
 or training histories. One solution to this task impurity problem 
(Miyake et al., 2000)
 is to study first what varies between individuals of a single species, using test batteries aimed at assessing multiple cognitive abilities with multiple tasks for each ability. The shared variance of multiple tasks pertaining the same ability (but varying in peripheral demands such as perceptual or motoric requirements) might then be compared across species 
(Völter, Tinklenberg, Call, & Seed, 2018)
. Such a psychometric approach, however, also requires large and diverse samples within a given species. Meeting this requirement is challenging because researchers are often limited to small samples in zoo, laboratory, and field settings, and in wild populations where control of extraneous influences is even harder to achieve.
Large and diverse samples are also essential to estimate the replicability of primate cognition research across sites. In human psychological research, the failure to achieve such samples has led to findings that have proven difficult to replicate within and across populations 
(Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010;
Open Science Collaboration, 2015)
, a predicament that is a key contributor to what is widely known as the 'replication crisis' 
(Lindsay, 2015)
. Similarly, in primate cognition research, studies using comprehensive cognition test batteries suggest that different populations of the same primate species possess markedly different cognitive profiles 
(Herrmann, Hernández-Lloreda, Call, Hare, & Tomasello, 2010;
Hopkins, Russell, & Schaeffer, 2014)
. Such variation in living systems need not represent noise or error. Instead, such variation might be the outcome of predictable responses to sources of variation across sites 
(Voelkl & Würbel, 2019)
, including differences in social environment, ecology, and population-specific histories of participation in other cognitive tasks 
(Cronin, Jacobson, Bonnie, & Hopper, 2017)
.
These influences can be examined and accounted for by systematically documenting the living conditions of different populations, which might enable primate cognition researchers to develop better predictions about when and where findings should be expected to replicate, and to what extent a particular result might be expected to be similar elsewhere. At the same time, it has also been suggested that such differences in cognitive profiles might be explained by methodological differences across studies 
(Völter et al., 2018)
.
The use of different methods to assess a particular cognitive ability, rather than acting as a challenge to repeatability, might instead offer opportunities for conceptual replications. In fact, this form of repeatability is used to establish the construct validity of cognitive abilities. Recently, 
Cauchoix et al. (2018)
 assessed both contextual and temporal repeatability of cognitive measurements at the individual level in non-human animals. In their meta-analysis, the authors found evidence for repeatability of cognitive performance at the individual level across contexts (i.e., different tasks designed to measure the same cognitive trait) and over time (with low to moderate reproducibility estimates). Consistent and reliable individual differences in cognition are important from an evolutionary point of view, as such traits might confer different fitness benefits 
(Thornton, Isden, & Madden, 2014)
. However, datasets suitable to examine the repeatability of cognitive performance in primates specifically are lacking (with some exceptions: e.g., 
Hopkins et al., 2014)
. This lack of studies is due to limited access to sufficiently large and diverse samples, and inadequate coordination across research sites to ensure cognitive tasks applied across species are directly comparable.
In other areas of psychological science, large-scale collaborations have been adopted to combat challenges to the validity and reliability of research findings (e.g., Open Science Collaboration, 2012; Psychological Science Accelerator: 
Moshontz et al., 2018)
. However, primate cognition research has no infrastructure for large-scale collaboration, and consequently many of the key challenges to the integrity of the field outlined above remain unresolved.
ManyPrimates seeks to overcome these challenges by developing an infrastructure for large-scale research collaboration among researchers who have access to different primate populations available for cognitive testing. In this paper, we review the current state of the field of primate cognition research, including the species studied, sample sizes, and study sites (for a similar recent survey of field primatology research see 
Bezanson & McNamara, 2019)
. Based on this analysis, we outline key limitations of the field, highlight the importance of large-scale collaboration in primate psychological science, summarize the goals of ManyPrimates, report on the current state of the project, and suggest directions for the future.


State of the Field
A widely held view within the field of primate cognition is that research is dominated by work with a few species 
(Beach, 1950;
Shettleworth, 2010)
. Another common conjecture is that primate cognition studies are characterized by notoriously small sample sizes. Small samples are, perhaps, less problematic for "proof of principle studies" seeking to identify whether a single individual has a certain ability, like being able to perceive a stimulus or use a tool. However, small sample sizes present a much larger obstacle to obtaining precise, reliable quantitative comparisons of differences in ability between species (but see 
Smith & Little, 2018)
. Additionally, some research sites might be particularly productive, leading to overrepresentation in the literature of individuals and species with idiosyncratic environments (e.g. rearing history, amount of cognitive testing, reliance on food provisioning by humans, or size of enclosure or home range) that could affect the generalizability of findings to more diverse populations and species.
To test these intuitions, we conducted a systematic review of recently published primate cognition research. We surveyed all journal articles from 22 relevant journals 1 publishing work on primate cognition between January 2014 and October 2019. We included all articles with original data from at least one primate species (excluding humans) that studied some kind of psychological process (judging from the title, abstract, and/or keywords) and involved at least one experimental manipulation. We included studies with any kind of behavioral measure and excluded studies focusing exclusively on other processes (e.g., genetics, neurophysiology). In addition to surveying the literature, we also solicited articles from the members of the ManyPrimates mailing list. For each article, we coded 1) the primate species involved, 2) the sample size per species and site, 3) the data collection site, 4) whether or not the study included a replication, 2 and 5) whether or not species were compared to one another statistically. All data and analysis scripts associated with this review are available in a public repository at:
https://github.com/ManyPrimates/japanese_review. We encourage the reader to consult the original data file for information beyond the summaries presented here.
Our search yielded a total of 574 studies with 69 different species. 3 
Figure 1
 shows a phylogenetic tree of all primate species, with species identified in at least one study in black, and all others in grey. Less than 15% of over 500 commonly recognized primate species have been represented in studies from our review period. There is great variability in taxon-specific research efforts, and most primate radiations only received marginal attention. Of 16 primate families, 13
were included in at least one study. No cognitive research was reported on bushbabies and galagos (Galagonidae), sportive lemurs (Lepilemuridae), or tarsiers (Tarsiidae). Lorises (Lorisidae), the aye-aye (Daubentoniidae), and owl monkeys (Aotidae) each appeared only in a single study, and for gibbons (Hylobatidae) there were just two. Together, these four families featured in less than 1% of publications. We found similarly low numbers for Indriidae (3 studies) and Atelidae (4 studies). By far, the most intensively studied groups were the great apes (Hominidae) and Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae), appearing in 38% and 40% of studies, respectively. Within these highly studied taxa, chimpanzees (184 studies) and rhesus macaques (152 studies) dominated. Among Old World monkeys, research was almost exclusively focused on the subfamily Cercopithecinae, which most prominently includes macaques, baboons, and vervet monkeys. The second subfamily of the group, the folivorous Colobinae, only featured in 3 studies (0.5%).
Thus, the vast majority of studies focus on great apes and cercopithecine Old World monkeys, which comprise just a small fraction of primates' phylogenetic, ecological, and behavioural diversity. In particular, folivorous and nocturnal primate taxa are systematically underrepresented. Thus, the intuition that primate cognition research is dominated by only a few species is supported. This sampling bias is problematic for evolutionary inferences, because underor unrepresented species might have psychological characteristics that differ from even closely related species. For example, rhesus macaques are socially less tolerant compared to other macaque species, which has been suggested to affect their social cognitive skills 
(Joly et al., 2017)
.
The overrepresentation of rhesus macaques could therefore lead to a biased impression of macaque social cognitive skills in general in the literature.
Sample sizes in these studies ranged from 1 to 481 individuals, but varied widely by species ( 
Figure 2
). The median sample size across all species and studies was 7 individuals, limiting the ability to generalize from a sample to the entire population of a species, let alone to broader clades.
Further, most species featured only in a small number of studies, each with relatively few individuals: 66% of species had median sample sizes smaller than 10. The only species for which we observed larger samples were the ones already overrepresented in the field. That is, while the field can estimate the abilities of captive chimpanzees and rhesus macaques with some precision, for most species we are left with too little information for accurate quantitative comparisons. Other research questions, such as the structure of individual differences in cognitive abilities, are also hampered by small sample sizes (for reviews, see 
Shaw & Schmelz, 2017;
Völter et al., 2018)

. Branch lengths are proportional to absolute time. Black tip labels indicate species that were tested in primate cognition studies published from January 2014 to October 2019. The size of the points is proportional to the number of studies for each tested species. Note that we only have phylogenetic data for 288 species and that these do not consistently reflect currently accepted tree topologies for all taxa concerned. There are currently more than 500 commonly recognized species of primates (Llorente Espino, 2019) and their nomenclature and taxonomic grouping are constantly changing. For this figure, we adapted the nomenclatures of H.

 for all other groups. *The following species appeared in published studies but were not included in the 10kTrees data set. Here, they therefore take the place of closely related species: Hoolock leuconedys (H. hoolock), Plecturocebus cupreus (P. moloch), Callicebus nigrifrons (C. personatus), and Eulemur rufifrons (E. rufus).

We added a small amount of horizontal jitter to reduce overplotting. Densities are shown for species that featured in at least four studies. The vertical grey bar indicates overall median sample size across studies and species (Mdn = 7).
Additionally, a few sites contributed most studies in the field. The 5 most productive sites featured in 38% of studies. 
Figure 3
 shows a map of all 183 data collection sites that we identified in our review. The size of each dot corresponds to the number of studies from a particular site.
Even though there is a broad range of data collection sites, there is a clearly uneven distribution of published papers by study site. 
Figure 2 also
  From a comparative perspective, we found that while 19% of studies involved more than one species, 20% of these (22/111) did not compare species quantitatively-though of those that did, almost half (43/89) compared more than two species. Taken together, evolutionary inferences based on comparing multiple species are the exception rather than the norm in primate cognition research. 4
These issues likely arise not because researchers do not want to study a broad range of species, each with a sufficiently large sample size, but because they lack the infrastructure to do so. Data collection with primates is inherently costly 
(Childers & Phillips, 2019;
Conlee, Hoffeld, & Stephens, 2004)
, limiting the number of animals and sites involved in a study. This issue also creates an incentive to use so-called "questionable research practices" 
(John, Loewenstein, & Prelec, 2012)
. Because data collection is costly and the current publishing model does not value null results, researchers might be tempted to look for "significance" in the data to increase the likelihood of publication. Combined with a low rate of replication studies (only 2% of studies in our sample attempted to replicate findings with comparable methodology in an independent sample from the original study), and even fewer would be expected to replicate successfully 
(Farrar & Clayton, 2019)
. In the following, we present the ManyPrimates project as an attempt to overcome some of these issues. ManyPrimates cannot solve all issues related to funding and the culture of academic publishing, but it can provide researchers with an opportunity to contribute their limited resources to a larger project. This pooling of resources allows them to tackle important evolutionary questions in a systematic and meaningful way. The project was inspired by other large-scale collaboration projects within psychology, which we now turn to.


Large Scale Collaboration in Psychology
Many of the problems facing primate cognition research also exist in other scientific fields. One of the most pressing problems is publication bias. Researchers' careers benefit from the publication of innovative results in prestigious journals. Consequently, scholars often face incentives to value quantity over quality, and novelty of results over reliability, when choosing how to conduct research, with the goal of producing positive results that are more 'publishable.' Researchers also typically have substantial 'degrees of freedom' in how to conduct a study, analyze the data, and interpret results, and this flexibility can be used to favor positive results 
(Gelman & Loken, 2013)
.
For instance, researchers might: recruit participants in several stages and end the experiment once desired results show up; HARK -Hypothesize After the Results are Known 
(Kerr, 1998)
; test several parameters at the same time to compare multiple results and choose those that work 
(John et al., 2012)
; analyze only a subgroup of participants; or fail to adjust for inflated Type I error rates. 5 Put another way, these practices involve 'torturing' the data until the desired results appear ManyPrimates have to tackle similar issues, such as coordinating projects, choosing a specific topic, clarifying criteria for participation, designating responsibilities, and appropriately acknowledging contributors 
(Byers-Heinlein et al., 2019)
. However, the upside is clear: the first ManyBabies project was hugely successful, bringing together researchers from more than 60 labs who in total collected data from more than 2,300 infants (The ManyBabies Consortium, in press).
This dataset allows researchers to estimate the size of an effect of interest with unprecedented precision, but it also allows the identification of factors that induce variation across labs.
Additional projects are currently underway.
The Psychological Science Accelerator 
(Moshontz et al., 2018
) is a network of over 500 psychology laboratories from 70 countries, mostly studying human adults, that collaborate on an ongoing basis. A notable feature of the Psychological Science Accelerator is the involvement of numerous smaller laboratories, which often contribute data from underrepresented populations.
This distribution and diversification of data collection thus helps to address many of the problems we identified above in our review of primate cognition studies (e.g., the problem of a few very productive sites being responsible for most studies). In addition to providing new ways of collecting data, collaborations discourage questionable research and measurement practices by requiring transparency and extensive pre-registration of studies to successfully conduct largescale, multi-site studies 
(Allen & Mehler, 2019)
.
Finally, there are also examples of large-scale collaboration in primate research. For example, through the PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE, Neff, 2019), primate researchers create a repository of shared neuroimaging data 
(Milham et al., 2018)
. To promote collaboration and open science, this group works on four specific aspects: 1) standardizing data collection protocols, 2) improving animal welfare, ethics, and intellectual property, 3) improving data standards, quality assessment, and analytic software, and 4) establishing coordinated paradigm designs.


ManyPrimates: Goals
To fully understand sources of variation in primate cognition within and between species, it is necessary to study a broad and diverse sample of species and individuals. ManyPrimates aims to offer an infrastructure that allows the collection of such a sample by pooling resources across research sites. It provides a centralized platform on which researchers can jointly discuss and develop study ideas and procedures. Each collaborator then implements the study in their respective institution and submits the data back to the project. This approach allows the generation of datasets that are larger and more diverse than any researcher or institution could achieve on their own. Other large-scale collaborations in psychology focus on evaluating the robustness and replicability of core findings in the field. While this is also a point of interest for ManyPrimates, the project might play an even more fundamental role in the field: Because data collection is so difficult and expensive, fundamental questions about the evolution of cognition can only be answered if a large number of researchers in the field join forces.
ManyPrimates aims to include a wide variety of institutions, with university research labs, zoos, and sanctuaries participating. This diversity improves the representativeness of the sample and the study results. Systematically accounting for variation in housing and rearing backgrounds allows researchers to examine whether environmental variation predicts differences in cognitive performance. Pooling of data also provides a unique opportunity to include many species that are often excluded from research because of their small numbers at a single location. For example, gibbons are typically housed as pairs or small family groups, and there are often no more than four gibbons at a single institution. Combining data across sites for these species yields samples that are large enough to make meaningful inferences. Including these neglected species is another one of the main goals of ManyPrimates.
For each experiment, group members develop a shared procedure and coding scheme for all data collection sites before data collection starts. This protocol is then shared among all contributing institutions. This policy ensures that results are comparable across species and sites, making successful replications more likely and species comparisons more valid. In addition, the discussion surrounding the design of a study that precedes it provides an opportunity for labs to exchange experiences and best practices and also exposes early career researchers to a wider variety of approaches. As mentioned above, the central goal of ManyPrimates is to provide an infrastructure to facilitate large scale collaboration in primate cognition research. The first step in this direction was to establish a mailing list which connects all the people interested in the project and serves as the main tool to share information and announce new developments. For in depth discussions and coordination of data management, data analysis, and manuscript writing we use an online messaging tool (Slack).
All data management, analysis, and writing happens on openly accessible online platforms.
We write manuscripts on Google Docs, we host documentation and research material on Google Drive, and we store, process, and analyze data on GitHub. Procedures and data analysis plans are pre-registered at the Open Science Framework. These components are all linked through our website, which also allows people not yet associated with the project to get information about projects and outreach activities.
Our website is also the main way to disseminate news about the project with a general audience. For further outreach we use social media (e.g., Twitter: @ManyPrimates) and conference presentations (10 conference presentations since the official launch of the project). In July 2020, we will host a ManyPrimates symposium at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.
We established and tested this infrastructure while running our first pilot study on short term memory. The topic was selected -through voting -from a number of ideas proposed by the early members of ManyPrimates. Between March and August of 2018 we collected data from 176 primates from 12 different species in 11 study sites. The procedure and the results are described in detail in Many 
Primates et al. (2019)
. In light of the literature review presented above, the sample size and diversity of species in the pilot paper is already extraordinary. For example, none of the studies reviewed included more species or more sites. However, from a phylogenetic perspective, the number of species represented in the sample is still relatively small 
(Freckleton, Harvey, & Pagel, 2002;
Freckleton & Rees, 2019)
. We therefore decided to continue data collection to add more data from more species. The pilot project has thus become ManyPrimates1 (MP1 -data collection planned to end in May 2020). We also break new ground in the way we organize the data analysis. For MP1, we announced a modelling challenge to solicit phylogenetic models from the community to find the best predictors of short-term memory abilities on a species level.
Researchers can submit models specifying the external variables (social and ecological) they think best predict short-term memory abilities across species. All submitted models will then enter into a model comparison. Given a nearly endless number of plausible models, deciding which to favor strongly depends on one's theoretical views. As a project, ManyPrimates aims to be theoretically neutral. This position is best maintained not by making theory-laden analytical choices, but by considering the full breath of models coming from the research community. Meanwhile, we have started planning for MP2 (see future directions below).


Limitations
Some of the biggest challenges in coordinating research with primates across settings are logistical.
It is impossible to use exactly the same method across all subjects and sites as animal facilities themselves differ. For example, in many traditional research settings the primates are individually separated during testing, which allows a relatively high degree of control over extraneous factors such as the behavior of other individuals. In contrast, some sanctuary and zoo animals have to be tested in their group due to a lack of designated areas to separate individuals, a lack of facility approval to separate animals, or other competing demands such as the needs of zoos to keep their animals on display. The animals themselves also differ. Many zoo and sanctuary animals are research naive and some may come from suboptimal backgrounds, such as having been pets or in the entertainment industry. However, these limitations are also an opportunity to compare results across sites and individuals, allowing us to investigate the effects these differences, avoid sampling biases, and identify the robustness of reported effects 
(Baribault et al., 2018;
Fiedler, 2011)
.
Another primary challenge is balancing the need to keep methods the same across species with the flexibility required to adjust methods for species differences 
(Boesch, 2007)
. For example, the sizes and dimensions of a testing apparatus should vary with the primate species' body size to allow for adequate manipulation by each species during a test. We already know that small differences in methodology can influence results within the same species (see, for example, 
Barth, Reaux, & Povinelli, 2005)
 and this effect is likely to be amplified across species. Species also vary in their attention spans, motivation, experience, sensory systems, motor abilities, and a variety of other qualities that make it difficult to design "fair" tests across diverse species and individuals.
Currently, the choice of whether to adjust methods for a particular species is usually left to individual researchers, and is often based on intuition rather than evidence. The ManyPrimates project can thus contribute to best practices by bringing researchers together from diverse backgrounds to tackle the challenge of developing unbiased tests.
ManyPrimates also offers the opportunity to reflect upon and exchange ethical considerations. We need to compare country-specific or site-specific laws/regulations, and 
carefully


Future Directions
ManyPrimates seeks to address the limitations mentioned above. In addition, ManyPrimates offers unique opportunities that grow as the project matures. Some future directions specifically concentrate on focal research questions. However, there are also future directions for the nature of
ManyPrimates itself, what it can become, and how it can evolve and sustain itself through repeated collaborative interactions. By creating an online platform for large-scale collaboration, future projects can benefit from collective data sets not just from that project, but from all preceding projects. The replicability and generalizability of primate cognition studies can be tested through a large and robust framework. Because sample sizes are often a concern in this field, we can study these subjects intensively, and take advantage of their detailed developmental histories. As an example, if a future project assesses the serial ordering abilities of many of the primate species in the first ManyPrimates project, we can examine serial ordering and its relation to short term memory. If, later, we assess prospective memory in these individuals, then we also have short term memory and serial learning profiles for these same individuals. This example can be expanded outside a primary research topic (such as memory). We could examine relations between sensorimotor skills and susceptibility to perceptual illusions, or choice biases and impulsivity, or any number of other combinations. That nonhuman primates are so long-lived is a major benefit to ManyPrimates. Likewise, as hinted in our introduction, we could examine the construct validity of cognitive abilities with large and diverse samples by conducting multiple tasks aiming at assessing the same cognitive ability. In time, longitudinal, developmental, and psychometric studies can emerge from ManyPrimates, with the opportunity for some of the largest test-retest experiments with nonhuman animals ever conducted. There have been occasional studies of longterm memory retention, typically for learned skills or specific semantic or episodic information (e.g., 
Beran, Pate, Richardson, & Rumbaugh, 2000;
Burdyn, Noble, Shreves, & Thomas, 1984;
Lewis, Call, & Berntsen, 2017a
, 2017b
Martin-Ordas, Berntsen, & Call, 2013;
Mendes & Call, 2014)
, but nothing on the scale that could be accomplished through ManyPrimates. To give just one possibility, we could train hundreds of primates from dozens of species to perform a task (e.g., solve a puzzle box, or encode the correct container from an array of 12 choices), and then test these same individuals months or even years later to establish their long-term memory.
To better understand the evolution of cognition in primates we need to not only compare the cognitive abilities of different species, but also to investigate how ecological and social factors affect cognitive abilities, as these factors played an essential role in the evolution of cognition 
(Janmaat, 2019)
. However, primate cognition studies have been performed only infrequently in the wild, mainly with chimpanzees (e.g., 
Matsuzawa, Humle, & Sugiyama, 2011)
 and capuchins (e.g., 
Liu, Fragaszy, & Visalberghi, 2016)
. Even more infrequent are experiments presenting the same task to two different wild populations of the same species inhabiting the same habitat type 
(Cardoso & Ottoni, 2016)
. In the future, we hope to include more field primatologists into the group to eventually study primate cognition in the wild. Replicating the same experiment in different populations of one species living in the same or in different habitats, or in different primate species living in the same habitat, will be particularly useful to assess the role of ecological and social factors in shaping the development of cognitive abilities.
It is important to note that individual primates likely would be tested by new people over time, and that this is part of the design of ManyPrimates. Rather than a specific group of researchers giving access to "their animals," ManyPrimates is a community sharing access, and a commitment to try to participate in as many experiments as possible. The pilot study reflects this, with researchers at all career levels, from early graduate students to senior professors. Over time, we hope individual zoos, labs, and sanctuaries will develop equitable policies to allow any interested individuals to help contribute data. This can help foster an environment in which participation is a facility-wide commitment from the broad research team that continues beyond the participation of a single or small number of researchers. Even if individual researchers move on from where they contributed data to a ManyPrimates project, the framework for someone new to step in and continue the collaboration will remain. 


Conclusion
To understand the evolutionary mechanisms underlying primate cognition, large and diverse samples are needed to measure variability in cognitive traits within and between species. However, it is difficult for individual researchers and institutions to achieve this. Our analysis of primate cognition research published within the last five years shows that during this period only about 15% of primate species have been studied. The median sample size was just seven individuals.
Great apes and Old World monkeys account for the vast majority of studies, with chimpanzees and rhesus macaques being especially overrepresented in research. Taken together, these two species are the focus of study in more than half of all publications. Furthermore, only five data collection sites produced 38% of all studies. These imbalances in sampling introduce bias to primate cognition research and pose a serious problem for reconstructing the evolutionary history of cognition.
ManyPrimates offers the infrastructure for large-scale collaboration, addressing these problems by pooling resources, allowing researchers at different sites with varying capacities to perform experiments using standardized methods. This collaboration means we can generate larger, more robust and diverse datasets, conduct quantitative comparisons among species, and validate discoveries through replication. Eventually, this approach will enable us to tackle currently unanswerable questions in the field, producing novel findings and allowing for theory building. Moreover, our collaborative ethos fosters joint discussions for developing research ideas, monitors of ethical research practices, and promotes open science.


Policy Recommendations for Study Reporting
The level of detail with which researchers described their samples varied tremendously across studies and journals. Given the issues we identified above, precise reporting is important to estimate the diversity of the sample and with that what we know about a given species. We therefore urge authors to include the following details in their manuscript or the supplementary material: Name of data collection site(s), Species name (including scientific name), Subject identity, (in a table or as part of the data), drop out rate (even if there were none), and subjects' age and sex for each (sub-)species and site. For instance, an ideal statement might be: "A total number of XX primates contributed data to this study. This included XX [species1] (latin species1, XX female, mean age = XX) and XX [species2] (latin species2, XX female, mean age = XX). List of all subjects can be found in 
Table X
 (including the subjects' age, sex, rearing history) in the supplementary material. Species1 was housed at AAA, and species2 was housed at BBB. We attempted to collect data from XX additional subjects (XX species1, X female, mean age = X; XX species1, X female, mean age = X) but did not include them because CCC."

Location of 183 data collection sites for primate cognition studies published from January 2014 to October 2019. The size of the points is proportional to the number of studies involving each site. The color of the points indicates the number of species tested at each site. The five most productive sites were: Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Center (Leipzig, Germany), Language Research Center (Atlanta, GA, USA), Yerkes National Primate Research Center (Atlanta, GA, USA), Laboratory of Comparative Ethology (Dickerson, MD, USA), and Primate Research Institute (Inuyama, Japan). See online repository for the complete data set.


(p-hacking;

. Abusing these degrees of freedom undermines trust in the field
(Pickett & Roche, 2018
) and makes replicability difficult or even impossible. Several large scale projects have examined this issue empirically, with troubling results: For instance, one of the first efforts to reproduce a large number of studies in psychology only managed to replicate statistically significant effects in 36% of studies (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Identifying problems with such questionable research practices and replicability has prompted researchers to search for solutions. One response in different fields of psychology has been to form large-scale collaboration networks. The goal of these groups is to measure the robustness and replicability of core findings. While there now exist a number of these networks, below we focus on a few that have been particularly influential for ManyPrimates.An emblematic and particularly relevant example of large-scale collaboration is the ManyBabies project. Infant research and primate cognition research face many of the same challenges, such as small sample sizes, inconsistent research practices across sites, and a limited focus on specific populations. From the perspective of developing infrastructure, ManyBabies and


Lastly, ManyPrimates is by nature a collaborative platform (largely based online) -a place where multiple researchers can develop new ideas, initiate joint projects, and work together to promote open science. Future directions will continue to include organizing regular workshops and meetings beyond the online platform, further strengthening existing connections and inspiring future researchers to join ManyPrimates.


shows the number of studies for a species in relation to the number of sites contributing data for that species. For example, we identified 184 studies with chimpanzees, but coming from just 29 sites. Because primates are long-lived and often spend most of their life at one site, the same subjects are tested over and over again. As a consequence, we may end up knowing a lot about a few individuals, but less about the variation within the species. In addition, repeated testing of few individuals may result in better performance due to experience with cognitive testing, hampering comparisons both within and across species.


: State of the Project The
ManyPrimates also wants to promote the implementation of open science practices in the field of primate cognition research. To this end, studies that are conducted as part of ManyPrimates have pre-registered data collection and analysis plans. Furthermore, all materials, data, and analysis code are openly available in an online repository (https://github.com/ManyPrimates).Study results are published first as pre-prints and then in full open access journals. This ensures that people working in non-academic institutions without journal subscriptions (e.g., zoos or sanctuaries) have free access to all articles. These practices will enable research discoveries to be shared more widely, facilitating further discoveries and increasing their translational value.Taken together, ManyPrimates aims to accelerate research collaboration in animal cognition, benefitting not only its members, but also the general scientific community by addressing questions that no single researcher, group, or institution could have answered individually. idea to initiate ManyPrimates emerged from a number of informal discussions among researchers about the challenges and problems faced by the field of primate cognition and psychology more broadly. Inspired by comparable movements in the social sciences (described above), the project was officially launched in August 2018 at the 27 th International Primatological Society Congress in Nairobi, Kenya, as part of a methods symposium. Since then, the project has been continuously growing. The number of people involved is best approximated by the 120+ individuals on the mailing list. The first paper, describing the project and presenting a first pilot study, was recently published (Many
Primates et al., 2019)

consider definitions of invasive and noninvasive cognitive testing procedures.
ManyPrimates aims to be inclusive, bringing people together from different disciplines, with
different ethical views. This diversity of perspectives is valuable, but also introduces additional
challenges, not all of which are specific to primate studies. How do large research collaborations
make decisions? A consensus-based approach is ideal, but is difficult to implement in practice with
a hundred or more collaborators. A leadership team and/or governing board may be useful moving
forward. Technical infrastructure, administrative support, funding, and incentivizing participation
are
all
additional
obstacles.

(https://manyprimates.github.io/authorship/); however, due to the nature of the project it is difficult
to check the individual contributions of each participating member. This limitation might lead to
unbalanced contributions.


It is worth noting, however, that we did not include in this review studies that compared humans to other species, which make up a large proportion of comparative cognition studies. While research comparing humans to other species is scientifically valuable, it is also critically important to explore cognition beyond humans to gain fundamental insights about the nature and evolution of cognitive diversity

 The taxonomic identities of subjects were reported in varying detail within the papers (i.e. regarding subspecific status). To be consistent, we chose to base our reporting and analysis on the species level and excluded publications that failed to provide a species assignment for their subjects. In the case of orangutans (Pongo spp.) and robust capuchins (Sapajus spp.), interspecific hybrids frequently feature in cognitive studies. To account for this issue, data on these groups are presented here on the genus instead of species level. When species-level assignments for Pongo and Sapajus subjects were provided, we included them in the raw data (see:
https://github.com/ManyPrimates/japanese_review).
