You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Decision-making is the process of making choices by identifying a decision, gathering information, and assessing alternative resolutions. A step-by-step decision-making process can help make more deliberate decisions by organizing relevant information and defining alternatives. Daniel Kahneman, who recently passed away, popularized the concept of two systems of thought. System one is fast, efficient, confident, and prone to error, while system two is slow, resource-consuming, full of doubt, and perhaps less prone to error 
(Kahneman, 2011)
. These two systems work together.
On the other hand, it has been hypothesized that specific brain structure modulation enables faster processing and greater accuracy in specific cognitive domains (domain-specific hypotheses), providing a simple explanation of cognitive processes by implying that different types of cognitive processing can be accounted for by different specialized modules 
(Buss, 2019)
. Conversely, it has been proposed that cognitive architecture and the capacity for reasoning, learning, imitation, goal-oriented actions, and memory retention exemplify general-purpose mechanisms (domain-general hypothesis) ( 
Barrett et al., 2006)
.
At the central level, the decision-making process is accompanied by activations in prefrontal and subcortical brain regions associated with executive functioning. In turn, poor decisionmaking is associated with various psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), depression, bipolar disorder, attentional deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which relate to low prefrontal activity, leading to inaccurate representations of rewards and penalties, and contributing to poor decision-making.
Here, it is proposed that healthy, "neurotypical" people may use Kahneman's two systems in a balanced way and that psychiatric, "neurodivergent" people may use only system one (fast) or the two systems in an unbalanced way. In this view, and according to the conceptualization that flexible decision-making is under the control of prefrontal areas, limbic structures, hippocampal formations, and thalamic nuclei, it is also possible to argue that Kahneman's system one might be used by single brain structures, in a more local "domain-specific" fashion. In contrast, system two might combine several brain structures in a more "domain-general" fashion.
Secondly, in this paper, two transdisciplinary fields of investigation are introduced, neuroeconomics and neuromarketing, aiming at elucidating new potential pathways in the investigation of pathological, "neurodivergent" decision-making for the discovery of new diagnostic tools and new therapeutic strategies. A question is mainly asked: How does neurodivergent make decisions that are considered essential for their day-by-day life? For example, how does a "neurodivergent" ADHD decide to buy? In the future, the goal would be to enhance our understanding of the interplay between neurodiversity and decisionmaking processes in neuromarketing settings. This interaction may involve the adoption of experimental behavioral setups, human and non-human models, to explore the neurobiological aspects of neurodiversity constructs such as reward-related impulsivity/compulsivity, risk-seeking, intolerance to delay, intolerance of uncertainty, and affecting decision-making abilities.
In conclusion, this paper aims to highlight the importance of theoretical frameworks, their interconnections, and their potential utility in diagnosing and therapeutic strategies related to pathological decision-making.


The role of Kahneman in modern neuroeconomics and cognitive neuroscience
The recent passing away of Daniel Kahneman at 90 years old marked an intellectual gap in the scientific community, particularly in behavioral neuroscience and neuroeconomics. His scientific contributions played a pivotal role in laying the foundation for behavioral economics by challenging traditional economic assumptions and introducing psychologically realistic models. Kahneman's work with Amos Tversky on prospect theory explored how human judgment deviates from rational decision-making principles. Prospect theory, set out in 1979, challenged the mainstream economic view that people were fundamentally "rational" even if prone to error 
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979
). This cognitive approach to economics can be traced back to Herbert Simon and Maurice Allais, who paved the way for Tversky and Kahneman's contributions 
(Pascale & Pascale, 2015
). An example of this theory might be as follows: given a choice between 100€ for sure and a 50/50 chance of gaining 200€, most people will take the 100€. However, given a choice between losing 100€ for sure and a 50/50 chance of losing 200€, people will take the 50/50 chance. People are risk averse regarding gains, but risk seeking about losses. More recently, Kahneman popularized the concept of two systems of thought. System one is fast, efficient, confident, and prone to error, while system two is slow, resource-consuming, full of doubt, and perhaps a little less prone to error. These two systems work together. System one tells us the dessert is likely to be delicious and worth considering, while system two (might) check the calorie count before we dig in. This last idea seems to be an evolution of the prospect theory, and altogether, it has paved the way for a new research field, neuroeconomics.


Decision-making and prefrontal cortex
The advantageous decision-making process is accompanied by activations in prefrontal and subcortical brain regions associated with executive functioning. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are critical for decision-making processes 
(Rosenbloom et al., 2012)
. Functional imaging studies reveal that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is involved in general decision-making, while the medial frontal gyrus, lateral OFC, and insula activate during advantageous choices 
(Rolls, 2023)
. Meta-analyses suggest a dissociation between neural circuits for risky and ambiguous decisions, with OFC and rostral ACC associated with risky choices and DLPFC and dorsal ACC linked to ambiguous decisions 
(Krain et al., 2006)
. Finally, the right ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices play crucial roles in adaptive, flexible decision-making under ambiguity by integrating choice utility and outcome evaluation, driving shifts away from disadvantageous options through sensitivity to accumulating negative outcomes 
(Christakou et al., 2009)
.
Adaptive, flexible decision-making is characterized by a range of options and speed of response (Laureiro-Martinez & Brusoni, 2018). Research suggests that decision-makers with access to multiple modes of understanding are more effective, demonstrating higher tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty 
(Nutt, 1993)
. Flexibility in strategic decision-making is crucial for organizational adaptation, particularly in uncertain environments. According to Kahneman's system one (fast) and system two (slow), we may argue that flexible decisionmaking -the ability to understand when to rely on habits vs. when to explore new courses of action-could enable managers to switch from a "fast" decision mode, based on habits, to a "slow," more deliberate decision mode that facilitates the exploration of new courses of action. Therefore, highly flexible managers reflect on the situation, recognize and value diversity in viewpoints, and integrate such diversity into their decisions. By valuing diversity, they are more likely to overcome inertia (Laureiro-Martinez & Brusoni, 2018).
It has been shown that the medial frontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex play key roles in representing environmental values and structural relationships to guide decision-making (Klein-Flügge et al., 2022). Moreover, corticostriatal circuits are essential for integrating information and influencing choice, with an evolutionary expansion of these connections linked to increased behavioral flexibility 
(Lee et al., 2015)
. For example, dopamine signaling, regulated by clearance mechanisms such as the dopamine transporter (DAT) and catechol-Omethyltransferase (COMT), is critical for flexible decision-making 
(Korn et al., 2021)
. Moreover, recent research on rodent models of schizophrenia-like, reward-and risk-related behavioral inflexibility showed a crucial role of GABAergic parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVIs) in medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus 
(Patrono et al., 2023;
. These pieces of evidence highlight the pivotal role of the prefrontal cortex in flexible decision-making and, crucially, determine the importance of translating neuroscience research into the neuroeconomics field.


Inflexibility and poor decision-making
In turn, poor decision-making is associated with various psychiatric conditions (SCZ, ASD, depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD) connected with low prefrontal activity, leading to inaccurate representations of rewards and penalties and contributing to poor decisionmaking. In general, flawed decision-making in mental illness is a product of deficits in basic neuropsychological processes, including impaired attention, working memory, or response inhibition. Poor decision-making has a pervasive presence in clinical outcomes. For example, adherence rates for antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, or stimulants range between 30-50% (Caceda et al., 2014). Moreover, in schizophrenia, executive functioning controlling reward-related or risk-related decision-making is critically compromised, as measured by the lack of flexibility in decision-making (Orellana & Slachevsky, 2013; Patrono et al., 2023; 2024). Recently, the problem of inflexibility in decision-making was assessed throughout several psychiatric disorders, indicating compulsivity and impulsivity as the major features correlated with inflexibility 
(Grant & Chamberlain, 2023)
. When considering Kahneman' system one (fast) and system two (slow), one may argue that healthy, "neurotypical" people may use the two systems in a balanced way and that psychiatric, "neurodivergent" people may use only system one (fast), or the two systems in an unbalanced way. In this view, and according to the conceptualization that flexible decisionmaking is under the control of prefrontal areas, limbic structures, hippocampal formations, and thalamic nuclei, it is also possible to argue that Kahneman's system one might be used by single brain structures, in a more local "domain-specific" fashion. In contrast, system two might combine several brain structures in a more "domain-general" fashion. However, Kahneman explains that the dual-system approach combines both forms of reasoning as almost all processes are a mix of both systems. Though challenging scenarios may rely more on system two, both systems work together. Emotions from our unconscious system one processes influence and complement our logical system two thinking, and our brain integrates the two to enable us to make purposeful decisions. Furthermore, Kahneman declared that "there is no part of the brain that either of the systems would call home", suggesting the impossibility of addressing specific brain locations for the dual-system conceptualization 
(Kahneman, 2011
).
On the other hand, it has been hypothesized that specific brain structure modulation enables faster processing and greater accuracy in specific cognitive domains and provides a simple explanation of cognitive processes by implying that different types of cognitive processing can be accounted for by different specialized modules rather than a single domain-general mechanism 
(Buss, 2019)
. Recent research on rodent models of SCZ showed that optogenetic stimulations of PVIs at specific frequencies (resembling those of specific brain oscillations) in specific brain structures (prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus) restored behavioral flexibility, suggesting that domain-specific stimulations have a pivotal role in restoring domain-general cognitive functions 
(Patrono et al., 2023;
. Conversely, it has been proposed that cognitive architecture is all-purpose and devoid of content. For example, information processing devices responsible for food choice would be the same as for mate and habitat choice. The capacity for reasoning, learning, imitation, goal-oriented actions, recognizing similarities, conceptualizing, and memory retention exemplify generalpurpose mechanisms 
(Barrett et al., 2006
).
These pieces of information created debates concerning the conceptual relationships between the dual-system model of Kahneman and the "domain-specific"-"domain-general" duality hypotheses. The recent advances show a large consensus in identifying the more deliberative system two with the "domain-general" hypotheses and the more emotional, fast system one with the "domain-specific" hypotheses (Da Silva, 2023). However, it is also important to note that such exemplifications might bring cognitive biases, as already stated by 
Kahneman (2011)
. Moreover, it is crucial to consider that the whole discussion has been referred to healthy "neurotypical" conditions. Currently, evaluations over whether psychiatric, "neurodivergent" people use more system one than system two or more "domain-specific" than "domain-general" approaches have not yet been fully explored.


Neurodivergent decision-making and Neuroeconomics
Very recently, a new term -neurodiversity -has been coined, which encompasses psychiatric conditions such as SCZ, ASD, and ADHD, with poor decision-making abilities. The definition of neurodiversity argues that there are positive aspects to having brains that function differently; many prefer to see these differences simply as differences rather than disorders. Nowadays, neurodiversity has become an "umbrella term" describing all those people with strengths and weaknesses that are different from those that are considered "neurotypical".
Recent research sought to determine decision-making abilities in those subjects considered under the umbrella of "neurodivergent", particularly SCZ, ASD, and ADHD (Patrono et al., 2023; 2024; Rogge, 2022; Sørensen et al., 2024). All evidence concluded that poor decisionmaking abilities, rather reward-related than risk-related, had a common denominator in impulsivity and compulsivity, previously described as the significant features for inflexibility in decision-making. Interestingly, Sharp and Coll. (2012) reviewed several studies connecting poor reward-related decision-making, psychiatric disorders, and motivational disruption, pointing out the possibility of using behavioral economics and neuroeconomics to explicitly conceptualize these disorders within a reward 
(Finger et al., 2011;
Fairchild et al., 2011)
. Furthermore, the authors point out a lack of crosstalk between the fields of psychology, cognitive neuroscience, neuroanatomy, and computational science in poor, maladaptive reward-related decision-making. Therefore, they propose that neuroeconomics is a field that shows immense promise as a potential bridge for translational science 
(Sharp et al., 2012)
.
Neuroeconomics is an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines economics, psychology, and neuroscience to understand human decision-making processes 
(Glimcher & Rustichini, 2004)
, aiming to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making, integrating behavioral observations with neurobiological insights 
(Mariano et al., 2009)
. The field keeps evolving, investigating how brain activity relates to economic choices and whether this knowledge can improve economic predictive models 
(Croxson et al., 2009)
. Neuroeconomics is concerned with questions about how we make choices, that is, decision-making. It is, therefore, not surprising that a discipline that may optimally elucidate such a complex process should owe its existence to the interaction of several parent disciplines -each of which underwent significant changes in the last half of the 20th century. Firstly, neuroeconomics stands in behavioral economics, led by Kahneman and Tversky. In parallel, cognitive neuroscience took the first steps toward demonstrating the correlation between neuronal activity and monkey choice behavior 
(Platt & Glimcher, 1999)
. For the first time, behavioral economic tasks, combined with neuroimaging techniques in humans and singlecell recordings in non-human primates, could be used to conduct algorithmic analyses of the physical mechanisms of choice in the brain. However, it is important to note that neuroeconomics does not mean "the neural basis of economic decision-making". Rather, it does mean the infusion of neuroscience with how economics models value and utility, using economic metaphors to study how neurons and neural networks make decisions.
The metaphor of utility and value can be used across the different levels of explanation from cells to society, making this a unique field. In applying this metaphor to psychiatry, it is possible then to hypothesize that disturbances in the global valuation system of the brain are a major cause of psychiatric disorders 
(Hasler, 2012
). Depending on the task constraints, such disturbances may be evident in increased or reduced brain activation in reward-related areas or may even be reflected in altogether alternative (categorically different) decisionmaking strategies, for instance, the use of an altogether different reference point such that relative gains and losses are valued differently.


Neuromarketing for neurodivergent?
Whether neuroeconomics can provide an objective metric to examine psychopathology as sub-optimal behavior, a "multi-level" research approach, or even a platform for investigators from different fields of investigation to develop a common language for studying rewardrelated decision-making in psychiatric disorders, to date, it is still unclear how a "neurodivergent", sub-optimal reward-related decision-making behavior can be evaluated and therapeutically ameliorated. In the last years, very few scientific articles have been published considering "neurodivergence" and "decision-making" 
(Brandsen et al., 2024;
Thompson-Hodgetts et al., 2023;
Jones et al., 2024)
. In turn, opinion articles (including blogs and forums) have been produced linking neurodiversity and decision-making. In these articles, a question is mainly asked: How does neurodivergent make decisions that are considered important for their day-by-day life? For example, how does a "neurodivergent" ADHD decide to buy?
Whether neurotypical or neurodivergent, a sector of economics developed to predict and potentially even manipulate consumer behavior and decision-making. Neuromarketing, or "consumer neuroscience," loosely refers to measuring physiological and neural signals to gain insight into customers' motivations, preferences, and decisions. Neuromarketing uses neurotypical consumers to help inform creative advertising, product development, pricing, and other marketing areas. Since marketers use neuromarketing to shape consuming narratives around their neurotypical consumers, it is arguable that neuromarketing may expand its perspectives toward neurodivergent people. Some publications have recently fostered this idea 
(Mareva et al., 2024;
Nuñez-Gomez et al., 2020)
.
In the future, the goal would be to enhance our understanding of the interplay between neurodiversity and decision-making processes in neuromarketing settings. This interaction may involve the adoption of experimental behavioral setups, human and non-human models, to explore the neurobiological aspects of neurodiversity constructs such as rewardrelated impulsivity/compulsivity, risk-seeking, intolerance to delay, intolerance of uncertainty, and affecting decision-making abilities. In this way, research will emphasize distinct neurobiological measures for understanding decision-making processes (the catecholaminergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic neurotransmission actors), highlighting the main brain areas involved (prefrontal cortices, limbic system, hippocampal formations, including thalamic nuclei).


Conclusions
This paper sought to establish possible connections between theoretical frameworks to elucidate new conceptual pathways to better understand healthy and pathological decisionmaking abilities. Starting from the dual-system approach by 
Kahneman (2011)
, I found potential connections with the cognitive domain-general and domain-specific hypotheses. Considering that, in normal conditions, both the dual-system and the general/specific domain work in a balanced way, it has been hypothesized that pathological decision-making may relate to an unbalanced "cognitive administration" of both the dual-system (using more the fast system one that the slow system two) and the general/specific (using more specific domain than general one). Subsequently, aiming to focus on pathological, neurodivergent decision-making, the neuroeconomics field of research has been briefly discussed, overarching previous studies and hypotheses. The paper aligned with the central assumption of neuroeconomics, which is the transdisciplinary study of how neurons and neural networks make decisions. Neuroeconomics is a valid and established field of investigation that can elucidate the mechanisms of decision-making in pathological conditions using cognitive neuroscience and behavioral economy models. However, up to now, models have been used mostly to study healthy, neurotypical decision-making. Therefore, it is still unclear how a "neurodivergent", sub-optimal reward-related decision-making behavior can be evaluated and therapeutically ameliorated. In this way, neuromarketing, loosely called the measurement of physiological and neural signals, was introduced to gain insight into customers' motivations, preferences, and decisions. Since marketers use neuromarketing to shape consuming narratives around their neurotypical consumers, it has been argued that neuromarketing may expand its perspectives toward neurodivergent people.
In conclusion, this paper's overall aim was to highlight the importance of theoretical frameworks, their interconnections, and their potential utility in diagnoses and therapeutic strategies related to pathological decision-making. Decision-making is generally one of the executive functions that is more complex and used by neurotypical and neurodivergent people.
