You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

The 'White Male Effect' in Perceptions of Risk of Dying from COVID-19
The White Male Effect describes the phenomenon that across a variety of domains, White men tend to perceive various situations and properties of the world to be less risky than do other demographic groups. The term was coined by 
Finucane and colleagues (2000)
 to give a name to previous empirical findings on race and gender disparities in risk perception. For example, they observed that White men consider it relatively unlikely that they will get cancer, die in a plane crash, or be exposed to environmental toxins. 
Finucane et al. (2000)
 suggested that rather than race and gender involving biologically determined risks, perceived differences in risk might in fact have a sociocultural explanation relating to resources as a function of one's relative position in society: Because on average White men are more likely than members of other groups to hold positions of power and privilege, risky situation may indeed pose less of a threat to them than to those who are relatively less powerful and disadvantaged.
Other studies have also observed a White Male Effect, including with respect to risks relating to the environment, guns and abortion 
(Kahan et al., 2007)
, nuclear power 
(Rivers et al., 2010)
, and finance 
(Palmer, 2003)
. The current research explored the potential presence of a White Male Effect in people's perception of the risk of dying as a function of contracting the coronavirus during the core periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021. In other words, we investigated whether the subjectively perceived mortality risk due to a highly contagious illness varied systematically across people with a different sociodemographic background. Using a nationally representative longitudinal dataset provided by the Understanding America Study at the University of Southern California, we tested this hypothesis over the time course of April 1, 2020 until July 21, 2021. We predicted that White men would have the lowest perceived risk of COVID-19 mortality compared to White women, non-White men and non-White women.


WHITE MALE EFFECT IN PERCEIVED COVID-19 MORTALITY RISK 4
Previous research documented a White Male Effect in the hesitancy to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, such that White men found it to be the least risky to get vaccinated, while Black women were the most fearful of serious side effects 
(Shapiro et al., 2022)
. This qualitative study was conducted via interviews with 24 individuals. In contrast, our quantitative study investigated data from thousands of participants, and importantly, we also linked participants' subjective morality risk perceptions with the actual risk of dying from the COVID-19 disease, as reflected in official mortality data.
Throughout the pandemic evidence suggested racial and gender disparities in COVID-19 deaths across the United States, such that men had a higher mortality rate than women, and non-Whites had a higher mortality rate than Whites 
(Rushovich, Boulicault & Chen, 2021;
Gausman & Langer, 2020
 


2021
. The same set of participants were invited each time. Alongside other questions, they rated their subjectively perceived risk of dying from COVID-19, on a scale from 0 to 100, with the following wording: "If you do get the coronavirus, what is the percent chance you will die from it? If you're not sure, please give your best guess." The first wave was a pilot study, which differed from surveys in subsequent waves in terms of variables and sampling method, and we therefore disregarded it. We analyzed 28 waves of data between April 1, 2020 and July 21, 2021.
Objective COVID-19 Mortality Risk. To link COVID-19 mortality risk perceptions with actually observed risk of death by demographic group, we relied on data collected by the


COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data administered by the Center for Disease and
Control 
(CDC)
. The CDC data recorded COVID-19 deaths from January 1, 2020 onward. We analyzed the data for the same timeframe as the UAS data noted above, namely April 1, 2020 to July 21, 2021. In contrast to the UAS surveys, however, the CDC data are not weighted to reflect the demographic make-up of the U.S. population. We therefore used the American Community Survey Microdata Analysis Tool (ACS -MDAT), provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, to obtain the proportion of each demographic group represented in the American population. In other words, we used census data to compare the observed number of COVID-19 deaths by demographic group to the number of deaths that would be expected if they were proportional to the demographic composition of the U.S. population.


Results
Across 28 waves, the UAS sample contained 8,339 unique individuals who participated in the bi-weekly surveys. The average participant was 49.32 years old, with an annual household WHITE MALE EFFECT IN PERCEIVED COVID-19 MORTALITY RISK 6 income between $40,000 and 49,999, and in terms of education, had achieved an Associate's degree. Regarding the demographic breakdown, there were 2,705 White men, 3,709 White women, 693 non-White men, and 1,232 non-White women. Attrition rates were calculated as the number of participants in each wave divided by the total number of unique participants, with resulting retention rates ranging between 64.77% and 75.87%.
Subjective Perceptions of COVID-19 Mortality Risk. We hypothesized that being a White male was associated with a lower perceived COVID-19 mortality risk, and first visually examined a descriptive representation of death risk estimates organized by the demographic groups of White Men, White Women, Non-White Men and Non-White Women. As illustrated in 
Figure 1
, at each time point the mean estimates by White Men were lower than those of the other demographic groups.
------------------------------------Insert Figure 1 about here---------------------------------------
As an inferential test we used the lmerTest package in R to conduct a linear mixed model with demographic group as our main predictor of interest. We controlled for variables that might influence participants' risk perceptions, namely age, household income, and education.
Additionally, given that personal experiences with COVID-19 could also affect one's mortality risk perceptions, we controlled for the number of hospitalizations and deaths by close friends or family that had occurred in a given participant's life. Furthermore, because daily interactions with others can result in greater virus exposure, we also included work patterns and living arrangements, operationalized as the number of days that a participant indicated to be working from home in a workweek, as well as the size of the household they lived in. Consistent with the descriptive data, we found that demographic group was a significant predictor of COVID-19 mortality risk perceptions (β = -3.50, SE = 0.49, t = -7.10, p < .001).
Other demographic variables also showed significant effects, such that age was positively associated with risk estimates, while household income and education were negatively associated. Of additional relevance, the greater the number of close others who had either been hospitalized, or died from COVID-19, the higher was a given participant's estimate of dying from it as well (see 
Table 1
).
As a next step, we examined which of the three other demographic groups differed significantly in their risk estimates from White men. To do so we conducted a one-way repeated measures ANCOVA that included the same covariates as the linear mixed model described above. This analysis showed the same effect across groups, F(3, 76378) = 322.99, p < 0.001.  While the CDC statistics are informative, they do not take into account the proportion of demographic groups across the population. For example, the somewhat higher number of fatalities in White Men might be due to the fact that they are a majority group. Thus, in order to arrive at death counts proportional to the overall number of individuals in a given demographic group, we consulted the ACS-MDAT provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, which provides five-year estimates of the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS). We then examined the number of recorded deaths by demographic group, and their respective proportions in the total number of recorded deaths, as well as their proportion in the American population (see 


Discussion
Examining people's COVID-19 mortality risk perceptions over the course of more than a year of the pandemic, we showed that White men evaluated the risk of dying from COVID-19 to be much lower than did other demographic groups. Furthermore, with the exception of White women, members of different demographic groups were relatively accurate about their personal mortality risk given the observed mortality proportion of each group in the population. The latter finding is consistent with the observation that women adopted more precautionary behaviors during the pandemic than men and reported higher worry about the outbreak, as well as less negative attitudes toward quarantine restrictions 
(Prati, Stefani, & Barbieri, 2022)
. This research was conducted with an Italian sample, which presumably was largely White, and therefore did not examine the interaction of gender and race, as we did in our study.
It is worth noting that in line with a resource interpretation of the White Male Effect, we WHITE MALE EFFECT IN PERCEIVED COVID-19 MORTALITY RISK 11 also found that mortality risk was perceived to be higher by participants who were older, less affluent and less educated than their counterparts. Indeed, when faced with a serious health threat-or any life adversity, for that matter-being White, male, young, wealthy and educated is likely to offer numerous advantages. Thus, subjective perceptions probably often track actual coping capabilities, as indeed we also observed with respect to official fatality rates.
When individuals consider a health threat for themselves, having an implicit sense of the threat to one's own health may be appropriate. It becomes highly problematic, however, when individuals occupy positions of power that involve wide-ranging decision making capacities over other people, as is disproportionally the case for White men. In such cases their decisions may not have taken into account the relatively more precarious living conditions of other demographic groups that did not enjoy the same level of occupationally low risks of coronavirus exposure (e.g., office-based work vs. service industries) and the same resources (e.g., access to health-care facilities) to treat the illness if contracted.
Our results may help explain why U.S. states with women governors (most of whom were White) fared better regarding Covid-19 outcomes early in the pandemic than male governors did: Because White women generally perceive the severe risks arising from COVID-19 to be greater, they might have acted sooner and more decisively than their male counterparts 
(Sergent & Stajkovic 2020)
. Similarly, negative consequences of the coronavirus, including death counts, were lower in countries led by women, likely because they implemented lockdowns earlier than their male colleagues 
(Garikipati & Kambhampati, 2021)
. Importantly, this pattern was observed across 194 countries while matching countries along a number of economic and sociodemographic variables. This suggests that not only cognitive processes related to risk varied by demographic background of decision makers, as our research showed,
Figure 2). The results indicate that although White men account for 35.85% of the population, they only constituted 27.32% of the observed COVID-19 deaths.WHITE MALE EFFECT IN PERCEIVED COVID-19 MORTALITY RISK 10 ------------------------------------Insert Figure 2 about here---------------------------------------Therefore, White men's perceptions of relatively low risks had a justifiable basis in reality, since they were indeed less likely to die from COVID-19 than would statistically be expected.Similarly, with a mortality proportion in the population that was around double of what would be expected given the demographic break-down of the US population, the risk perceptions of both Non-White men and Non-White women reflected their objectively disproportionate likelihood of dying. In contrast, while the actual mortality proportion of White women in the population was practically identical to that of men, and also lower (25.17%) than would be expected based on their demographic representation (36.65%), they had inflated mortality risk perceptions that likely overestimated the actual health risk posed by contracting COVID-19.

To relate subjective COVID-19 mortality risk perceptions to the objectives real-world risk of dying of COVID-19, we examined the COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data provided by the CDC for the same time range as the UAS data set (i.e., April 1, 2020 to July 21, 2021). Only cases that were lab-confirmed for COVID-19 and contained complete race and gender information were included. This resulted in 542,940 officially recorded deaths, with the breakdown into demographic groups noted inTable
Follow-up Tukey's range tests and simple effect analysis, controlling for all covariates, showed that White men (controlled M = 9.40, 95% CI = [9.17, 9.63]) had significantly lower risk perceptions than each of the other demographic groups, namely White Women (controlled M = 11.52, 95% CI = [11.32, 11.72]), Non-White Men (controlled M = 12.91, 95% CI = [12.47, 9 2.
