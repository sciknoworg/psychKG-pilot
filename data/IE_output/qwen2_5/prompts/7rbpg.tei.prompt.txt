You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Hypertension, the leading global cause of disability-adjusted life-years in 2016 
(Gakidou et al, 2017)
, is the major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke worldwide 
(Forouzanfar et al., 2017)
, and it is a significant public health concern 
(World Health Organization, 2013)
.
Hypertension control is multifactorial and challenging 
(Carey et al, 2018)
, often requiring patients to make significant and lifelong behavioural changes, including taking medications.
Although antihypertensive drugs are known to be clinically effective and a key component in controlling the disease, almost half of patients do not take their medications as prescribed 
(Sabate´, 2003)
. Alongside pharmacological treatments, adopting non-pharmacological strategies such as a healthy diet and regular physical activity is crucial for comprehensive blood pressure management 
(Whelton et al., 2018)
. Accordingly, low adherence to treatment including adherence to lifestyle modification (LMA) and medication adherence (MA) are the most common cause of uncontrolled hypertension 
(Sabate´, 2003)
. Thus, exploring methods of engaging patients in necessary lifestyle modification is therefore a key research priority 
(Carey et al, 2018)
.
Illness Perceptions (IP) (or cognitions) are defined according to the Common-Sense Model as the patient's implicit common-sense perceptions of the illness, which play a major role in patients' adherence to treatment across conditions, including hypertension 
(Kucukarslan, 2011;
Leventhal et al, 2016)
. Illness cognitions encompass various aspects of an individual's perception and understanding of the illness. These include illness identity (symptoms experienced by the individual), cause (causal beliefs of the illness), timeline (individual perceptions of the illness duration), personal control/cure (beliefs about the illness controllability by the patient), treatment control/cure (beliefs about the illness controllability by treatment), consequences (the impacts of the illness on the individual's daily life), coherence (the coherence and usefulness of individual's representations of the illness), and emotional representation (the emotional responses elicited by the illness) 
(Leventhal et al., 2003;
Moss-Morris et al., 2002)
. 
Chen et al (2011)
 found that patient perceptions of cause, identity and control of illness may directly affect their adherence to prescribed medications. Illness control also has a direct effect on patient self-management behaviours. 
Spikes et al (2020)
 reported the effect of illness consequences on MA in patients with hypertension. While 
Rajpura & Nayak (2014)
 reported a positive relationship between IP and MA, recent studies failed to identify any significant associations between patients' views of hypertension and their adherence to medications 
(Al Noumani et al, 2018;
Durand et al, 2018)
.
Numerous studies have explored the links between IP dimensions and MA. However, the specific characteristics and dynamics of these associations are yet to be fully elucidated.
Patient-and provider-related predictors of poor adherence to hypertension treatment are often intertwined 
(Carey et al, 2018)
. The concept of the Working Alliance (WA), initially introduced in the context of psychotherapy by 
Bordin (1979)
, is also applicable in describing the dynamics of the physician-patient interaction. According to 
Fuertes et al (2017)
, this relationship is defined by three key components: a mutual understanding and agreement on the treatment goals, a consensus regarding the specific responsibilities and tasks that both the provider and patient undertake to achieve these goals, and the level of mutual trust that exists between the two parties.
In the context of physician-patient relationship, physicians' explanations on how to control the illness may modify IP and indirectly improve adherence 
(Swain et al, 2015)
. Although a poor patient-provider relationship is identified as a consistent predictor of low MA in hypertension 
(Fuertes et al, 2015;
Świątoniowska-Lonc et al, 2020)
, it is unclear how and what aspects of this relationship are related to MA 
(Van der Laan et al, 2017)
. There is also insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions about how a therapeutic relationship enhances LMA in patients with hypertension 
(Jones et al, 2012;
Swain et al, 2015)
.
Considering the limited evidence regarding the combined effects of IP and the physician-patient relationship on the hypertensive patients' adherence especially to lifestyle modifications, the current study aimed to understand the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the combined effects of IP and the physician-patient relationship on treatment adherence in hypertensive patients. To achieve this, we conducted a mixed methods study to determine the role of IP and the quality of physician-patient relationship in adherence in patients with essential hypertension, including MA and LMA.


Methods


Study Design
To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem, we adopted a mixed methods approach 
(Creswell et al, 2011)
. This study used an explanatory sequential design in which a first quantitative phase was conducted, the findings of which sequentially informed the second qualitative phase, which aimed to further explain the quantitative results ( 
Figure 1
). Thus, we first collected and analysed patients' quantitative data to determine the value of IP and the physician-patient relationship in predicting patient's adherence. A small subset of patients was then purposefully recruited to participate in the qualitative phase. The in-depth interviews explored the patients' perspectives on how IP and their physician-patient relationship influence their adherence.
The study was conducted in a cardiovascular disease-dedicated hospital located in a metropolitan city from April to December 2017. This setting was selected due to its high influx of patients with essential hypertension from various socio-economic backgrounds, providing a diverse This manuscript is accepted for publication by European Journal of Health Psychology on Feb 05, 2024 8 sample for the study and making our findings applicable to a broad patient population. The study procedure was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the [authors' affiliation] (approval number: 830).


Quantitative Phase


Participants
The first phase utilised a cross-sectional survey design. We used G*Power software (version 3.1.9.2) 
(Faul et al, 2009)
 to calculate the required sample size for linear multiple regression with four predictors including IP and three aspects of the physician-patient relationship, based on alpha level at 0.05, power at 0.9, and a medium effect size at 0.15, drawing from previous research on the effects of IP 
(Chen et al, 2009)
 and the physician-patient relationship 
(Schoenthaler et al, 2012)
 on adherence to therapeutic regimens of patients with hypertension.
Considering a dropout rate of 10%, we increased the estimated sample size (n = 108) and recruited 120 eligible patients with essential hypertension, among all those referred to the hospital from April to June 2017. Out of the total sample, 8 patients who initially gave informed consent refused to participate in the study during the data collection. Then, our sample consisted of 112 patients. We also conducted the data cleaning process, as described in the supplementary results, leaving finally 110 patients for all analyses. The following criteria for inclusion were utilised (1) participants who gave informed consent for participation; (2) aged over 18 years; 
3
diagnosis by a specialist physician at least 6 months before participation, due to an opportunity for lifestyle modification; (4) the patient must have attended at least three treatment session before participation, to ensure recent communication with their physician; (5) be prescribed any type of antihypertensive medication; (6) not prescribed psychiatric drugs, and (7) not being hospitalized or receiving emergency medical care at the time of participation.
As shown in 
Table 1
, 61.8% (n = 68) of the patients were male, with a mean age of 55 ± 11.22 years. The mean age of women (n = 42) was 58 ± 8.86 years. About 86% (n = 36) of women and 10% (n = 7) of men were unemployed. The mean number of consultations for antihypertensive therapy was 13.04 ± 17.38. Among all the patients, 60.9 % (n = 67) had one or more of the following comorbid conditions: diabetes, cardiovascular, renal, or respiratory diseases. Also, 23.6% (n = 26) of patients suffered from common mental health problems (such as anxiety or depression).Data Collection Patients were provided with a set of four validated questionnaires in Persian language: (1) Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire 
(Broadbent et al, 2006)
 consisting of eight items related to dimensions of IP, based on Common-Sense Model, rated on a 0-10 scale. These dimensions are consequences, timeline, personal control, treatment control, identity, coherence, emotional representation, and illness concern. In addition, there is an item asking patients to identify the three most important factors that they believed have caused their illness. According to 
Broadbent et al (2006)
, we removed this item for quantitative analyses. The internal consistency reliability of the scale for the current study was acceptable (alpha = 0.84); (2) Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised 
(Munder et al, 2010)
 which was slightly modified to assess the physician-patient relationship, based on 
Bordin's (1979)
 model of WA, with three subscales included physicianpatient agreement on therapeutic goals, agreement on therapeutic tasks, and emotional bonds.
This 12-item inventory consisting of four items per subscale is rated on a 1-5 scale. We tested the reliability of the scale and subscales for the current study using Cronbach's alpha, which indicated satisfactory (0.88 for all items, 0.70 for agreement on goals, 0.68 for agreement on tasks and 0.84 for the emotional bond); (3) Medication Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale 
(Ogedegbe et al, 2003)
 for measuring the patients' adherence to antihypertensive This manuscript is accepted for publication by European Journal of Health Psychology on Feb 05, 2024 10 pharmacotherapy. This scale consists of 26 items representing various life situations and is rated on a 1-3 scale. In our study, we obtained a Cronbach's alpha of 0.93 for this scale; and (4) Therapeutic Adherence Scale for Hypertensive Patients for Lifestyle Modifications 
(He, 2015)
 consisting of 11 items rated on a 1-5 scale to assess the patients' LMA behaviours in smoking and alcohol management, and daily life management including diet, exercise, and coping with stress. Measures 1-3 have been previously used in Persian 
(Bagherian-Sararoudi et al, 2010;
Nikfarjam, 2012;
Saffari et al, 2015)
.
The current study represents the first use of aforementioned scale 4 in Persian. We used the translation-back translation method, and the translated questionnaire was modified and evaluated by an expert panel of three psychologists, a psychiatrist, and a cardiologist. The Cronbach's alpha of 0.85 was then obtained for the reliability of the final version of this scale in a pilot study involving 35 hypertensive patients. The Cronbach's alpha value for the main study was 0.75.
After completing all the questionnaires, patients received a self-help hypertension educational package with some general guidelines for hypertension control including physical activity, diet, stress coping skills, etc.


Data Analysis
We used SPSS (version 22) to perform all analyses. Macro PROCESS (version 2.16.3) 
(Hayes, 2013)
 to conduct the mediation analysis. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. We used percentages and mean ± Standard Deviation (SD) to describe patient characteristics. We applied multiple regression models to assess the effects of IP and WA on both LMA and MA.


Case Selection
To gain greater insight into how IP and the physician-patient relationship influence patients' adherence, we utilised a multiple case study design. Using maximum variation sampling, we considered patients' scores on predictors, IP and WA, to purposefully select the patients. We initially created a matrix consisting of patients divided into three groups, each comprising three individuals. These groups were categorized based on their performance scores on two predictor measures, with one group exhibiting the highest scores, another group displaying average scores, and the last group exhibiting the lowest scores. Subsequently, we enlisted three patients, one from each group, whose demographic characteristics were maximally different from each other, to be approached for the qualitative phase 
(Figure 1
). 
Creswell and Poth (2018)
 recommended that three to five cases are typically suitable for case studies, and emphasised that the smaller the number of cases, the higher the quality of the in-depth analysis needs to be.


Qualitative Phase
Interview schedule Development Following the quantitative data analysis, we aimed to understand how the patients' experiences of the concepts explored in this study explain the quantitative results. Then, we developed the open-ended questions with follow-up prompts into an interview schedule to explore the patients' perspectives on the role of their perceptions from hypertension and relationship with a physician in their adherence to treatment. Based on the interview schedule refinement framework (Castillo-Montoya, 2016), we adapted the schedule through pilot testing with a patient with essential hypertension. The final interview schedule included eight questions ( 
Supplementary Table S2)
 considering the meaning of each variable and the contribution of the predictors to both adherence variables from the patients' viewpoint.


Data Collection
Having obtained written permissions from the medical secretaries as gatekeepers, and each participant, we collected data from multiple sources 
(Table 2)
, between October and December 2017, to gain a more in-depth understanding of patients' experiences. The data collection methods were (1) semi-structured interviews, as the primary data collection strategy; (2) the corresponding pilot-tested interviews with a family member of each participant; (3) the complete observation of the physician-patient relationship, using an observational protocol (Supplementary 
Figure S1)
, and (4) the four-week journal, in which patients were weekly asked to reflect on their experiences and answer a set of questions outlined in a paper form corresponding to the interview schedule. The first author researcher kept a reflective, field journals throughout the process. After completing the qualitative phase, participants received a gift card of 500,000 IRR (about £10) as a reward for participation.


Data Analysis
We adopted a cross-case synthesis approach to compare any within-case patterns in detail across the cases 
(Yin, 2018)
. A qualitative thematic analysis was performed to identify the emerging themes. We did not have any preconceived themes before data collection to ensure that the codes were derived directly from the patients' own words 
(Creswell, 2012)
. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and during this process each interview was preliminarily explored. We then used open coding and in vivo codes to develop descriptions and themes for each case. To uncover similarities, differences and recurring patterns across the cases, we used a case-based approach to construct word tables containing codes and themes derived from each unique case 
(Yin, 2018)
. We finally developed overarching themes that cut across cases. MAXQDA (version 12) was used to organise the data for analysis. To ensure the trustworthiness of our findings, we adopted four qualitative validation strategies recommended by 
Creswell and Poth (2018)
. These included triangulation, member checking, thick descriptions, and bracketing. We triangulated data from the different sources i.e. the interviews, journals, field notes, and observations. The accurate representation of the participants' experiences was ensured through member checking.
We presented findings to participants to read and check our interpretation of their experience. To deeply understand participants' lived experience, we provided thick descriptions of them.
Although the first author tried to bracket his personal experiences regarding the study problem, it is acknowledged that his role as a health care provider may have unintentionally affected data analysis.


Results


Quantitative Data Analysis
In multiple regression analyses (see 
Supplementary Table S1
 for correlations among predictors and 
Table 3
 for the analyses), only WA was an independent predictor of MA and explained 7% of its variability, a small effect size, whereas both IP and WA were independent predictors of LMA and cumulatively explained 14.4% of its variability, a medium effect size. As shown in 
Table 3
, IP was negatively associated with LMA, indicating patients who found their hypertension less threatening were more adherent to lifestyle modification.
In the multiple regression model, all WA dimensions were predictors of MA 
(Table 3)
.
Nevertheless, the emotional bond was a suppressor variable, because of its bivariate correlations with agreement on goals (r = 0.72; p < 0.001) and tasks (r = 0.55; p < 0.001), non-correlation with MA (r = 0.07; p = 0.26), and negative association with MA. As presented in 
Table 3, LMA
 was predicted by none of the WA dimensions. However, the statistically significant correlation between agreement on tasks and LMA (r = 0.28; p = 0.004), and the statistically non-significant regression coefficients in the model provided evidence of a multiple mediation model, in which the emotional bond indirectly predicted LMA (ß: 1.90; 95% bias-corrected bootstrap CI: 0.04 to 5.39) through agreement on goals and tasks, respectively. Additional methodological details of the multiple mediation analysis can be found in the supplementary materials (see the supplementary results; Supplementary 
Figure S2
; 
Supplementary Table S3
; and Supplementary 
Figure S3
). 
Table 4
 provides case demographics and scores for the qualitative phase. Case study participants are depicted with pseudonymised patient name identifiers. Based on the mean ± SD and range values of both predictors in the quantitative phase, Tina, Said, and Arash were identified with the highest, moderate and lowest score respectively.


Qualitative Theme Analysis


Case Description
Tina, 56 years, living in Tehran, had been married for 46 years. She had been suffering from hypertension for over 10 years attributed to stress. Tina had a heart attack in an emergency room in June 2008 and was immediately visited by a "compassionate" physician. As a result of angiography, she was referred to Tehran Heart Center for open-heart surgery. At the beginning of the interview, Tina was too anxious to focus on the questions, but she gradually relaxed. We summarised emergent themes from the case narratives as a sample of within-case thematic findings in the supplementary results.
Said, 57 years, living in Karaj, had been married for 28 years. Said has a history of rheumatic heart disease and had been suffering from hypertension for over 30 years. He was referred to the centre because of cardiomegaly in July 2010. Following angiography, he underwent heart surgery. During the interview, Said frequently used gesticulation and facial expressions to accurately convey his experiences with hypertension to the interviewer.
Arash, 67 years, living in Tehran, had been married for 35 years. He had been suffering from hypertension for eight years. Arash was referred to the centre due to heart arrhythmias in 2012.
Following angiography in April 2017, he underwent angioplasty in the centre. At the beginning of the interview, Arash had a relatively negative attitude toward discussing the topics included in the interview schedule, but his engagement gradually increased with the help of the interviewer.


Cross-Case Themes
We explored six themes from the cross-case thematic analysis to answer the qualitative questions related to quantitative results (see Supplementary 
Figure S4
 for within-case and cross-case thematic layers).
Negative emotional representations of illness. "Fear of the dangerous consequences of hypertension like infarction and stroke", was a strong motivation for taking antihypertensive medications. This was clearly stated by one patient and inferred by the other two patients.
Negative emotions about the illness as a traumatic event were described as having a direct association with medication use.


Personal control based on understanding illness causes. Patients improved their lifestyle first
by understanding the hypertension causes, including "stress," and then "accepting" and learning about the illness and its control. The perceptions regarding the effectiveness of the hypertension control depended on the attitude toward the condition. For example, "not being afraid" of the illness reduced stress and helped the patient "enjoy" the lifestyle change.
The attitude of a physician to an experienced patient. Based on patients' lived experiences, if a physician performing the "specialised" task of "prescribing medication" "listens" to the patients' experiences of taking medication, and uses shared decision making, the patients' MA will improve.
Acceptance and non-judgement of a patient by a physician. From the patients' viewpoint, a physician is a "specialised" and consequently trustworthy person who not only provides "lifestyle advice" and information about hypertension but "accepts" patients who are suffering from "stress" and difficult living conditions. The acceptance of the patient is achieved through unconditional physicians' respect for the patient and empathetic, "compassionate listening" to the patient.
Differences in the attitude of a physician to a patient. Listening to patients' experiences and using shared decision making for taking medication improved MA, compared with unconditional compassionate accepting the suffering patient, which enhanced LMA, identified different attitudes of the physician to the patient regarding adherence types.


Cultural beliefs about a physician.
The physician played a more important role than IP in LMA.
The high status of a physician in patients' opinion is rooted in Iranian cultural beliefs. This both enhanced patients' trust in the physician and raised patients' expectations of the physician providing information about controlling hypertension by changing lifestyle, which in turn increased LMA.


Mixed Methods Inference
We found high congruence between the quantitative and qualitative results, with the qualitative results describing more thoroughly the relationships found within the quantitative findings. 
Table   5
 details the mixed methods inferences of the study. Cultural beliefs about a physician, for example, identified the more critical role of WA than IP in LMA, elaborating on the related statistical inference. We made all mixed methods inferences about the effects of IP and WA on MA and LMA from merging all the quantitative and qualitative results of the study.


Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first mixed methods study examining the combined effects of illness perceptions and the physician-patient relationship on both medication and lifestyle modification adherence for hypertension. In the first phase of this explanatory sequential study, adhering to antihypertensive medication was only associated with a desirable physician-patient relationship, whereas adhering to lifestyle modification was associated with perceiving hypertension as a less-threatening illness, and a satisfactory physician-patient relationship. In the second phase, six qualitative themes, reflecting the patients' experience of the illness, their relationship with physicians, and their adherence, supported the quantitative results.
The current study findings regarding the lack of association between IP and MA are consistent with a previous study finding in an Omani primary care population 
(Al Noumani et al, 2018)
.
Additionally, these findings contrast with 
Rajpura & Nayak's (2014)
 report of a positive relationship between IP and MA. However, our mixed methods results revealed that only negative emotional representation of illness, one of the IP dimensions, may motivate patients to take medications. A threatening view of hypertension, particularly being cognisant of possible consequences of not taking medications, improves MA 
(Durand et al, 2020)
. Patients with hypertension appear to develop fear-based responses to the illness as a traumatic event, and may choose to take medication as a coping strategy 
(Leventhal et al, 2016)
. We found that patients' perception of their ability to control hypertension enhanced LMA. This finding supports the earlier research conducted with Taiwanese patients with essential hypertension, which showed that among all the IP dimensions perception of personal illness control is the most important predictor of good LMA 
(Chen et al, 2011)
. Gaining a sense of potential illness control through attributing illness causes to daily habits leads to an optimistic view of hypertension and increases the patients' self-efficacy 
(Bandura, 1989;
Lau-Walker, 2004)
 to develop problem-focused coping strategies 
(Hagger & Orbell, 2003)
 and adopt a healthy lifestyle.
Consistent with prior studies in hypertensive patients 
(Swain et al, 2015;
Schoenthaler et al, 2018;
Świątoniowska-Lonc et al, 2020)
, this study explored associations of the physician-patient relationship with MA and LMA. We observed that agreement on tasks and goals contributed to MA. Some support for this was established in a recent study reporting shared and active decision making, functionally similar to the physician-patients agreements, improved MA 
(Schoenthaler et al, 2018)
. Listening to patients' experiences about the amount, timing, and side effects of antihypertensive medication facilitates physicians to provide relevant informational support on medication use and engage in shared decision making, which increases MA 
(Swain et al, 2015;
Ampofo et al, 2020)
. However, improving LMA is based on the acceptance of the patients, including the physician's warmth and empathy with the patients 
(Farber & Doolin, 2011
).
Physicians' openness and communication skills can facilitate patients expressing concerns and experiences 
(Hartley & Repede, 2011)
, increasing the patients' trust in the physician, and the patients' satisfaction 
(Fuertes et al, 2015;
Świątoniowska-Lonc et al, 2020)
, and has a substantial impact on LMA improvement 
(Fuertes et al, 2017)
. The physician's warmth also enhances the patients' self-efficacy, autonomy, and involvement in care 
(Martin et al, 2003;
Fuertes et al, 2009)
, and improves LMA. Compared to MA, our findings demonstrated that the emotional bond played a more significant role than agreement on tasks in LMA because modifying illnessrelated life routines is more complex than taking medication. These findings are supported by a study of 200 hypertensive patients in US primary care clinics, which showed no association between patient trust in physicians and MA, while patients with higher trust in their physicians reported more attempts to lose weight, reduce salt and increase exercise 
(Jones et al, 2012)
.
Thus, trusting in the compassionate physician who understands the difficulties of the patients' life acts as a supportive resource and empowers the patients to overcome barriers to behaviour change by providing a sense of safety.
Cultural beliefs and attitudes about the physician, originating from members involved in the patient social network 
(McConnell, 2017)
, are a component of the Cultural Health Capital framework, a specific form of cultural capital that shapes the expectations and experiences of physicians and patients about patient-centred care, and their healthcare interactions 
(Shim, 2010)
.
Concerning the patients' biopsychosocial context, cultural-spiritual beliefs thus have remarkable implications for lifestyle modification and medication use 
(Kucukarslan , 2011;
McIntosh et al, 2020)
. In Iranian culture, a physician's expertise, which is reflected in the physician's clinical skills and patient satisfaction, plays a vital role in building a strong emotional bond and patients' trust in the physician. This cultural health norm can even lead to LMA before a favourable physician-patient relationship is established. Further research, especially coming from low-and middle-income countries, should provide a detailed understanding of the contribution of cultural health capital in controlling hypertension as an asymptomatic chronic disease.
Our study's strengths include the mixed methods design using rigorous quantitative and qualitative procedures which is rarely used in the field of adherence research in hypertension 
(Campbell et al, 2017)
, studying less-researched LMA for hypertension, and examining the physician-patient relationship based on a pan-theoretical model of the therapeutic relationship 
(Bordin, 1979)
.
There were, however, limitations to the current study. The quantitative phase used a correlational design; therefore, we cannot infer causal associations among variables. Although the sample was small and patients were studied at a single, large metropolitan cardiovascular hospital, we carefully fulfilled important quality criteria of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research, such as performing a detailed quantitative data cleaning, ensuring qualitative trustworthiness and fully integrating the quantitative and qualitative research. In addition, Medication Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale indirectly measures MA through patients' personal beliefs about antihypertensive medication use, but does not specifically measure behaviours.
However, the scale is a valid and reliable instrument 
(AlGhurair et al, 2012;
Saffari et al, 2015)
. This could also be the reason for our incongruent results with some studies that revealed an association between IP and MA 
(Rajpura & Nayak, 2014;
Spikes et al, 2020)
, when using a questionnaire to assess medication-taking behaviours like the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale 
(Morisky et al, 1986)
 or Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale 
(Kripalani et al, 2009)

Data Cleaning
All missing values were completely at random. We replaced the missing values on all variables by performing multiple imputations. Thus, the pooled results of imputed datasets were considered for all analyses. We implemented power transformations to improve homoscedasticity, pairwise linearity, skewness, and kurtosis of MA and WA variables. One case with an extremely low z score on LMA and 1 case through Mahalanobis distance were respectively identified as the univariate and multivariate outliers with p <.001. We deleted these cases, leaving 110 patients for analysis.


Multiple Mediation Analysis
We tested all of 12 possible mediation models with WA dimensions as predictors and LMA as the outcome variable ( 
Figure S2
). Finally, in only one regression-based serial multiple mediation analysis 
(Table S3
), the emotional bond was an independent predictor of agreement on goals (ß:
1.18 [95% CI: 0.96 to 1.40]; p < 0.001), which in turn independently predicted agreement on tasks 


Sample Within-Case Thematic Finding


Tina


Illness Causes
Tina considered stress and "nervousness" to be the primary and enduring cause of high blood pressure, mainly due to family conflicts and her "obsessions": "... That my husband is not in tune with me makes me very nervous and upset. I used to cry at night until morning ... but I always do my best at home, cooking and cleaning, in the best way, and I don't let the illness get me down."


Illness Control
From the patient's point of view, "accepting" the illness was the first step in controlling hypertension. Another issue related to illness control was Tina's particular attention to media information, especially about nutrition. However, an important motivating factor for Tina's illness control was her "fear of the dangerous consequences of hypertension like infarction and stroke"
and "no relaxation" that had a direct impact on drug use: "I am afraid of an infarction... I'm scared to come back to the Heart Center, so I'm trying to control myself at home."

Tina believed that accurate "examining," "diagnosing," "explaining" the patient's medical condition, and giving advice on lifestyle and "prescribing medication" are the usual duties of any better to deal with life and its problems."


Emotional Bonds with the Physician
For the patient, "trust" in the physician was the most influential component in the therapeutic relationship and the cause of "satisfaction" and optimism in the physician. Examining the patient thoroughly, giving a full explanation of the condition, and prescribing the medication according to the patient's "medical history" made Tina "calm" and then increased her trust in the physician:
"My doctor looks at my medical record and repeatedly tells me "Look at the result of the ECG, your heart beats like the heart of a healthy person" ... He never gives me a prescription based on general instructions ... It all means calmness." In addition to trust, the unconditional acceptance of the patient by the physician through "being kind" and empathetic, "compassionate, listening" to the patient improved the quality of the emotional bonds with the physician.


Shared Decision Making
Tina only made limited shared decisions on medication. She did not "dare" to change the amount or timing of taking medications, although the physician was "confident" of the patient's careful attention to the drugs and their side effects: "The doctor tells me that you are well-versed in the drugs, and you can take them less when you are well ... but I dare not."

Practice ImplicationsOur findings have important implications for clinicians and researchers. Engaging patients in shared decision making on medication use, and accepting them compassionately and unconditionally improve MA and LMA, respectively. Furthermore, physicians' depiction of essential hypertension as a controllable less-threatening illness, not "a silent killer", facilitates the illness management through empowering patients for LMA. Given our results are preliminary evidence, additional research is needed to develop multifaceted, multilevel interventions that address the fear-related mechanisms leading to patient avoidance of health behaviours. These behaviour change interventions within the biopsychosocial framework should incorporate components of the cultural health capital to improve adherence in patients with hypertension.ConclusionsAdhering to antihypertensive medication was associated with a favourable physician-patient relationship. The physician who considers the patients' experiences of taking medication, and makes shared decisions motivates the patients for MA, although negative emotional representations of hypertension may help the patients take medication as an illness coping strategy. Adopting a healthy lifestyle was associated with a less-threatening perception of hypertension, and a well-founded physician-patient relationship. The patient who perceives hypertension as a controllable illness modifies illness-related daily habits. However, the compassionate physician who treats the patients without judgement and provides useful information about hypertension makes a more considerable contribution to the LMA of the patients, who holds cultural beliefs about the physician.Electronic SupplementaryMaterial ESM 1.

being aware or not of disease causes can have an impact on the lifestyle change, especially nutrition." doctor is like a mechanic who detects broken parts of the car … He says you should take this medicine, so I take it. But from now on, my experiences with medication are essential to talk to the doctor, and I expect my doctor to listen and, if necessary, change the prescription."

The results indicated the statistically significant indirect effect of the emotional bond on LMA (ß: 1.90; 95% bias-corrected bootstrap CI: 0.04 to 5.39) through agreement on goals and tasks, respectively (Figure S3). Number of bootstrap samples for bias-corrected bootstrap CIs were 10000.
