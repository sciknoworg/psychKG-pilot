You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Significance statement
The current study bridges joint action and behavioral economics research to demonstrate that people use action planning and execution cues to decide who is likely a reliable partner and who is untrustworthy in an economic interaction. This extends our understanding of human cooperative behavior by demonstrating that we understand each other's social preferences PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION 3 through cues present in actions and can make decisions in an interaction based on this.
Moreover, this work informs action understanding research by highlighting the utility of perception-action coupling beyond the understanding of intentions behind actions, by showing that perception-action coupling also allows us to use action cues to understand an actor's decision process as it unfolds.


PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION


4
A key driving factor behind humans' success as cooperators is the ability to prudently choose whom to interact with and whom to avoid. This ability to effectively select among potential partners stabilizes cooperation, motivating people to be fair, cooperative and trustworthy 
(Gächter & Thoni, 2005;
Barclay & Willer, 2007;
Andre & Baumard, 2011)
. By now, the kinds of cues that influence the perception of a (potential) cooperation partner have been well researched. For instance, individuals prefer those who exhibit generosity for the social good 
(Barclay & Willer, 2007)
; those who enforce norms by punishing transgressors 
(Kurzban, DeScioli & O'Brien, 2007)
, and those who are willing to share both the monetary and effort costs involved in cooperation 
(Hoffman, Yoeli & Nowak, 2015;
McEllin, Felber & Michael, 2022;
. Moreover, physical attributes, such as facial features 
(Bonnefon, Hopfensitz & De Neys, 2017)
 and voice (O'Connor & 
Barclay, 2017)
 or personal values such as political ideologies 
(Balliet, Tybur, Wu, Antonellis & Van Lange, 2018)
 and religious conviction 
(McCullough, Swartwout, Shaver, Carter & Sosis, 2016
) may be important for deciding who to interact with and who to avoid.
While the role of others' preferences, attributes, and values in partner choice have been established 
(Rossetti, Hilbe & Hauser, 2022)
, much less is known about whether the manner in which a potential partner plans and implements a decision provides helpful cues for partner choice. Across many domains, an actor's (un)certainty when making a decision is reflected in their response times 
(Hyman, 1953;
Vickers, 1970;
Greene, 2007)
. With regards to planning a decision in a cooperative interaction, it has been shown that decision time serves as an indicator of the extent to which an actor is deliberating, and is seen as more trustworthy 
(Jordan, Hoffman, Nowak & Rand, 2016)
. Cooperators who respond quickly can be described as 'intuitive cooperators' who cooperate without calculating, whereas those who respond slowly can be described as 'deliberative cooperators' who cooperate only after weighing the costs and benefits of cooperation 
(Rand, Greene & Nowak, 2012;
Bear & Rand, PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION 5 2016)
. Individuals are more likely to trust intuitive rather than deliberative cooperators in economic interactions 
(Hoffman, Yoeli, Rand, & Nowak, 2015;
Jordan et al. 2016)
, but the extent to which planning/decision time affects partner choice is unknown.
Concerning action execution, spatial and temporal characteristics of an actor's hand movements may reveal the extent to which they are certain or uncertain about a decision 
(Slepian, Young, Rutchick & Ambady, 2013;
Patel, Fleming & Kilner, 2012)
. Specifically related to implementing decisions in an economic interaction, the extent to which an actor is conflicted about a decision to cooperate or defect is reflected in their movement kinematics.
While actors that are unconflicted about an economic decision execute their decision by moving more smoothly and directly towards their chosen option, those conflicted by an economic decision move less smoothly and less directly towards their chosen option 
(Kieslich & Hilbig, 2014)
. It has been shown across different social interactions that the cues present in others' actions guide how we interact with them by informing us about their mental states 
(Wolpert, Doya & Kawato, 2003;
Cavallo et al. 2016;
Krishnan-Barman, Forbes, & Hamilton, 2017)
, raising the question whether action cues to certainty with regard to implementing a cooperative decision may also influence partner choice in economic interactions.
The current study aimed to investigate whether decision-time as a cue to the (un)certainty with which a decision was planned (Experiment 1) and movement smoothness and directness present in action execution as a cue to the (un)certainty with which a decision was implemented (Experiment 2) inform partner choice in an economic interaction. We employed two different economic games, to test whether our effects generalize between cooperative interactions with different incentive structures. We used the prisoner's dilemma 
(Rapoport, Chammah & Orwant, 1965
)a game in which two individuals can either choose to cooperate with their partner for a moderate mutual benefit if their partner also chooses to PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION 6 cooperate or defect for a large individual benefit, at the expense of their partner's benefit if their partner chooses to cooperate (while receiving nothing if their partner also chooses to defect). In this game, individuals' interests can either be aligned (in cases of cooperation) or opposed (in cases of defection). We also used the stag hunt 
(Skyrms, 2001
)a game in which individuals can either choose to coordinate with their partner for a large mutual benefit if their partner also chooses to coordinate (receiving a small benefit if their partner does not coordinate), or act alone for a moderate individual benefit regardless of their partner's choice.
Here individuals' interests are always aligned and cannot be opposed.
Participants watched two potential partners making a choice in a previous round of the economic game, before expressing which of these partners they wanted to play with in the same economic game. Notably, both potential partners made the same choice (i.e., cooperate or defect in the prisoners' dilemma and stag or hare in the stag-hunt), but differed with regards to either their decision planning or decision implementation: in Experiment 1 one potential partner would plan a decision quickly (i.e., with certainty) and one potential partner would plan a decision slowly (i.e., with uncertainty); in Experiment 2, one potential partner would implement their decision with smooth and direct movements (i.e., with certainty) and one potential partner would implement their decision with curved and jittery movements (i.e., with uncertainty). Participants watched a computer screen on which they saw a computerized version of the economic games with the two options presented in the top-left (e.g., cooperate) and top-right corners (e.g., defect) of the screen 
(Kieslich & Hilbig, 2014)
. The potential partners' decision times could be inferred from four loading dots lighting up over and over in sequence until the decision was made, and the chosen option was highlighted. In trials where participants received information about the potential partners' movements, they saw the partner's mouse cursor starting to move towards the response options with different amounts of jitter and following trajectories of varying straightness.


PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION


7
If participants use cues to certainty present in the planning of a decision to inform their partner choice, then they should prefer potential partners who planned prosocial decisions (i.e., decided to cooperate in the prisoner's dilemma or chose the stag in the staghunt game) with certainty (i.e., quickly) compared to potential partners who planned prosocial decisions with uncertainty (i.e., slowly). If participants rely on cues to certainty present during the implementation of a decision for making partner choices, they should prefer partners who implemented cooperative decisions with certainty (i.e., smooth and direct movements), compared to potential partners who implemented the same decisions with uncertainty (i.e., with jittery and indirect movements). We expected the effects of perceived certainty during decision making and decision implementation on partner choice to generalize across both games, because cues to certainty should increase the impression of a potential partner as a reliable individual with stronger pro-social preferences, regardless of the particular incentive structure.
With respect to selfish actors, (i.e., those who chose to defect in the prisoner's dilemma game or chose the hare in the stag-hunt game), our predictions were more open. On the one hand, participants may have different preferences for certain or uncertain selfish potential partners across contexts with other incentive structures. For instance, participants may prefer those who act selfishly with uncertainty in the prisoners' dilemma because an uncertain defector may be less likely to try and exploit them in the future compared to a certain defector, whilst preferring those who act selfishly with certainty in the stag hunt, as it makes their preferences clear concerning choosing the stag or hare. On the other hand, participants may have a general preference for potential partners who make and implement selfish decisions in an uncertain way, regardless of specific incentive structures. Finally, it might be the case that there is individual variation so that different participants exhibit different preferences when it comes to selfish choices (i.e., individual participants would not PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION 8 respond at chance level, but would show diverging preferences for either certain or uncertain selfish potential partners).

Data, analysis scripts, and experimental materials for all Experiments are available at: https://osf.io/yebvt/. Pre-registrations for Experiments are listed in their respective methods sections.


Experiment 1a: Method -Prisoners' Dilemma
The pre-registration for this study can be found at: https://aspredicted.org/ka8q9.pdf Participants A g*power analysis using pilot data (from 20 participants) for a Bonferroni corrected (for two comparisons) one sample t-test (d=.488, a= .025, p= .95) determined that we should collect 66 participants. Thus, we decided to collect 72 participants (after the replacement of excluded participants) to ensure equal counterbalancing. Using the Prolific recruitment platform (www.prolific.co) we recruited 92 participants (20 removed from the analysis because they did not meet our ore-registered inclusion criteria), with a mean age of 34.92 (SD = 11.94), with 56 identifying as male, 35 identifying as female, and 1 identifying as other. The experiment was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Psychological Research Ethics Board (PREBO) at Central European University, Private University, Vienna, Austria.


Apparatus and Stimuli
Our study was hosted on the Pavlovia online hosting platform and programmed using JavaScript (a combination of PsychoJS and custom written functions). Stimuli size was defined using standard height units (relative to the screen size).

Procedure


PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION


10
After clicking our link on Prolific, participants would be informed that they would first play one round of an economic game with a random partner, before being given the opportunity to play several more rounds of that game with a series of partners whom they had the opportunity to choose (in actuality they would choose between potential partners only and then the experiment would end, i.e., they would not play the economic game with the chosen partners). They were told that they would play the economic game with a series of partners who had already given their responses in a previous testing session, believing that their responses would be paired with the responses of others from a later testing session.
Participants were instructed to play the game just like they would if playing live, because the stakes were just the same as in a live version of the game, with both their own payoff and their partner's deferred payoff depending on how they had both responded. They were then presented with a description of the prisoners' dilemma game and were asked a series of questions (see SM1 for questions) designed to check their understanding of the game. If they got more than one of these questions wrong the first time, they would be allowed to try again, being informed that they would not be able to proceed with the full experiment should they fail a second time.
If they passed the check, participants would play one round of the prisoners' dilemma, with a random partner. They did not get feedback with regard to the outcome of the game.
This was done to give them experience in playing the game before moving on to the partner choice task.
After playing the first round, participants were informed that they would be presented with animations of two potential partners ('Partner A' and 'Partner B') playing the game with another participant, with their task being to choose which potential partner they would rather play the game with (i.e., to choose partner A or B), under the belief that they would have the opportunity to play the game with the chosen partner at the end of the experiment for a bonus PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION 11 of up to 1 GBP (when actually, they never played the game at the end of the experiment, but did receive the full bonus). For one trial, participants would view back-to-back animations of each partner making their decision, with one partner planning their decision with certainty (i.e., quickly after 2-4 seconds) and one partner planning their decision with uncertainty (i.e., slowly after 14-16 seconds). Whether partner A or B planned with certainty or uncertainty was counterbalanced between trials. For each partner, the animation would first display loading dots representing the time it took for the partner to plan their decision, before displaying the choice that the partner had made. The participant would then be prompted to choose either Player A or Player B, by pressing 'a' or 'b' on their keyboard (see SM3 for video example).
Participants would complete eight 'Cooperation trials' in which they chose between a 'certain cooperator' and an 'uncertain cooperator' and eight 'Defection trials' in which they chose between a 'certain defector' and an 'uncertain defector. We also included eight filler trials in which participants would choose between a cooperator who planned either with certainty or uncertainty and a defector who responded in the other way (this was done to make the aims of the task less salient). Trials were presented in random order. Participants were paid a total of 3GBP for participation. Because we used an online sample, we pre-registered several criteria to exclude participants who may have been inattentive throughout the experiment. Firstly, we excluded any participants who answered more than one of the four catch questions incorrectly (see SM1 for catch questions). Secondly, we excluded any participants who pressed the same button more than 85% of the time (for Experiment 1a, we initially pre-registered this threshold to be 75% but realized that this may have been too strict and result in the unfair exclusion of those with weaker preferences, thereby inflating our effectssee SM2 for a robustness check with different exclusion criteria applied). Thirdly, we excluded any participants who took more than one hour to complete the task. On the trial level, we excluded any trials that took longer than thirty seconds to complete.
For Experiment 1a we recruited 92 participants in total. We excluded 18 participants who answered more than one catch question incorrectly and 2 participants who pressed the same button more than 85% of the time. On the trial level, we excluded 15 trials with response times above 30 seconds. 


Experiment 1a: Results -Prisoners' Dilemma


Individual-level preferences
Secondly, we examined the extent to which individual participants formed a preference for either certain decision-makers, or uncertain decision-makers. To do this, we computed the strength of each participant's preference for either certain or uncertain decision-makers (i.e., their absolute preference for any kind of decision-maker varying from 0 -4), with 0 representing no preference (i.e., chance performance) and 4 representing a complete preference for either certain or uncertain decision-makers. 


Exploratory: Magnitude of cues
To investigate if there was a specific effect of the difference in decision time between certain and uncertain decision makers on the trial level, we carried out a mixed effects logistic regression with the participant's choice (i.e., whether they chose the certain partner or uncertain partner) as a response variable and decision-time difference score (uncertain decision-timecertain decision time) as a fixed effect. We carried out separate tests for cooperation trials and for defection trials, as we were interested in how the decision-time difference score influences partner choice separately for these two kinds of trials, rather than the interaction between the decision-time difference and trial type. This analysis revealed no significant effect of decision-time difference score for cooperation trials, z = -.27, p = .79, odds = .96, or defection trials, z = .08, p = .94, odds = 1.01.


Exploratory: RTs and participants' deliberation
We used the participants' response times (RTs) when choosing between the two partners, as an exploratory index of how conflicted they were when making their choice. A paired t-test was significant t(71) = -4.53, p = < .001, d = -.533. 95 % CIs = [-.78, 0.29] suggesting that participants were significantly more conflicted when choosing between defectors (M = 2.67, SD = 1.55) compared to cooperators (M = 2.01, SD = 1.17).

On the trial level, we excluded 3 trials with response times over 30 seconds.

Group-level preferences
Firstly, there was a significant difference between stag trials and hare trials with respect to preference scores (see

Experiment 2: Decision Implementation Experiment 2a: Method -Prisoner's Dilemma
The pre-registration for this study can be found at: https://aspredicted.org/ec9cf.pdf


Participants
Like in the previous Experiments, we aimed for a final sample of 72 participants after exclusions. In total we recruited 93 participants (21 excluded), 59 of which identified as male, and 34 of which identified as female. The sample had a mean age of 27.93 (SD = 7.95).


Apparatus and Stimuli
Payoff matrix -Prisoner's Dilemma:
This was the same as in Experiment 1a.
Virtual partner response screen:
Like in Experiment 1a, the response options ('Cooperate' and 'Defect') were displayed in the top left and right (counterbalanced across participants) and the decision-making phase of the potential partner's response was represented by loading dots in the center of the screen.
However, this time the decision-making time was fixed and followed by an animation of the action execution phase of the potential partner's response, with a white dot (x=0.05, y=0.05)
representing the potential partner's mouse movements towards one of the response options.


PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION


18
After the decision was implemented (i.e., the dot had stopped on one of the response options) a white ellipse around the choice was also displayed.


Virtual partner behaviour:
With respect to the potential partner's movements, our two kinematic parameters of interest were maximum deviation (in pixels) from the most direct path to the chosen option (as an index of directness towards the chosen option, thus relative attraction to the other option) and
jitter. Potential partners acting with certainty were programmed to move towards the response option with a trajectory that was straight (i.e., low max deviation from the most direct path and thus little attraction to the other option) and smooth (i.e., no jitter) whilst uncertain partners were programmed to move towards the response option with a curved (i.e., high max deviation from the most direct path, thus substantial attraction to the other option) and jittery trajectory.
To create these trajectories, we took the open-source movement data from Kieslich & Hilbig, 2014 (http://journal.sjdm.org/14/14808/data.csv) which contained movement data from participants responding to mouse tracked versions of economic games (i.e., prisoner's dilemma, stag-hunt, and chicken) in which the response options were displayed in the top corners of the screen. For each trial (1726 in total) there was a movement trajectory (x and y coordinates) that was normalized to have 101 even time steps (frames). To isolate trajectories that were suitable for animations of confident and uncertain partners we took several processing steps to ensure strict experimental control of the cues present in the movements.
Firstly, to ensure that our trajectories varied only with regards to jitter and max deviation, we controlled for several other factors. We removed any long pauses from the trajectories. We removed movements that hovered around the home button (i.e., movements that hadn't travelled 20% of the path by frame 50) as in these trials participants likely made their decision before starting to move, meaning that their decision process never leaked into PARTNER
CHOICE IN ACTION 19
the kinematics (i.e., against the instructions in 
Kieslich & Hilbig, 2014)
. We removed movements that hovered around an option without making a choice (i.e., movements that had travelled 80% of the path by frame 50), as this was an unwanted signal of uncertainty. We removed long pauses during a movement (i.e., where movements were around zero velocity for more than 15 frames) as it is likely that participants may have attributed pauses in the movements to something else other than uncertainty (e.g., reading or equipment related issues). We removed movements with long paths (with a maximum deviation of more than 1000 pixels, or a total path length of more than 4000 pixels), as these movements may have represented participants choosing one option before having a change of heart and moving towards another optionrather than reflecting uncertainty, this may have reflected participants unintentionally moving towards the wrong option before correcting their mistake.
We removed movements that contained excessive direction changes on either the x or y axes (>2SD of the mean) as this may have reflected indecisiveness.
Secondly, we quantified maximum deviation (maximum distance in pixels from the most direct path towards the response option) and jitter (RMSE of smoothed velocity profile subtracted from unsmoothed velocity profile), before splitting the data into quartiles based on both parameters (we log transformed both parameters to avoid a skewed final sample).
Thirdly, we took the trajectories that fell in the first quartile for both max deviation and jitter as our pool of 'certain trajectories' and those that fell in the fourth quartile for both maximum deviation and jitter as our pool or 'uncertain trajectories'. For each pool, we took a random sample of 16 trajectories, that fell within 1.5SD with respect to the mean max deviation and jitter of that pool. See 
Figure 3
 for trajectories and kinematic parameters.
Finally, we randomly paired the trajectories from each pool, generating a list of 16 pairs of movement trajectories (one certain and one uncertain trajectory per pair), ensuring that the differences between the pairs with respect to max deviation and jitter were not correlated PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION


20
(i.e., the difference in jitter between each trajectory in a pair did not increase as a function of the difference in max deviation between each trajectory in a pair). This trial list was fixed throughout the experiment, so that all participants viewed the same 16 pairs of movements. 


Procedure
This was the same as in Experiment 1a, except for the stimuli, where the decision-making time was held constant for both partners within a trial (i.e., decision time was a random value between 7 and 9 seconds and was always the same for both partners) and animations of the virtual partners' movements towards the response options were added (see SM4 for video example).


Exclusions

21
We recruited 93 participants in total. We excluded 21 participants who answered more than one catch question incorrectly but no participants who pressed the same button more than 85% of the time. On the trial level, we excluded 11 trials with response times over 30 seconds.

difference score (uncertain jittercertain jitter), and max deviation difference score (uncertain max deviationcertain max deviation) as fixed effects. We carried out this analysis separately for cooperation trials and for defection trials, as we were not interested in the interaction between these movement parameters and trial type. For cooperation trials this analysis revealed a significant effect of jitter difference score, z = -2.63, p = .008, odds = .93 but no significant effect of max deviation difference score, z = -.58, p = .56, odds = 1, and for defection trials this effect revealed no significant effect of jitter difference score, z = -.48, p =
.63, odds = .99, or max deviation difference score, z = -.23, p = .82, odds = 1. This suggests that participants may have been particularly sensitive to jitter with respect to partner choice.

Participants' responses were significantly faster in cooperation trials compared to defection trials, t(71) = -3.98, p < .001, d = -.47, 95 % CIs =

, indicating that participants were more conflicted when choosing between two defectors (M = 2.99, SD = 1.69) compared to two cooperators (M = 2.4, SD = 1.14).

Experiment 2b: Results -Stag Hunt


Group-level preferences
Firstly, there was a significant difference between stag trials and hare trials with respect to preference scores (see preference strength scores demonstrated that at an individual level participants exhibited a significant preference for one kind of partner (i.e., either certain or uncertain responders), both for stag trials, W = 2278, p < .001, d= 1., and hare trials, W = 2016, p < 001., d = 1.


Exploratory: Magnitude of cues
We conducted mixed effects logistic regressions (separately for stag and hare trials) with the participant's choice as a response variable, jitter difference score and max deviation difference score as fixed effects. For stag trials this analysis revealed a significant effect of jitter difference score, z = -2.67, p = .007, odds = .92, and a non-significant influence of max deviation difference score, z = -1.91 p = .06, odds = .99, and for hare trials this effect revealed no significant effect of jitter difference score, z = -.89, p = .37, odds = .98, or max deviation difference score, z = -.32, p = .75, odds = 1. This suggests that participants may have been particularly sensitive to jitter with respect to partner choice.


Exploratory: RTs and participants' deliberation
A paired t-test was significant t(71) = -2.61, p = .01, d = -.31, 95 % CIs = 
[-.54, -.07]
 suggesting that participants were significantly more conflicted for hare trials (M = 3.04, SD = 1.48) compared to stag trials (M = 2.63, SD = 1.25).


General Discussion
This study investigated whether people select between potential partners in an economic interaction based on cues to certainty present in the planning of the partners' prosocial or selfish decisions, and in the actions used to implement these decisions. Participants chose between two partners who both either made prosocial choices (i.e., chose to cooperate in the Prisoners' Dilemma or chose the stag in the Stag Hunt) or selfish choices (i.e., chose to defect PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION 25 in the Prisoners' Dilemma or chose the hare in the Stag Hunt). The partners' responses contained cues that reflected either certain or uncertain decision-making (Experiment 1), or cues that reflected either certain or uncertain decision-implementation (Experiment 2).
Confirming our key predictions, participants exhibited strong preferences for partners who planned and implemented prosocial choices (both in the Prisoners' Dilemma and Stag Hunt) with certainty (either quickly or with smooth and direct movements) rather than with uncertainty (either deciding slowly or acting with jittery and indirect movements). Thus, prosocial actions planned or implemented with cues that reflect certainty may signal that a potential partner has strong prosocial preferences and thus will be a reliable partner who will act prosocially in the future, whereas prosocial actions planned or implemented with cues that reflect uncertainty may signal that a potential partner has weaker prosocial preferences and may be an unreliable partner who may be tempted to act selfishly in the future. This extends the finding that people are more cooperative towards those who cooperate without considering the costs and benefits of the interaction 
(Hoffman et al. 2015;
Jordan et al. 2016)
.
For selfish choices, our predictions were more open. We explored whether participants' preferences for certain or uncertain selfish partners differed across the two games due their different incentive structures, or whether participants would have a general preference for those who acted selfishly with uncertainty (i.e., because uncertainty in a selfish action would signal a weaker preference for selfish behavior than certainty in a selfish action). For the prisoners' dilemma, a game in which players' interests may conflict, participants preferred those who made selfish choices with uncertainty. Here, selfish decisions planned or implemented with cues that reflect certainty may signal that a potential partner has strong selfish preferences and will act accordingly in the future and thus should be avoided, whereas selfish decisions planned or implemented with uncertainty may signal PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION 26 that a potential partner has weaker selfish preferences and thus may act prosocially under certain circumstances.
For the stag hunt, where players' interests are aligned, our findings were less clear.
On the group level, we found a weaker but significant preference for partners whose decision implementing actions contained cues to certainty compared to uncertainty but no preference for certainty or uncertainty during decision making. However, on the individual level, participants did on average exhibit a strong preference for one of the two potential partners (regardless of which potential partner was preferred) meaning that they discriminated between the two partners. Here, some participants may have preferred those with strong selfish preferences because this would reduce their own uncertainty in the game, i.e., the obvious choice here would be to choose the hare. However, others may have preferred to risk interacting with those with weaker selfish preferences, as they may act prosocially under the right conditions. Moreover, we found that on the group level participants discriminated between hare choosers on the basis of decision-implementation cues but not decision-making cues. The effect was small for both cases, meaning that the study could have been underpowered given the effect size for decision-making cues, but not for decisionimplementation cues (as indexed by a larger effect size). Alternatively, decisionimplementation cues may be a stronger signal of certainty (at least in the stag-hunt) than decision-making cues. It is noteworthy that for all four of our experiments, participants were significantly more conflicted (as indexed by their response times) when choosing between selfish potential partners rather than prosocial potential partners, which further indexes participants' uncertainty with regards to the choice between selfish potential partners.
Overall, we demonstrate that in addition to cues related to interaction history 
(Barclay & Willer, 2007;
Hardy & van der Vugt, 2006)
 or traits 
(Bonnefon, et al. 2017
, Balliet et al. 2018
) the ways in which people plan and implement prosocial or selfish choices carry PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION 27 important cues with respect to partner choice. Much as action parameters render instrumental or social intentions visible and thereby facilitate effective coordination in a joint action 
(Cavallo et al. 2016;
McEllin et al. 2018;
Sebanz, Bekkering & Knoblich, 2006)
, action parameters may render social preferences (and the strength thereof) visible, thus facilitating effective cooperation in economic interactions. This points to the fact that much of human's cooperative success, beyond action coordination 
(Sebanz et al. 2006)
, can be attributed to the perception-action coupling that allows us to understand each other's actions as they unfold. In addition to allowing us to predict and understand the motor and social intentions behind an action 
(Jacob & Jeannerod, 2005;
McEllin et al. 2018)
, perception-action coupling allows us to observe a partner's decision process as it unfolds, providing us with additional information about the strength of their social preferences that are not observable in the outcome of their actions (i.e., interaction history). Such an ability may have been crucial for cultivating and maintaining mutually beneficial partnerships with those who are likely to continue cooperating, whilst avoiding those who may act selfishly and free ride. Moreover, these additional cooperative (and competitive) advantages may have been one of the contributing factors to the evolutionary selection of the mechanisms that support action understanding through perception-action coupling.


Future Directions
In the current study we investigated how action cues inform whether one should engage with a partner, but what about cooperative behaviour once engaged in an interaction? Could cues from a partners' cooperative or selfish actions when engaged in an economic interaction also help us decide how to best interact with that partner? For instance, interaction history may tell an actor that their partner is cooperative, but that partner may start to execute cooperative actions with uncertainty rather than certainty (e.g., their decision-time may suddenly begin to increase). This may provide the actor with a useful cue that their partner is considering PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION 28 defection, allowing the actor to deal with this issue proactively, for instance by acting conservatively to avoid being exploited or punish and curtail transgressions early. Future research should investigate the influence of action cues on cooperative behavior in a repeated interaction, using for instance a repeated Prisoners' Dilemma.
Looking beyond economic games, are cues to certain and uncertain decision-making and implementation specific to economic interactions? Considering that uncertainty with regards to perceptual or moral decision-making may be observed in decision-times 
(Vickers, 1970;
Greene, 2007)
 and movement parameters 
(Patel et al. 2012;
Spivey, Grosjean & Knoblich, 2005)
 we doubt this is the case. Future research should aim to investigate how such cues help us coordinate everyday decisions (e.g., what to have for dinner) by understanding an actor's general preferences, or how these cues can help us to coordinate larger decisions (e.g., who to vote for) by understanding an actor's moral preferences.


Potential Limitations
This study employed a factorial design with partners choosing between partners who responded either with strong cues to certainty or uncertainty. Although this allowed us to contrast between these kinds of action cues it did not allow us to properly investigate the effects that the magnitude of these cues may have had upon partner choice. Moreover, although our regressions demonstrated that with respect to the kinds of actions, the magnitude of movement jitter may influence partner choice, whereas the magnitude of the movement directness and decision time does not, more work needs to be done to investigate whether the strength of partner preference (and therefore perceived strength of social preference) scales with the magnitude of these cues. Moreover, specifically to action execution cues, more work needs to be done to systematically investigate the effects of directness and jitter with respect to partner choice.


PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION


29
Would our findings generalize to non-western, and particularly non-industrialized societies 
(Henrich, Heine & Norenzayan 2010)
? On one hand there is evidence that the tendency to make inferences about an actor's mental state can be observed across multiple small-and large-scale non-western societies 
(Barrett, Todd, Miller & Blythe 2005)
 hinting that the ability to make inferences about social preferences using action cues may be universal. On the other hand, there are many dimensions on which cultures (or individuals for that matter) differcultural differences in phenomena such as context sensitivity 
(Masuda & Nisbett, 2001)
, risk perception, 
(Weber & Hsee, 1998)
 or intuitive cooperation 
(Nishi, Christakis & Rand, 2017)
 may all influence the effect of action cues upon partner choice, thus warranting further investigation. For instance, those who cooperate with certainty may view those who also cooperate with certainty as trustworthy and reliable cooperation partners, whereas those who value deliberation may view such actors as overly impulsive or even foolish.


Conclusion
The current study demonstrates that action cues present in either the planning (i.e., decision time) or implementation (i.e., movement directness and smoothness) of prosocial or selfish choices also influence partner choice, by revealing the strength of the social preferences of those potential partners. This bears on our understanding of: a) human economic behavior; b)
human decision-making and decision-coordination in general; and c) the utility (both in our evolutionary past and today) of a coupling between perception and action that allows us to recycle the representations within our own motor repertoire for the purposes of action understanding.

Crucially, one sample t-tests (Bonferroni corrected for two comparisons) from chance level performance (0.5 preference score) revealed that participants had a significant preference for cooperators deciding with certainty, t(71) = -8.43, p < .001, d = -.99, 95 % CIs = [-1.27, -.71], and a significant preference for uncertain defectors, t(71) = 2.85, p = .006, d = .34, 95 % CIs = [.1, .57].

Individual-level preferences A paired Wilcoxon test revealed no significant difference between stag and hare trials for individual-level preference strength scores, W = 546, p = .22, RBC = 0.21, 95 % CIs = [-.13, -.51]. Moreover, one sample Wilcoxon tests (Bonferroni corrected for two comparisons) from 0 (chance performance) for preference strength scores demonstrated that at an individual level, participants exhibited a significant preference for one kind of decision-maker (i.e., either certain or uncertain responders), both for stag trials, W=2145, p < .001, RBC = 1, 95 % CIs = [1, 1 ] and hare trials, W = 2080, p < .001, RBC = 1, 95 % CIs = [1, 1 ].

response options being counterbalanced across participants. The decision-making time was
represented with four loading dots (text height = 0.05) which repeated in a sequence whilst a
potential partner was making their decision. Below the dots, text was displayed indicating
that the potential partner was planning their decision. After the decision had been made, a

A paired Wilcoxon test (this variable only had five levels therefore, we deemed non-parametric analyses to be more suitable for this analysis) revealed no significant difference between cooperation and defection trials for preference strength scores, W = 561, p = .43, RBC = 0.1, 95 % CIs = [-.2, .44], indicating that participants had equally strong preferences for either certain or uncertain decision-makers in cooperation and defection trials. Moreover, one sample Wilcoxon tests PARTNER CHOICE IN ACTION 14 (Bonferroni corrected for two comparisons) from 0 for preference strength scores, demonstrated that at an individual level participants exhibited a significant preference for one kind of decision-maker, both for cooperation trials, W=1953, p < .001, RBC = 1, 95 % CIs = [1, 1], and for defection trials, W = 2016, p < .001, RBC = 1, 95 % CIs = [1, 1].
