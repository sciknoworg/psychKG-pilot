You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
The antenatal period, defined as the time between conception and birth, is associated with elevated risk for depressive episodes 
(Gentile, 2005)
, with the prevalence of antenatal depression (AD) estimated to be as high as 7-20% 
(Faisal-Cury et al., 2021;
Koc et al., 2023;
Videbech et al., 2023;
Yin et al., 2021)
. Treatment for AD, as with depression more broadly, is often bimodal, utilizing a combination of pharmaco-and psychotherapy 
(Kessing, 2021)
. Opting for the most optimal and time-efficient treatment is paramount, as untreated depression carries negative health implications for the affected individual 
(Greenberg et al., 2021)
, spanning chronic states of neurotoxic stress 
(Smaga et al., 2022)
, increased mortality 
(Gilman et al., 2017)
, and severe interpersonal issues 
(Steger et al., 2009)
. Achieving quick remission becomes an even greater concern in AD, as depression during gestation predisposes not only parent but also offspring to distinctive detrimental outcomes 
(Wichman & Stern, 2015)
, including spontaneous abortion and preterm birth 
(Apriliana et al., 2021;
Jahan et al. 2021)
, heightened risk of post-partum depression (PPD) 
(Faisal-Cury et al., 2021;
Yu et al., 2023)
, long-term mother-child relationship issues 
(Myers & Johns, 2018)
, and childhood behavioral problems 
(Apriliana et al., 2021;
Jahan et al., 2021)
. While psychotherapy is often adequate when treating mild depressive cases, moderate to severe phenotypes often warrant prescription drugs, as counseling alone might prove ineffective or slow to produce results 
(Kessing, 2021;
National Health Service, 2021)
. Currently, an estimated 1-10% of pregnant women in Western countries take selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are the most prescribed class of antidepressants for treating AD 
(Futterup & Andersen, 2019;
Koc et al., 2023)
. SSRIs target 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HT) neurotransmission, also called serotonin, by blocking reuptake transporters on the presynaptic neuron, thereby increasing the concentration of available 5-HT that might bind to the post-synaptic neuron 
(Futterup & Andersen, 2019
).
The serotonergic system emerges early in embryogenesis and its neurons are essential to normal brain development 
(Hornung, 2010)
. By the fifth week of gestation, serotonergic neurons are detectable and continue to grow rapidly, with the raphe nuclei, the main site of 5-HT synthetization, emerging in a state resemblant of that in the adult brain by week fifteen 
(Brummelte et al., 2017)
. In the fully developed brain, 5-HT pathways project to widespread regions of the central nervous system, including the cerebellum, limbic structures, the striatum, the medulla, and the cortex 
(Wright & O'Neill, 2012)
. The importance of serotonin during development is underscored by its role as both a morphogen and a tropic factor during embryogenesis, meaning it assists in both the development and structuring of brain tissue and synaptic connectivity through processes such as cell division, migration, myelination, synaptogenesis, and dendritic pruning 
(Brummelte et al., 2017;
Huang et al., 2019)
. This pivotal role of serotonin in early development extends post-natally, with 5-HT influencing neural maturation and synaptogenesis long after birth 
(Huang et al., 2019)
. These widespread influences of serotonin during and following gestation make it no surprise that irregularities in 5-HT transmission during this period have been found to carry long-term consequences for structural and functional brain development 
(Huang et al., 2019)
. Thus, while taking SSRIs is generally considered safe 
(Koc et al., 2023)
, specific concerns are raised when drugs are prescribed to women during pregnancy, as decisions must take in to account the complexity of prescribing a drug intended to treat the parent that simultaneously risks affecting the healthy development of their offspring.
While both SSRIs and AD on its own have been theorized to alter the embryogenetic development of the 5-HT system 
(El Marroun et al., 2014)
, research on the effect of prenatal SSRI exposure on child development and long-term consequences is in a preliminary stage. However, current knowledge indicates prenatal SSRI exposure-related physiological defects such as cardiovascular malformations and other congenital anomalies 
(Gao et al., 2018;
Zhang et al., 2017)
, while behavioral, cognitive, and psychiatric measures need further, and more robust research before recommendations can be made 
(El Marroun et al., 2014)
. While currently, women enrolled in SSRI treatment prior to gestation are advocated to continue treatment, as discontinuation during early pregnancy comes with a 68% risk of relapse 
(Brummelte et al., 2017)
, broader guidelines to aid clinical treatment option decisions are currently lacking. While other reviews have aimed to illuminate the consequences of several types of antidepressant exposure on children's psychological development (e.g. 
Araujo et al., 2020;
Gentile & Galbally, 2011;
Suri et al., 2014)
, this review aims to only focus on the impact of prenatal SSRI exposure.
Furthermore, to our knowledge, this review will be the first to only include studies with children in groups of only AD exposure and a combined group of AD and SSRI exposure. If successful, such an overview could serve as a foundation for health professionals and to-be parents facing the hard decision of having to weigh treatment options for depression during pregnancy.


Methods
The databases PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science and Scopus were systematically searched in October 2024 using the PICO framework. All databases were searched utilizing the databases' individual advanced search query to include all search items within each part of PICO; population, intervention, comparison and outcome. A comprehensive overview of the PICO search with all hits is given in 
Table 1
. All databases were limited to only showing human studies except for Web of Science, which does not provide this option.


Eligibility Criteria
To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to measure neurodevelopmental and/or behavioral outcomes on children in two exposure groups, namely, a group of children exposed to AD and another exposed to both AD and SSRI treatment in utero. Thus, allowing for the consequences of in utero AD exposure to be compared to the combination of AD and SSRI exposure. Studies with mothers diagnosed with other mental illnesses than depression, e.g. anxiety, or with several diagnosis were excluded due to our specific focus on AD's impact on children. Similarly, treatment with antidepressants other than SSRI medicaments were excluded. The full set of criteria is listed in Table 2.


Data extraction
The search yielded 2414 studies with 349 results on PubMed, 301 on PsycInfo, 917 on Web of Science and 847 on Scopus. All articles were automatically collected from the databases by the reference management software Zotero. After removing duplicates, 1406 articles were left for screening to ensure that studies fulfilled the strict eligibility criteria. All authors screened the articles (50% of the studies were screened by author RFG, 25% by ATYN and 25% by JL) in a two-step process which started with a screening of title/abstract and a subsequent full-text review. The individually selected studies were hereafter evaluated together to reach common agreement leading to the inclusion of 14 studies in the review. A comprehensive protocol of the study selection is displayed according to the PRISMA framework 
(Page et al., 2021)
 in 
Figure 1
. 
Table 3
 displays a summary of all articles included in this review. The 14 articles included are divided into 4 different sections: impact on the brain, behavioral development, language and psychiatric consequences.


Results


Impact on the brain


Volumetric differences
A recent population-based study by 
Koc et al. (2023)
 investigated a cohort of mothers and their children, grouped into five different subject groups based on the mother's duration and time of usage of SSRI and depressive symptoms. The children included underwent at least one brain imaging assessment from 7 to 15 years of age. The authors reported an association between SSRI exposure and significantly lower gray matter (GM) volume, particularly within the corticolimbic system. This finding persisted until the age of 15 years. 
Jha et al. (2016)
, when excluding subjects born earlier than week 34, found significantly lower GM volume in the right thalamus in SSRI-exposed neonates. This corroborates the notion that subcortical structures may be influenced by SSRI exposure 
(Koc et al., 2023)
. Furthermore, 
Koc et al.'s (2023)
 investigation of cortical volumes showed a consistent association between SSRI exposure and lower cortical volume, ranging from 5% to 10% in the frontal, cingulate, and temporal cortex across ages. Interestingly, SSRI use before pregnancy showed no association with cortical volumes nor lower GM or white matter (WM) volume. Exposure to AD was, however, associated with smaller volume in the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus 
(Koc et al., 2023)
. 
Lugo-Candelas et al. (2018)
, who investigated cortical volume on SSRI-exposed infants, found significantly higher GM volume in the right amygdala and right insula in SSRI-exposed infants compared to AD and non-exposed children, while 
Koc et al. (2023)
 reported lower amygdala volume between ages 9-12, an effect that seemed to attenuate with age. Furthermore, 
Moreau et al. (2023)
 found an association between greater left parietal surface area and lateral occipital cortical thickness in SSRI-exposed children compared to non-exposed.
It is worth nothing, however, that Jha et al. (2016) did not find any significant global or regional differences in brain volumes in their main analyses when comparing SSRI-exposed to non-exposed, beyond the finding reported above that emerged when excluding subjects born earlier than week 34. 
Jha et al. (2016)
 measured white matter (WM) connectivity in neonates with fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity, measurements of WM microstructure 
(Figley et al., 2022;
Grieve et al., 2007)
. 
Jha et al. (2016)
 found that SSRI-exposed neonates exhibited lower FA and increased mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity across multiple fiber bundles, most pronounced in the corticothalamic and corticofugal tracts. No differences were reported for infants exposed to AD alone. 
Koc et al. (2024)
 reported that both SSRI-exposed and AD-only exposed children exhibited lower whole brain FA at the age of 7. Both SSRI-exposed and AD-only had lower FA in the uncinate fasciculus, cingulum bundle inferior longitudinal fasciculi, corticospinal tract, and forceps minor of the corpus callosum. Findings for AD-only all remained significant after multiple testing adjustments except for FA in the cingulum, while only the finding for the forceps minor remained significant for SSRI-exposed after multiple testing adjustments. 
(Koc et al., 2024)
.


Structural and functional connectivity
At the follow up scan at 15 years of age, both groups showed no significant differences compared to non-exposed (AD or SSRI) children, indicating a diminishing effect with age 
(Koc et al., 2024)
.
Rotem-Kohavi et al. (2019a) studied infants exposed to either SSRI or AD-only and the impact on resting state networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The authors found an association between SSRI exposure and hyperconnectivity within the auditory network, and in regions that were coactivated by this network, an effect not observed in either AD-only or non-exposed infants (Rotem-Kohavi et al., 2019a).
Rotem-Kohavi et al. (2019b) reported higher connector hub values in the left anterior cingulate, insula, and caudate as well as higher provincial hub values in the amygdala for AD-exposed infants compared to nonexposed. Meanwhile, the SSRI-exposed infants showed higher provincial hub values in Heschl's gyrus relative to the AD-exposed group 
(Rotem-Kohavi et al., 2019b)
. Furthermore, they assessed the infants' temperament at 6 months using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire 
(Rothbart, 1981)
, where the hub values measured at the age of 6 days predicted 10% variability in temperament at 6 months. This finding suggests different behavioral and neurodevelopmental patterns between non-exposed infants and infants exposed to either SSRI or AD (Rotem-Kohavi et al., 2019b). 
Nulman et al. (2012)
 studied IQ and behavior using The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence 
(Wechsler, 2002)
 for IQ measurement and the Child Behavior Checklist 
(Achenbach, 1991)
 and 
Conners' Parent
 Rating Scale 
(Conners, 1997)
 for measurement of behavior. The full-scale IQ-test (both verbal and performance IQ) did not reveal any difference between AD-only and SSRI-exposed children. However, the SSRI-exposed group did show significantly lower full-scale IQ results than non-exposed children. Furthermore, both AD-only and SSRI-exposed children had more clinically problematic behavior and temperament scores, reaching significance in the Conners' Parent Rating Scale, than the non-exposed group, especially regarding internalizing and externalizing problems. Similarly, Hermansen et al. (2016) studied IQ and behavior in children, but in contrast to 
Nulman et al. (2012)
, they did not find a relationship between exposure to either AD or SSRI and IQ, as both groups performed similarly to the non-exposed group. The authors also found that both AD-only and SSRIexposed children showed significantly more externalizing problems compared to controls, and, notably, SSRIexposed further showed more internalizing and total problems. 
Hermansen et al. (2016)
 further assessed visual attention and inhibition of motor control with two subtasks within the Neuropsychological Assessment II (NEPSY-II; 
Korkman et al. 2000)
, and the children's processing efficiency of their attentional network with the Attentional Network Task (ANT; 
Rueda et al. 2004)
. However, no significant relationship was reported with either group. Using the same cohort as 
Hermansen et al. (2016)
, 
Hermansen et al. (2017)
 investigated attention and interference suppression with a flanker task as a subtest of the ANT while simultaneously collecting data on event-related potentials with electroencephalogram (EEG), which could give insight into the cognitive control. However, no difference between AD-only, SSRI-exposed and the control group were seen on reaction time and accuracy rates nor on electrophysical activation. Scale 
(Santucci et al., 2014)
. SSRI-exposed infants at the 26-weeks and 52-weeks assessments displayed a significant decline in scores in the Psychomotor Development Index. However, this significance was not present at the 12-week and 78-week assessments, where no difference between the groups' scores was seen. Lastly, neither the full score on the Behavioral Rating Scale nor the scores on the different subscales within the test showed a difference between the groups. Similarly to the previous study, Casper et al. 
2003
found significantly lower scores on the Psychomotor Development index for SSRI-exposed but also found SSRI-exposed children to have lower Behavioral Rating Scale scores compared to AD-only children. Specifically, SSRI-exposed had lower behavioral motor quality in the Behavioral Rating Scale, notably for fine motor skills and tremulousness.


Behavioral development
Finally, Salisbury et al. (2011) assessed infants with the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) 
(Lester & Tronick, 2004)
. The NNNS measures both physiological and neurobehavioral development, and while the authors do report some significant physiological differences between non-exposed, AD-only and SSRI-exposed infants, those results are not strictly related to psychological development and are therefore not within the scope of this review. Of interest here, AD-only infants had lower attention scores compared to non-exposed and SSRI-exposed infants. Meanwhile, the SSRI-exposed infants scored lower on the Quality of Movement measure and higher on CNS stress, which is a measurement of drug abstinence symptoms and stress across five organs, compared to non-exposed and AD-only infants. Furthermore, a significant interaction between CNS stress and age was observed in the SSRI-group, i.e. a lowering in scores with age, while the non-exposed had lower scores that were steady across age. Compared to non-exposed, infants in the AD-only group scored significantly lower on arousal, marginally higher on lethargy, and required significantly less handling (maneuvers needed to keep the infant alert and calm during orientation) with increasing age at assessment.
Finally, the authors examined depressive symptom severity during pregnancy with NNNS measures, showing that overall handling scores increased as depression scores increased however, within the AD-only group, the relationship was negative.


Language
Weikum et al. (2012) studied whether AD and SSRI exposure had an impact on the timing and precision of developmental milestones related to speech perception. Healthy 4-to-6-month-olds can discriminate broadly across phonemic contrasts, a finding that disappears at 8 months of age unless the child is raised bilingual 
(Weikum et al., 2012)
. Measured at 6 and 10 months, AD-only infants displayed delayed language development, meaning their ability to discriminate between languages both auditorily and visually was unreliable at 6 months but apparent at 10. On the other hand, SSRI-exposed infants displayed accelerated development, failing to discriminate both visually and auditorily at both timepoints.


Psychiatric consequences
The only article in this review looking at child psychiatric diagnosis is by 
Moreau et al. (2023)
 who investigated depressive symptoms in SSRI-exposed and AD-exposed children. They found a small increase in depressive symptoms in SSRI-exposed children compared to non-exposed control peers at the age of 9 years. However, this increase was not independent of recent measures of maternal mood symptoms.


Discussion
This review aimed to shed light on the consequences of prenatal SSRI and AD exposure on the psychological development of the exposed child. Three main factors that seem to exert influence on children and their cognitive, psychological and behavioral development became evident: severity of depression, SSRI treatment for AD, and the quality of maternal care in childhood. While some of the results may seem contradictory, several common features emerge.
Brain and behavior. Notably, regarding brain structure, 
Koc et al. (2023
), Lugo-Candelas et al. (2018
, and Rotem-Kohavi et al. (2019b) all reported structural differences in the corticolimbic system between SSRIexposed children and non-exposed children. Additionally, 
Koc et al. (2024)
 reported that both AD-exposed and SSRI-exposed children had lower FA in the same system compared to non-exposed. The corticolimbic system consists of several brain regions including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampal formation, and basolateral amygdala 
(Leisman & Melillo, 2013)
. These structures have been theorized to play a central role in emotional experiences, motivational responses, selective attentional responses 
(Leisman & Melillo, 2013)
, and other aspects of cognition 
(Kovner et al., 2019)
. Dysfunction in the corticolimbic system and its associated functions have been related to psychopathology in adolescents and adults 
(Kovner et al., 2019)
. As previously mentioned, serotonin plays a vital role in embryogenesis, and exposure to SSRI may influence these processes by increasing serotonin transferred from mother to fetus by the umbilical cord. Animal studies have shown that high levels of serotonin during the perinatal period may impact the corticolimbic system 
(Homberg et al., 2010)
, and prenatal SSRI exposure could therefore contribute to altered serotonin receptor distribution 
(Homberg et al., 2010)
, transcription factor expression 
(Brivio et al., 2019)
, and neurotropic factor level fluctuations 
(Calabrese et al., 2013)
. However, one must keep in mind that serotonergic signaling has only been investigated in animal models, which may pose certain translational challenges 
(Brummelte et al., 2017)
. One could hypothesize that the abovementioned findings of altered corticolimbic structures seen in both AD and SSRI exposed children plays a role in mediating the increased internalizing and externalizing problems reported by 
Nulman et al. (2012)
 and 
Hermansen et al. (2016)
, which has been linked to altered white matter microstructure in the corticolimbic system (Mohamed 
Ali et al., 2018)
. Internalizing problems have previously been theorized to be, amongst other factors, related to alterations in the interactions between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex mediated by the uncinate fasciculus 
(Kim et al., 2019)
. Higher white matter integrity of the uncinate fasciculus is thought to underlie better regulation of emotion and anxiety 
(Kim et al., 2019)
, thus, 
Koc et al.'s (2024)
 finding on lower white matter FA in the uncinate fasciculus in AD-only exposed children may suggest that AD alone influences the development of the corticolimbic system. Yet, 
Moreau et al. (2023)
 did not find depressive symptoms in AD-only-exposed children, but rather a small increase in depressive symptoms in SSRI-exposed children at the mean age of 9.9. This result, however, was dependent on current maternal mood, which sheds light upon the importance of maternal care, regardless of exposure.
Brain and cognition. Concerning the brain structures that support cognitive performance and executive function, 
Jha et al. (2016)
 found differences in mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity within the corticothalamic tract in SSRI-exposed compared with AD-only-exposed children. The corticothalamic system is central to the integration of information between sensory signals and higher order cognitive processes. Additionally, the interconnectedness of this system to other brain areas, e.g. the limbic system, further suggests that the integrity of this system may affect multiple aspects of cognitive function such as perception, attention, arousal, learning and language 
(Briggs & Usrey 2008;
Dalley et al 2017;
Fettes et al., 2017;
Peters 2016
) Furthermore, the serotonergic system plays an influential role in establishing the afferent fibers from the thalamus in neuroembryological development 
(Zafeiriou et al., 2009)
. Alterations in this system, such as the ones reported by 
Jha et al. (2016)
, could therefore be expected to impact scores on behavioral outcomes, such as attention, language and IQ. However, the articles on behavioral development do not entirely support the notion that the corticothalamic system is implicated in SSRI-exposed children, or that alterations in this system manifest in cognitive problems 
(Hermansen et al., 2016
(Hermansen et al., , 2017
Nulman et al., 2012)
. While Salisbury et al. (2011) did report lower attention scores for AD-only-exposed infants, 
Hermansen et al. (2016)
 reported no difference between SSRI-exposed and AD-only-exposed children at the age of 5-6 years on neither the NEPSY-II nor on interference control as measured using the ANT. Similarly, 
Hermansen et al. (2017)
 reported no difference between the groups on interference suppression, an ability which is highly dependent on cognitive control. Interestingly, 
Nulman et al. (2012)
 did observe significantly lower full-scale IQ results in SSRI-exposed children compared to nonexposed, however, this could be explained by the observed 5-10% lower cortical volume in SSRI-exposed children 
(Koc et al., 2023)
, rather than a specific interruption of the corticothalamic system, since higher cortical volume and cortical thickness have been associated with higher full-scale IQ 
(Bajaj et al., 2018)
. Regarding the accelerated language development reported by 
Weikum et al. (2012)
 in infants exposed to SSRIs when compared to AD-only, 
Rotem-Kohavi et al. (2019a
, 2019b
 found specific alterations in functional connectivity in SSRIexposed neonates across areas related to auditory perception, suggesting that exposure to SSRIs may exert influences on early neuroplastic adaptation during sensitive periods. Overall, neural and psychological differences in SSRI-and AD-only-exposed children are intertwined in ways that are difficult to disentangle, which affords multimodal studies that employ both behavioral and neuroimaging measures to establish causality.
Motor. 
Both Santucci et al. (2014)
, Salisbury et al. 
2011
and 
Casper et al. (2003)
 reported that SSRI exposure seem to influence psychomotor functioning in young children, a result which seems to be related to the exposure of the combination of SSRI and AD, and not AD exposure alone. While all three studies included in in this review tested children under the age of 2, a study by Galbally et al. 
2021
, using a broader spectrum of antidepressants found an association between drug exposure and poorer motor skills in older children, suggesting that antidepressant exposure in utero have lasting effects on motor skills.


Limitations
When comparing results across different studies, variations in the ages of the children may complicate interpretations. It is worth noting that the present findings of brain alterations, including changed amygdala volume (Lugo-Candelas et al. 2018), hyperconnectivity within the auditory network and regions that were coactivated with the network (Rotem-Kohavi et al., 2019a), higher provincial hub values in Heschl's gyrus (Rotem-Kohavi et al., 2019b) lower FA and increased MD, RD, and AXD across multiple fiber bundles 
(Jha et al., 2016)
, were discovered in cross-sectional studies. Indeed, these studies were conducted on infants under the age of 4 weeks, at the beginning of an extended period of rapid brain growth, with a doubling of cerebral volume taking place in the first year of life alone 
(Wilder & Semendeferi, 2022)
. Since infancy is characterized by plasticity and growth, the changes described in these findings may be malleable over the lifespan. Underscoring this notion, 
Koc et al.'s (2023)
 longitudinal study observed a catch-up growth of the amygdala, fusiform gyrus and global WM in their sample from age 7 and age 15, indicating an attenuation of these differences with age.
Nonetheless, a considerable amount of time passes before this catch-up occurs, raising questions as to how this prolonged period of differences might impact various aspects of development.
Additionally, since most studies on brain alterations are on infants and neonates, comparisons to the behavioral outcomes as measured on 3-6-year-old children may not be feasible. Factors such as maternal care, maternal mood, and active support systems have all shown to have great impact on both behavior, child mood and development of psychopathology 
(Breaux et al., 2014;
Cherewick et al., 2023;
WHO, n.d)
. Furthermore, environmental factors in childhood and adolescence are known to have great potential to change brain structures through epigenetics 
(Tooley et al., 2021)
, which further complicates direct comparisons. Studies utilizing both imaging techniques, behavioral and psychiatric measurements would greatly benefit understandings of how SSRI and AD exposure impact brain and behavior. Finally, while several studies have concluded statistical differences between AD-only, SSRI-exposed and non-exposed children, the differences are not necessarily clinically significant and are often accompanied by small effect sizes.
Maternal mood symptoms. Another notion to keep in mind when reading the current studies is the fact that several of them underscore the importance of depression severity during pregnancy. Findings on both AD and SSRI exposure could be confounded by missing information on symptom severity, since severity of AD has been shown to have marked consequences on fetal development 
(Jha et al., 2016)
. Individuals treated with SSRI often have more severe depressive phenotypes that are harder to treat with non-medical interventions. It can therefore be hard to distinguish between the true impact of SSRI and the impact of phenotype. Furthermore, women in the AD and SSRI groups were more likely to use alcohol and tobacco throughout pregnancy (e.g. 
Casper et al., 2003;
Hermansen et al., 2016;
Moreau et al., 2023)
, and to have lower levels of education (e.g. 
Casper et al., 2003;
Hermansen et al., 2016;
Salisbury et al., 2011;
Weikum et al., 2012)
. Confounders such as these are hard to disentangle from the true effects of prenatal in utero exposure to AD and SSRI.
Methodology. The screening criteria employed in this study are a notable limitation due to the strict focus on samples of participants being diagnosed with AD alone, thereby excluding samples with comorbidities, i.e. anxiety, which frequently co-occurs 
(Kalin, 2020)
. Further, we acknowledge the overlaps in the current etiological understanding of both disorders, implicating 5-HT neurotransmission and synthetization 
(Lin et al., 2023;
Zangrossi et al., 2020)
. However, the strict inclusion criteria can be considered a strength for several reasons.
Firstly, keeping a 'clean' AD sample minimizes the likelihood of confounding factors associated with comorbid disorders, leading to an easier interpretation of findings across neural, behavioral and cognitive measures likely to be biased by the inclusion of other disorders. Secondly, from a practical perspective, insisting on a homogeneous sample makes for higher transferability to clinical decision-making, as, again, findings will be more unambiguous, providing a stronger foundation for targeted interventions. Finally, a review with strict AD sampling can provide a robust reference for future studies aiming to compare the possible differential effects of treating AD with SSRIs compared with antenatal anxiety disorders and other conditions, where SSRIs are also employed. Further research could explore samples with anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, etc., to broaden the understanding of early disruptions of the serotonergic system and how they interplay with specific disorders and SSRIs.


Future directions
Altogether, current literature on the effects of AD and SSRI exposure is far from exhaustive, and more longitudinal investigations with larger sample sizes and multimodal methodology are needed, since most studies employ a small sample size in a cross-sectional study design with measurements across limited dimensions.
Furthermore, as became evident during the systematic search, several studies investigate in utero SSRI exposure and child development but fall short on their choice of methodology by including samples with various confounding variables. As mentioned throughout this review, exposure to AD has adverse effects on child development and future research needs to consider how diagnoses and comorbidities affect their results when investigating in utero SSRI exposure. Previously, it has been pointed out that different subclasses of SSRIs have differential effects on the mother and the fetus 
(Latendresse et al., 2017)
, leading some investigators to recommend that future studies should conduct separate analyses on different SSRI subtypes 
(Womersley et al., 2017)
, Indeed, of the 14 studies, only 
Moreau et al. (2023)
 investigated this question, finding different associations between SSRI subtypes and cortical volumes. Looking forward, we hope more investigators will contribute to this effort to elucidate how different SSRI options, e.g. sertraline or fluoxetine, affect child development.


Conclusion
To our knowledge, this article is the first to provide a synthesis of studies who has investigated the consequences of prenatal AD and SSRI exposure on child development exclusively. Principally, SSRI-and AD-only-exposed children displayed alterations in the corticolimbic system, abnormal language development, and increases in internalizing and externalizing problems. Specific to SSRI-exposed children were alterations in the corticothalamic system, lower full-scale IQ, and impairment of psychomotor functioning.
Disentangling the effects of SSRI from AD exposure and vice versa is difficult and needs further exploration. Regardless, it is important to underscore the influence of environmental factors, with several studies highlighting the effects of contemporary maternal mood on their results. The developing brain is highly receptive to the effects of the quality of parental care and positive experiences, underscoring the importance of early diagnosing AD and taking the appropriate clinical decisions in regards to treatment, as depressive symptoms may interfere with mother-infant bonding. Ultimately, this systematic review synthesizes and adds to existing knowledge on the effects of SSRI and AD exposure on child development, but, importantly, it emphasizes the pressing need to conduct more research with more rigorous designs in order to increase our understanding of the impact of SSRI treatment of AD on child development. Considering the high prevalence of AD, as well as the reported neurological and psychological effects on children exposed to AD, more informed decision making in treating this condition would have significant societal impact, as well as the potential to increase the quality of life of the children and their parents.


Statements and declarations


Declaration of conflicting interest
The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article. iv. Samples where the mothers had other mental illnesses than depression e.g. anxiety or bipolar.


v.
Studies with a focus on several antidepressants and not only SSRI Note. The criteria stated above were used in both phases of the two-step process of selection. SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, AD = antenatal depression. AD-only n=19 MRI Diffusion tensor imaging SSRI-exposed infants showed a significant GM volume expansion in the right amygdala, and the right insula, as well as in the right superior frontal gyrus and the left occipital gyrus at a whole-brain corrected P value <.05 when comparing to Adonly and non-exposed.


Study
There were no significant differences in GM volumes between the AD-only and non-exposed groups.

Diffusion tensor imaging
No differences were seen in global or regional brain volumes between the groups.
Reduced GM volume was observed in the right thalamus of SSRI-exposed neonates when children born before 34 weeks were excluded SSRI-exposed neonates exhibited lower FA and increased MD, RD, and AXD across multiple fiber bundles, with the strongest association in all corticofugal and corticothalamic tracts (p < 0.001).
No differences were reported for infants only exposed to AD.

MRI


Diffusion tensor imaging
Both SSRI-exposed and AD-only groups exhibited similar associations with reduced whole-brain white matter microstructure as indicated by FA (p = .02 and p < .001 respectively). SSRI-exposed group had lower white matter FA in the uncinate fasciculus, cingulum bundle, inferior longitudinal fasciculi, corticospinal tract, and forceps minor of the corpus callosum pregnancy n=72 Non-exposed reference group n=2640 at age 7 years. Only the association with the forceps minor survived adjustment for multiple testing (p = .004) AD-only group had lower FA in the uncinate fasciculus, cingulum bundle, superior longitudinal fasciculi, inferior longitudinal fasciculi, corticospinal tract, and forceps minor of the corpus callosum. All remained significant after multiple testing adjustments except for FA in the cingulum.
At the follow up scan at 15 years of age, both groups showed no significant differences compared to non-exposed children, indicating an attenuation with age

Infant Behavioral Questionnaire
Differences between groups were not evident at global brain level (p > 0.5).
Significantly higher connector hub values in the left anterior cingulate (p=.007), insula (p=.026), and caudate (p=.008) as well as higher provincial hub values in the amygdala (p=.045) for the AD-only infants compared to the non-exposed group. SSRI-exposed infants showed differences in the left Heschl's gyrus and the right medial frontal orbital gyrus, relative to the depressedexposed group Significantly lower PDI scores for SSRI-exposed at 26 weeks and 52 weeks versus nonexposed, (P = .038). Findings were non-significant at 78 weeks.
All groups showed a decrease in MDI scores over the 4 assessment times (p = .002).
No significant effects of exposure on BRS total score (p = .744), attention/arousal (p = .525), orientation/engagement (p = .632), motor quality (p = .968), and emotional regulation (p = .535)


Hermansen et al. (2016)
Crosssectional study N = 103 5-6year-old children SSRIexposed n=28 AD-only n=42 Non-exposed n=33 Compared to non-exposed, SSRIexposed children showed significantly more internalizing problems, (p=.018), externalizing, (p= .053) and total problems, (p= .029) AD-only children also had significantly more externalizing problems compared to controls, (p= .014).
There were no significant differences between SSRI-exposed and AD-only groups on either measure  Control group had significantly higher full IQ and verbal IQ than SSRI-exposed (p<.005) and venlafaxine group (p<.001).
No IQ difference between exposed groups Exposed groups had more clinically significant behavioral problems as assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, externalizing, and total problems subscales (total score ≥64) and on the Conners' Parent Rating Scale total and DSM-IV total symptom indices (total score ≥65) compared to control group.
Difference between groups were only significant on 
Conners
 No significant differences in MDI scores between AD-only and SSRIexposed children. SSRI-exposed had significantly lower scores on the PDI, p= .03, and on the BRS, p= .04, than AD-only. BRS factor scales revealed notable lower scores for tremulousness, p=.08, and for fine motor movements, p=.01, in SSRI-exposed children.


Salisbury et al. (2011)
Crosssectional study N= 112 infants tested within 3 weeks after birth SSRIexposed n= 36 AD-only n=20 Non-exposed n=56 NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) AD-only infants had lower attention scores compared non-exposed controls (mean diff, p<0.001) and SSRI-exposed infants (mean diff, p<0.001) SSRI-exposed infants had lower quality of movement scores and more CNS stress signs than non-exposes control infants (mean diff p<0.05; mean diff p<0.001) and AD-only infants (mean diff p<0.005; mean diff p<0.001).
SSRI infants had the most CNS stress signs overall and showed a significant interaction with age (p<.02). This suggests fewer CNS stress signs with increasing age at assessment compared to the steady, lower number seen in the non-exposed control group with increaseing age at assessment. Infants in the AD-only group had lower arousal scores with increasing age at assessment compared to the non-exposed group (p<.02).
Infants in the AD-only group required less handling with increasing age at assessment compared to the nonexposed group (p<.04).
Overall handling scores increased as HRSD scores increased (p = 0.03); however, within the MDD group, the relationship was negative (p = 0.01).

Note. Only results relevant to psychological child development are listed in this table. Consult individual studies for their complete analyses. SSRI-exposed refers to children being exposed to both AD and SSRI prenatally, AD-only entails being only exposed to AD with no medical intervention, and non-exposed represents being exposed to neither SSRI or AD. SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, AD = antenatal depression. SSRI-exposed group showed a significant decline in heart rate between the preswitch and postswitch trials (p = 0.024) Psychiatric Consequences Moreau et al. 
2023
Crosssectional Ns = 5420-7528 9-10year-old children SSRIexposed n=235 AD-exposed n=1983 MRI Child Behavior Checklist SSRI exposure was associated with greater left superior parietal surface area (p = .00038) and lateral occipital cortical thickness (p = .0000079). These results were not associated with child depressive symptoms.
Smaller global brain structure was associated with more child depressive symptoms (p=.000115) SSRI exposure was associated with a small increase in depressive symptoms among children (p=.0019). However, not after accounting for recent maternal depressive symptoms (p=.63).
