You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

awareness of graph comprehension for actual IPCC graphs, providing an ecologically valid approach.
Findings show that (1) the principles matching spatial and conventional features and representing one main message per graph enhanced graph comprehension, (2) the principle representing one main message per graph also improved participant's awareness of their understanding of the graphs, (3) we did not find evidence for the effectiveness of applying principles that involve guiding viewers to make the correct inferences and matching visual information with expectations.


Introduction
Climate change decision-makers need to understand the causes and impacts of climate change and possible mitigation and adaptation strategies to develop and implement effective evidencebased climate change policy. IPCC reports summarise the current state of climate science, particularly aiming to inform climate change decision-makers in governance, civil society, research and the public sector. These reports are viewed as an authoritative source of information for climate mitigation and adaptation policy (support) 
(Doran et al., 2023)
. Key information in these reports is summarised in scientific visualisations such as infographics, figures, graphs and illustrations. These visualisations may be more captivating than text alone and efficiently disseminate information to a broad audience as they are assumed to reduce cognitive load 
(Perra & Brinkman, 2021)
. Indeed, graphs can require less cognitive effort and minimise processing time relative to other formats, such as tables, particularly for more complex data 
(Brewer et al., 2012;
Smerecnik et al., 2010)
. Hence, graphs may be used by busy readers of IPCC reports to quickly grasp the gist of the reports. However, the effectiveness of such graphs depends on how they are designed. Graphs that are not well-designed can lead to systematic misunderstandings and suboptimal decision-making (e.g., 
Okan et al., 2012
Okan et al., , 2016
Raschke & Steinbart, 2008;
Yang et al., 2021)
.
Acknowledging the need for effective graph design, the IPCC has made significant progress in recent years by implementing a more systematic communication approach and having working groups supported by communication specialists 
(Lorenzoni & Harold, 2022;
Lynn & Peeva, 2021)
. Nonetheless, recent research on the understanding of IPCC graphs shows that misinterpretations of these graphs are still pervasive among climate change decision-makers 
(Fischer et al., 2020)
. Indeed, IPCC authors acknowledge that greater visual complexity (i.e. use of multiple colours and densely packed visual elements) is associated with greater perceived comprehension difficulty 
(Harold et al., 2020)
. Furthermore, the complexity of IPCC graphs may particularly be an issue for viewers without prior exposure to climate science, who often describe the graphs using irrelevant words 
(McMahon et al., 2016)
.
Importantly, decision-makers are often unaware that they may be misinterpreting IPCC graphs 
(Fischer et al., 2020)
. Such unwarranted confidence in the accuracy of one's understanding of the messages conveyed in graphs may have adverse consequences 
(Liu et al., 2017;
Robinson & Marino, 2015)
 and impede the development of effective evidence-based climate policy. Moreover, the complexity of IPCC graphs may be associated with higher perceived scientific credibility, increasing confidence in the data presented 
(McMahon et al., 2016)
. Whereas promoting confidence in the information depicted is desirable, this can be problematic if accurate interpretations of the information do not accompany such confidence.
Hence, it is important to not only investigate decision-makers' comprehension of IPCC graphs, but also the awareness of their graph comprehension, meaning the relationship between their confidence in their understanding and their graph comprehension.
Here we aimed to improve the accuracy of IPCC graph interpretation by applying key principles from cognitive sciences that have been found to improve graph understanding 
(Harold et al., 2016;
Morelli et al., 2021)
. Evidence-based recommendations have been developed to improve graph design in general (e.g., 
Hegarty, 2011;
Kosslyn, 2006)
, graphs communicating health risks (e.g., 
Ancker et al., 2006;
Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2017;
Trevena et al., 2021)
, and IPCC graph design specifically 
(Harold et al., 2016;
Wardekker & Lorenz, 2019)
. Some studies have started implementing such recommendations through graph co-design with users and user testing 
(Morelli et al., 2021)
. However, few studies have systematically evaluated the effect of specific design features through experimental methods, particularly with large relevant samples of global decision-makers. Here, we examine the effectiveness of four key principles in improving the understanding of IPCC graphs and decision-makers' awareness of their own graph understanding. We selected the most promising principles of graph design, drawing from a rich history of research in cognitive science, psychology and health & climate communication research, and used the selected principles to redesign IPCC graphs. We tested these principles among a large global sample of the IPCC's target audience. By redesigning original IPCC graphs and testing them against the original design with actual global decision-makers, this study, therefore, provides an ecologically valid evaluation.


Principles from cognitive sciences
Based on the rich existing literature on graph design, we selected four principles that appear promising a priori in enhancing IPCC graph understanding and awareness of graph understanding.
The first principle is that spatial features in graphs (e.g., heights of bars) should convey the same meaning as conventional features such as axes labels, legends and numerical values on a scale 
(Okan et al., 2012
(Okan et al., , 2016
Trevena et al., 2021)
. Research has shown that decision-makers tend to misinterpret graphs when spatial and conventional features in IPCC graphs do not match (e.g., where higher bars indicate lower levels of climate change impact) 
(Fischer et al., 2020)
.
Graphs containing such violations can be misleading because people often rely on spatial-toconceptual mappings such as 'high equals more' to interpret graphs 
(Okan et al., 2012
(Okan et al., , 2016
.
People have intuitive representations of number magnitudes, which are spontaneously activated when confronted with numerical information 
(Peters et al., 2007
(Peters et al., , 2008
. Presenting numerical information to be consistent with the direction of this 'number line' (e.g., greater numbers represent more frequent events) can thus improve comprehension 
(Peters et al., 2007)
.
The second principle is that graphs should be kept as simple as possible, ideally focusing on one main message per graph 
(Garcia-Retamero & Cokely, 2017;
Harold et al., 2020;
Kause et al., 2020)
. This principle is underpinned by the well-documented limits in people's capacity to process and retain graphical information 
(Kosslyn, 2006;
Padilla et al., 2018)
. If the processing demands to interpret a graph exceed the viewer's capacities, communications will likely be ineffective, even among experts. Breaking complex data into separate panels or displays may prevent an overload of graph viewers' short term-memory capacity 
(Kosslyn, 2006;
Shah & Hoeffner, 2002)
. Similarly, there is some evidence that limiting the number of statistics represented in a given graph can improve understanding of health statistics 
(Zikmund-Fisher et al., 2010)
.
Third, graphs should guide viewers to make appropriate inferences from data rather than merely stating intended inferences in the accompanying text of a graph 
(Harold et al 2016)
. This may be accomplished by using design features that support the so-called integration phase, a key process identified in cognitive models of graph comprehension 
(Carpenter & Shah, 1998;
Huestegge & Philipp, 2011)
. This process involves inferring information from conventional features such as axes labels, legends and numerical values on scales and integrating this information with that inferred from the visual pattern. In displays depicting a small number of variables and/or data points, this process may be facilitated by adding simple numerical or textual labels 
(Okan et al., 2015)
. However, more complex displays may require additional features to support inference-making. An effective strategy may be to provide an example of how to interpret a section of the visual information illustrating the meaning of specific visual features such as sizes of bars or different shades of colour. Viewers may then extrapolate this example to interpret the rest of the information depicted in the graph.
The final principle is to match visual information with prior knowledge or the viewers' expectations, which has been recommended for IPCC graph design 
(Harold et al., 2016)
. For example, one's expectations concerning the meaning of symbols, such as crosses or arrows, can guide how graphs are processed 
(Freedman & Shah, 2002;
Harold et al., 2016)
. The use of jargon or symbols that viewers are unfamiliar with or that trigger ambiguous interpretations may lead to unintended misunderstandings 
(Kosslyn, 2006)
. Instead, using design features aligned with prior knowledge can ease graph understanding through top-down processes.


Research design
To develop evidence-based insights to improve the design of IPCC graphs, we conducted two studies applying the four principles outlined above to graphs from various IPCC reports. We experimentally investigated the effectiveness of the different principles by comparing participants' understanding of the original IPCC graphs versus redesigned versions among two large samples of IPCC report target audience. These included 690 climate change decisionmakers in governance, civil society, research and the public sector from 135 countries, spanning all inhabited continents and all UN world regions. These participants are at the frontiers of global climate change decision-making and, therefore, key users of IPCC graphs. We redesigned four graphs, applying one principle per graph: Matching spatial and conventional features (Graph 1), One main message per graph (Graph 2), Guiding viewers to make the correct inferences (Graph 3), and Match visual info with expectations (Graph 4; see section IPCC graphs redesign, in Methods). We measured graph comprehension using two items per graph, participants' confidence in their understanding of the graph, satisfaction with the displayed graph, the selfreported cognitive load of graph interpretation and risk perceptions before and after viewing the graph. We tested the effect of graph redesign on (1) graph comprehension (2) the awareness of their graph comprehension (3) the cognitive load required to process the graph (4) and changes in climate risk perceptions after viewing the graph. Hence, we deliver evidence-based insights on how best to communicate climate science and provide critical recommendations for the future design of (IPCC) climate change graphs among a global sample of the IPCC's target audience.


Results
The following sections report the effect of graph redesign on graph comprehension and the awareness of graph comprehension. To ensure the comparability of the original and redesigned graph conditions, we checked the survey completion time and graph familiarity across conditions for the second survey study. Survey completion time did not differ across conditions (Graph 2: W= 22260, p=.54; Graph 3: W= 19714, p=.09; Graph 4: W= 21282, p=.84), nor did familiarity with the graphs (Graph 2: χ 2 (2, N= 435) = 0.66, p = .72; Graph 3: χ 2 (2, N=435) = 5.45, p= .07, Graph 4: χ 2 (2, N=435) = 0.33, p= .85). The effect of graph redesign on graph satisfaction, cognitive load and changes in risk perceptions are reported in Appendix C.


Graph comprehension
The redesign of the graphs successfully increased graph comprehension for Graph 1 and Graph 2, but not for Graph 3 and Graph 4 (see 
Figure 1
). 


Graph 1: Matching spatial and conventional features
The odds that a participant provided the correct answer to the comprehension questions were over three times as high for those viewing the redesigned Graph 1 compared to those viewing the 


Graph 2: One main message per graph
The odds that a participant provided the correct answer to the comprehension questions were twice as high for those viewing the redesigned Graph 2 compared to those viewing the original 


Graph 4: Match visual info with expectations
The comprehension of the graphs did not differ between the original Graph 4 and redesigned Graph 4 (OR=1.06, 95% profile (log-)likelihood CIOR:[0.75, 1.49], z=-0.12, p=0.90; see 
Table 1
).  


Awareness of graph comprehension
The redesign of the graphs enhanced the awareness of their graph comprehension (i.e. the alignment between confidence and graph comprehension) for Graph 2, but not for Graph 1, 3, and 4 (see 
Figure 2
). 


Graph 1: Matching spatial and conventional features
The non-significant interaction between confidence and condition indicates that the relationship between confidence and comprehension did not differ across the two conditions (OR=6.  
rquestion1=.15, p=.10, rquestion2=.12, p=.19
).


Graph 2: One main message per graph
The significant interaction between confidence and condition indicates that the relationship between confidence and comprehension differed across the two conditions (OR=1.59, profile (log-)likelihood CIOR:[1.01, 2.50], z= 2.03, p= 0.04; see 
Table 2
). Confidence was more strongly related to comprehension among participants viewing the redesigned graph (rquestion1=.46, p<.001, rquestion2=.26, p<.001) compared to those viewing the original graph (rquestion1= .33, p <.001, rquestion2= .10, p= .15), indicating improved awareness of their graph comprehension.


Graph 3: Guiding viewers to make the correct inferences
The non-significant interaction between confidence and condition indicates that the relationship between confidence and comprehension did not differ across the two conditions (OR= 0.83, profile (log-)likelihood CIOR:[0.58, 1.19], z=-1.00, p=0.32; see 
Table 2
). The correlation between confidence and comprehension was similar for the redesigned graph (rquestion1=.32, p<.001, rquestion2=-.12, p=.10) compared to the original graph (rquestion1=. 
38, p<.001, rquestion2=-.04, p=.10
).


Graph 4: Match visual info with expectations
The non-significant interaction between confidence and condition indicates that the relationship between confidence and comprehension did not differ across the two conditions (OR = 1.01, profile (log-)likelihood CIOR:[0.70, 1.46], z=0.07, p=0.94; see 
Table 2
). The correlation between confidence and comprehension did not demonstrate a relationship for the redesigned graph 
(rquestion1=.10, p=.13, rquestion2=-.06, p=.38)
 or the original graph (rquestion1=. 
15, p=.03, rquestion2=
.00, p=.97). We report on three key results. First, we found that two of these principles -matching spatial and conventional features and one main message per graph-were indeed successful at increasing understanding of the communicated science, by tripling or doubling the odds of accurately interpreting the graphs. Second, one of these principles-providing one main message per graph-also improved decision-makers' awareness of their graph understanding, rendering this the most successful redesign overall. Although associations between comprehension and confidence were also stronger for the redesigned (vs. original) graph applying the principle matching spatial and conventional features, the relationship between comprehension and confidence did not differ significantly as a function of redesign. Third, we did not find support for the effectiveness of applying two principles of graph redesign that appeared promising based on prior research from different domains: guiding viewers to make appropriate inferences and matching visual information with viewers' expectations.
These results provide a comprehensive and evidence-based evaluation of how to communicate climate science to decision-makers successfully. Crucially, our redesigns were based on a rich history of cognitive research on graph comprehension from different domains The former principle can easily be implemented without loss of information in many graph types by avoiding, for example, inverted or truncated scales (e.g., where the y-axis scale does not start at 0). There are specific cases, however, where violations of this principle may be required to depict meaningful differences in the data 
(Trevena et al., 2021)
. For example, depicting fluctuations of mean annual temperatures using a zero baseline may not be meaningful and may obscure important differences in temperature. Similarly, space constraints may sometimes prevent showing the full range of values. In such cases, it is essential to include clear labelling in graphs to minimise the chances of potential misinterpretations.
Restricting IPCC graphs to only one main message may prove more challenging, in contrast, for two reasons. First, the sheer amount of scientific knowledge available requires condensing information. Second, IPCC reports need to be highly detailed to do justice to the IPCC principle of "Traceable accounts", which conflicts with page restrictions, and may therefore push authors towards including even more information into ever more complex graphs 
(Amelung et al., 2016
 Just as it is relevant for political decision-makers to interpret the graphs correctly, it is also crucial for decision-makers to be aware of graphs they do not understand, as individuals tend to use the confidence they have in their understanding to guide subsequent judgment and behaviour 
(Balsdon et al., 2020;
Desender et al., 2018;
Fischer et al., In press;
Hainguerlot et al., 2018;
Schulz et al., 2023;
Van Den Berg et al., 2016)
. Unwarranted confidence in understanding of IPCC graphs, therefore, may lead to poor decision-making 
(Berner & Graber, 2008)
, reduce the likelihood of double-checking one's (flawed) understanding (Meyer et al., 2013), and even endorsing more risky policies 
(Liu et al., 2017
 
(Trevena et al., 2021)
.
In line with prior research, we found that participants did not update their climate change The results need to be interpreted considering three main limitations of the study. First, the graph redesigns were nested within the graphs. That is, each principle was applied to a different graph as no single IPCC graph would lend itself to undergo all four redesign principles.
While this approach was taken to maximise the ecological validity of our results by applying each principle to an original IPCC graph that was suitable, there may be a confounding effect of the graph, and the effects of applying the principles may be different for other graphs. Thus, future research could examine if the principles that involve guiding viewers to make the correct inferences and matching visual information with expectations prove more effective when applied to different graph types in different contexts.
Second, Graph 4 was redesigned to match visual information with expectations by using symbols that match prior knowledge, but the legend for these new symbols was also placed in a more prominent location in the graph, which eased the integration of the information of the graph with the information of the legend. Spatial proximity between legends and corresponding data can facilitate graph processing and reduce working memory demands 
(Wickens & Carswell, 1995)
. Thus, any performance improvements associated with this graph could be attributed both to the use of symbols matching prior knowledge and to the improved spatial proximity between the legend and corresponding symbols. Nevertheless, the redesign was not associated with improved comprehension or improved insight into participants' comprehension of the graph. 


Methods
Data were collected in two studies. The first study consisted of a face-to-face survey among attendees of the 25 th Conference of the Parties (COP25) participants in which the redesign of Graph 1 was tested. The second study involved an online survey to test the redesign for Graph 2, 3 and 4.


Participants


Study 1
The sample for Study 1 included climate change decision-makers at COP25 (N=255),
representing climate experts in research (30%), civil society (30%), government (25%) and the public sector (9%). The sample represented 54 countries, with the largest proportion of participants coming from the USA (18%), Germany (9%), Spain (6%) and the United Kingdom (6%) (see 
Figure 3
 for the sample's global representation, 
Table 3
 for the sample's demographic information, and 
Table 4
 for the sample sizes per condition).  


Recruitment
Potential participants were approached at COP25 in December 2019 as they were queueing at coffee and food trucks and asked if they could spare 10 minutes to complete a survey that assessed their understanding of IPCC graphs. We initially collected 256 surveys, but 1 participant had missing data on key items for the main analysis and their responses were excluded from analyses.


Study 2
The sample for Study 2 included climate change decision-makers (N=435), representing climate experts working in the government (77%), research (12%), civil society (8%) and the public sector (4%). The sample represented 135 countries, with the largest proportion of participants coming from the USA (7%), France (5%) and Germany (5%) (see 
Figure 4
 for the sample's global representation, 
Table 3
 for the sample's demographic information and 
Table 4
 for the sample sizes per condition). participants completed the demographic information questions and the responses for at least one graph, resulting in a response rate of 19%. Participants who did not complete the questions for at least one graph were removed from the data (117 participants). Participants who completed the survey for one or two graphs were included in the analysis and marked as partial responses (41 participants). The incomplete responses were fairly equally distributed across conditions (29 participants in the original graph condition and 37 participants in the redesigned graph condition). 


Materials


Prior and posterior risk perceptions


IPCC graphs redesign
Four IPCC graphs were selected to be redesigned for this study. We selected the first graph based on prior research (Fischer et al. 2020) that showed that policymakers often misinterpret the projected frequencies of heat extremes across world regions from Chapter 11, AR5 (IPCC, 2014). In this graph, higher values in scales indicated lower climate change impact, often leading participants to draw the opposite conclusion from what was intended to be conveyed with the graph (see 
Figure 5
, upper panel). Hence, for the redesigned graph, we inverted the scales so that higher values indicated higher climate impact (see lower panel 
Figure 5
), thereby applying the principle: Matching spatial and conventional features. For the second graph, we took 
Figure SPM
.5 from the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) (IPCC, 2019) (see 
Figure 6
, upper panel). This graph depicts two layers of information, namely the sea level rise in 2100 under different sealevel rise response scenarios and the relative contribution of response options to risk reduction.
Our redesigned graph presented these two types of information in two separate graphs ( 
Figure 6
, lower panel), hence applying the principle: One main message per graph.   


Graph comprehension
Two items assessed comprehension for each graph (e.g. Graph 1: "Which of the following regions is expected to have the highest frequency in maximum daily temperatures that would have occurred only once in 20 years in the late 20th century according to scenario A2 (red bar)?", Graph 2: "In which geographical area is the differences between the high and low emission scenario the largest in term of the relative contribution of in-situ responses?", Graph 3: "In the energy demand sector, how high is the confidence of the potential for strong synergies forSDG9 (industry, innovations and infrastructure)?", Graph 4 "For extreme weather events (RFC2), what is the level of additional impact/risk of the global mean surface temperature change of 0.5-1 degree?"). Each question had four response options with one correct answer.
Participants could look at the graphs while answering both questions. These items were coded as correct (1) or incorrect (0) (See supplementary material A and B for all survey items).


Awareness of graph comprehension
Awareness of graph comprehension was measured by assessing the relationship between confidence in graph comprehension and the graph comprehension score. In both studies, participants indicated their confidence in the accuracy of their answer to the comprehension question (e.g. "How certain are you of your last answer?"), with four response options: 25%
(guessing), 50%, 75% or 100%.


Cognitive load
Participants rated Graph 2, 3 and 4 on the cognitive load required for processing the graph ("How much did you need to concentrate to understand this figure?") on a scale of 0 (a little) to 100 (a lot).


Numeracy
Numeracy was measured with three items in Study 1 based on previous work by 
Schwartz and colleagues (1997)
. Responses to the comprehension and numeracy questions were recoded into binary variables (correct or incorrect). The three numeracy items were summed, resulting in a scale ranging from 0-3. Means were computed and served as a summary variable (M= 1.65, SD=0.61). Numeracy was only included in the first study as we did not find an effect of this variable in the first study, and we aimed to keep the survey brief to retain sufficient participants in Study 2.


Graph familiarity
To check if familiarity with the graphs was evenly distributed across conditions, we asked participants if they were familiar with the graph in Study 2, with answer options: yes, no, I am not sure.


Graph satisfaction
In Study 1, we assessed graph satisfaction ("How satisfied are you with this graph?") with five response options: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%.


Demographics
Demographic questions assessed gender, age, nationality, education and type of institution. The institution response options were grouped into: research (including universities and research institutes), government (including governmental institutions and pollical parties), civil society (civil society organisation, including NGO's), and public sector (including small-and mediumsizes enterprise and large corporations).


Procedure
For survey 1, we randomly allocated participants to the original graph condition or redesigned graph condition. For survey 2, we used block randomisation, meaning the participants were randomly allocated to the original or redesigned graph condition for each graph (3 blocks). The allocation to the condition for the three blocks was independent, meaning the allocation to a certain condition for the first block did not affect the allocation to a condition for the subsequent blocks. The survey software randomly allocated participants and ensured even distribution across conditions. The order of the graphs (the three blocks) was also randomised across participants to counter order effects. See

C. Effects of graph redesign on graph satisfaction, cognitive load and changes in risk perceptions


Graph satisfaction
Graph satisfaction was only measured in Study 1 (for Graph 1; Matching spatial and conventional features), and did not follow a normal distribution (positive skew). Therefore a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test was conducted. Graph satisfaction was not significantly different between the original Graph 1 (median=25%) and the redesigned Graph 1 (median=25%) w= 27941, p=. 0.37; see 
Figure 9
). 


Cognitive load
The cognitive load data for all three graphs did not follow a normal distribution 
(negative skew)
 and therefore, a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test was performed for each graph. Participants viewing the redesigned version of Graph 3 (Guiding viewers to make the correct inferences) reported experiencing higher cognitive load (median=80) compared to those viewing the original graph Medianoriginal graph=66, Medianredesigned graph =71, W=19844, p=.33). 


Change in risk perceptions
The data on the changes in risk perceptions also did not follow a normal distribution for any of the graphs, and therefore, a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test was performed for all three graphs. The graph redesign did not affect the change in risk perceptions across any of the three graphs (see 
Figure 11
). That is, no differences between conditions were observed with regard to change in risk perceptions after viewing the Graph 2 (Median changeoriginal graph=0, Median changeredesigned graph =0, W=20849, p=.63), Graph 3 (Median changeoriginal graph=0, Median changeredesigned graph=0, W=20937, p=.82) and Graph 4 (Median changeoriginal graph=0, Median changeredesigned graph=0, W=22935, p=.09).

These results demonstrate that-perhaps surprisingly-it may not sufficient to redesign IPCC graphs solely based on even well-established principles. Although some principles may contribute to increasing graph comprehension, more successful redesigns require systematic feedback from empirical evaluation among the target population, in line with prior calls(Fischer et al., 2018;   Herrmann et al., 2018).Principles that successfully enhanced decision-makers' graph understanding involved matching the meaning of spatial and conventional features(Okan et al., 2012(Okan et al.,  , 2016, and including one main message per graph

risk perceptions after viewing the graphs(Fischer et al., 2020). This held for both the original and all the redesigned graphs and suggests that policymakers' belief about the risks of climate change are influenced by a range of cues and a multitude of information and are not subject to rapid changes(Fischer & van den Broek, 2021).


Figure 4 :

Nationalities of sample for Study 2. Frequencies denote the number of participants per country.RecruitmentA power analysis based on effect sizes derived from (Fischer et al. 2020) indicated a recommended sample size of 170 participants (see preregistration: https://osf.io/t7rzx). We send out a total of 2260 invitations to take part in the study via email between May 2021 and May2022. The potential participants' contact information was obtained from the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change website, which lists the admitted parties and observer organisations of the COP. Contact details for EPA staff were also extracted from the respective websites. Furthermore, IPCC communication staff shared the survey with their panel of 67 participants. From these invitations, 552 participants started the survey, and 435


At the start of the survey for Study 2, participants rated their climate change risk perceptions on a scale from 0-100, as well as after viewing each graph ("Now that you have seen this figure, what is your take on the seriousness of the threat of climate change?"). The difference between these two served as a measure of a change in climate change risk perceptions, ranging from -100, 100 (Mbaseline=90.97, Mpost-graph2= 83.39, Mpost-graph3= 79.53, Mpost-graph3= 86.96).

Original (above)  and redesigned (below) versions of Graph 2 (redesigned from SPM.5 Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a ChangingClimate, IPCC, 2019)    For the third graph, we tookFigure SPM.4 from the Special Report Global Warming of 1.5 ºC (SR15) (IPCC, 2018) (Figure 7, left panel). The graph represents the potential positive effects (synergies) and negative effects (trade-offs) of mitigation options in different sectors in relation to Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs). In the redesigned version(Figure 7, right panel), we included an example illustrating how the graph should be interpreted. The example explained the trade-offs and synergies of the SDG1 in the energy sector, explaining how to interpret (1) the size of the bars indicating the synergies and trade-offs, (2) the shades of colour representing confidence levels of the synergies and trade-offs, and (3) the differences in confidence levels for different levels of synergies and trade-offs. This example was designed to apply the principle Guiding viewers to make the correct inferences by giving them a step-by-step interpretation of one specific graph section that participants could extrapolate to the rest of the graph.

Original (left)  and redesigned (right) versions of Graph 3 (redesigned from SPM.4 from the Special Report Global Warming of 1.5 ºC,IPCC, 2018)    For the fourth graph, we took SPM.2 from SR15 (IPCC, 2018). This graph displays how the level of global warming affects impacts and/or risks associated with the Reasons for Concern and selected natural, managed and human systems(Figure 8, left panel). The original graph indicates confidence levels with letters (L, M, H), which viewers may conflate with the level of added impact/risk displayed in the bars. Hence the redesigned graph employed symbols to indicate the level of confidence (similar to SPM3 from SROCC (IPCC, 2019), in which the number of dots next to the bar indicates the level of confidence(Figure 8, right panel), to apply the principle Match visual info with expectations. Most viewers may expect that a larger number of dots represents a larger quantity of the variable being depicted. Hence, this symbol may be more intuitive to interpret than the letters originally used.

Discussion The reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) synthesise the best available evidence on climate change, its state, causes, and impacts, and hence lay the foundation for evidence-based political decision-making. Although these reports often summarise key results in graphs, there is growing concern that IPCC graphs are difficult to understand (Harold et al., 2020), and scholars have called for more graph intuitive design (Fischer et al., 2020; McMahon et al., 2016). Here, we deliver an unprecedented empirical test of how to improve IPCC graphs among a sample of over six hundred decision-makers from 54 (Study 1) and 135 (Study 2) countries, spanning all inhabited continents and all UN world regions. Drawing on established principles from cognitive research and graph design, we experimentally test four different redesigns of IPCC graphs communicating climate change risks and potentials for mitigation.


). Hence, our results suggest that climate science communicators must carefully balance various goals when designing graphs, by finding a "cognitive middle-ground" between space restrictions and maximising understanding based on the present results. Graph understanding may also be improved by using simplified language, as suggested by a recent study that documented frequent confusion and misunderstandings of expert terminology in IPCC reports among laypeople (Bruine de Bruin et al., 2021). Hence, these findings highlight the need to consider potential misinterpretations of complex graphs and terminology in IPCC reports among different audiences, as well as the potential benefits of adjusting information design considering the main communication goal in each case.


). Redesigning graphs based on the principle of one message per graph was most successful at attaining this type of accurate self-evaluation, suggesting that to enhance awareness of own graph understanding-and gaps in understanding-IPCC graphs are best designed when limiting the number of messages conveyed to viewers. This demonstrates how one comparatively simple principle, providing one main message per graph, can successfully enhance insight into the validity and error of own interpretations of IPCC graphs among the IPCC's target audience. The principle matching spatial and conventional features also shows some promise to support more accurate self-evaluations but further research would be needed to obtain more conclusive results.Subjective evaluations of the graphs, including the mental effort required to understand the graphs (cognitive load) and satisfaction with the graphs, were unreliable indicators of actual understanding. The redesigns did not result in a reduction in the reported cognitive load, while the principle of guiding viewers in interpreting the graphs even increased self-reported cognitive load. Conversely, although satisfaction with the graph applying the principle mapping spatial and conventional features was not higher than satisfaction with the original graph, participants' understanding was more accurate for the redesigned graph. This finding suggests that subjective
preferences for different designs (Taylor et al., 2015) may not reliably guide authors towards more understandable communication formats, and is consistent with previous research in the health domain showing that people's preferences for different graph types are not always aligned with their performance


A third possible limitation of the study is the non-response or drop-out of participants. It is likely that those who declined to participate or dropped out of the study would have had a poorer understanding of IPCC graphs, or at least would have been less confident in their
understanding of the graphs. Hence, if these participants had completed the study, the results may have indicated poorer graph comprehension. Since these participants may have benefitted even more from graph redesign based on cognitive psychology principles, their participation in the study may have enhanced the effect sizes. Conclusion Ineffective communication of climate science can be costly. If political decision-makers struggle to understand the communicated science, they will not be able to base their political decisions on the current state of climate science when developing policy that mitigates climate change risks, and adapts to its inevitable impacts. The present research provides an extensive evaluation of four of the most promising redesigns to elevate climate communication among decision-makers worldwide, demonstrating which cognitive principles are most successful at improving graph comprehension and awareness of graph comprehension. We hope that these empirical insights on how to successfully communicate complex climate science to the IPCC's target audience can help lay the foundation for improved graph design, and hence, evidence-based policymaking.

We also ran a regression correcting for participants' numeracy, but this did not influence the results as numeracy did not have a significant effect on the accuracy of the responses to the comprehension questions.

Board (ref.: Geo S-21503)
.


Analysis
We preregistered the planned statistical analyses before data collection for Study 2 (https://osf.io/t7rzx). We deviated from the preregistration in that we assessed the effect of graph redesign on graph comprehension by conducting a general linear mixed model with a binominal distribution instead of the logistic regression originally planned. The general linear mixed model included a random subjects effect to account for the dependence between the responses to questions 1 and 2, thus allowing us to optimise analyses. The question number and a dummy for graph redesign were included as predictors in the model.
To investigate the effect of graph redesign on the awareness of graph comprehension, we analysed the alignment between confidence and graph comprehension by conducting a general linear mixed model including a main effect for confidence and including an interaction between confidence and condition. A significant interaction effect would indicate that the relationship between confidence and graph comprehension (the awareness of graph comprehension) differs across conditions. All coefficients were submitted to two-sided tests.
The analyses also deviated from the preregistration in that we used non-parametric tests to assess the impact of graph redesign on cognitive load and risk perception instead of the planned T-tests as the assumptions for a parametric test were not met.
