Introduction
The aging process becomes a major issue in the public health sector, as the old population is continuing to grow rapidly. Various disorders, altered social behaviours as well as diseases are at higher risk in older people, which leads to a poor quality of life and to an enormous impact of the health care costs 
(Maron & Nutt, 2017)
. Hence, to live and perform independently in our community is determined by various social, physical, emotional, as well as cognitive factors. Research has presented, that cognition shows the greatest predictor of performing daily life in older people successfully 
(McAlister & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2016)
. Moreover, our overall life expectancy is increasing from year to year. Hence, the major issue is to not only extend the life years but also to improve the quality-of-life years. An universal goal of current scientific research is to fill the gap of life expectancy and the expectancy of years free of disability 
(Montero-Odasso et al., 2012
).
One of the common cognitive disorders, which appears in older ages, is defined as the socalled generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The disorder is mainly associated with persisted worry and fear about everyday situations. Further, people affected by anxiety show poor task performance, especially when it comes to cognitive-motor tasks, such as walking while talking 
(Feldman et al., 2019;
Tyrer & Baldwin, 2006)
. However, anxiety is used to be treated with drugs or expensive psychotherapies, which are not fitting to individuals. Moreover, the disorder mostly does not get detected or mixed up with other disorders, as for example depression, which leads to wrong or any treatment. Hence, those factors are highlighting the poor knowledge about the GAD in individuals 
(Hidalgo & Sheehan, 2012)
.
From a neural point of view, increased anxiety is associated with a dysfunction of the fronto-parietral network and especially in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which includes the function of top-down attentional process. Therefore, people with GAD switch their attentional resources to task-irrelevant thoughts, which results in a poor performance.
Accompanying, an additional effect has been shown when it comes to the aging process.
Especially, the executive functions, which origins in the PFC are disproportional decreasing by the aging process. For instance, working memory, or attentional control show poor function when it comes to perform different tasks 
(Falbo et al., 2016;
McAlister & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2016)
 To focus on the improvement of general health among older people with GAD means to aim to decrease anxiety, while increasing cognitive function and a general physical fitness. Cognitive-physical dual-tasks presents an attentional demanding task, where the target group shows a poor performance. Therefore, future interventions should focus to train dual task to boost executive function performances and further to normalize the PFC activity in anxious but also in healthy older people 
(Kimura & Matsuura, 2021)
.
Considerations from a cognitive neuroscience and a physical exercise science showed also great effects adding feedback to a performed task. This directs the attention from the performer to the effect of the movement instead to the movement itself. Various literature proofed that this method leads to a better automatic control process, which would therefore boost the task-irrelevant attention of anxious people positively 
(McNevin et al., 2003)
.
In order to improve GAD, but also the cognitive and physical function of older people the experimental study has the main purpose to detect the activity level of the PFC while performing cognitive tasks utilizing state of the art electroencephalographic methods.
Next, based on the results of anxiety-related brain activity, an intervention containing physical-cognitive tasks combined with additional response-related feedback will be accomplished. This aims to normalize the PFC activity and improve cognitive and physical fitness in anxious older people. Further, suggestions based on the interventions will be made for performing a training, which is suitable for real-life conditions for elderly people who suffers from GAD.
For this aim, the experimental study will be constructed by a team of researchers, who are experts in cognitive neuroscience and in the science of physical exercise using both laboratory experiments and innovative physical-cognitive exercise training to be applied in the gym and even at home. Noteworthy, preliminary data of the effect of feedback mechanism on anxious younger people will be considered to get the confidence for the experimental study with older participants.
The multidisciplinary project will be developed to provide a physical-cognitive dual task training linked with response-related feedback to older people with and without anxiety.
Further, the study should address the relevance of improving cognitive and physical fitness to reduce health care costs and ensure a better quality of life in older ages.
A case study, including two older people with and without anxiety were conducted. Hence, the below described intervention study included two old participants in order to compare and to proof the hypothesis also in elderly. Moreover, the results will be considered for the main experimental study in the next months. The selected methods running the study are similar to the preliminary study.
Specifically, based on the above-described current knowledge in regard to the thesis topic, following outcomes are expected:
• The ERP data of the anxious older participant during DRT testing will show a hypoactivation in the pN compared to healthy peers.
• The anxious participant will show poor DRT behavioral data compared to healthy peers.
• Both, the anxious and healthy participant will show an increase of cognitive and physical fitness, as well as DRT behavioral data after the intervention.
• The anxious participant will show a significant increase of the preparatory negativity after the intervention.
• The healthy participant will show a normalization of the preparatory negativity after the intervention.


Methods


Participants
Two participants aged 65 and 87 years, whereas one person showed high anxiety 
(HA)
 and the other person no anxiety at all (NA), based on the STAI-Y2 questionary, were assigned for this study. Both participants performed the physical-cognitive DT training with feedback. The participants were living in the close community center and remained independently in their all-daily life. Noteworthy, both were free of any treatments. The recruitment of the participants took place between May and June. After the enrolment, participants showed no exclusion criteria, so the study could start without any doubts.
Before the intervention, each participant was informed about all procedures and was asked to sign an informed consent. Moreover, the project was following the Declaration of Helsinki-Guidelines and were submitted to the committee for the authorization of the research (CAR) at the University of Rome "Foro Italico" to obtain the approval of ethical aspects.


Study Design
The study is defined as a pre-liminary case study. Due to the Coronavirus situation, only 1
Person per time was allowed to enter the laboratory. Hence, less people could participate in the study. The results will be considered for the future experimental study, which will take place in autumn. However, the study contained an intervention, which lasted over 1 month, including 7 training sessions and a pre-and post-screening test. The participants were asked to come to the laboratory at the Foro Italico University twice a week to perform the training.
The schedule was individually managed with the participants twice a week. Additionally, each person participated for the screening tests before, and after the intervention to detect the ERP data, as well as the cognitive and functional fitness.


Screening
At the screening sessions, the cognitive and functional fitness of the participants were tested. Also, the anxiety level of the participants was conducted. Additionally, the ERP data during a discriminative task on the computer were measured. 
Table 1
 shows the typology of baseline physical data of the participants recorded before the intervention. 


State Trait Anxiety Inventory
To detect the anxiety level of the participants, the so-called "State Trait Anxiety Inventory" (STAI) were used. The STAI-Y version contains 40 self-reported items which aims to assess the trait anxiety as a stable character, as well as the state anxiety about a specific event. The selected assessment remains sensitive to the level of anxiety over many years. Moreover, the inventory has been utilized over 14.000 times, which highlights the enormous relevance.
Hence, the participants were asked to fill out the questionary, which lasted around 5 minutes to complete. Further, the STAI were scored using the norms of the Italian version, whereas the higher scores define the higher level of anxiety. As mentioned in the study above, the levels of anxiety can be categorized in four categories, whereas a score above 44 is defined as high anxiety 
(Spielberger et al., 1983)
.


Montreal Cognitive Assessment
Next, to screen the cognitive status of the individuals, the "Montreal Cognitive Assessment Moreover, the assessment has been proofed to be sensitive and specific, detecting cognitive impairments, such as Alzheimer's disease and has been validated for older people ranging between 55 and 85 years. Also, executive functions, higher-level language abilities, and complex visuospatial processing can be mildly impaired in participants with mild cognitive impairments, which are detected by the MoCA 
(Larner, 2016)
.


Functional Fitness Battery
According to the physical fitness assessment, tasks were selected which are suited for elderly people to detect the functional fitness. Noteworthy, positive results ensure all inclusion criteria for a safe participation at the intervention. Moreover, the tasks were scored to detect any difference between the pre-and postintervention. Specifical, the "Four Square Test", the "Functional Reach Test", the "Time up and go Test" and basic balance tasks were performed. To highlight, the ERP analysis were focused on the preparatory brain wave labelled as "prefrontal negativity (pN) which is a top-down activity originating from the PFC 
(Di Russo et al., 2017
.
According to the test procedure, the figure 1 shows the stimuli which consisted of 2 targets plus 2 non-targets in squared configurations. Hence, in contrast to the preliminary study, only 4 different target stimuli were selected, fitting to the cognitive level of the participants. Target and non-target stimuli were randomly presented for 250 ms with equal probability. Likewise, the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 s. The participants were asked to press a button with the right index finger when a target stimulus appeared, withholding the response for non-target (go/no-go task). Hence, the response time (RT) as well as the accuracy were measured. Meanwhile, the brain activity were recorded (Di 
Russo et al., 2017
Russo et al., , 2019
. The test was repeated 10 times, without any pretrial. The participants were tested in a pre-set room after preparing the EEG cap.
Likewise, the visual stimuli were presented on a 24" screen, sitting in front of the computer. At the center of the screen, a fixation point was always seen. So, they were asked to press the button with the right hand as soon as possible after seeing one of the two Go-patterns. The specific test procedure is similar to the preliminary stud, which is described in the chapter above. 


Intervention
After the screening day, instructors ensured that the participants provide all inclusion criteria for further participation. Each intervention session lasted around 30 min and took place twice a week in the laboratory of Foro Italico University. In sum, 7 sessions were performed in a month, following the same physical-cognitive dual task training with feedback.
The concurrent performance of physical and cognitive exercises required inhibitory control of attention, as the attention allocation to both physical and cognitive tasks involve inhibition of prepotent and distracting behavior. Based on previous literature, it is expected that both participants will improve functional fitness and cognitive performance.
Additionally, the PFC activity in the pN phase will be normalized, meaning that in anxiety older individuals the activity will decrease, while in health older individuals the activity will increase. Hence, both will benefit from the training with feedbacks and reduce normalize anxiety level 
(Falbo et al., 2016)
.
The purpose of the training intervention is to improve the functional abilities as well as the cognitive functions. Hence, this should lead to a better PFC activation and in a further perspective to an improved and independently daily life function. Noteworthy, the program was initially developed in the laboratory of Foro Italico University designed for older people.
It contained tasks which included exercises for the lower and upper body performed either while sitting on a gymnastic ball, standing or while walking. In addition, the training consisted of various stimulus-response cognitive tasks, linking different types of upper or lower limbs exercises with different visual stimuli. So, the tasks were arranged in short routines to concurrently stimulate muscle power, static and dynamic balance and different cognitive functions in a coordinated manner. Likewise, promoting inhibition of habitual responses and challenge working memory, participants performed task sequences reversing or "scattering" the learned order. Also, they were asked to learn different stimulus-response associations and further, to switch between them based on changing external cues.
To perform those tasks, the "Witty-SEM" system (Microgate S.r.l, Bolzano, Italy) were utilized (figure 2). Specifically, that training system presents a cognitive reactive training method. It is made up of photocells, which are able to project numbers, letters, arrows and colors. Moreover, those led matrices provide a built-in proximity sensor, which allows an interaction with the performer. Hence, the portable training system provides visuo-auditory cues to enhance different types of cognitively demanding tasks. So, the cognitive functions of the participants are stimulated while training physical and functional abilities These devices can be placed on individual or multiple standing support scattered in the room or placed in front of the sitting or standing participant who will be asked to associate the emitted signals with different physical tasks. So, the devices can be used flexible, in a laboratory or at home and can be self-controlled or controlled at distance by an operator using a smartphone app. Considering the transfer of the Witty-Sem System to the real-life intervention with older people, the procedure was selected wisely to ensure a safe and effective training method.
The stimulus categories were coded by distinct colors and symbols, while the participants were asked to brush as quickly and accurately as possible the sensors with the target color/symbol.
Specifically, the physical-cognitive dual task training was composed of the following tasks mentioned below. Noteworthy, the difficulty was calibrated in the preliminary testing suited to the participants. However, the level of difficulty was increased individually during the intervention.


Analysis
Since only two participants were participating in the study, a statistical analysis was not applicable. Hence descriptive data were analysed to show single results and to present possible tendencies for future studies. Therefore, the Microsoft Excel program were mainly used to collect the data and to create figures. The results were compared within the participants before and after the intervention calculating the percentage of the initial value. Additionally, data were confronted with preliminary data of young participants. Also, figures were created to illustrate the results.


Results


Basic Screening
The HA participant is female and 78 years old, the NA participant is male and 65 years old. According to the BMI classification for elderly of the World Health Organization, both showed a normal BMI 
(table 2)
. 


Montreal Cognitive Test
As showed in figure 3, at the Montreal Cognitive test, the NA participant reached a score of 27 points before and 26 points after the intervention. Hence, he showed a normal cognitive ability in both tests 
(Larner, 2016)
. In contrast, the HA could improve the cognitive ability after the intervention. She reached a score of 18 point at the pre-test, which is categorized as a cognitive impairment. After the intervention, she could reach 25 points, which presents an improvement of 39%. 


State Trait Anxiety Inventory
The NA participant showed no anxiety level at all at the pre-test. He did not show a great difference of both, the trait and the state anxiety level after the intervention. According to 
Ansari & Derakshan (2011a
, 2011b
, with 25 and 23 points on the anxiety questionary he stood on the lowest level.
The HA participant showed a high trait anxiety (46 points) and a low state anxiety before the intervention (32 points). Noteworthy, a high anxiety levels are classified with more than 44 points. Showing in the figure 18, the anxiety level of the HA participant could decrease after the intervention. The participant reached the lowest trait anxiety level (25 points), while the state anxiety level stayed stable (31 points). Hence, the trait anxiety level decreased about 46% from the initial value.  All, standing with opened eyes, closed eyes, and the tandem position with the dominant leg wit opened eyes could performed more than 30 s.
Considering the results of the NA participant, various improvements can be seen.  


Discriminative Response Task
The behavioural data of the discriminative response task were compared to the representative group of the preliminary study described above. Generally, the response speed, the response consistency, the accuracy and the commission errors were evaluated.
The mean response time and the standard deviation were needed to calculate the intraindividual co-efficient of variation (ICV). The omission errors (OEmissing responses to the targets) as well as the commission errors (CEresponses to No-go trials) were used to evaluate the accuracy.
As shown in the figure 6, the healthy young participants showed better results in every behavioural DRT factor. The response time to the stimuli were improved of the HA participant about 41% (962-560 ms), while the response time of the NA participant were increased about 5% (520-550 ms). Likewise, the accuracy of the NA participant enhanced, decreasing the responses to No-go trials from 35% to 19% and the missing a) b)
c) d)
responses to targets from 9% to 4%. Also, the HA participant could improve the omission errors from 40% to 26%, but the responses to No-go increased from 23% to 26%. A different amplitude of the pN wave can be seen according to the groups and the test before and after the intervention. The pN initiated at about -800 ms and was maximal at stimulus onset. Additionally, data of the group of 15 healthy young participants were added to the figure. Whereas the pN activity of the HA participant was almost flat before the intervention, after the intervention the pN became large as the young group. In the NA participant the pN was large (larger than young group and the HA participants) in the pretest and became slightly larger in the post-test.
Additionally, the BP during the DRT test were analysed. Likewise, to the pN improvements, both old participants increased the BP activity. After the intervention, both showed a BP amplitude comparable to that of the young group. However, the HA participant had a lower BP activity in the pre-test and, hence, a bigger improvement. The slope of rising is also different in the HA participant, seeing a flatter curve before the stimulus onset. Looking at the figure below, the BP activity onset is slightly later than the pN component in all participants. The BP initiated at about -700 ms. Noteworthy, the smooth green waveforms of the young group are much less noisy the individual data because derive by the average of 15 individuals. Furthermore, the scalp topography of the participants shows the activity distribution before and after the intervention in the intervals from -400 to 0 ms. As showed in the figure 8
there is a great increase of activity at prefrontal and central areas in both participants.
While the HA participant did not show any activity at prefrontal and only little in central at the pre-test, there was more activity in both areas at the post-test, detecting almost -5 μV at CPz. The NA participant showed more activity in the right prefrontal area, increasing that activity after the intervention. The topographical distribution was similar in all the reported cases. 


Discussion
In the present study, two participants were recruited to perform the intervention with the purpose to provide preliminary data, showing the effectiveness of dual-task training on PFC activity, cognitive function, fitness function and anxiety level. Therefore, pre-and post-screenings were performed, using a high-density EEG with ERP analysis during DRT tasks. Hence, the pN preparatory activities in PFC areas as well as in the premotor BP were analysed comparing the data with normative data from group of young participants. Additionally, functional and cognitive fitness were assessed, and differences were analysed.


Anxiety
According to the STAI-Y questionary detecting the anxiety level of the participants, great results after the intervention could be presented. While the NA participant did not show much difference after the intervention and stood on the lowest level, the HA participant improved a lot in terms of the trait anxiety. Hence, she showed a high trait anxiety level before (46 points) but reached 25 points after the intervention. So, the trait anxiety level decreased about 46% from the initial value. Those results are confirming the expected outcomes and are motivating for future research. The fact, that only one month of dualtask training might be required to alleviate a disorder in that extent is great and appeals for further considerations. Moreover, subjectively, the participant felt more secure and told the instructors that she manages the daily life much better in terms of, for example, not holding on a bar while walking the stairs, and more.
In line with the great anxiety results are the functional and cognitive results, confirming a correlation between those factors. Moreover, the improved anxiety level of the HA participant could correlate with the improved behavioural data of the DRT test and the increased pN activity. Hence, the attentional control and processing efficiency might be improved and the distraction by task-irrelevant stimuli could be decreased. Thus, the results are in agreement with the relevant literature, association anxiety with task performance and poor PFC activity 
(Park & Moghaddam, 2017;
Sari et al., 2016)
. So, stimulating the EFs with dual-task training is in line with few other studies 
(Falbo et al., 2016;
Lord & Close, 2018)
. Not to forget that additional feedback to the task performance can boost the positive effect leading the internal focus to the effect of the movement 
(McNevin et al., 2003)
.
The STAI score and the statement of the HA participant is in agreement with the knowledge of GAD and quality of life. Literature has reported that older anxious people show a decreased quality of life. Since it is known, that GAD correlates with a poor mental health, social functioning and vitality, the improvement of the anxiety level is in great interest for researchers 
(Hidalgo & Sheehan, 2012)
.


Cognitive performance
When it comes to the cognitive skills after the intervention, the HA participant could reported multiple times, that GAD is affecting the cognitive performance negatively, due to worrying and trying to use strategies to achieve the goal 
(Derakshan & Eysenck, 2009)
.
Additionally, an early detection of impairment could lead to an effective search for the root cause. It is in great interest to improve the time of the diagnosis since it is evidence-based that this correlates to the quality of life of the affected people. Specifically, the cognitive performance is highly related to the gait performance, meaning that gait impairments and further falls are more prevalent in people with poor cognitive performance. Moreover, this correlation shows stronger effects in older people 
(Montero-Odasso et al., 2012)
. Worth to state out, the plasticity of the brain even in older ages allows individuals to improve and prevent degenerative processes, highlighting the importance of the early assessment of cognitive function.


Fitness Tests
Considering the functional fitness data after the intervention, various improvements can be reported. Looking at the balance tests, so the HA participant did not even try various tasks. She was too anxious and/or not able to stand on the nondominant leg and with closed eyes. After the intervention, she could perform every task, which is already a great improvement and worth to report. Noteworthy, the participant is with 5 s at tandem closed eyes task still below the normative data from the study of 
Vereeck et al. (2008)
 with age matching dwelling elderly (13.20 s). Also, the task, standing on one leg, could improve about 3 times from 2.37 s to 9.13 s, which is still less than the normative group (21.43 s).
Standing with closed eyes, which was not possible before the intervention, she could reach 3.66 s afterwards (representative data: 4.87 s).
However, the NA participant could improve a lot as well. Besides the task of standing with the dominant leg OE, standing with the nondominant leg CE and the nondominant tandem task with OE, the time of the other tasks could increase. After the intervention he could reach the maximal time in both dominant leg tandem task, where he is above the mean time of the normative data. Although, the time of the task, standing with one leg OE and CE, is less than the normative data (27.72 s, 8.93 s).
However, significant comparisons are not rational, as the participants only had one pre trail and one test trail, while the normative study collected the mean time out of three trails. Those limitation should be reconsidered for the experimental study. The interpretation should only give some bias and motivation for further research.
According to the functional reach test it is a clinical assessment to measure dynamic balance aiming to explain the risk of falling, especially in elderly. The distance was assessed two times and the mean were calculated afterwards. Reaching more than 25 cm only low risk to fall can be interpreted. Hence, the NA participant did not show any risk, even the distance decreased a bit after the intervention, reaching 37.5 cm and 36.5 cm.
The HA participant only reached 24 cm at the pre-screening, which correlates with a 2x greater risk of falling than normal 
(Duncan et al., 1990)
. After the intervention the distance could be improved to 28 cm. Thus, she could decrease her risk of falling. That improved performance at this test could cause from a better movement strategy trained by the dual task intervention.
The 4square step test aimed to assess the ability to step over little obstacles, forward, sideway, or backward. Those movements were also included in various performance tasks in the intervention training expecting better outcomes afterwards. Compared to the representative group of geriatric older people, both participants showed good results.
Literature has reported that poor performance in that test correlates also with risk of falling. Specifically, older people reaching more than 15 s are about that higher risk 
(Moore & Barker, 2017)
. However, the HA participant could improve the mean performance (test measured two times and mean time were calculated afterwards) about 37% (13.06 s, 8.19 s). Also, the time of the NA participant decreased about 17% from 8.86 to 7.35 s. Hence, the expected outcomes to achieve better results due to the intervention program could be confirmed.
Considering the time up and go test and in addition the cognitive part, great improvements could be observed as well. This test is designed for the elderly population to measure the progress of balance, walking and sitting considering the relation to the risk of falling.
Noteworthy, it is recommended that the test including the cognitive part, should not be interpreted solely, due to only moderate accuracy. Remarkable, the HA participant could improve the mean time about the half (49%) from 12.36 to 6.36 s. The literature's cut off point to have a greater risk of falling in older adults are more than 12 s at the test 
(Shumway-Cook et al., 2000)
. Similar results could be shown in the test with cognitive tasks. There she performed the test within 21.38 s before and 12.02 s after the intervention, which presents a 44% improvement from the initial value.
Also, the NA participant could decrease the time almost about the half from 7.86 to 4.56 s and 9.95 to 5.41 s. Hence, no risk of falls would be correlated before or after the intervention. However, better results highlight the effectivity of the program also in healthy older people.
Interestingly, the great improvement might also cause from a so-called learning effect.
Since the participants already performed the test before the intervention, the process efficiency and productivity might be increased by the repeated times.
Generally, it is well-know, that physical training enhances cognitive and functional fitness and counteracts the degenerative processes during aging 
(Gokdemir et al., 2020)
.
According to literature, the dual task training provides an effective method to affect the fitness and cognitive skills of individuals and reduce risk of falls and in general the morbidity rate. Important to mention, physical fitness is correlating positively with brain structures such as the PFC. In agreement with the literature, in that experimental study, the functional fitness could improve in the individuals after the intervention. Considering the percentage of the improvement, the HA participant had always worse initial values and greater improvements afterwards. Hence, a daring hypothesis can be state out to say that the dual task training affected both, but the HA more effectively.


Behavioural Data
Looking at the behavioural data of the DRT tests, interesting results can be interpreted.
Coinciding with 
Berchicci et al. (2013)
 the physical status of older people correlates with the response time (RT), counteracting the neural over-activation in the PFC. Similar results can only be observed in the HA participant, since all fitness tests were improved and the response time as well, while the preparatory activity in the PFC increased. In contrast, the NA participant showed a slightly slower response time, while the activity increased. Specifically, the response time could improve about 41% in the HA participant reaching 550 ms, while the NA participant increased a bit from 520 ms to 550 ms.
Literature has mentioned that the activity gets greater to compensate or dedifferentiate more to get better performance outcomes seeing for example in the better response time.
Hence, the results of the NA participant, presenting a slower RT and a higher pN activity is not in line with the hypothesis.
In agreement with the previous research, both have a slower RT compared to the young participants (450 ms). The RT correlates negatively with a better accuracy. Hence, more time gives you a better chance to be more accurate while performing the task.
Noteworthy, the hyper-activation leads to a highly controlled top-down behaviour.
Additionally, a greater pN correlates with a greater top-down control. (Di Russo et al.,


2017)
Moreover, literature has reported, that the slowdown of processing are associated with the impaired daily life activities, such as driving, crossing street, or grasping an object which falls down), not to forget decision making and learning 
(Berchicci et al., 2014)
.
However, more knowledge regarding this over-activation combined with the pN activity and the behavioural data of the DRT tests is yet to research. Noteworthy, considering the activity changes of both participants, it is obvious that brain plasticity truly exists.
According to the accuracy of the DRT test, previous literature presented that the CE and OE are affected by the pN activity. So, if the pN activity increases, the false alarms 
(CE)
 and the OE (omission errors) decreases. Due to less inhibitory control, participants are less able to prevent the not wanted responses or to respond to the target (Di 
Russo et al., 2019
).
The CE decreased from 25% to 19% and OE from 9% to 4% of the NA participant.
Remarkable, both post-results were similar to the results of the young participants. Since a better accuracy is correlating with a slower response time, the NA participant confirmed that with his results 
(Berchicci et al., 2013)
. Also, the ICV could improve about 24%.
Noteworthy, considering the relative improvement, so there is a reduction of 24% and 56% in accuracy, while the RT only increased about 6%. Highlighting that, there is a better performance outcome after the intervention.
Interestingly, the HA participant could improve almost every behavioural factor. Only the CE, response to no-go's, remained stable (from 23% to 26%). Anyhow, outstanding, the RT is decreased about 42% reaching almost similar results than a healthy person. Also, important to consider, is the OE result, reaching in the pre-test 40% and decreasing in the post-test 26%. Not to forget, that the accuracy is still much lower compared to healthy ones. Relatively, the performance outcomes after the intervention improved immense.
Worth to mention, the DRT is activating the process similar to those taking place in the daily life, such as selecting an action as a response to an external stimuli (Di 
Russo et al., 2019)
. Hence, assumptions, stating that the participant might also perform better in real life situations, can be stated out.
A growing body of literature has stated out that specific brain areas, such as the PFC supporting the EF, are more sensitive to a physical training than other areas 
(Berchicci et al., 2014)
. As described in detail above, the EF are needed performing in an unusual situation initiating a goal-directed behaviour 
(McAlister & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2016
).
The dual-task training is targeting those skills requiring especially the top-down system of the attentional control. Additionally, directing the attention externally by the dual task training with giving feedback, the task irrelevant stimuli should increase, while the goal directed system increases. This is in high interest for anxious people, considering the threat related process which leads to the less goal directed attention 
(Derakshan & Eysenck, 2009;
Shi et al., 2019)
.
According to the current state of art, anxiety is also influencing the EF, especially the working memory. Resulting from a poor cognitive control system or from the inability to use control mechanism to screen out task-irrelevant processing and focus on the task 
(Balderston et al., 2017)
. Compared to the results of this study, similar effects could be interpreted, since the HA participant showed a better anxiety level, while having better behavioural results at the DRT test.


Brain activity
During the DRT, the preparation activity could be mainly observed at the SMA and PFC, as also presented in previous literature (Di 
Russo et al., 2019)
.
Compared to the young group, the healthy older participant showed a greater activation in the PFC. This might cause from the general degeneration affected by the age, meaning that an over-activation comes either from a poor neural specialisation and non-selective recruitment. In contrast, the over-activation could express through the recruitment of additional brain areas or the overactivation compensates for behavioural deficits. Hence, two hypothesis could be found in the literature causing the neural over activity in older people calling the compensation hypothesis and dedifferentiation hypothesis 
(Berchicci et al., 2013)
.
Additionally, looking at the figure 21, the onset of the pN activity raised earlier in elderly compared to the young participants. The phenomena of the PFC activity in the preparatory phase of the different target groups can be explained, considering the complex of the task. While the young healthy participants did not need any the PFC control activity to perform a quite simple task, it is required for older people. Additionally, the PFC activity of the anxious older people is less, due to the hypothesis of limited brain activity resources which are more required for handling a stressful situation 
(Berchicci et al., 2013;
Di Russo et al., 2017)
.
The well-known BP is also presenting a slow-rising negativity before an external event, although it is more known for self-paced movements. However, literature has reported that in both situations the BP peaks in medial frontal electrodes, such as the CPz. Moreover, the BP correlates with the response time positively (Di 
Russo et al., 2019)
. This hypothesis can be confirmed with the HA participant. As seen in the figure 21 and 22, the BP increased in both participants, but way more in the HA woman. Additionally, the rising slope was at the beginning steep and more flat right before the stimuli onset in the HA participant. Noteworthy, the BP activity in the post-test was almost similar to the young group.
Considering the onset of the BP activity, the older participants showed no differences between the time points and compared to the young participants. Although, literature has presented that older people an earlier BP onset (Di 
Russo et al., 2019)
. However, generally, more activity difference compared to the younger people are pictured in the pN figure than in the BP.


Conclusion
In conclusion, the experimental study investigated preliminary data about the effect of dual-task training with feedback on the pN activity, the cognitive and fitness level as well as the anxiety level of older people. Conclusively, this presented work added the cognitive part to the well-known physical training expecting a greater effect to all mentioned factors.
The results were interpreted qualitatively and should give some tendencies for future considerations. Major results are in line with previous literature, highlighting the even greater effects on the HA participants and the achieved low anxiety level. From an expanded perspective, especially the EF are on great interest to improve, presenting in detected data, such as DRT behavioural data, cognitive and functional tests and the ERP data.
From a public health point of view, efficiently working EF is crucial for the quality of life, since EF are needed to perform under dual task conditions, which appear many times a day. Further, poor EF are associated with risk of falls, which also presents an enormous issue in the health sector 
(Montero-Odasso et al., 2012)
. Summarizing, that a dual-task intervention might lead to many benefits for elderly but also for anxious older people, not to forget the additional effect when giving feedback.


Limitations
Due to the COVID-19 situation, there are various limitations, which affected the study.
Less participants were recruited, because limited people were allowed to stay in the lab on the same time. Hence, just an inefficiently procedure was possible. Additionally, recruiting older people had been a hard process, since the target group was categorized as a great risk group for COVID-19 disease. People were worried to get infected and the mobility to get to the lab presented a big barrier. Moreover, the intervention was supposed to take place in a training group at a gym hall, so more people on the same time could have been trained. Hence, this study cannot be considered as a study with quantitative and significant results for relevant future considerations. The study should me more seen as a pilot study, aimed to present qualitative preliminary data to plan the experimental study in autumn.
Furthermore, the time period of the intervention was selected for 1 month, as the study needed to be postponed and there was a time limit to deliver the thesis. Approximately, better results would have been achieved if the intervention would last at least 2-3 months.
Besides the issues causing from the COVID-19 situation, having only 2 participants, there is a big age difference between the two older people, which could also lead to differences in the results. Also, the participants had to wear the face masks for COVID-19 protection, which was another unpleasant factor, especially for older people and during the summer times.
According to the EEG screening test, in future planning's for the experimental study, the difficulty of the test should be reconsidered. The HA participant had struggles to follow and remember the visual stimuli in the first screening tests. Different visual patterns, which are easier to distinguish might be an option to achieve a better study run. Next, since the experiment took place in Rome, the participants were only speaking Italian which led sometimes to a language barrier and another Italian instructor is needed.
(
MoCA)" was utilized. Noteworthy, the method presents a cognitive screening instrument, which was commonly developed to detect cognitive impairment. This assessment contains cognitive tasks which requires visuospatial, memory, attention, concentration, language, abstraction, as well as orientation skills. The process lasted around 10min.

a) Trait Anxiety Score of both participants; b) State Anxiety score of both participants before and after the interventionFitness AssessmentAccording to the fitness screening before and after the intervention, the participants could try over every task for once before starting to record. All balance tests were assessed only once, while the 4 square test, the time up and go test and the functional reach test were recorded twice and the mean value of both were calculated.All results in details from the Pre-and Posttests are listed in the table 3 and illustrated in the figure below:


Especially, the time during the functional fitness tests could be increased, while the balance tests only partly improved. The mean time of the 4 square test could decrease from 8.86s to 7.35, the mean time up and go test from 7.86 to 4.56 s and the same test with cognitive task added from 9.95 to 5.41 s.The HA improved the performance in every task. While the participant was too anxious and not able to perform the most balance tasks before the intervention, she could perform all of them after the intervention. Additionally, the mean distance at the functional and reach test improved from 24 cm to 28 cm, which presents a 17% increase. Likewise, to the NA participant, she performed the functional tests faster. She improved the time about37% at the 4 square test from 13.06 to 8.19 s. Remarkable, the mean time at the time up and go test decreased almost about the half (49%) from 12.36 to 6.36 s. Likewise, she performed the cognitive time up and go test within 21.38 s before and 12.02 s after the intervention, which presents a 44% improvement from the initial value. The results of both participants are pictured in the figure 19:

improve the score of the MoCa Test about 39% and reached 25 points out of 30 while the results of the NA participant stood quiet stable (27.26). Research has reported that a score of 18-25 points presents a mild cognitive impairment (MoCA -Cognitive Assessment, 2021). Hence, the HA participant almost improved her cognitive skills from a mild cognitive impairment to no cognitive impairment at all. This result is enormous and confirms the expectation. Moreover, it shed lights for a promising and effective intervention method to improve the cognitive status in anxious older people. It has been
