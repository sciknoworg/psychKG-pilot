You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction


Uncertainty in Clinical Settings
Communication about the likelihood of an event is relevant for all stages of medical or mental health treatment. Clinicians need to interpret uncertain information provided by patient, from clinical literature and from diagnostic guidelines and treatment manuals. They need to communicate the uncertainty inherent in their assumptions about diagnoses and outcomes to the patient. The patient in turn needs to communicate how certain they are about their own symptoms, and to interpret the uncertainty expressed by the clinician's diagnosis and treatment advice. Either party may over-or underestimate symptom severity, frequency, likelihood or urgency. There is an inherent challenge in whether clinician and patient have the same interpretation of a statement about uncertainty.
1.1.1. Risk and probability. An uncertain situation involves a likelihood for a given outcome in a given situation. The term "risk" is often used for negative outcomes, while "possibility" is used for positive outcomes. A classicist view of likelihood emphasizes the number of possible events and the chance occurrence of each, while a frequentist view emphasizes the historical record of an event occurring relative to competing events. The exact likelihood of an event is unknown and unknowable, both before and after the event occurs 
(Feduzi et al., 2014;
Nau, 2001)
. Although probabilities are nondiscrete, we often think of an assumed likelihood to have a range or a specific point-estimate somewhere between "impossible" (e.g., a 0% chance) and "certain" (a 100% chance). It is challenging for humans to reason about future events in terms of probability, and it appear we have a preference to think in absolute (or categorical) terms 
(Simon & Newell, 1971;
Szolovits & Pauker, 1978)
.


Verbal phrases for expressing probability.
Phrases can be used to convey information about the probability an event has for occurring. This uncertainty is typically conveyed by verbal phrases, such as "likely", "possible" or "uncertain". 
Hanauer and colleagues (2012)
 found that 313 different phrases had been used for this in medical literature. The choice of phrase gives an indication of how high probability the sender has in mind. Nevertheless, most verbal phrases have a wide range of possible interpretations (for reviews, see 
Collins & Hahn, 2018;
Lipkus, 2007;
Wallsten & Budescu, 1995)
. There is thus a potential for the receiver to interpret a different probability than the sender intended. A physician that says a treatment has "a possibility" of curing a disease may think that the probability is at 40 percent, but the patient may interpret this as anything from 20 to 70 percent 
(Mazur & Hickam, 1997)
. Further, such miscommunication may go undetected by both sender and receiver 
(Brun & Teigen, 1988)
.
In addition to the direct effect of communicating a given probability, the choice of verbal statements could also have indirect effects on how the receiver thinks about probabilities and outcomes.
Communicating about a given probability can be framed in a positive way ("there is a possibility this will go well") or in a negative way ("it is not certain that this will go well"; 
Collins & Hahn, 2018;
Teigen & Brun, 1999)
. Choice of phrase may indicate whether the uncertainty is due to missing information, or due to variability and randomness 
(Ülkümen et al., 2016)
. The phrases can also function as social "hedges", to make the message less blunt, more polite and to maintain the sender's reputation 
(Bonnefon & Villejoubert, 2006)
. Verbal phrases may thus impact decisions and reveal the speaker's preferences and expertise.


Effects of probability phrases on communication.
Studies have shown that probability phrases are often interpreted differently by the receiver than what was intended by the sender 
(Brun & Teigen, 1988;
Budescu et al., 2014;
Wallsten et al., 1986)
. The interpretation of phrases may be influenced by the way they are framed 
(Brun & Teigen, 1988;
Teigen, 2015)
. Phrases may also have an inherent directionality 
(Teigen & Brun, 1999)
, in that the receiver is more willing to take an action when a positive phrases (such as "some possibility") is used, than a negative phrases (such as "quite uncertain"). The use of probability phrases may conceal miscommunication issues 
(Holtgraves, 2021)
. Finally, while senders prefer to use verbal phrases when expressing probabilities, studies have indicated that receivers often prefer to have probabilities stated as numeric information 
(Wallsten et al., 1993)
.
1.1.4. Different types of probability phrases. Probability phrases can be classified according to whether they relate to either how likely or realistic the event is, or to the frequency of the event given a high number of chances for it to occur. 
Beyth-Marom (1982)
 found there to be more variation in the interpretation of frequency phrases than in the interpretation of likelihood phrases.
A more detailed classification was offered by 
Clark (1990)
:. Phrases like "sometimes", "rarely", "almost always", describe how frequently an event would occur, given a high number of similar circumstances. Phrases like "best bet", "safe choice" or "good call" say something about the utility of an uncertain outcome. Some phrases are logical expressions, such as "is consistent with" or "cannot be excluded". Other phrases describe the relationship between probability and expectations, such as "there's a fair chance" or "it can be expected". Finally, some phrases describe the prototypical outcome, such as "this is what normally happens". 
Clark (1990)
 also described "other" types of probability phrases, some of which describe how "realistic" an event is, such as "highly probable", "very small chance". Paradoxically, phrases in the "other" category are often included in research on probability phrases, and may be more frequently used than the category name would indicate. 
Teigen and Brun (1995)
 also distinguished between positive expressions, implying the likelihood of a specific outcome, and negative expressions, highlighting the unlikelihood of that outcome. They saw this distinction as related to but not synonymous with high and low probability values. A given probability was seen as more attractive when phrased as having "some possibility" of success, than when phrased as being "quite uncertain" 
(Teigen & Brun, 1999)
. Moreover, negative phrases result in fewer conjunction errors in probabilistic reasoning than positive phrases. For example, a combination of two "uncertain" outcomes is readily perceived as "very uncertain". However, positive phrases result in fewer disjunction errors compared to negative phrases. Verbal probabilistic phrases may thus diverge from numerical probabilities not primarily by their level of "vagueness", but by suggesting the type of inferences that should be drawn 
(Teigen & Brun, 1999)
.


Previous research on quantification of probability phrases in clinical settings.
Examining how clinicians and patients interpret and quantify phrases of probability may be important for effective communication and decision-making in healthcare settings. If clinicians and patients interpret phrases to refer to different numerical probabilities, this may lead to misunderstandings. 
Kong et al. (1986)
 found that various medical professionals assigned similar percentage values to probability phrases.
The similarity in median values suggested that the phrases could safely be used for clear communication about uncertainty. 
Mazur and Hickam (1997)
 found that when consecutive patient descriptions were presented, there were distinct patterns in how patients quantified the probability terms. Patients had different specific estimates of probability, but they consistently understood the relative meanings of the terms. In other words, the way they ranked probability phrases from high to low remained similar between patients. 
O'Brien (1989)
 showed that practitioners understood probability phrases for side effects to refer to a spectrum of quantifications, ranging from "never" at 0%, with "reasonable chance" at 50%, to "certain" at 95%. Despite variations in individual ratings, the median ratings for several phrases closely aligned with findings from other studies involving different medical professionals. Research from the 1980ies and 1990ies converged on describing the phrases in terms of their average (or median) probability point estimate, and whether they refer to wide or narrow ranges of probability (see e.g., 
Wallsten et al., 1986
). More recent explorations also appear to focus on these aspects 
(Dhami & Mandel, 2022)
.


Knowledge Gap
As reviewed above, there has been extensive research on how probabilities are expressed and understood 
(Visschers et al., 2009)
. Taxonomies have been suggested for how English probability phrases are typically interpreted to indicate different numerical probabilities 
(Wallsten et al., 1986
).
There is less standardization of how Norwegian phrases reflect numerical probabilities, compared to research on the equivalent English phrases. The Norwegian Intelligence Doctrine (Norwegian Armed Forces, 2021) lists five graded Norwegian probability phrases that map onto equivalent NATO counterparts. The doctrine has a guide for which percentage ranges for each phrase, but do not substantiate that this is the prototypical interpretation of the phrases. 
Brun and Teigen (1988;
1999)
 studied Norwegian language probability phrases and how the choice of phrase influences interpretations and decisions. This work has mainly focused on identifying mechanisms that influence the interpretation of probability phrases, rather than to describe the typical interpretation of Norwegian phrases. A master thesis at The Norwegian Defence University College 
(Halvorsen, 2020)
 showed variable degree of consensus in how intelligence officers interpreted 17 probability phrases often used in the Norwegian intelligence services. A recent Norwegian survey 
(Røislien & Hesselberg, 2023)
, described by the authors as "an unceremonious online survey" of over 1,500 online participants reported interpretations of Norwegian probability phrases. This study largely supported international findings that although there is agreement on the rough ranking of the phrases, there is considerable variation in the quantified interpretation. The authors argued in favour of stating probabilities in numbers rather than phrases. 
Beyth-Marom (1982)
 found that the interpretation varied more when a phrase is presented in a context compared to when presented alone. 
Weber and Hilton (1990)
 also argued that contextual effects could have large effects on interpretation. In a more general sense, verbal framing has been shown to influence decision-making and assessment 
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1984;
Teigen & Brun, 1999)
. We should therefore explore whether the probability assigned to Norwegian probability phrases is influenced by the verbal frame. In particular, it is relevant to know how the phrases are interpreted in a clinical setting, in order to suggest which phrases may facilitate precise clinical communication.
Most of the many previous studies on this topic may not reach current academic standards for statistical power, research process transparency and data sharing. There is thus a need to replicate and build on past studies in a Norwegian setting, while using larger samples, preregistered studies and to provide open datasets.


The Current Study
We selected English verbal phrases that express probability from past research and translated them to Norwegian. Participants were asked to provide a point-estimate for the quantified probability they associate with each phrase. They were also asked to provide an upper limit for the highest probability that they think the phrase may express, and the lower limit for the lowest probability it may express (for similar approaches, see e.g., 
Wallsten et al., 1986)
. Based on our research interests in clinical decisionmaking, we also asked In a final section of the study, participants gave a point-estimate interpretation for each phrase in both a positive and a negative clinical framing.


Hypotheses
Based on past research on English probability phrases, we dichotomized the Norwegian counterpart phrases to either high or low probabilities (see 
Table 1
). Our first hypothesis (H1) was that we expected phrases in the "high probability" category to be assigned higher point-estimates for probabilities than the phrases in the "low probability" category.
Past research has indicated that some English probability phrases are associated with wider or more narrow ranges of probabilities (see 
Table 1
 for dichotomization of Norwegian counterpart phrases).
To reflect differences in how people use probability phrases, we expect (H2a) a larger range in probability point-estimates for phrases in the "broad" category than for phrases in the "narrow" category. Further, we expect participants to be aware of the differences between how the phrases are used, and thus 
H2b
to have larger difference between their upper and lower limit on interpretation (the min-max ranges) for phrases in the "broad" category than in the "narrow" category. However, participants may still underestimate the extent of the inter-individual variation in how the phrases are used. We thus expect (H2c) the variation between participants' probability point-estimates to be larger than the participant average min-max ranges.
We expect that framing the probability phrases in hypothetical clinical statements will influence how the phrases are interpreted. However, past research does not provide strong evidence for predicting the direction of such effects. We thus expect the probability point-estimates for the phrases in both the (H3a) positive and (H3b) the negative framing condition to be different from when presented without a framing (but without hypothesizing a direction for the effect).
Hypotheses, sampling and analysis plans were preregistered ahead of data collection. Hypotheses, materials and analysis plan was preregistered before data collection began (https://osf.io/8xc5v).


Methods


Participants
Invitations to participate were sent to all members (< 2,000) in a pool of potential participants (the Norwegian Citizen Lab, https://www.uib.no/en/digsscore/118577/citizen-lab). From these, 768 opened the link to the survey, 577 completed at least the demographic questions, and 471 answered all questions. The 106 respondents with partial responses were missing 4.81 of the 110 research questions on average (median of 39 respondents missing all 110). We made a non-registered decision to only include respondents that had answered at least half of the research questions, resulting in an analysis sample of N = 484. All respondent data is available in the public dataset, in order to allow interested readers to make different exclusion choices.
The participants were 71% female and 27% male. Over half of the participants (58% of the sample) reported their age as "18-25 years", while most of the remaining (37%) reported "26-35 years" and the rest (3%) reported "36-45 years" (exact age was not requested to preserve anonymity). The participants indicated a diverse field of study and professions, where 18% reported some clinical or mental health related background, and an additional 12% in non-clinical psychology.
Data was collected for one month starting in April 2020. This places the data-collection in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway, and the results will be discussed in light of that.


Experiment Procedure
The data was collected as an online survey (SurveyXact, https://rambollxact.com/surveyxact), and could be answered on smartphones, tablets or PC/laptop devices. The experiment consisted of the following steps: (1) Informed consent, (2) Demographic questions, (3) Instructions for neutral quantification, (4) Neutral quantification, (5) Instruction for positive framing, (6) Positive framing, (7)
Instruction for negative framing, (8) Negative framing, and (9) Debrief. These are explained in detail and instructions are given in an online supplementary table (https://osf.io/tcvd5). On the steps that involved indicating a quantification of a phrase or statement (steps 4, 6 and 8) the responses were given using a horizontal slider. Before responding, the slider was a grey line with a light grey circle at the left end. The circle was moved and adjusted by dragging it with touch-screen interaction or click-and-drag with a computer mouse. After moving the circle, the circle and the part of the line between the left origin point and the circle was coloured red, and a number between 0 and 100 was shown in black underneath the circle to show the currently selected value. The slider could be adjusted after placing it, and the participants clicked a button marked "Continue" when they were satisfied with the placement.
Step 3 had detailed instructions for how to use the slider, and a demonstration where the participants could test out how to use the three questions of the response mode on a blank example phrase. It took most participants 15-20 minutes to complete the study.


Materials and Variables
A list of relevant probability phrases were taken from previous studies 
(Clark, 1990;
Hamm, 1991;
Karelitz & Budescu, 2004;
Mazur & Hickam, 1997;
Visschers et al., 2009;
Wallsten & Budescu, 1995)
. From this list we selected and translated the phrases we evaluated to be relevant for Norwegian clinical context. The selection of phrases were then supplemented with other examples from comparable Norwegian studies 
(Brun & Teigen, 1988)
. This resulted in the 22 probability phrases shown in 
Table 1
 that were used in the experiment. Where applicable, information from previous studies were used to classify the phrases to indicate a high or low probability, and a broad or narrow range of probabilities. 


Data Cleaning
In accordance with the preregistration, we tested the logical coherence of point-estimate, minimum and maximum interpretation responses for neutral phrases (thus 3 questions x 22 phrases x 484 participants = 31,944 responses). When a participant had stated a minimum interpretation for a phrase that was higher than the maximum interpretation for the same phrase, we assume an error in responding or understanding. We removed both minimum and maximum value in such cases, leading to excluding 194 responses. Thereafter, we assumed an error when a participant had indicated a minimum response for a phrase that was higher than their own point-estimate. We removed the minimum range response in such cases, leading to excluding 354 responses. Finally, we assumed an error when a maximum range response was lower than their own point-estimates. We removed the maximum range response in such cases, leading to excluding 292 responses. After these removals, 6.82% of the sample had more than 9 missing values.
While the response distributions had central tendencies for each phrase, there were also nontrivial numbers of deviating extreme answers. For example, some participants had answered that they interpret the phrase "never" to usually indicate a probability of 100%, or "always" to indicate a probability of 0%. Such outliers may be due to some participants being confused about the response scale (although none had a completely reversed response pattern across all phrases), random mistakes or slips, or noncompliant behaviour. 1 Our preregistration did not describe an approach to handle this. We find that an outlier removal at +/-two standard deviations strike a good balance of removing responses that appear
to have been made in error, while retaining idiosyncrasies in the participants' interpretation of the phrases.
We have provided online analysis scripts and datasets that make it easy for the reader to test out effects of using different approaches to outlier removal.


Results


Descriptive analyses
3.1.1. Overall descriptive results. The point estimate, minimum, and maximum probability for each phrase were reported as values between 0 and 100. 
Table 1
 shows the interpretations of the probability phrases, ranked in descending order, as presented in the neutral (no framing) condition. These interpretations appear to make semantic sense and to match the ordering of similar phrases in previous studies.
The following sections describe and provide violin plots for the distributions of point-estimates for the phrases, with horizontal lines for what the average participant saw as minimum and maximum interpretation of each phrase. 3.1.2. Quantification of "high" and "low" probability phrases. Based on previous studies, the preregistration specified that eight of the 22 phrases would correspond to high probabilities, while nine of them would correspond to low probabilities. The answer distributions for point estimates for these high and low phrases are shown in 
Figure 1
 and 
Figure 2
, respectively. Visual inspection supports the categorization into "high" and "low" phrases. However, the figures also show that quite a few of the phrases have broad interpretations: Even if the average score is fairly high or low, they are also interpreted by some to indicate the opposite side of the halfway mark. For example, while the phrase "likely" has an average interpretation of almost 70, a considerable portion of participants also interpreted it below 50. Further, the phrases "maybe" and "uncertain" which were expected to be interpreted as low probabilities, had most of the responses around the 50% mark. Five of the phrases ("less likely", "possible", "presumably", "(there is a) risk", and "sometimes") had not been a priori categorized in terms of whether we expected them to be associated with high or low probabilities, and are not shown in figures 1 and 2.  3.1.3. Quantification of "broad" and "narrow" probability phrases. Nine of the 22 phrases were expected to have a narrow band of interpretations (i.e., people mostly agreed on which probability they indicate), whereas ten phrases were expected to have more broad ranges (i.e., more disagreement).
These two categories are shown in 
Figure 3
 and 
Figure 4
, respectively. Visual inspection of the figures supports the overall classification into narrow and broad phrases. Note that phrases like "always" and "very rarely" are more focused than phrases like "likely", "probable" and "risk". However, we also see that most of the high probability narrow phrases have mare variation in their interpretation (in particular, "certain" and "almost always"). "Never" and "not possible" also had longer tails than one may have expected. Further, while the phrase "maybe" was expected to have a broad range of interpretations, most participants place it around the half-way mark. There were three phrases that were not a priori categorized in terms of range: "less likely", "not likely" and "often". The results showed that these phrases were more similar to the "broad" than the "narrow" phrases.  


Confirmatory Analyses
The confirmatory analyses were performed in accordance with the preregistration. Welch two sample t-tests were used unless otherwise indicated, and Cohen's d was reported for effect sizes (interpreted according to 
Sawilowsky, 2009)
. H1 and H2 hypotheses are tested in the neutral condition, but similar results were seen when performing the tests in the positive and negative framing condition.
H1 stated that the average point-estimate scores in the "high probability" category would be higher than in the "low probability" category. A t-test supported H1 by showing that the interpretation of the "high phrases" (M = 82.01) were significantly higher than the "low phrases" (M = 19. H2 stated that there would be more variation in point-estimates in the "broad" than in the "narrow" category. One way to measure the variability in the interpretation of a phrase is to examine the distance between each participant's point-estimate for a phrase and the sample average point-estimates for that phrase. H2a stated that this distance would be larger for phrases in the "broad" category than for phrases in the "narrow" category. A t-test supported this by showing a significant, that the distance was larger for "broad" phrases (M = 10.56) than for "narrow" phrases (M = 6.62), with an effect size between "large" and "very large" (difference = 3.03, 95% CI [3.93, Inf], t(921.09) = 17.34, p = .001; d = 1.11, 95% CI [1.00, Inf]).
An alternative way to measure the phrase interpretation variability is to compare the size of the ranges between what participants consider to be minimum and maximum reasonable interpretation of a phrase. H2b stated that the min-max ranges would be larger for phrases in the "broad" category than phrases in the "narrow" category. A t-test supported this by showing that the range of the "broad range phrases" (M = 19.86) were interpreted as broader than the "narrow phrases range" (M = 9.73), with a large-very large effect size (t(913.98) = 17.2, p < .001; d = 1.11, 95% CI [9.17, Inf]).
To reflect that people may underestimate how broadly probability phrases may be interpreted, H2c stated that the variation between participants' probability point-estimates would be larger than the participant average min-max ranges. To test H3b, we performed t-tests of whether the average probability point-estimates for each phrase is different in "negative frame" (M = 44.44) and the "neutral" condition (M = 47.94) showed that the effect is negative, statistically significant, and of medium size (difference = -3.50, 95% CI [-4.34, - 


Discussion


Summary of Results
Our study tested how Norwegians would quantify probability phrases, what they would see as the upper and lower limit of the phrases' interpretation, and whether the interpretation would be influenced by a medical context. The results showed considerable variation in the interpretation of the phrases.
However, there were predictable patterns as to which phrases were interpreted as higher or lower probabilities, and which had narrow or broad ranges of probability. We also found a medical framing of the phrases to influence the interpretation.


Predicting the Interpretation of Probability Phrases
By supporting the first hypothesis (H1), we showed that the a priori categorization of probability phrases as referring to "high" and "low" probabilities corresponded to how the participants interpreted the phrases. This indicates that the verbal symbols have meaningful and predictable relationships with cognitive constructs.
It may be considered somewhat trivial to show that probability phrases are used in predictable ways. We would still argue that it is relevant to show replication of general patterns from previous literature 
(Hüffmeier et al., 2016;
Nosek & Errington, 2020)
, while using transparent research practices such as preregistration, open data, and high-powered statistical tests.
The support for H1 also serves the purpose of generalizing past findings into a Norwegian context, and to validate our translation (or counterparts) of English probability phrases into Norwegian.
In an extension of this, the current study takes a step towards establishing a taxonomy for how Norwegian probability phrases are typically used and interpreted. Further work should attempt to replicate and refine these results, using a more representative sample of the population, while controlling for variation in education and socio-cultural background.
The current study preregistered categories of "high" and "low" probability phrases (while keeping some phrases uncategorized). Examining the results appears to indicate that more detailed classification could also be possible. For example, the phrases "always", "almost always", "certain" and "most probable" refer to higher probabilities, than "most probable", "probable", "often" and "likely".
"Not possible" and "never" are interpreted as the lowest probabilities, closely followed by "very rarely"
and "almost never", whereas "rarely", "improbable" and "not likely" are somewhat low probabilities. The phrases "maybe" and "uncertain" were a priori assumed to be low probability phrases, but turned out to be mostly interpreted to refer to even chances. A more detailed ranking could thus be explored in future studies.
We should note that most of the words used in the Norwegian translation tend to related to the frequency of an event (e.g., "it will never happen"). In contrast, it has been argued 
(Reagan et al., 1989)
 that the English probability phrases are mostly directed at the likelihood of an event ("it is impossible").
According to 
Beyth-Marom (1982)
, there is more variation in how frequency phrases are interpreted.
Nevertheless, we find that our phrases appear to cover the same ranges and have comparable variability to those presented in the literature.


Predicting the Variability of Probability Phrases
Support for the second hypothesis (H2) showed that the probability phrases varied in how broadly or narrowly they were interpreted. The first test of this proposition (H2a) was to show that there was more variation between the participants in how they interpret the "broad" phrases than the "narrow"
phrases. Support for our a priori categorization of probability phrases as broad or narrow indicates that although people agree on phrases referring to high or low probabilities (as seen for H1 above), the degree of variation in how much people agree on these interpretations is also stable, predictable, and generalizes to a Norwegian context.
A separate question is whether people are aware of which phrases are used more broadly than other phrases. We found (H2b) that they do, in that our participants indicated wider ranges between what they thought of as reasonable minimum and maximum interpretation of the "broad" phrases than of the "narrow" phrases. Thus, when they observe others using a probability phrase, people may take into account how broadly that phrase is usually used. Further, people may choose which phrases they use in order to indicate how certain they are about the likelihood of an outcome. They may also choose phrases strategically according to whether they would like to emphasize accuracy or vagueness in their prediction (i.e., as social hedges, 
Bonnefon & Villejoubert, 2006)
.
Given that the phrases varied in how broad a range of probabilities they refer to (as seen in H2a), and that people are aware of this variation (as seen in H2b), we also wanted to test whether people had accurate impressions of how broad ranges the phrases referred to. We found (H2c) that although the participants correctly identified broader and more narrow phrases, they underestimated the extent of the variation. Almost all phrases had wider range in how people interpreted them (in terms of point-estimates after removing outliers), than the average participant's range between estimated minimum and maximum usage of the phrase. If people underestimate how large the variation may be in how a phrase is used, this may cause misunderstanding and misalignment in risk communication and expectations.
Comparing the phrases' variability shows that "possible" and "risk" have very distributed interpretations that span almost the whole possibility space without a clear central tendency. The same applies to a lesser degree to the phrases "likely", "presumably", "probable", "sometimes" and "uncertain". The phrase "maybe" is an exception to the overall pattern remarked above (H2c), since the actual variation between participants' interpretation is narrower than the estimated minimum and maximum usage range they assume that it has.


Framing Effects on Interpretation
Testing the final hypothesis (H3) showed that the phrases were interpreted as referring to lower probabilities when they were used in the context of hypothetical clinical statements. Both positive framing (probability of being healed) and negative framing (probability of developing a symptom) led to the phrases being interpreted as having a lower probability than when the phrases were presented alone. 
Beyth-Marom (1982)
 found more inter-individual variation in the probabilities that were assigned to phrases when they appeared in context, compared to when they were presented out of context.
However, the current study found probability estimates to decrease overall, rather than the variation to increase.
It is noteworthy that the effect was in the same direction in both the positive and the negative framing. If the effect had been due to a self-protective mechanism such as an optimism bias 
(Sharot, 2011)
, one may imagine that the likelihood for symptoms was seen as lower, while the probability for being healed was seen as higher. Alternatively, if the change was due to a mechanism making one more sensitive to threats to one's wellbeing, one may imagine the converse pattern, where symptoms were seen as more likely, and recovery was seen as less likely. Instead of different effects for positive and negative framing, the current results appear to indicate that there is a general effect of reducing a phrase's probability when it is presented in a medical context or of directing the phrase at the recipient. It could also be that merely adding a context imbues the phrases with a negative directionality they did not have when the phrase was presented alone. This could be comparable to the effect demonstrated by 
Teigen and Brun (1999)
.
It should be mentioned that the current study was not optimized for exploring how medical context may have influenced the interpretation of probability phrases. All participants first gave their "neutral" quantification of the phrases (without any framing), before quantifying them in the positive and negative framing (the latter two in counterbalanced order). Thus, the responses in the framing conditions may have been influenced by prior responses in the neutral condition, suggesting an ordering effect that may have masked a framing effect. This could explain the small differences between the neutral and framing conditions, as well as minimal differences between the positive and negative framing. Future studies should test the effect of framing on quantification without (or in advance of) measuring the quantification of neutral phrases.


Limits on Interpretation
The data was collected during the first stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is possible that thoughts about probabilities were closer to people's minds during this time than it would be at other times. This particularly goes for the questions where we asked participants to assign probabilities to medically framed phrases. This could have influenced the responses, although it is difficult to predict which direction this effect may have had. However, the fact that the interpretation of the phrases is comparable to previous studies indicates that the timing of the data-collection did not have an overwhelming impact.
Examining our response rates shows that a lot of participants opened the survey, but dropped out after completing the initial demographic questions. Some participants continued to fill out the first page with demographic information, but then quit on the first page that showed the example of how to provide the quantification of the phrases. It is possible that those who were not comfortable with this mode of quantifying the phrases chose not to participate. This could bias our sample so that participants are more numerate than the sample that was initially recruited to the study.
The current study was based on phrases used in traditional research on probability phrases.
However, this does not necessarily match the way probability is expressed in everyday language. For example, it has been argued that we often express probability in terms of something that can happen, or something that will happen, and that these terms are not always used in an intuitive manner 
(Teigen & Filkuková, 2013)
. Our study may have been improved by also including such phrases. Studies have also indicated that people interpret a phrase differently when asked to quantify the probability of the phrase, than when using the phrase to express probabilities 
(Teigen et al., 2014)
. This could entail that a clinician's use of a probability phrase will always be difficult to reconcile with a patient's interpretation of the phrase.


Implications and Further Research
The current results support previous research in indicating that probability phrases have imprecise interpretations and show variability across individuals. This has led some to argue 
(Dhami & Mandel, 2022)
 that numeric expressions of probabilities may be preferable to verbal phrases. Similar arguments have also been made earlier 
(Nakao & Axelrod, 1983)
. However, it appears that senders have a preference for verbal rather than numerical communication 
(Wallsten et al., 1993)
. Further, current results
indicate that a given phrase may express a broad range of probability. This inherent vagueness in verbal communication may serve strategic purposes 
(Bonnefon & Villejoubert, 2006;
Teigen & Brun, 1999)
, which would be missed if replaced with a specific number.
It has been suggested 
(Nakao & Axelrod, 1983;
Røislien & Hesselberg, 2023
) that standardized lexica should be developed for risk communication. However, it has also been shown that even standardized phrases are not always interpreted as intended 
(Collins & Hahn, 2018;
Lipkus, 2007;
Wallsten & Budescu, 1995)
, and the interpretation is nevertheless influenced by phrase framing 
(Weber & Hilton, 1990
).
The current work may suggest a third approach: It appears that although phrases vary in how widely they are interpreted, people are to some extent aware of which phrases are interpreted more broadly or more narrowly. We could thus encourage people to further develop and actively use such knowledge in their communication. Senders should use more accurate phrases (such as "highly probable"
or "very rarely") when their aim is to communicate a specific probability, while less accurate phrases (such as "likely" or "uncertain") should be used when the aim is to communicate a wider range of probabilities.
At the same time, we should warn communicators that one tends to underestimate how broadly phrases are interpreted.
As mentioned above, the current work takes a step towards establishing a taxonomy for the quantification of Norwegian probability phrases. Once established, such a taxonomy could aid decisionmakers or clinicians in choosing wording to communicate a given probability, to indicate the inherent variability in a given phrase, or to be aware of how a given phrase may be interpreted differently by different receivers.
Given the potential for order-effects in the current study design, further research should investigate framing effects without being preceded by a "neutral" condition.
Another continuation of the current project could be to examine how phrases are used differently in different populations. For example, it could be that clinicians and their patients understand a given phrase to express different probabilities.


Author Note
Thanks to other researchers involved in discussing the study design. In particular, Karl Halvor
Teigen (University of Oslo) and Eivind Kolflaath (University of Bergen) provided feedback on a pilot study for the current data collection. Thanks to all the participants that took time to respond to the survey. The current work has been supported by the University of Bergen funding for cross-disciplinary humanities research initiatives.
The analyses in the current manuscript were publicly preregistered in advance of accessing the data (https://osf.io/8xc5v). Data and analysis scripts are available online (https://osf.io/3szxd).

To test this, we performed t-tests of whether participants' range for minimum and maximum interpretation of each phrase is smaller than a reference constant of the variation
between all participant's point-estimates for the phrase. A t-test supported this by showing that the ranges
in point-estimates (M = 51.59) was larger than the average difference between minimum and maximum
estimates (M = 27.24), with an effect size between "very large" and "huge" (difference = 24.35, 95% CI
[16.39, 32.31], t(40.98) = 6.18, p < .001; d = 1.86, 95% CI [1.14, 2.57])
H3 stated that probability estimates would be different when presented in a positive or negative
medical context than when presented alone. To test H3a, we performed t-tests of whether the average
probability point-estimates for each phrase is different in the "positive frame" (M = 44.46) and "neutral"
condition (M = 47.94) showed that the effect is negative, statistically significant, and of medium size
(difference = -3.48, 95% CI [-4.31, -2.65], t(996.84) = -8.20, p < .001; d = -0.52, 95% CI [-0.64, -0.39]).


We see that similar studies with limited data cleaning (e.g., seeTable 15in Halvorsen, 2020) may have some symmetrical smaller responses on the opposite side of the 50% mark from the central tendency. This may indicate that a non-trivial number of participants invert the response scale for some responses.
