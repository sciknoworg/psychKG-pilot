You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
In 2050, the global population will comprise an equal number of elderly and younger individuals and thus, aging global populations present significant health, social, and economic changes in the coming decades (e.g., 
Harper, 2014)
. This change is linked to challenges as well as opportunities. Prosocial behavior, for example, is a vital component for the functioning of societies 
(Nowak, 2006)
 and has a profound impact on individuals' mental and physical well-being across their lifespan 
(Brown et al., 2003;
Hui et al., 2020;
Konrath et al., 2012;
O'Reilly et al., 2008)
. Past research has provided evidence for higher prosociality in older as compared to younger adults (e.g. 
(Cutler et al., 2021;
Engel, 2011;
Pollerhoff et al., 2023;
Sparrow et al., 2021)
. However, recent meta-analyses indicated that this effect might be small and have revealed significant heterogeneity in the association of adult age and prosociality, depending on how prosociality is measured 
(Bagaïni et al., 2023;
Pollerhoff et al., 2023;
Sparrow et al., 2021)
. Importantly, cognitive mechanisms underlying age-related differences in prosocial behavior, as well as factors moderating them, remain yet to be identified 
(Mayr & Freund, 2020)
.
Prosociality incorporates various behaviors such as cooperating, helping, or sharing 
(Ebner et al., 2017;
Eisenberg et al., 2006)
, all of which involve a cost to the self in order to benefit others 
(Andreoni, 1989;
Contreras-Huerta, 2023)
. Thus, a decision to engage in prosocial acts can be cast as the result of a cost-benefit calculation based on integrating values for oneself and others 
(Berkman et al., 2017;
Hutcherson et al., 2015;
Mayr & Freund, 2020)
. Interestingly, studies in the non-social domain suggest differences between younger and older adults in tasks that require integrating information from different sources or cost-ADULT AGE DIFFERENCES IN THE INTEGRATION OF VALUES FOR SELF AND OTHER 5 benefit trade-offs 
(Bagaïni et al., 2023;
De Dieuleveult et al., 2017;
Devine et al., 2021;
Ruel et al., 2021)
, potentially due to aging-related changes in available cognitive 
(control)
 resources 
(H.-Y. Chen et al., 2021;
Ruel et al., 2021)
. A decline in cognitive resources in older age might affect the integration of all available information relevant to the decisionmaking process 
(Mata & Nunes, 2010)
 and computationally, lower cognitive abilities have been related to lower efficiency in the decision process (e.g., 
Schmiedek et al., 2007;
Schubert et al., 2015)
. In line with this notion, it has been proposed that older adults may rely on processes that require lower cognitive demands during decision-making, aiming to minimize cognitive effort 
(Gigerenzer, 2003;
Sanfey & Hastie, 1999)
, for example, by analyzing and/or integrating less information 
(Mata et al., 2007
Shah & Oppenheimer, 2008
).
To explicitly test the factors underlying potential age-related differences in (pro)social decision-making, drift-diffusion models (DDMs; 
Ratcliff, 1978;
Ratcliff et al., 2016)
 are a promising tool to computationally describe trade-offs like the decision to help someone at one's own cost (e.g., 
Iotzov, Saulin, et al., 2022;
Iotzov, Weiß, et al., 2022;
Saulin et al., 2022;
Weiß et al., 2023)
. That is, DDMs provide a quantitative framework to delineate cognitive subcomponents involved in cost-benefit calculations. In detail, they assume that a noisy signal representing the relative value of (most often) two options, like helping someone or not, is integrated at each moment, and a decision is made when the accumulated evidence reaches the boundary of the correponding choice option 
(Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993;
Hunt et al., 2012;
Krajbich et al., 2010)
. This process can be characterized in terms of three parameters that each capture a different aspect of the decision process: Firstly, the drift rate, a parameter which quantifies the efficiency of the decision process. The larger this parameter, the more efficiently the decision is made. Secondly, the initial bias, a parameter which is a marker for a participant's a-priori bias towards one decision option before accumulation of evidence has started. This reflects that if one of the two response options (like helping someone or not) has a higher expected value for an individual, participants shift the starting point towards this favored option. And thirdly, the boundary separation which is a ADULT AGE DIFFERENCES IN THE INTEGRATION OF VALUES FOR SELF AND OTHER 6 measure for how much evidence needs to be accumulated to reach a decision. The larger this parameter, the larger a participant's response caution favoring accuracy over speed 
(Ratcliff et al., 2016)
. Past work has demonstrated that DDMs can be successfully applied to delineate cognifive subcomponents that drive decisions in the social domain (F. 
Chen & Krajbich, 2018;
Hutcherson et al., 2015;
Hutcherson & Tusche, 2022)
. Thus, this approach is a valuable tool to gain insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying differences in prosocial decision-making between younger and older adults 
(Tusche & Bas, 2021)
.
Previous studies leveraging DDM to study age-related differences in decision-making observed lower drift rates when the task required the integration of different information, i.e., a reduced decision-making efficiency in older but not younger adults when combining different sources of information 
(Bocheva et al., 2018)
. More gerenally, older adults exhibited lower drift rates in the perceptual and memory domain 
(Ratcliff et al., 2011;
Theisen et al., 2021)
. Moreover, on a range of non-social tasks older adults task-independently adopted higher boundary separations as compared to younger adults (i.e., they apply more cautious response criteria than younger adults, 
Theisen et al., 2021)
.
Building on these findings in the non-social domain, we aimed to to provide insights into the precise mechanisms underlying age effects in the cost-benefit tradeoff of social decisionmaking. More specifically, we asked whether older and younger adults differ when integrating values for themselves and others to reach a social decision and whether we can relate these differences to interpretable cognitive subcomponents like decision-making efficiency, evidence accumulation, and initital response bias for self-serving or other-serving options. To test this, we exposed younger and older adults to a widely used task to measure prosociality (modified dictator game, 
Hutcherson et al., 2015)
. In this paradigm, the decision-maker is exposed to a set of choice options with varying payoffs for oneself and another person, which can be integrated or considered independently to make a decision. This allowed us to examine age group differences in value-integration processes during prosocial decisionmaking by modeling their choice behavior and reaction times using state of the art drift diffusion modeling 
(Vandekerckhove et al., 2011;
Wiecki et al., 2013)
.
Further, we were interested in factors that might influence the cost-benefit tradeoff of prosocial decision-making, and age differences therein. In general, there is increasing evidence that socio-emotional and socio-cognitive capacities like empathy, compassion, and Theory of Mind predict prosociality 
(Batson, 2014;
Caputi et al., 2012;
de Waal, 2008;
Depow et al., 2021;
Eisenberg & Fabes, 1990;
Eisenberg & Miller, 1987;
Lehmann et al., 2022;
Schulreich et al., 2022;
Tusche et al., 2016;
Underwood & Moore, 1982)
. However, studies testing whether the influence of empathy and Theory of Mind on prosocial behavior differs as a function of age showed mixed results (e.g., 
Bailey et al., 2018;
Beadle et al., 2015;
Cavallini et al., 2021;
Cho et al., 2022;
Pollerhoff et al., 2022;
Sze et al., 2012)
. Moreover, general cognitive abilities have been suggested to play a moderating role in age-related differences in prosocial behavior 
(Mayr & Freund, 2020)
. For instance, older age is associated with reduced inhibition and cognitive functioning per se 
(Braver et al., 2001;
Deary et al., 2009;
Kane et al., 1994;
Lövdén et al., 2020)
, both of which are negatively associated with giving behavior in adult age 
(Cappelen et al., 2016;
C.-C. Chen et al., 2013;
Inaba et al., 2018;
Ogawa et al., 2020;
Rosi et al., 2019;
Sütterlin et al., 2011;
Yamagishi et al., 2016
Yamagishi et al., , 2017
. To investigate the role of such potential social and cognitive moderators of age differences in social decision-making, we additionally assessed social, general cognitive and inhibition capacity in our participants.
Based on previous studies in the non-social domain, we hypothesized that older adults use the integrated information about their own and the other person's payoff to a lesser extent than younger adults. This would be reflected in a smaller interaction effect of self and other payoff in older as compared to younger adults. Furthermore, we hypothesized that agerelated differences in prosocial decision-making may be attributed to the efficiency of the prosocial decision-making process (i.e., different drift rates in older adults than younger adults, especially for other-serving decisions), and/or a the initial bias towards other-serving decisions (i.e., different initial bias in older adults than younger adults). Additionally, response caution may be increased for older adults (i.e., larger boundary separation in older adults ADULT AGE DIFFERENCES IN THE INTEGRATION OF VALUES FOR SELF AND OTHER 8 than younger adults). Lastly, we explored to what extent individual differences in cognitive and social abilities may modulate these potential age-related differences.


Methods
The current study was part of a bigger project consisting of three testing sessions.
Here, we focused on the behavioral data from a social choice task (a modified dictator game based on 
Hutcherson et al., 2015)
, the EmpaToM task 
(Kanske et al., 2015)
, a paradigm to assess socio-affective and socio-cognitive processes, and a cognitive functioning battery. In a separate session participants completed an inhibitory control battery (based on 
Wolff et al., 2016)
. Other data gathered within this larger project have been (or will be) reported elsewhere 
(Stietz et al., 2021)
 Participants A total of 126 participants participated in the relevant test sessions of the study: 70 younger adults (YA), age range 18-30 years, and 56 older adults (OA), age range = 65-78 years. This sample largely overlapped with a previously published study on a different experimental task completed within the same sessions 
(Stietz et al., 2021)
. For recruitment and exclusion criteria see Supplemental Methods. Sample characteristics of the final sample are reported in 
Table 1
. We did not observe significant age group differences concerning years of education, relationship status, or residence. 


Materials and procedure
Participants provided written informed consent before the sessions. Participants filled in a questionnaire on socio-demographic characteristics(see 
Table 1
). They were compensated with 8.50€ per hour for their participation and a bonus of a maximum of 11€
based on their decisions in the social choice task. Ethical approval was granted by the Technische Universität Dresden ethics committee in accordance with the Helsinki declaration (EK 486 112 015).


Social choice task: Modified dictator game
Two participants of the same age group and self-reported gender completed a social choice task (modified dictator game, DG; adapted from 
Hutcherson et al. 2015)
. To emphasize the social context, participants were first asked to consider the other participant (whom they saw at the beginning of the session) as their partner in the following game. Next, each participant completed nine practice trials of the computerized task to ensure task comprehension, followed by the 180 trials of the main DG. In each trial, participants chose between a proposed offer with varying monetary distributions for themselves 
("€self" value)
 and their partner ("€other" value), or a constant default distribution of money (5€ for both) (see 
Figure 1A
). The location of the two offers on the screen (left vs. right) was randomized across participants. The proposed offer varied from 1€ to 10€ and was drawn from one of the nine offer types shown in 
Figure 1B
. Every offer type was shown 20 times, randomly intermixed across the experiment. As in 
Hutcherson et al. (2015)
, to avoid habituation and repetition effects, the values of €self and €other were randomly jittered by plus or minus 0 -0.40 € (10€ were always jittered downward). Participants had up to four seconds to choose between the default distribution and the proposed offer on a four-point scale of "strong yes"
(accepting the varying proposal) to "strong no" (rejecting the proposed offer in favor of the ADULT AGE DIFFERENCES IN THE INTEGRATION OF VALUES FOR SELF AND OTHER 11 default). Failures to respond within four seconds yielded the automatic acceptance of the default and the on-screen feedback "too slow." To reduce social desirability effects, we further implemented the chosen options probabilistically (as in 
Hutcherson et al., 2015)
: with an 80% probability the chosen option was logged after the trial, while the non-chosen option was implemented in the remaining 20% of the time. Thus, in the case of a self-serving choice, a partner could not be certain whether this was indeed a selfish choice by the player, or a probabilistic outcome implemented by the computer algorithm. Participants were informed that at the end of the task, one trial would be randomly chosen and implemented (determining the bonus pay at the end of the session).   represents the speed of the accumulation process. The a-parameter (boundary separation) describes the distance between the two boundaries. The z-parameter indicates the initial bias of the accumulation process with respect to the two boundaries. A decision is made the moment one of the two boundaries is crossed (i.e., enough evidence accumulated). In the example trial ( 
Figure 1A
), choosing "1" or "2" would correspond to rejecting the offer (lower boundary), whereas choosing "3" or "4" would correspond to accepting the offer (upper boundary). Upper boundary = accepting the offer (i.e., rejecting the default distribution), lower boundary = rejecting the offer (i.e., accepting the default distribution).


Inhibitory control battery
To investigate whether inhibitory control moderates the relationship between adult age and the way values for oneself and others are integrated, we used a previously validated, computerized task battery designed to assess (amongst other constructs) inhibition performance (adopted from 
Wolff et al., 2016)
. The three inhibition tasks included a Go-Nogo, Stroop, and Stop Signal task (see 
Table 2
 for details). Participants were instructed to react as fast an accurate as possible in all tasks. For the Go-Nogo and Stroop tasks, we calculated inverse efficacy scores (IESs) 
(Townsend & Ashby, 2014)
. For the Stop Signal task, we computed the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) using the quantile method 
(Congdon et al., 2012)
. Z-scores of all task measures were used to build a composite inhibition score ADULT AGE DIFFERENCES IN THE INTEGRATION OF VALUES FOR SELF AND OTHER 13 for each participant by calculating the mean of these z-scores. Z-scores were estimated based on the following approach: For models including the whole sample, z-scores were calculated based on the whole sample (YA and OA) to reflect differences between YA and OA. For models including only one age group, z-scores based on the specific age group were calculated (YA or OA) to reflect intra-group differences in one of the age groups. See 
Table 1
 for descriptive and inferential statistics of task-specific and composite inhibition scores.


Table 2
Inhibition Tasks (adapted from 
Wolff et al. (2016))
 Task (adapted from) Task description Outcome measure
Go-Nogo Two vertically or horizontally arranged dots 
500ms
were presented. In "go" trials (vertically arranged dots), participants should press the response key. In "nogo" trials (horizontally arranged dots), participants should not react. In total the task consisted of 280 "go" and 40 "nogo" trials. At least five "go" trials were in between a "nogo" trial. 2012; 
Rubia et al., 2003)
 participants should press the left or right response key corresponding to the direction of the arrow. In "stop" trials (upward-pointing instead of sideward-pointing arrow), participants were instructed to withhold the response after a variable stop-signal delay (SSD). At least five "go" trials were presented between "stop" trials.

Note. Each trial starts with a fixation cross (750ms). IES = inverse efficiency score; RT = reaction time; SSRT = stop signal reaction time.
1 IES, dervided by dividing the average RT for accurate "go" trials by the ratio of correct response in "nogo" trials (indicated in miliseconds).
2 First, IES were calculate separately for congruent and incongruent trials by dividing the corresponding average RT by the corresponding accuracy rate. After that, the difference between IES in congruent and incongruent trials was calculated for each participant.
3 RTs from correct go trials are sorted in ascending order, and quantiles of RTs related to ERs on "stop" trials are selected. The mean SSD is then subtracted from the quantile RT to calculate SSRT (see also 
Congdon et al., 2012 and
Wolff et al., 2016)
.


Cognitive functioning battery (fluid vs. verbal abilities)
We characterized differences between YA and OA in cognitive functioning by adopting a previously used task battery 
(Reiter et al., 2017)
 that included the following tests:
Trail Making tests A and B (TMT A and B; 
Reitan, 1955)
, the Identical Pictures test (IDP; 
Ekstrom et al., 1976)
, the Digit Span backward (DSb; Wechsler, 1997), and the Spot A Word test (SAW; 
Lindenberger et al., 1993)
. Matching the procedure of 
Reiter et al. (2017)
 and 
Stietz et al. (2021)
, mean composite scores were calculated based on z-scored test values to derive measures of fluid and verbal abilities. As in the inhibition task battery, two different approaches were followed for calculating z-scores and corresponding composite scores: For models including the whole sample, z-scores were estimated based on the entire sample (incl. YA and OA). For models including only one age group, z-scores were calculated with the values of this specific age group (YA or OA). To derive the average composite of fluid abilities, we assessed processing speed with the IDP, working memory with the DSb, visual attention with the TMT A, and complex attention with the TMT B. SAW scores (performance and RT), were used for the average composite score of verbal capacities. Previous findings from a larger population-based lifespan sample 
(Li et al., 2004)
 suggested an age-related decline in fluid capacities, but an experience-related increase in crystallized abilities in OA compared to YA. In line with those findings (see 
Li et al., 2004)
 
Table 1
.


EmpaToM paradigm (empathy, compassion, and theory of mind)
The EmpaToM 
(Kanske et al., 2015;
Tholen et al., 2020)
, a video-based social understanding task, was designed to measure empathy, compassion, and Theory of Mind (ToM) within the same individual and task. Every trial consisted of a ~15-second video clip in which a male or female narrator reported an autobiographic experience whose content could be either neutral or negatively emotional. Afterward, participants indicated on two different rating scales: i) how they felt after the specific video, that is, the current valence of their emotion (empathy measure), and ii) how much compassion they felt for the individual in the video (compassion measure). Last, participants responded to a multiple-choice question, which either required ToM ("[name of the narrator] thinks that...") or factual reasoning ("It is correct that…") as a control measure. Matching previous studies 
(Hildebrandt et al., 2021;
Reiter et al., 2017;
Stietz et al., 2021)
, the variables were operationalized as follows: i) behavioral empathy was defined by mean valence ratings in emotional minus neutral trials, ii) behavioral compassion was operationalized by mean compassion ratings across emotional and neutral trials and iii) behavioral ToM was analyzed by utilizing the accuracy in ToM-trials.

Stietz et al. (2021)

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using Matlab (2022b; MATLAB, 2020), R (Version 4.1.2; R Core Team, 2018) with RStudio, and Python (Version 3.6.13). Age differences concerning sample characteristics, inhibition, cognitive functioning, empathy, compassion, and ToM (see 
Table 1
) were examined with a non-parametric robust yuen test (see 
Mair & Wilcox, 2019)
 or c 2 -test. When the data fulfilled the assumptions of homoscedasticity and normality, an independent t-test was used (indicated by an asterisk in 
Table 1
). The two primary outcome variables of interest for the DG were choice behavior and reaction time (RT). RTs were analyzed for responses given on all 180 choice trials. Rare trials with RTs < 200ms were removed (M = 1.91, SD = 3.13 of removed trials across all participants). In the following, RTs are indicated in seconds.
To model the effect of the different offer types as defined by our experiment, trials showing the different offers ( 
Figure 1B
) were classified into a condition variable (self-serving, other-serving, and rational condition). Trials in the other-serving condition included offer types where their acceptance yielded costs to participants to benefit their partner (compared to the default option of 5€ for both players). In other words, a choice was considered otherserving when participants accepted offers with €self ≤ 5€ but €other > 5€. The self-serving condition mirrored the other-serving condition. Specifically, choices were classified as selfserving when participants accepted offers that benefitted themselves at the cost to their partner (i.e., accepting offers with €self ≥ 5€ but €other < 5€). Two offer types (accepting €self5:€other10 and €self10:€other5) were categorized as rational condition since they don't disadvantage either player and thus their accpentace can neither be classified as prosocial nor selfish behavior. Refer to 
Figure 1B
 for classifying the nine different offer types into the condition variable. This classification allowed us to focus on the decision process in the other-serving condition as defined by prior studies on altruistic choice 
(Hutcherson et al., 2015;
Tusche & Hutcherson, 2018)
.

Mixed model regression analyses of choice behavior and RTs in the DG
We ran two separate mixed-effect models to examine age effects (YA, OA) regarding the trial-by-trial choices and RTs in the DG, using the mixed function from the "afex" package in R (Version 1.1-0; Singmann & Kellen, 2019). For all mixed models, the F test statistic and p-values based on the Satterthwaite approximation are reported 
(Singmann & Kellen, 2019)
.
When simple slopes were extracted from the mixed models, 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the emtrends function from the "emmeans" package in R (Version 1.7.3; 
Lenth et al., 2019)
.
Choice behavior (as derived from ratings on the four-point Likert scale) was included as a continuous dependent variable (DV) ranging from 1 = strong no to 4 = strong yes so that higher values indicated a stronger preference for the proposed offer compared to the default distribution (5€ per person). RTs were also treated as continuous DV. In both models (choice behavior vs. RT as DV), age group, amount distributed to oneself (€self), and amount distributed to the other person (€other) were included as fixed effects. In addition to the main effects, we also tested for 2-way and 3-way interactions. To account for potential time-related effects, we included a continuous trial variable (1 to 180) as a covariate in the fixed effects.
Before fitting the random effects (including random intercept and random slopes), a model with and without the time covariate was compared via the loglikelihood ratio test (R function anova), and the model with the lower AIC was selected. Based on a conservative approach, the maximal random effect structure was fitted in the next step 
(Barr et al., 2013)
: Participant ID was included as a random intercept; the model also allowed for random slopes for the interaction of €self × €other and correlations among the random effect parameters.
Whenever convergence warnings occurred, the number of iterations was increased, and the optimizer was changed to "bobyqa".
Moderation analyses concerning inhibitory control, a composite of fluid abilities, and a composite of verbal abilities, as well as empathy, compassion, and ToM were further investigated in separate post-hoc models, separately for choice behavior and RTs. In separate models for YA and OA we tested whether trial-by-trial choice behavior and RTs were predicted by an 3-way interaction of the moderator variable with €self × €other (e.g.,
whether the interaction term of inhibition × €self × €other predicted choice behavior in OA).
Thus, a moderation effect was defined by a significant 3-way interaction either predicting choice behavior or RTs in YA or OA. We adjusted the p-values derived from models including the composite scores of fluid an verbal abilities (derived from the same cognition battery), as well as p-values derived from the models including empathy, compassion, and
ToM (derived from one task, the EmpaToM task), as moderators to control for the falsediscovery rate (FDR): (p-adjust function from the "stats" package (Version 4.1.2; R Core Team, 2022).


Hierarchical drift-diffusion modeling
Bayesian hierarchical drift-diffusion modeling (HDDM) 
(Vandekerckhove et al., 2011;
Wiecki et al., 2013
) was applied to model the choice and RT data from the modified DG.
HDDM allows the exploitation of between-and within-subject variability in relatively small sample sizes with the help of Bayesian estimation methods. Diffusion modeling of choice and RT data was carried out with the Python package HDDM (Version 0.8.0, 
Wiecki et al., 2013)
.
For the HDDM analysis, binary outcomes were used that were computed based on participants' choice behavior on the four-point Likert scale (as measured in the DG). To achieve this, we recoded choices into a binary outcome format (accept proposed offer vs.
reject proposed offer) following previous work 
(Hutcherson et al., 2015;
Hutcherson & Tusche, 2022;
Tusche & Hutcherson, 2018)
. A participant's choice of "strong no" or "weak no" indicated the rejection of the proposed offer (and acceptance of the default distribution) and was coded as zero. Choosing "weak yes" or "strong yes" defined the acceptance of the proposed offer coded as one.
The HDDM framework uses both trial-by-trial choices and RTs to estimate latent variables characterizing the prosocial decision process (v, z, and a-parameters). The vparameter (drift rate) captures the speed of the accumulation process, with which the participant decides to accept or reject the offer. Thus, the v-parameter represents the efficiency of the prosocial decision-making process itself 
(Forstmann et al., 2016)
. The zparameter describes the initial choice bias with which a participant enters the choice process,
i.e., the extent to which a participant favors one choice option over the other (accept vs. reject) before entering the evidence accumulation process (F. 
Chen & Krajbich, 2018)
.
Lastly, the a-parameter (boundary separation) reflects the amount of relative evidence to be accumulated to choose one of the two options. A large a-parameter indicates more cautious response behavior, whereas a small a-parameter indicates response behavior favoring speed over caution (e.g., 
Hedge et al., 2019;
Ratcliff et al., 2006)
.
According to the theoretical reasoning of the drift-diffusion model, the integration of potential values associated with €self and €other during the decision process should be reflected by the modulation of the v-parameter 
(Forstmann et al., 2016;
Saulin et al., 2022)
.
The categorical effect of offer type, presented by the condition variable (other-serving vs.
self-serving vs. rational), should potentially influence the modulation of the z-parameter and/or the a-parameter. These two parameters reflect the pre-decisional characteristics of the decision-making process. It is important to note that the combined information of €self and €other constitutes the condition. Therefore, including the condition as an additional potential regressor on the v-parameter would introduce collinearity and lead to model instability.
How exactly do older and younger adults make decisions in the DG? To address this question and test which components of the social decision process -such as concerns for benefits for themselves (€self) or others (€other) -best accounted for the observed choices and RTs, we estimated 12 models separately for each age group (see 
Table S9
 for an ADULT AGE DIFFERENCES IN THE INTEGRATION OF VALUES FOR SELF AND OTHER 20 overview). In the simplest model, all parameters were fixed across conditions. Progressively more complex models included only self-regard (€self), only other-regard (€other), or their combination. In the full model, the drift rate (v) was modulated by the interaction of values of €self and €other (reflecting the tradeoff between self-and other-regard), and conditionrelated changes (other-serving vs. self-serving vs. rational) of the boundary separation (a) and initial bias (z). Considering evidence that older adults behaved more prosocially than younger adults, the other-serving condition was used as the intercept of the regression model. Thus, the intercept of the condition effect on the a-and z-parameters can be interpreted as the absolute initial bias toward accepting the other-serving offer. In turn, the estimated coefficients of the self-serving and the rational condition can be understood as a decrease or increase in initial bias towards accepting the proposed offer relative to the acceptance of the other-serving condition.
Besides the three main parameters, we further estimated the non-decision time ndt and allowed for trial-by-trial variations of the initial bias (sz), the drift rate (sv), and the nondecision time (sndt) fixed across conditions. As no mixed designs (between-and withinsubject effects) are currently possible to implement in HDDM, we fitted all 12 models separately for YA and OA as recommended by the authors of the toolbox 
(Sandhu, 2020;
 https://groups.google.com/g/hddm-users/c/JD1kfl_12q8/m/b6f_yNCoAAAJ). Default values for priors and hyperpriors, as provided by HDDM, were used for the estimation process (see 
Wiecki et al., 2013)
. All models (i.e., the included parameters) were visually inspected for convergence with respect to traces, autocorrelations, and marginal posteriors (see 
Figures   S5 and S6
). Due to the visual appearance of convergence problems in the estimation process of the a-parameter (especially with respect to OAs' choices and RTs), we increased iterations to 4000 and burn-ins to 2000 (for recommendation see 
Iftach, 2023;
 https://groups.google.com/g/hddm-users/c/cQaJ4gWc9uY/m/R0YUnfYLBwAJ). Further, we increased the possibility of potential outliers to 10% to improve model fit (as recommended, e.g., 
Voss et al., 2013)
. This approach satisfyingly improved convergence for nearly all parameters, (see 
Figures S2)
. Convergence for the a-parameter was still suboptimal, which is why the results with regard to the a-parameters should be interpreted with caution.
Model convergence was further checked with the Gelman-Rubin statistic (all values < 1.01, 
Gelman and Rubin, 1992)
. In the next step, posterior predictive checks were performed. In detail, we compared our observed data with 500 simulated datasets based on the posterior of our model 
(Wiecki et al., 2013)
. If the empirical data fell within the 95% probability interval of the simulated data, the model was considered to describe our data well.
We extracted the parameters of interest (v, z, and a-parameter) from the winning models (YA and OA) for further analyses. Statistical analyses were performed on the mean group posteriors, and we considered an effect significant if the 95% density interval excluded zero.
Linear models were calculated to see whether the pre-defined moderators (inhibitory control, cognitive functioning, empathy, compassion, and ToM) predicted the mean group posteriors of the drift rate (v-parameter), initial bias (z-parameter), and boundary separation (a-parameter), separately for YA and OA (function lm, from the "stats" package (Version 4.1.2; R Core Team, 2022), and summaryh function from the "hauselin/hausekeep" package in R (Version 0.0.0.9003; Lin, 2019).

Results


Generous versus selfish choices
YA chose generously (i.e., accepted an other-serving offer that would benefit the other at the cost of themselves) in 17% of the other-serving condition trials and chose selfishly (i.e. accepting an self-serving offer at the cost of the partner) in 33% of the selfserving condition trials of the trials. OA made generous decisions in 25% of the other-serving ADULT
AGE DIFFERENCES IN THE INTEGRATION OF VALUES FOR SELF AND OTHER 22
condition trials and opted for selfish choices in 38% of the self-serving condition trials. There were no significant age group differences in accepting self-serving versus other-serving offers (age group × condition interaction: F(15261.09) = 0.02, p = 0.89). However, we found age group differences such that OA generally favoured offers (compared to the constant default distribution of 5€ per person), independent of if the offer was self-serving or otherserving (main effect age group: F(108.97) = 4.91, p = 0.03).


Age group differences in integrating values for oneself and other during social decision-making


Choice behavior as a value integration process
We were particularly interested in whether adult age impacted (pro)social choice behavior with respect to the degree to which outcomes for oneself (€self) and others (€other) guide behaviors. We calculated a mixed effect regression model with trial-by-trial choices as DVs, and the main effects and interactions of the following predictor variables: age group, payoffs to oneself (€self), and payoffs to the partner (€other). We observed the expected main effects of age group, €self, and €other (all ps < 0.002, see 
Table S1
) (compare 
Hutcherson et al., 2015)
, as well as significant age × €self and age × €other iteractions (all ps < 0.001, see 
Table S1
) on a decision to accept an offer. Critically, we additionally found a significant 3-way interaction of age group × €self × €other (F(109.02) = 30.80, p < 0.01, see 
Table S1
). The latter indicates age group differences with respect to the integration of €self and €other (see 
Figure 2A
 and 2B). As a post hoc test, the data was split into two models, separately for each age group (YA and OA), and including the main effects, as well as the 2way interaction of €self × €other. We found significat main effects of €self and €other in both YA and OA (all ps < 0.02, see 
Table S2
). Interestingly, however, while YAs' choices were modulated by an interaction of €self × €other (F(61.99) = 62.71, p < 0.001), this was not observed in OAs' choice behavior (interaction term €self × €other : F(47.10) = 0.57, p = 0.46). As 
Figure 2A
 illustrates, in YA, the tendency to choose the proposed offer as a function of €self was modulated by €other: Indeed, low payoffs for the other person decreased the tendency to accept an offer with increasing €self in YA (simple slope €other -1SD: β = 0.16, 95% interval = [0.11, 0.21]; simple slope €other + 1SD: β = 0.44, 95% interval = [0.39, 0.49], contrast €other -1SD vs. + 1SD: estimate = -0.28, p < 0.001, see 
Figure 2A
).
In OA, the probability of accepting the proposed offer increased with higher values of €self, 1SD: estimate = -0.02, p = 0.73, see 
Figure 2B
). That is, in OA, whilst there was evidence for an additive effect of €self and €other (i.e, significant main effects of €self and €other, there was no significant evidence for an integration of both values (in the sense of an multiplicative effect).


Reaction times
Next, we examined age-related differences in the tradeoff between self-and otherregard (i.e., interaction €self × €other) captured in RTs in YA versus OA. Again, we calculated a mixed effect model, consisting of trial-by-trial RTs as DV, and the same predictors of age group, value for self (€self), and value for other (€other), including their main effects and interactions. Strikingly, the RT results mirrored the pattern we observed for choice behavior: the 3-way interaction of age group × €self × €other was significant (F(108.94) = 18.30, p < 0.001, see 
Table S3
 and 
Figure 2C
 and 2D). Again, YAs' RTs were modulated by a significant 2-way interaction of €self × €other (F(61.96) = 27.37, p < 0.001, see 
Table S4
), while this was not apparent in OAs' RTs (F(46.95) = 0.44, p = 0.51, see 
Table   S4
). The significant 2-way interaction of €self × €other in YA illustrates that YA reacted quickly when values for €self and €other were either both high or both low, and YA reacted slowest when there was a conflict between €self and €other, i.e., when one of them was high, and the other was low, or vice versa (simple slope €other -1SD: β = 0.02, 95% interval = [0.01, 0.04]; simple slope €other + 1SD: β = -0.06, 95% interval = [-0.08, -0.04], contrast €other -1SD vs. + 1SD: estimate = 0.09, p < 0.001, see 
Figure 2C
). OA on the other hand reacted faster the higher €self was in a trial's offer, and this was not significantly influenced by €other (simple slope €other -1SD: β = -0.02, 95% interval = [-0.04, -0.002]; simple slope €other + 1SD: β = -0.01, 95% interval = [-0.03, -0.01], contrast €other -1SD vs. + 1SD: estimate = -0.01, p = 0.79, see 
Figure 2D
).

× €other
Note. We identified significant 3-way interactions of age group × €self × €other (both for choices and RTs). The shaded areas around the lines represent the 95% confidence intervals.
Note that there was no condition where both values (i.e., €self and €other) fell below 5€ (A)
YAs' choices were modulated by an interaction of €self × €other. Higher values increased the probability of choosing the proposed offer. (B) OAs' tendency to accept an offer as a function of own benefits was not significantly modified by payoffs for the other: The probability of choosing the proposed offer increased with higher values of €self (regardless of €other). (C)
YAs' RTs were modulated by an interaction of €self × €other. YA showed faster RTs when both values (€self and €other) were either high or low, and slower RTs when values diverged (i.e., one was high and the other low). (D) OAs' RTs were only modulated by €self, irrespective of €other. Faster RTs were observed for higher values of €self (regardless of €other).


Moderation effect of inhibitory control on choice behavior
In the main manuscript, moderation effects in terms of significant 3-way interactions for choice behavior (i.e., moderator × €self × €other) are reported. Results of other moderator analyses are provided in the supplemental results (see pp.4-13). See 
Figure S4
 and S5 for histogramms of the distribution of the different moderator variables.
In YA, we did not observe significant main or interaction effects involving inhibitory control (all ps > 0.25, see 
Table S5
). Interestingly, we found a significant moderation effect of inhibitory control on OAs' choices (i.e., significant 3-way interaction of inhibition × €self × €other, F(42.04) = 6.27, p = 0.02, see 
Figure 3
 and 
Table S5
). As 
Figure 3
 suggests, the OAs with higher inhibitory control were better able to integrate payoffs for themselves and others. That is, in the OA subgroup with high inhibitory capacities (see 
Figure 3
, right panel, mean inhibitory control + 1 SD), slopes for €self differed as a function of €other (β = 0.01, SE = 0.01, 95% confidence interval [0.002, 0.022]). In other words, as can be seen in 
Figure 3
 (right panel), the OA subgroup with high inhibitory control abilities looked more similiar to YA.
OA with medium inhibitory control abilities (see 


Figure 3

Note. Significant interaction of €self x €other x inhibition ability. Note that we split up the sample in low vs. medium vs. high inhibitory control for illustration purposes only. Inhibition ability entered the model as a continuous predictor. In OA with high inhibition abilities (right panel, mean inhibitory control + 1 SD), choices to accept the proposed offer were impacted by a multiplicative effect of both €self and €other. In OA with medium inhibition abilities (middle panel, mean inhibitory control), choices to accept the proposed offer were impacted by values for €self and €other, but not by the interaction of €self x €other. OA with low inhibition abilities (left panel, mean inhibitory control -1SD) were only influenced by the values for self (€self).
The shaded areas around the lines represent the 95% confidence intervals.


Hierarchical drift-diffusion model
We conducted hierarchical drift-diffusion modeling analyses to determine which components of the social decision-making process were differentially influenced by condition, and the tradeoff between self-regard (€self) and other-regard (€other) in the two age groups.
We estimated the three main DDM parameters for every participant (v-, z-, and aparameter) within the same model, but separately for YA and OA. Across 12 models per age group, the winning model with the lowest DIC value was the most complex model that was subsequently chosen to test our hypotheses (see 
Table S9
). This model allowed the a-(boundary separation) and z-parameter (initial bias) to vary by condition (other-serving vs.
self-serving vs. rational). The v-parameter (drift rate) was assumed to be modulated by payoffs for themselves (€self), for the partner (€other), and their interaction (€self × €other).
We further modeled the non-decision time ndt as a fixed parameter across conditions (YA: M = 0.98, SD = 0.21; OA: M = 0.92, SD = 0.29). By comparing our observed data with 500 simulated datasets, we could illustrate that the winning model fits the data well, both in YA and OA (see 
Table S14
-S15).
Here, we were interested in whether age group differences in the integration of values for €self and €other can be explained by age group differences in drift rate (v-parameter), initial bias (z-parameter), and/or the amount of relative evidence accumulated (a-parameter).
As our research question focusses on prosocial decision behavior, the other-serving condition was included as the intercept of the regression model. This modeling approach enables conclusions regarding the initital bias or the amount of relative evidence toward accepting a other-serving offer, indicating a prosocial decision. As a result, the regression coefficients for the self-serving and rational condition can be interpreted relative to the otherserving condition.


Drift rate (v)
In YA, we observed meaningful main effects of €self and €other on drift rate (vparameter). The drift rate increased in proportion to the degree of €self (probability(v YA-€self > ADULT AGE DIFFERENCES IN THE INTEGRATION OF VALUES FOR SELF AND OTHER 28 0) = 1.0) and €other (probability(v YA-€other > 0) = 0.96) (see 
Figure 4A
). Matching main effects of €self and €other were also present in OA (probability(v OA-€self > 0) = 1.0; probability(v OA-€other > 0) = 1.0; see 
Figure 4A
). Notably, comparisons of main effects between YA and OA did not reveal differences across age groups (probability(v YA-€self > v OA-€self ) = 0.91;
probability(v YA-€other > v OA-€other ) = 0.75).
Next, we investigated the influence of the integration of values for €self and €other (i.e., the interaction term €self × €other) on drift rates in YA and OA. YAs' drift rates were positively impacted by the interaction of €self × €other (probability(v YA-€selfx€other > 0) = 1.0; see 
Figure 4B
). Interestingly, no such interaction effect on OAs' drift rates was observed (probability(v OA-€selfx€other > 0) = 0.51, see 
Figure 4B
). Direct comparisons across age groups found that the influence of the interaction of €self × €other on drift rates was meaningfully more pronounced in YA compared to OA (probability(v YA-€selfx€other > v OA-€selfx€other) = 1.0; see 
Figure 4B
).
Taken together, consistent with previous findings 
(Hutcherson et al., 2015;
Hutcherson & Tusche, 2022;
Tusche & Hutcherson, 2018)
, values of €self and €other were linked to drift rates v (the speed of information accumulation) and, thus, the efficiency of the social decision-making process. This was true for both age groups, YA and OA. However, drift rates in YA -but not OA -were also associated with the interaction of both payoffs (€self × €other), indicating differences in the complex trade-off and integration of information of benefits for €self and €other across age groups.

 Note. Bayesian posterior densities of drift rates (v-parameter) estimated from hierarchical regression drift-diffusion models and how they varied as a function of payoff values €self and €other. For an effect to be meaningful, 95% of the distribution has to be on the left or right of zero (dotted vertical grey line). (A) Main effects of €self and €other on the drift rate, separately for YA (purple) and OA (green). All main effects indicated a positive impact of €self and €other on drift rates in YA and OA. (B) €self × €other interaction effect on the drift rates in YA and OA.
Only YA (purple) demonstrated a positive interaction effect of €self × €other on drift rates.


Initital Bias (z)
Next, we tested whether the initial bias (z-parameter) differed as a function of condition (other-serving vs. selfserving vs. rational). Estimates of the initial bias (z) can range from 0 to 1, with values > 0.50 representing a bias towards the upper boundary (acceptance of the offer type) and values < 0.50 reflecting an initial bias towards the lower boundary (rejection of the offer type).
In YA, we observed different initial biases for the three different conditions (otherserving vs. self-serving vs. rational, see 
Figures 5A and 5B
). There was no initial bias for the intercept, i.e., other-serving condition (zYA-other-serving = 0.49, probability(zYA-other-serving < 0.50) = 0.77). However, compared to the other-serving condition, YA showed a meaningfully increased initial bias in the rational condition towards the acceptance of the offer (β-zYA-rational = 0.14, probability(β-zYA-rational > 0) = 1.0, zYA-rational = 0.63). Further, they showed a ADULT AGE DIFFERENCES IN THE INTEGRATION OF VALUES FOR SELF AND OTHER 30 meaningfully decreased initial bias for the self-serving condition (i.e., towards the rejection of the offer type (β-zYA-self-serving = -0.03, probability(β-zYA-self-serving < 0) = 0.96, zYA-self-serving = 0.46), compared to the other-serving condition.
In OA, we also observed meaningful differences in initial biases depending on the condition (see 
Figures 5A and 5B
). OA did show an initial bias towards the lower boundary,
i.e., the rejection of the offer type for the other-serving condition (intercept; zOA-other-serving = 0.47, probability(zOA-other-serving < 0.5) = 0.98). Further, they showed higher initial biases in both the rational (β-zOA-rational = 0.08, zOA-rational = 0.55, probability(β-zOA-rational > 0) = 1.0) and selfserving condition (β-zOA-self-serving = 0.06, zOA-self-serving = 0.53, probability(β-zOA-self-serving > 0) = 1.0), compared to the other-serving condition.
We did not observe age group differences between YA and OA with respect to their initial bias in the other-serving condition (i.e., the intercept; probability(zYA-other-serving > zOA-otherserving) = 0.86). However, the beta weights for the initial bias in the self-serving condition were significantly higher in OA compared to YA (probability(β-zOA-self-serving > β-zYA-self-serving) = 1.0).
Also, the beta weights for the initial bias in the rational condition varied meaningfully between age groups. That is, both age groups did show increased initial biases for the rational compared to the other-serving condition, but this effect was more pronounced in YA compared to OA (probability(β-zYA-rational > β-zOA-rational) = 0.98).
This means that OA had a larger initial bias towards accepting self-serving offers than YA. YA, on the other hand, had a larger bias towards accepting rational offers than OA. 


Boundary separation (a)
Finally, we investigated whether the amount of relative evidence that participants required to cross a decision boundary (a-parameter, cf. 
Figure 1C
) and, thus, reach a decision differed depending on the condition (other-serving vs. self-serving vs. rational). Due to convergence problems in the initial model fitting procedure, in the estimation process of the a-parameters in OA, the following results must be interpreted cautiously.
In YA, the boundary separation in the other-serving condition (intercept) was aYA-otherserving = 2.31 (see 
Figure 6A
). Compared to this intercept, the boundary separation decreased in the self-serving condition (β-aYA-self-serving = -0.25, aYA-self-serving = 2.06, probability(β-aYA-selfserving < 0) = 1.0, see 
Figure 6B
). This indicates that less evidence had to be accumulated in the self-serving (compared to the other-serving) condition to reach a decision. No meaningful change in boundary separation was observed for the rational condition compared to the intercept, i.e., other-serving condition (β-aYA-rational = -0.04, aYA-rational = 2.27, probability(β-aYArational < 0) = 0.81, see 
Figure 6B
).
OA showed a boundary separation of aOA-other-serving = 2.29 (see 
Figure 6A
) in the otherserving condition (intercept). However, the boundary separation decreased in both the selfserving (β-aOA-self-serving = -0.26, aOA-self-serving = 2.03, probability(β-aOA-self-serving < 0) = 1.0) and rational condition (β-aOA-rational = -0.18, aOA-rational = 2.12, probability(β-aOA-rational < 0) = 1.0), as compared to the other-serving condition (see 
Figure 6B
). This suggests that OA had to accumulate less evidence to reach a decision in the self-serving and rational condition, as compared to the other-serving condition.
No age group difference concerning the other-serving condition in boundary separation was observed (probability(aYA-other-serving > aOA-other-serving) = 0.55). Moreover, we did not find age differences in boundary separation when considering the beta weights for the self-serving condition in YA and OA (probability(β-aYA-self-serving > β-aOA-self-serving) = 0.56).
However, the beta-weights for the rational condition varied meaningfully between age groups (probability(β-aYA-rational > β-aOA-rational) = 0.98). Thus, in the rational (relative to the otherserving) condition OA showed a larger decrease in boundary separation than YA.

Beta weights illustrate how boundary separation changes in self-serving and rational conditions relative to the intercept (other-serving condition).

19, Tables S10-S12). In brief, we found significant associations of the a-parameter and ToMabilities in YA, and correlations of boundary separation with cognitive abilities (fluid and verbal) in OA (for more details see supplementary results section).


Discussion
Here, we adopted a value-based decision-making framework and applied hierarchical drift-diffusion modeling to investigate age group differences in decision-making for self and others. Other than previously suggested, OA did not display higher prosociality per se in our study. Harvesting our design, we however found differences in how OA and YA solve the cost-benefit tradeoff of (pro)social decision-making. We found that YA, but not OA, integrated values for self and others in a multiplicative fashion: the tendency to accept an offer based on their own payoff was modulated by the others' payoff only for YA. In line with this, computational modelling showed that the integrated information of values for self and others (€self, €other) positively influenced the efficiency of YA's decision-making process. Contrary, in OA payoffs for self and others affected decision efficiency in an additive, but not an interacting, fashion. Interestingly, OA with better inhibitory control abilities demonstrated improved integration of the different values for €self and €other, showing a behavioral pattern more similar to YA. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into how age might change the social decision process and unravel inhibitory control as an important moderator of age-related differences in prosocial decision-making.
Previous meta-analytic evidence suggests a small age-related increase in selfreported and behavioral prosociality across adulthood, but also substantial heterogeneity in findings 
(Pollerhoff et al., 2023
). In the current study, we did not observe increased prosociality per se in OA versus YA. Even tough the prevailing view in the literature is that older people are more prosocial than young people, the present results are in line with a recently published study using asimilar behavioral paradigm 
(Falco et al., 2023)
, that observed less aversion towards advantageous inequity in OA compared to YA. Moreover, additional recent studies demonstrated a negative association between age and prosociality,
i.e. decreased prosocial behavior in older age 
(Ehlert et al., 2021;
Gong et al., 2019)
, painting a more mixed picture of prosociality in older age than has traditionally been suggested.
The design of our task allowed us to pinpoint age group differences in the integration of values for self and others. In detail, YA demonstrated a tendency to maximize their own profits, but this tendency was modulated by others' payoffs, i.e., was reduced with decreasing benefits for others. This was paralleled by an observation that YAs' RTs slowed down when payoffs for self and other were in conflict, this means when one's own gain was high, but the other's was low. This suggests that, in line with previous work 
(Fehr & Schmidt, 1999)
, younger participants did not simply focus on maximizing their own monetary outcomes but also cared about the other's well-being. Interestingly, OAs' tendency to choose based on their own potential monetary gain was not significantly affected by the other's benefits.
We used drift-diffusion modeling to gain further insight into the underlying processes of these age group differences in social value integration. Mirroring choice data and RT results, modeling indicated that for YA, an interaction of values for self and others was associated with a more efficient decision-making process, characterized by a more rapid accumulation of evidence towards accepting an offer. Previously, a formal model of evidence accumulation in prosocial decision-making 
(Hutcherson et al., 2015)
 Hence, the current results are inconsistent with some typical assumptions about prosociality in younger and older age groups. Firstly, they challenge the conception of younger individuals, particularly emerging adults, as inherently selfish 
(Arnett, 2007)
, as they did not exhibit a bias favoring self-serving offers. Secondly, they do not align with a view of older individuals as inherently prosocial 
(Hubbard et al., 2016)
, as they did neither show a bias towards other-serving offers in OA, nor did our choice data indicate more generous choice behavior in OA during the DG in general. Interestingly, there is evidence arguing that an initial bias reflects personal predispositions (F. 
Chen & Krajbich, 2018)
, but can also be distorted by social information (e.g., about the interaction partner) 
(Reiter et al., 2021;
Toelch et al., 2018)
, something we cannot disentangle with the current design.
In sum, raw choice data analyses, RTs, and computational modeling results show converging evidence that in the realm of social decision-making, the integration of information from various sources differs in OA compared to YA. Work outside of social contexts has previously reported age differences between YA and OA in certain tasks that involved combining information from different sources (e.g., perception, 
Bocheva et al., 2018;
Costello & Bloesch, 2017)
 or making decisions based on cost-benefit analyses 
(Bagaïni et
 ADULT AGE DIFFERENCES IN THE INTEGRATION OF VALUES FOR SELF 
AND OTHER 36 al., 2023;
De Dieuleveult et al., 2017;
Ruel et al., 2021)
. In these studies, older individuals were typically shown to be impaired in a capacity to effectively integrate all relevant information 
(Maddox et al., 2010;
Mata & Nunes, 2010)
. It is concluded that in order to reduce the cognitive demands of a specific task 
(Gigerenzer, 2003;
Sanfey & Hastie, 1999)
, older individuals adapted their decision-making behavior by analyzing and integrating less information 
(Mata et al., 2007
Shah & Oppenheimer, 2008)
 and showing less efficient decision-making when information needs to be integrated 
(Bocheva et al., 2018)
 or when more complex memory processes are required 
(Ratcliff et al., 2011;
Theisen et al., 2021)
.
According to the research-rational approach 
(Ruel et al., 2021)
, the employment of simpler and less demanding decision approaches (such as reduced information integration), present in children and older individuals, can be seen as a deliberative and effective decision-making strategy optimizing the use of available mental resources. Thus, the present results extend these previous findings to the realm of social decision-making by demonstrating relatively less consideration of integrated information in OA as compared to YA. More generally, our results argue in favour of conceptualizing prosocial behavior as a cost-benefit computation.
For aging studies, they suggest experimental designs akin to ours in which value for self and other are parametrically manipulated and traded off against each other. Given that OA showed a general tendency to favour offers (both self-serving and other-serving offers), we speculate that other tasks (e.g., one-shot tasks) could yield misleading results, depending on response framing (e.g., if saying "yes" is associated with helping or giving in a study, compare 
Schneider, 2016)
.
The present study also showed that older individuals with better inhibitory control abilities demonstrated a greater capacity to effectively integrate information from various sources. Inhibitory control enables flexible decision-making in response to changing task demands 
(Barkley, 1997;
Nigg, 2000)
 and studies consistently indicated a decline in inhibitory control abilities with older age 
(Braver et al., 2001;
Campbell et al., 2020;
Kane et al., 1994;
Rey-Mermet & Gade, 2018)
. Most of the existing research linking inhibitory control and prosocial behavior mainly focused on the period of childhood (e.g., 
Blake et al., 2015;
Hao, 2017;
Liu et al., 2016;
Yavuz et al., 2022)
, indicating that children with better inhibitory control tended to exhibit higher levels of prosocial behavior (e.g., 
Aguilar-Pardo et al., 2013;
Paulus et al., 2015;
Steinbeis et al., 2012)
. In adults, it is a lively debate whether prosociality is intuitive 
(Inaba et al., 2018;
Ponti & Rodriguez-Lara, 2015;
Zaki & Mitchell, 2013)
, or whether before acting prosocially, individuals must overcome prepotent, selfish impulses 
(DeWall et al., 2008;
Steinbeis et al., 2012)
. Additional lifespan research is thus needed to gain more insights into the relationship between inhibitory control, prosocial decision-making, and its underlying mechanisms.
It is a limitation of our study that we compared only YA and OA, leaving out the socially important phase of midlife. This might limit our understanding of the adult development of a relationship between socio-emotional factors and prosocial behavior. There are reasons to hypothesize that social aspects, such as prosociality and empathy, undergo changes during midlife. The period of midlife may be a particularly prosocial and empathetic phase as suggested by theoretical approaches, research on personality traits, as well as typical developmental tasks including caregiving 
(Fingerman et al., 2011;
Grundy & Henretta, 2006;
Lachman, 2004;
Pollerhoff et al., 2022

.


Conclusion
In summary, by adopting a value-based decision framework and utilizing drift diffusion modeling, we uncovered age-related differences in how older and younger individuals integrate values for self and others to reach a social decision. Collectively, this study provides valuable insights into the behavioral and computational mechanisms underlying age differences in social decision-making processes. It emphasizes social decision-making as a cost-benefit analyses which is solved differently by younger and older adults. In conclusion, these findings underscore the significance of exploring the underlying (computational) mechanisms of prosocial behavior and the broader social decision-making process to develop a comprehensive understanding of how this construct evolves throughout adulthood.

Values > 0.50 represent a bias towards the upper boundary (accepting the offer type). Values < 0.50 represent a bias towards the lower boundary (rejecting the offer type). (B) Beta weights correspond to the within-subject effects of the self-serving and rational condition on the z-parameter in YA (red and orange) and OA (pink and grey). Beta weights illustrate how the initial bias changes in self-serving and rational conditions with respect to the intercept (other-serving condition).

, based on data in YA, tested an additive effect of monetary gain for the self and the other on the decision-making process. Our study extends this model by showing that YA show an multiplicative effect of values for oneself and another person. That is, the effect of potential own gains on behavior is not fixed, but varies based on what another person could gain. For OA, decision-making efficiency was influenced by self or other monetary gain in an additive fashion, i.e., taking into account separate information, as originally suggested.
Moreover, even contrary to what we expected based on the litrature, drift diffusion
modeling demonstrated that OA showed an initial bias towards rejecting other-serving offers
(i.e., offers that benefitted partners at a cost to themselves). Moreover, their initital bias
suggested a tendency to accept self-serving offers (i.e., offers that benefitted themselves at
the partner's cost). Interestingly, YA showed a different pattern of initital bias than OA. They
did not express a clear bias towards accepting or rejecting other-serving offers (different from
OA) and instead displayed a bias towards rejecting self-serving offers.
