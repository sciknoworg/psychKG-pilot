Bystander Interventions for Promotion and Prevention: Applying Promotion Science, Motivation Science, and Behavioral Science to Upstanding
For decades, bystander intervention has been conceptualized and defined as proposing "bystanders [as] individuals or groups of individuals who are present when someone needs help or when some sort of negative behavior (like bullying or harassing comments) is taking place" 
(Banyard, 2015, p. 3)
. A bystander can generate helpful impact, harmful impact, or have no impact on the victim and experience positive or negative consequences for intervening (e.g., 
Banyard et al., 2021)
. An active bystander-also known as an upstander-notices a bystander prevention opportunity and takes action before, during, or after a harmful situation (e.g., sexual assault prevention opportunities: 
McMahon & Banyard, 2012)
. However, we challenge the view that upstanders can only prevent and respond, because upstanders can also promote. Ultimately, we aim to reclassify the existing literature on "upstanders" as "prevention upstanders" who address harm (e.g., illness/disease, injury, violence) and introduce a new wave of research on promotion upstanders who enhance benefit (e.g., safety, health).
In this article, we begin by introducing bystander behaviors and the bystander intervention model 
(BIM: Latané & Darley, 1970)
, highlighting prevention upstanding in prevention opportunities. We address the limitations of the prevention-oriented BIM by introducing promotion-oriented concepts, such as the scope of bystander intervention from promotion science, promotive focus from motivation science, and positive reinforcement from behavioral science. Finally, we propose the upstanding for promotion-prevention (UPP) model wherein promotion-prevention concepts are applied to the bystander (i.e., regulatory focus, goals, strategies) and environment (i.e., situations). As each stage of the model is introduced, we discuss the prospective bystander interventions with focused attention on applications to safety (peace promotionbullying prevention) as well as health (health promotiondisease prevention). Ultimately, we aim to advance a paradigm shift from prevention upstanding to include promotion upstanding.


Bystander Behavior
Bystander behavior toward vulnerable individuals or victims of harm can take three forms: active intervention to further harm the victim (e.g., aggressing, reinforcing harm); passive withdrawal or ignoring the situation (e.g., passive bystanding); and active intervention to help the victim (e.g., prosocial bystander behavior, upstander behavior; 
Banyard et al., 2021)
.
Historically, research studies on bystander behaviors focus on the elements and interplay of situational (e.g., possible costs to the self), interpersonal (e.g., relationship with others involved), and dispositional factors (e.g., motivation, personality traits, self-efficacy, victimization history) that influence bystander behavior (e.g., 
Mainwaring et al., 2022;
Vera et al., 2019;
Woods et al., 2020)
. For example, studies have found U.S. students are more likely to endorse or be observed upstanding when they are at lower risk of personal costs or setbacks 
(Spadafora et al., 2020)
, when there are fewer perceived barriers to intervention (e.g., friends arguing not to become involved; 
Bennett et al., 2014)
, and when they have more social capital and perceived support 
(Evans & Smokowski, 2015)
. While many factors influence bystander behavior, bystander researchers and program developers have focused on the social-cognitive process bystander decision-making across settings.


Bystander Intervention Model (BIM)
The bystander intervention model (BIM) includes five sequential decision-making steps affecting bystander behavior: 1) notice a need; 2) interpret the situation as requiring intervention;
3) assume personal responsibility; 4) choose an intervention strategy; and 5) take action 
(Latanè & Darley, 1970)
. BIM has been applied across multiple contexts, including preventing elder financial abuse 
(Gilhooly et al., 2013
(Gilhooly et al., , 2016
 and reducing prejudice and discrimination 
(Ashburn-Nardo et al., 2008;
Nelson et al., 2011)
. There is evidence that BIM contributes to behavior change and mitigation of sexual assault/violence (e.g., 
Burn, 2009)
, drunk driving (e.g., 
Buckley et al., 2016)
, bullying and cyberbullying (e.g., 
Eldridge & Jenkins, 2020;
Pozzoli et al., 2012)
, intimate partner violence (e.g., 
McMahon & Dick, 2011)
, and self-harm and suicide behaviors (e.g., 
Hill et al., 2022;
Worsteling & Keating, 2022)
. BIM is the theoretical foundation for prevention bystander programs (e.g., 
Bush et al., 2019)
 and mass communication campaigns (e.g., 
Nickerson et al., 2017
). Yet, BIM has not been extended from prevention to promotion.


Scope of Intervention from Promotion-Prevention Science
Bystander intervention is an application of prevention science concerned with stopping and delaying a problem behavior, reducing the impact of a problem, and addressing risk factors and protective factors associated with problems/behaviors (e.g., American Psychological Association [APA] 2014; 
Banyard & Hamby, 2022)
. Prevention is a scope of intervention distinct from, but complementary to, promotion 
(Catalano et al., 2002;
National Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2009)
, which focuses on enhancing desirable behavior, increasing beneficial impact, and promoting assets associated with positives and possibilities.
However, BIM does not recognize the scope of bystander intervention as prevention or promotion, limiting upstanding to prevention and failing to account for promotion. Models, approaches, and programs that integrate promotion and prevention are prevalent in community psychology (e.g., 
DuBois, 2017;
Riemer et al., 2020)
, developmental psychology (e.g., 
Catalano et al., 2002;
Kia-Keating et al., 2011)
, and related fields. For example, promotionprevention strategies are used for occupational safety (safety promotioninjury prevention: BYSTANDER PROMOTION AND PREVENTION 6 
Welander et al., 2004)
, community safety (peace promotionviolence prevention: Zimmerman et al., 2011), physical health (health promotiondisease prevention: 
Winett, 1995)
, and mental health (mental health promotionmental illness prevention: 
Barry et al., 2019)
. In summary, promotion could be intersected with BIM to expand bystander's goals and strategies.


Regulatory Focus Theory from Motivation Science
Regulatory focus theory (RFT) explains how the dual motivational systems of prevention and promotion influence security needs for survival (prevention goals) and growth (promotion goals; 
Higgins, 1997)
. However, these motivational systems have not been explored as predictors of bystanding. A person with a preventive focus is generally concerned with protecting against losses and maintaining their security; therefore, a preventive bystander focuses on stopping harm and protecting a person(s). In contrast, a person with a promotive focus is generally concerned with gains and actualizing their ideals and aspirations; therefore, a promotive bystander would be concerned with potential benefits to another person(s). These foci are also categorized as a chronic regulatory focus versus a situational focus. Therefore, RFT suggests a bystander's chronic focus (rooted in personality) or situational focus (induced by the situational context) will influence bystander decision-making and behavior.
A review of RFT research provides a conceptualization of prevention/preventive and promotion/promotive concepts as a multi-level construct, operating at the systems level for goals, at the strategies level for means, and at the tactics level for behavior 
(Scholer et al., 2019)
. RFT explains an individual's goal pursuit to benefit the self, but we extend RFT to prosocial goals whereby a bystander's goal pursuit is to benefit another person. Regulatory fit theory, an extension of regulatory focus theory, explains how these chronic regulatory dispositions of preventive orientation and promotive orientation can be matched to a prevention or promotion strategy, inducing a state of person-task fit. In summary, RFT and regulatory fit theory offer a range of prevention/preventive and promotion/promotive concepts to enhance BIM, especially the regulatory focus of bystanders and the ability to produce bystander-opportunity fit.


Reinforcement and Punishment from Behavioral Science
Behavioral science theories emphasize reinforcement/punishment strategies and positive/negative consequences. The use of punishment to produce negative consequences is implicit in bystander roles (e.g., bullying defender: 
Salmivalli, 1999)
 and behaviors of bystanders (e.g., bullying defending). For example, a bullying defender uses a form of "altruistic punishment" that aims to decrease undesirable behavior defecting from social norms and behavioral expectations 
(Fowler, 2005)
. However, the use of positive consequences and reinforcement is missing from the bystander literature despite the potential value to bystanders.
The notion of rewarding desired behavior has been used with adults and youth to encourage safe behaviors in workplaces 
(Geller, 2001
) and prosocial behaviors in schools (e.g., 
McCarty et al., 2021)
. In summary, an array of prosocial bystander behaviors (that aim to reward and reinforce desired behavior) are currently missing from BIM.


Upstanding for Promotion-Prevention (UPP)
In this theoretical article, we aim to adapt BIM by adding promotion-oriented concepts:
promotion scope of intervention, promotive focus, and positive reinforcement. We do this by proposing a holistic view of bystander intervention through the upstanding for promotionprevention (UPP) model. Then, we propose the UPP model of promotion-prevention concepts across beneficial and harmful situations (e.g., peace, violence), motivational systems (e.g., promotion, prevention), and bystander behaviors (e.g., affirming, defending). Also, we apply the UPP model to advance bystander intervention for safety and health.
Throughout the article, we adapt prevention-oriented concepts rooted in prevention bystander intervention for promotion bystander intervention. We provide definitions and examples for the most important terms within 
Table 1
. First, we begin by decoupling the definition of bystanding from prevention by raising awareness of prevention-oriented definitions that involve bystanders who identify prevention opportunities and respond to harmful situations (e.g., 
Banyard, 2015)
. In contrast, we use a neutral conceptualization of bystanders as "witnesses who are in a position to know what is happening and in a position to take action" 
(Staub, 2015, p. 4
). Using this definition, we can classify bystanders based on the bystander prevention opportunity or bystander promotion opportunity. If a bystander observes a harmful situation as a bystander prevention opportunity and intervenes with a prevention strategy, we label them as a prevention upstander. In contrast, a bystander who observes a beneficial situation as a bystander promotion opportunity and intervenes using a promotion strategy is labeled as a promotion upstander. To avoid confusion with terminology across disciplines and fields, we reserve the use of prevention and promotion for any concepts associated with the scope of bystander intervention-such as goals and strategies-and use preventive and promotive for a bystander's regulatory focus and to modify the other-directed goal of prosocial bystander behavior.
The UPP model consists of a bystander's five decision-making steps: 1) notice a beneficial situation as a promotion opportunity or a harmful situation as a prevention opportunity (situation); 2) interpret the situation as a degree of benefit or a degree of harm (situational intensity); 3) assume responsibility as an opportunity to promote benefit or an obligation to prevent harm; 4) select a promotion or prevention strategy; and 5) engage in a promotive or preventive prosocial bystander behavior to help as an upstander (see 
Table 2
).


#1) Bystander Opportunities: Prevention Opportunities and Promotion Opportunities
Harm is the primary situational feature identified by bystanders prior to choosing whether to intervene. Within the context of sexual assault situations, 
McMahon and Banyard (2012)
 encourage attention to the timing of bystander intervention across prevention bystander opportunities: before a harmful event (primary prevention, where they note distinctions between low-risk and high-risk scenarios), during a harmful event (secondary prevention), or after a harmful event (tertiary prevention). Additionally, they suggest proactive strategies for bystanders, such as taking an academic course or arranging an education program on a prevention-related topic (e.g., sexual assault). However, these proactive strategies fail to include bystander promotion opportunities wherein a bystander could notice a beneficial situation and affirm a desirable behavior, such as safety-promoting and health-promoting behaviors, which can be conceptualized as assets or protective behaviors from risk 
(Kia-Keating et al., 2011
). The UPP model extends the range of bystander opportunities from prevention to promotion opportunities.
A defining feature of prosocial behavior-which includes prosocial bystander behavior, is the intent to impact a recipient(s) beneficially 
(Dovidio et al., 2006)
. In the prosocial behavior literature, a multi-dimensional scaling study of helping behaviors produced a dimension of not seriousserious, which was highly correlated with two related bipolar dimensions: 1) make improveprevent worsen, and 2) make feel goodprevent feeling bad 
(Smithson & Amato, 1982
). Similar to the not seriousserious conceptualization of prosocial behavior, risky bystander opportunities are categorized as non-dangerousdangerous in the bystander literature 
(Fischer et al., 2011)
. Together, these studies suggest a person's prosocial goal may be associated with specific types of helping opportunities. Specifically, the prosocial goals of prevent worsen and prevent feeling bad are associated with serious/dangerous situations, whereas the goals of make improve and make feel good fit with the non-serious and non-dangerous situations. While research attends to non-dangerous and dangerous situations within the bystander literature (e.g., 
Fischer et al., 2011;
Levine et al., 2020)
, the range of non-dangerous situations is underexplored
and has yet to be extended to beneficial situations. Relatedly, McMahon and colleagues 
2022
categorize the built environment as health-depreciating or health-promoting settings, which may map onto prevention and promotion opportunities, respectively.
As a result, we presume bystanders may be guided by two other-focused motivations: 1) to prevent harm for the target/victim (e.g., prevent worsen and prevent feeling bad), and 2) to promote care for the target/recipient (e.g., make improve and make feel good). This conceptualization of prosocial motivation is supported by research on the prevention and promotion motivational systems from RFT 
(Scholer et al., 2019)
. Also, a bystander's motivation for upstanding may align with their regulatory orientation of preventive orientation when concerned with attaining a non-loss (e.g., prevent worsen) or avoiding a loss (e.g., prevent feeling bad) and promotive orientation when concerned with attaining a gain (e.g., make improve) or avoiding a non-gain (e.g., not making someone feel good). After noticing an opportunity to prevent harm or promote benefit, a bystander attends to the situational intensity.


#2) Interpreting the Situation: Degree of Harm and Degree of Benefit
Harmful impact of a behavior, situation, or event can be measured based on the duration of harm (over time), the frequency of harmful events/actions (within a time period), the intensity of harm at a moment in time, and latency between the prompt to harm and occurrence of harm 
(Bateson & Martin, 2021)
. In a meta-analytic review of the bystander effect, bystander responses differed based on a dangerous vs. non-dangerous emergency 
(Fischer et al., 2011)
, suggesting severity of harm is a defining feature of an emergency. In fact, severity is used to measure specific types of harm, such as bullying and cyberbullying (e.g., 
Hinduja & Patchin, 2019)
.
While the intensity of harm is relevant for prevention opportunities, the intensity of benefit may be relevant for promotion opportunities.
Related research suggests bystanders may observe the behavior of an agent/perpetrator relative to a recipient/victim using a bipolar continuum of intensity from extremely beneficial to extremely harmful. In fact, related bipolar continua have been proposed for occupational safety using a safeunsafe continuum 
(Maurice et al., 2001)
. Additionally, bipolar continua have been empirically supported across contexts in: mental health (healthyunhealthy; 
Foerde et al., 2020)
; peace (positivenegative peace; 
Davenport et al., 2018)
; and injury prevention (prosocial riskhealth risk; 
Skaar et al., 2014)
. In a study of adolescent observers/bystanders, high school students read vignettes of their peers engaging in either helpful, neutral, or harmful behavior and rated the similarity of these behaviors; extreme and moderately intense behaviors fell along a beneficialharmful continuum in all four analyses 
(McCarty & Dunsmore, 2022)
.
Based on the above research, we presume a bystander interprets the situation using a beneficialharmful continuum, suggesting a broader range of bystander opportunities: 1) most beneficial; 2) least beneficial; and continuing to the 3) low-risk, least harmful (non-emergency); and 4) highrisk, most harmful (emergency). After assessing the situational intensity, a bystander may choose to evade or take responsibility for helping others.


#3) Upstander Responsibility: Fulfilling a Responsibility or Helping as an Ideal
Personal bystander responsibility is affected by social features of the situation, such as presence of other bystanders 
(Fischer et al., 2011)
, and individual factors, such as the personal costs/benefits and negative/positive consequences of intervention 
(Banyard et al., 2021;
Spadafora et al., 2020)
. RFT offers a theory to reconceptualize personal costs and negative consequences (within losses/non-losses) along with personal benefits and positive consequences (within gains/non-gains). A simple extension of RFT to bystanding may presume preventive focus is closely associated with the concept of taking responsibility given the link between responsibility and "ought guides" (e.g., "I ought to intervene because it is a moral responsibility."), but bystanding may activate "ideal guides" (e.g., "I want to intervene because I am a caring person."). Thus, upstanding is a complex, social phenomena whereby gains/losses are experienced by all parties in the situation: bystander, agent/perpetrator, and recipient/victim.
After taking responsibility, a bystander decides on the appropriate strategy.


#4) Upstander Strategies: Prevention and Promotion Strategies
A bystander's goal pursuit strategy can be categorized as a prevention strategy or a promotion strategy. A prevention strategy involves tactics for non-loss (0) or loss (-1) for another person, whereas the promotion strategy involves tactics that result in a non-gain (0) or gain (+1) for another person 
(Scholer et al., 2019)
. Theoretically, preventive and promotive bystanders prefer different upstanding strategies based on whether they perceive a harmful or beneficial situation as a prevention or promotion opportunity, respectively. In a prevention opportunity, a preventive bystander may observe a victim being targeted by a bully at school. A preventive upstander may use a prevention strategy to pursue a non-loss (e.g., stop bullying behavior before it occurs) or avoid a loss (e.g., choose not to remain a passive bystander). While a preventive bystander may be more likely to intervene in a harmful situation, a promotive bystander may observe the same harmful situation as a promotion opportunity and use a promotion strategy to pursue a gain (e.g., making a victim feel better after the bullying event).


#5) Upstander Behaviors: Preventive and Promotive Bystander Prosocial Behavior
Upstander behavior is a goal-directed prosocial behavior that benefits another person(s) with various forms and potential targets of intervention. Did the prosocial bystander behavior help the target feel better or prevent the target from feeling worse? Did the behavior achieve an aspirational state or a less harmful state? In an attempt to facilitate an expanded taxonomy of upstander roles and behaviors, we introduce two forms of prosocial behaviors based on their prosocial function of decreasing harm-preventive prosocial bystander behavior (prevention upstanding)-or increasing benefit-promotive prosocial bystander behavior (promotion upstanding). Preventive prosocial bystander behavior refers to a class of beneficial behaviors that intend to prevent, mitigate, and reduce harm for another person(s). Specific subtypes of these behaviors exist in the bystander literature: defending, interventionist, information-gathering, and defusing 
(Graeff, 2014)
. A disease-prevention upstander could take on the role of "bullying defender", using a prevention strategy to dissuade the bully from continuing to harm others (e.g.,  
(Monin & Miller, 2001)
, and microaffirmations (Rolón-Dow & Davison, 2021).
Promotive prosocial bystander behavior offers a bottom-up, peer-to-peer strategy for promotion upstanders to reinforce desired prosocial norms and behavioral expectations. In fact, "social recognition, sympathetic attention, acts of caring, and receiving comfort are all positively reinforcing and vital to young people's development and everyone's well-being" 
(Biglan et al., 2012, p. 262)
. For a promotion upstander in a peaceful situation, the promotive prosocial tactic involves affirming the kindness of an agent toward a recipient (e.g., "It's really cool you did that to make our school a kinder place."). For a promotion upstander in a health-promoting situation, the upstander might observe a friend selecting a low-sugar, high-protein food at lunch and respond, "that's a good choice for a meal to improve your health."
The function of reinforcement, by definition, is to increase the likelihood of that behavior in the future (Oxford Reference, 2022). However, the reward procedures may facilitate an effect opposite of the desired outcome, such as decreased self-motivation 
(Eisenberger et al., 1999)
 or decreased prosocial behavior from process-focused feedback 
(Dunsmore, 2015)
. Past research has not defined or studied promotive prosocial bystander behavior. However, prior research has studied how social rewards influence bystander behavior in bullying situations. 
Salmivalli (2014)
 states, "peer bystanders are typically present when bullying takes place, often providing the perpetrators with social rewards" (p. 1). We aim to flip the impact of social rewards in bystanding by changing the focal situation away from reinforcers of the bully in bullying situations (or more broadly, reinforcers of harm in harmful situations) to reinforcers of peace in peaceful situations (or reinforcers of care in beneficial situations).


Discussion
The adoption of prevention science, through APA's Guidelines for Prevention in Psychology and as a mission area of the U.S. National Preparedness Goal, has previously and will continue to alleviate human suffering by "(a) stopping a problem from ever occurring; (b) delaying the onset of a problem, especially for those at-risk for the problem; [and] (c) reducing the impact of a problem behavior" 
(APA, 2014, p. 286;
Banyard & Hamby, 2022;
FEMA, n.d.)
.
The application of prevention science to the field of bystander intervention has produced a singular goal for bystanders-to prevent harm-using the prevention-oriented bystander intervention model (BIM) 
(Latanè & Darley, 1970)
. We challenged the notion of bystanders being limited to prevention opportunities and suggest prevention can be complemented by promotion, which is the most proactive scope of intervention 
(National Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2009)
.
To advance the conceptualization of bystanders and their decision-making from BIM, we proposed the upstanding for promotion-prevention (UPP) model. The UPP model stands atop a rich theoretical foundation of promotion and prevention science 
(Catalano et al., 2002;
Kia-Keating et al., 2011)
, regulatory focus and fit theories from motivation science 
(Higgins, 1997;
Scholer et al., 2019)
, reinforcement theory from applied behavioral science 
(Biglan, 2003;
Biglan et al., 2012;
Geller, 2001;
McCarty et al., 2021)
, and previous bystander intervention research encouraging various forms of prevention upstanding (e.g., 
Banyard et al., 2019
Banyard et al., , 2021
Hamby et al., 2016;
Hart & Miethe, 2008;
Moschella & Banyard, 2020;
Vera et al., 2019)
. Additionally, the UPP model answers prior calls by researchers to address multiple risks and forms of harm, while also broadening efforts to attend to multiple assets and forms of benefit (i.e., extending across prevention/promotion opportunities and health-depreciating and health-promoting settings; 
Hamby & Grych, 2013;
McMahon et al., 2022;
McMahon & Banyard, 2012)
. Despite the strengths of the UPP model, there are also limitations, assumptions, and boundary conditions.


Limitations
The UPP model expands and integrates important elements of existing frameworks but remains limited in its focus and scope. This model excludes emotional processes, relational factors, social-ecological factors, power dynamics, and the intersectional social identities of bystanders, perpetrators, and victims (e.g., 
Banyard, 2011
Banyard, , 2015
Bennett & Banyard, 2016;
Bond & Haynes-Baratz, 2022;
Christensen & Harris, 2019)
. Future research is needed to determine whether certain factors and relationships are bound to harmful situations or if they can be extended from prevention upstanding to promotion upstanding. The UPP model includes untested theoretical propositions, which require rigorous empirical research with bystanders of varying age, gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, class, and other social identities across settings (e.g., schools, campuses, workplaces, bars, hotels, communities).


Future Directions
The bystander intervention model (BIM) has been applied across problem areas, but few research studies have examined multiple problems within the same study (e.g., bullying and sexual harassment: 
Nickerson et al., 2014)
; therefore, scholars should incorporate both promotion goals and prevention goals within the same study. Such integrative research may lead to bystanders holistically addressing safety by promoting peace and preventing violence 
(Zimmerman et al., 2011)
 or promoting safety and preventing injury 
(Welander et al., 2004)
 as well as health by promoting health and preventing disease 
(Winett, 1995)
 or promoting mental health and preventing mental illness 
(Barry et al., 2019)
. Bystanders could also address equityinequity (e.g., racial discrimination; 
Nelson et al., 2011)
 by promoting microaffirmations and preventing microaggressions 
(Rolón-Dow & Davison, 2021)
.
The field of bystander intervention has incorporated behavioral science theories and concepts inconsistently. 
Biglan (2003)
 recommends focusing on "selection by consequences" as a unifying principle for prevention science although it is relevant for promotion science too.
While bystander scholars have studied the reinforcing of undesired harmful behaviors (e.g., through the role of the bullying assistant: 
Salmivalli, 1999)
 as well as the positive and negative consequences affecting bystanders 
(Banyard et al., 2021)
, the behavioral strategy of rewarding and reinforcing desired behaviors has not been incorporated as a potential bystander behavior until the introduction of our UPP model.


Conclusion
We aim to advance a paradigm shift for the field of bystander intervention by: 1) decoupling prevention from bystanding to include promotion bystander intervention; 2) infusing promotion-oriented concepts from promotion science, motivation science, and behavioral science to revise BIM; and 3) proposing the upstanding for promotion-prevention (UPP) model to advance research, programming, and practice. Ultimately, we hope an empirical investigation of the UPP model and its potential applications to safety, health, and other aspects of well-being may lead to a new mid-range theory of upstanding, a promotion-prevention bystander typology (e.g., promotive-preventive upstander, reinforcers of harm, reinforcers of care), new promotion bystander intervention programs to achieve promotion goals, and innovative promotionprevention bystander practices. Bystander focus A bystander's regulatory orientation based on either motivational system 
(Higgins, 1997)
 The bystander focus may affect noticing the situation and their bystander scope of intervention Promotive bystander A bystander's regulatory orientation toward gains (e.g., progress; 
Scholer et al., 2019)
 A promotive bystander may be more attuned to bystander promotion opportunities and help
Preventive bystander A bystander's regulatory orientation toward loss (e.g., maintain safety; 
Scholer et al., 2019)
 A preventive upstander may be more likely to notice prevention opportunities and stop harm Upstander type A category of active bystanders based on the promotion/ prevention opportunity, strategy, and behavior Two primary upstander types are promotion upstander and prevention upstander


Promotion upstander
An upstander who intervenes in beneficial situations, uses promotion strategies, and promotive prosocial bystander behavior
The school climate would benefit from more promotion upstanders to address a lack of positive assets, strengths, and possibilities


Prevention upstander
An upstander who intervenes in harmful situations, uses prevention strategies, and preventive prosocial bystander behavior
The school climate would improve from more prevention upstanders to address risk factors, harmful impact, and problems Bystander opportunity A situation wherein a bystander could help She noticed the bystander opportunity and intervened


Bystander promotion opportunity
A beneficial situation (e.g., safety, health) whereby a bystander can promote They noticed the bystander promotion opportunity when Jamal (agent) affirmed Sarah's act (recipient)
Bystander prevention opportunity A harmful situation (e.g., disease, injury, or violence) whereby a bystander can prevent
The bystander noticed Tim (agent) bullying Jose (victim) and stopped Tim from harming Jose more Bystander strategy A class of active/passive, direct/indirect, and/or prosocial/aggressive strategies used by bystanders
The bystander strategy worked, and he intervened successfully to help the person


Promotion bystander strategy
A bystander's approach for affirming desired behaviors in a promotion opportunity
The upstander is considering a promotion bystander strategy of affirming a peer's healthy food choice


Prevention bystander strategy
A bystander's approach for stopping a problem or mitigating harm in a prevention opportunity
The upstander is considering a prevention strategy of denouncing a peer's junk food choice
Upstander behavior An upstander's behavior intended to benefit others The upstander behavior helped that group of friends


Promotive prosocial bystander behavior
A class of prosocial bystander behaviors that intend to uplift, make better, or improve another person's state
After the popular student invited a lonely student to sit with her friends at lunch, a promotion upstander thanked the popular student for being inclusive


Preventive prosocial bystander behavior
A class of prosocial bystander behaviors that intend to prevent, mitigate, or reduce harm for others
After the victim was punched, the prevention upstander defended the victim against aggression by telling an adult at school
"
Stop. You're hurting them."). A bullying-prevention upstander could use a prevention strategy to dissuade a person from harming others (e.g., "You shouldn't go to a crowded place after testing positive for COVID.") Promotive prosocial bystander behavior includes various prosocial subtypes which have been defined previously in various literatures but not conceptualized in relation to upstanding. Most notably, recognition and rewarding desirable behavior have been studied under similar constructs, including labeled praise (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020) social recognition
