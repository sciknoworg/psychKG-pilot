You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

We often decide to impose harm to few for the broader benefit of others. For example, we fail a student to retain fairness and quality of education; we jail people for the sake of justice and safety of other people. There are two orthogonal inclinations driving such moral decision -utilitarianism and deontology 
(Conway & Gawronski, 2013)
. The utilitarian inclination focuses on the expected outcomes of a choice (e.g., it is worth sacrificing a single life to save five others). In contrast, deontological inclination points out the unshakable ethical norms that cannot be forsaken, regardless of the cost (i.e., we have no moral right to decide to sacrifice a person to save five other people).
Moral motives can trump other motives when guiding our judgements 
(Brambilla et al., 2019
(Brambilla et al., , 2021
Goodwin et al., 2014;
Wojciszke et al., 1998)
 and behaviour 
(Curry, 2016)
.
Therefore, moral judgments should preferably be coherent and based on fixed moral principles, rather than created ad hoc. That is, we would like people to make the same decision, regardless of some negligible contextual cues, changes in their mood or incidental emotions. Research suggests, however, this is not the case (e.g., 
Gawronski et al., 2018;
Schein, 2020)
.
Moral decision-making requires cognitive resources. Some older dual-process accounts of moral judgments assumed people need them to produce utilitarian judgment, which then trumps intuitively produced deontological inclination 
(Greene, 2007;
Greene et al., 2004)
. Along this line, people under cognitive load 
(Białek & De Neys, 2017;
Greene et al., 2008)
 or under time pressure 
(Suter & Hertwig, 2011)
 produce fewer utilitarian moral judgments.
To illustrate, tired people have fewer cognitive resources that they can spend on decision making 
(Timmons & Byrne, 2019)
. This may result in a more shallow processing of available information, which leads to sub-optimal choices, functioning, and performance 
(Cao et al., 2022;
Harris & Bray, 2019;
Kunrath et al., 2020)
. Being cognitively fatigued was linked with deteriorated physical exercise-related decision making 
(Fortes et al., 2023)
, or greater difficulties in making decisions generally 
(Killgore et al., 2007)
. For instance, fatigued individuals avoid risky decisions 
(Jia et al., 2022;
Lu-Lu & Yong-Juan, 2012)
, and their economic decision-making may become less consistent and thus less accurate 
(Mullette-Gillman et al., 2015)
.
Some studies suggest that cognitive fatigue influences moral decision making as well.
For instance, asking participants to write a paragraph without using letters a or n made them less inclined to engage in unethical behaviour 
(Yam et al., 2014)
. Conflicting evidence emerges from studies focused on fatigue-utilitarianism relationship. Experimentally induced fatigue led to a greater aversion towards the utilitarian choices 
(Timmons & Byrne, 2019)
, while long-term, environmentally-induced fatigue led to a greater preference towards the utilitarian choices 
(Zheng et al., 2023)
.
Here, we test whether being physically fatigued can affect moral judgment. There is evidence that physical fatigue, similarly to cognitive fatigue, leads to compromising cognitive processing . 
Weippert and colleagues (2018)
 had their participants perform an acute physical exercise, and subsequently, in the state of fatigue, make moral decisions. They found that fewer utilitarian choices in tired participants. In a longitudinal study of Marine corps martial arts training the authors found the soldiers having significantly impaired decision making immediately after the extremely demanding (thus, tiring) training 
(Siedlik et al., 2022)
. Furthermore, they found the marines' moral intention and moral judgement to worsen throughout the training programme, pointing out that it may lead to impaired ethical decision-making in real-life combat.
Previous studies found that acute physical exercise elevates testosterone levels 
(Crewther et al., 2014;
Kowal et al., 2020
Kowal et al., , 2021
, which in turn is related with making more utilitarian decisions 
Carney & Mason, 2010)
. It is possible that testosterone played a significant role in fatigue-morality relationship, because it has been linked to reduced affective and stress responses 
(Hermans et al., 2006
(Hermans et al., , 2007
 important for deontological moral judgments. Hence, incidental boost of testosterone caused by physical exercise, or as a long-term consequence of physical training can affect moral decisionmaking, potentially promoting less deontological decisions.
The few studies that provide any insights for the physical fatiguemoral decision making relationship have unfortunately rather small sample sizes (n=55 in 
Siedlik et al., 2022;
 n=32 in 
Weippert et al., 2018)
. Critically, the accuracy of their moral decision-making operationalization is questionable 
(Kahane, 2015)
. That is, moral dilemmas used in prior research pit deontological against utilitarian solution, artificially making them negatively correlated. For example, a famous trolley dilemma used in this line of research 
(Foot, 1967)
, ask people whether it is permissible to redirect a trolley from tracks with five people to side tracks, where there is a single person. Deontology suggests harming people is never permissible, thus this action is immoral. Utilitarianism suggest five lives are more valuable than one, thus, the action is moral. A person who decided for one solution is classified as opposing the other one. Recent development in psychological methods showed this is not true these inclinations are independent 
(Conway & Gawronski, 2013)
, and often both cue the same behaviour. For example, moral identity is positively correlated to both of them 
(Conway & Gawronski, 2013)
, just as willingness to invest in sin stocks is negatively correlated to both of them 
(Niszczota et al., 2022)
. Hence, if both inclinations are affected by fatigue, we could never observe this in traditional moral dilemmas. For example, increase in both inclinations would strongly decrease willingness to invest in sin stocks, but would not affect decision in a trolley problem where one has to sacrifice one person to save five.
To solve for this issue, we adopted a Process Dissociation procedure 
(Conway & Gawronski, 2013)
, which allows us to estimate both moral inclinations independently, along with the traditional score of utilitarian choices made in incongruent scenarios, i.e., where deontological and utilitarian motives are antithetic.


Current study
To test the hypothesis that physical fatigue is a predictor of certain shifts in moral decisionmaking, we conduct a preliminary study on deontology and utilitarianism levels prior to vs after an acute physical exercise that leads to significant physical fatigue. We implement the procedure from the previous studies that elicited testosterone through acute physical activity 
(Kowal et al., 2020
(Kowal et al., , 2021
, and provide the participants with a measure of deontological and utilitarian choices 
(Conway & Gawronski, 2013)
, widely used in studies on moral decisionmaking. This allows this study's results to be appropriately comparable with other research in this field. By recruiting a relatively large and homogenous group of participants, our analyses narrow down possible effects of uncontrolled variables, and provide decently powered results.


Methods


Transparency and Openness
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study, and we follow JARS from quantitative research . All data, analysis code, and research materials are available at https://osf.io/musc8/?view_only=328aee8087dd4203a9a576e350b12327. Data were analysed using JAMOVI, version 2.3.18 (The Jamovi Project, 2021). This study's design and its analysis were preregistered, https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=66V_YSK. The study was approved by the ethical board of Wroclaw University [reference number 2023/OCRGM], and all procedures were in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.


Participants
We recruited and analysed the data from 107 volunteering male students 1 ( Mage=21, SD=1.56) of a physical education academy. We remunerated them for their participation with a voucher worth of the equivalence of ~10 USD in the local currency. A medical authority examined all participants and considered them physically healthy. The participants were obliged not to smoke or drink energetic or alcoholic beverages for 24 hours before entering the study. Feeling ill on the day of the study, having chronic diseases, and taking hormonal treatment or supplements were exclusion criteria. We did not determine the target sample size a priori, but rather aimed as much data as possible within the lab availability time-window. Our sample size had 80% power to detect only fairly large effects of fatigue, d = 0.55.
However, it is almost 3 times larger in the only study oi this effect 
(Weippert et al., 2018)
.
Moreover, we report additionally Bayesian analysis, which weights the observed effect size sand its estimation accuracy when comparing the support for the hypothesis against the null 
(Dienes & Mclatchie, 2017)
.


Measures
To measure utilitarianism/deontology, we used the Process Dissociation procedure with 16 out of 20 original scenarios from 
Conway & Gawronski (2013)
. In accordance with our preregistration, we omitted the four scenarios relating to abortion and animal testing, as they are culturally-biased and unsuitable for some cultures. The battery consist of two types of sacrificial scenarios: congruent (where deontological and utilitarian inclinations cue the same decision), and incongruent (where deontological and utilitarian inclinations cue the different decision). For example, one is asked whether it is permissible to torture of a person suspected of planning a terrorist attach that may kill hundreds of people (incongruent), or of a person suspected of planning a prank with bombs filled with paint (congruent). The idea is that deontological consideration always prevent torture, whereas utilitarian considerations permit torture only in the former case.
We also measured two other variables unrelated to this research: risk-taking (using selfcreated set of lotteries) and disgust sensitivity (using self-created Sounds of Disgust Scale, and Three Domain Disgust Scale, 
Tybur et al., 2009)
. As a manipulation check, we measured participants' heart rate prior to, during, and after the acute physical exercise with a Polar RS400 cardio frequency meter strapped to participants' chest.


Procedure
The study took place in a laboratory, with all participants being tested between 8 and 11 a.m.
Each participant was randomly selected to one of two groupsthey either provided their answers to the moral dilemmas prior to the physical exercise, or a few minutes after finishing exercising. The order of presentation of the dilemmas was randomized. We opted for a between-subject design because we wanted to avoid problems with memorizing the answers provided prior to the manipulation (e.g., participants may be inclined to consistify their responses). Moreover, because the scale involves multiply dilemmas, we thought answering them again could be tedious to participants.
In this study we followed the exact procedure that previous studies of similar design have implemented 
(Crewther et al., 2014;
Kowal et al., 2020
Kowal et al., , 2021
 . We used a Monark cycle ergometer (824E, Sweden) for a sprint cycling exercise. The exact steps of the procedure were as follows: i) 5-minutes warm-up with a load of 2 kilograms, ii) one minute of resting, iii) 10seconds sprint with a load of 7.5% of one's body mass, iv) 50 seconds of slow cycling without a load. Points iii) and iv) were then repeated four more times. Ultimately, after five cycles of 10-seconds sprints and 50-seconds slow-cycling, the participants again cycled slowly for one minute without a load. This procedure is extremely exhausting, and the study was conducted in a presence of a qualified paramedic. Participants used tablets to respond to the Qualtrics questionnaires.


Results
First, we confirmed prior findings that the D and U parameters are independent or only weakly correlated. Specifically, here r(105) = 0.20, p = .042. We also tested whether the cycling was in fact demanding and tiring by comparing heart rate prior and after the exercise.
We observed a large increase in the experimental group Mpre = 81.3 SD = 12.9; Mpost = 127.0, SD = 13.6, t(51) = -20.5, p< 001, d = -2.84, showing that our manipulation did influence the physiological state of the participants. We then proceeded with testing the main hypothesis that physical fatigue will affect moral judgments.
As preregistered, we compared the deontological and utilitarian parameters between the pretreatment and post-treatment groups, using two two-tailed between-subject t-tests. These parameters were calculated based on a Process Dissociation procedure and standardized 
(Conway & Gawronski, 2013)
. For exploratory reasons, we also analysed the traditional score, i.e., utilitarian decisions made in incongruent sacrificial scenarios.
In all cases, we observed no significant differences 
(Table 1
). Because non-significant results of a statistical test are never an evidence of the absence of an effect (e.g., we could have lacked statistical power, or the true effect is smaller than assumed), we decided to follow-up this analysis with Bayesian t-test. This approach allows us to compare relative evidence for the null against the alternative hypothesis. Using default prior of Cauchy = 0.707 2 , we found moderate support for the null. In other words, it is about 5 times more likely to observe the current data if the null hypothesis is true, compared to when the alternative hypothesis is true.
Note, however, that some claim the default prior is conservative and biased against small, true effects 
(Tendeiro & Kiers, 2019)
. Thus, some caution is advised when interpreting the Bayesian analysis.

Discussion
Our study found that extreme physical fatigue does not affect moral judgments. Bayesian analysis suggests our data is 4 to 5 times more likely under the null model than the alternative. Our results indicate moral judgments are not as easily affected by external factors, like fatigue. This goes against the majority of prior literature, showing malleability of moral judgments, e.g., by incidental emotions, cognitive fatigue, or limited cognitive resources.
It is intriguing why physical and cognitive fatigue yield divergent outcomes in the context of moral judgment. This contemplation gains relevance given the extensive study of cognitive fatigue, which consistently demonstrates significant effects of fatigue. The hypothesis that moral judgments predominantly rely on cognitive resources gains traction from this perspective. Physical fatigue, in contrast, might not significantly deplete these resources, particularly in comparison to the mentally exhausting tasks employed in cognitive fatigue studies. Moreover, the emotional landscapes associated with each type of fatigue differ markedly: cognitive fatigue often leads to negative emotions 
(Wang et al., 2022)
 and impairs emotion regulation 
(Grillon et al., 2015)
, whereas physical fatigue may elicit arousal and excitement 
(Basso & Suzuki, 2017)
 and hastens emotional recovery from a subsequent stressor 
(Edwards et al., 2017)
. These distinctions underscore the necessity for future research to conduct a direct comparison of both fatigue types, with a meticulous control over the emotional experiences involved.
Of course, our findings are not decisive. Every experiment has only some probability of detecting a true effect. This probability depends on the true effect size, and on the sample size.
Additionally, our sample was modest, and comprised primarily fit, athletic males, which may uniquely influence the observed impact of fatigue on moral judgments. Another potential confound of our research is that we only dissociated deontology form utilitarianism. This is already a significant advancement compared to older studies. Yet, there is a third factor that may be importantaction aversion. In simple words, people may be willing to select passive solutions (i.e., do nothing) not because they believe this particular solution is morally superior, but because inaction is seen as non-decision . A more advanced method (but also not problem free, see 
Baron & Goodwin, 2020)
 is the CNI modelling 
(Gawronski et al., 2017)
 or any of its subsequent variants, like pro-CNI 
(Hennig & Hütter, 2021)
 or CAN 
(Liu & Liao, 2021)
. All of them can estimate the action aversion, and thus
show that maybe moral judgments are indeed affected by fatigue. Crucially, there are different types of it; while cognitive fatigue may reduce action aversion, physical fatigue may increase action aversion. This effect can cover the effect on moral inclinations, because in traditional scoring deontology is always passive and utilitarianism active. Hence, increase in deontological inclination (fewer active choices), if accompanied by decreased in action aversion (more active choices) would produce no effect in trolley-like vignettes.
To sum up, we showed that even after being extremely physically fatigued, people respond to hypothetical moral scenarios similarly, and show the same prominence of deontological and utilitarian inclinations. From a practical point of view, this is a good thing, because many people who make moral decisions (paramedics, doctors, firefighters, soldiers, police officers, etc.) are often tired. Their moral judgments should be immune to this state. From a theoretical point of view, we show that cognitive processes underlying moral judgments are not vulnerable to physical fatigue. This fits to a version of the dual-process theory, in which both moral inclinations are produced intuitively 
Białek & De Neys, 2016
, and reflection is needed only to solve potential internal conflict 
(Byrd & Conway, 2019)
. Finally, our results show that human cognition, at least in its moral aspect, is not as malleable as the psychological literature shows. In other words, people do not change their moral judgments easily. In principle, we believe that the psychological literature may have been biased to show successful incidental manipulations on wide range of behavior, and in the reality the effects are smaller or do not exist at all 
(Simmons et al., 2011;
Simonsohn, 2015)
. This is, however, only a speculation which warrants larger empirical research and replication projects 
(Zwaan et al., 2018)
.
This consistency holds for traditional measures (such as trolley problem scenarios) and for distinct deontological (D) and utilitarian (U) parameters. This distinction broadens our conclusion, overcoming limitations of traditional scoring which fails to separately assess deontological and utilitarian responses. For example, a scenario causing a slight decrease in deontological inclination and a greater decrease in utilitarian inclination would, under traditional scoring, erroneously appear as an increase in deontological choices due to the scoring's emphasis on the relative strength of the two inclinations.


Because of the ethical problems, we were only allowed to test male participants. Thus, the preregistration was not followed in full.


These priors correspond to a probability of 50% that the effect size (in Cohen's d) under the null hypothesis being true lies between -0.707 to +0.707.
