You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Personalization, which aims to optimize the content, channels, and modalities of an intervention or service depending on the needs and characteristics of individual recipients, has gained attention in recent years 
(Piwek et al., 2016;
Goetz & Schork, 2018;
El-Alti et al., 2019;
Román et al., 2019;
Mauch et al., 2022;
Livingstone et al., 2023)
. Within the context of personalization, various efforts have been made to incorporate psychological theories such as personality traits. According to a recent review of studies on health behavioral change interventions, the information used to personalize interventions was most commonly behavioral or lifestyle data (20/31, 65%) 
(Mauch et al., 2022)
. Among these variables (or moderators), personality traits are promising factors in implementing personalization, which are predictive of individuals' behavior in general 
(Ozer & Benet-Martínez, 2006;
Soto, 2019)
 and have indeed been shown to be informative when delivering optimal health messages (e.g., 
de Vries et al., 2017)
. Personalization strategies based on individual characteristics have been explored for cancer screening and other screening recommendations 
(Hirai et al., 2016)
.
Personalization in interventions requires rules for selecting appropriate methods and components 
(Cohen et al., 2023)
 for individuals with different backgrounds and characteristics. One possible approach is to construct a predictive model using existing data that allows the estimation of the effectiveness of each intervention component if delivered to a particular recipient (patient) or population 
(van Setten et al., 2002;
Cohen et al., 2023)
. For example, 
Cohen et al. (2023)
 developed predictive models to aid in deciding whether to continue antidepressant medication (ADM) or transition to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for relapse prevention in recurrent depression. They constructed models to predict the likelihood of relapse with both ADM therapy and a shift to MBCT. They demonstrated that comparing the predictions of these models may contribute to optimal treatment selection. Many attempts have been made to build models using personality and other psychological traits as predictors of behavioral responses to an intervention and prognosis with treatment 
(Box et al., 2019;
Laguna & Purc, 2016)
. In many cases, psychological traits including personality, are often measured and treated as continuous variables. This approach is known as the trait or dimensional approach, particularly in the research filed of personality. However, when designing personalized interventions, it is costly to develop detailed components and selection strategies for myriad combinations of multiple continuous variables. Therefore, it is effective to classify the population into a small number of distinct groups with homogeneous in-group characteristics and tailor the intervention for each group 
(Romain et al., 2018)
. This approach is called the type or classification approach.
In the classification approach, statistical cluster analysis and profiling based on individual characteristics are often conducted 
(Robins et al., 1996;
Ahlqvist et al., 2018;
Gerlach et al., 2018)
. However, classifying individuals into clusters sacrifices the information contained in the original continuous scales. Traditionally, dichotomization and other methods to reduce continuous values to categorical labels have been criticized for various reasons, including loss of information, reduced statistical power, underestimation of variation, and concealment of nonlinearity 
(Altman & Royston, 2006)
. Regardless of these criticisms, the classification approach has been appreciated for its simplicity and has been used to develop a knowledge base and implement personalization. Given these advantages and disadvantages, it is particularly important to evaluate the severity of information loss using a classification approach. This issue directly impacts decision-making in practice; if the information loss is negligible, the classification approach could be prioritized without risk; otherwise, effective personalization can be achieved only when an intervention is sufficiently fine-grained-that is, tailored with careful consideration of the continuum of psychological traits. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has systematically examined the extent to which information loss occurs. If the loss of important information occurs by creating clusters, the intervention design would need to be sufficiently fine grained; otherwise, the rough classification obtained by clustering would be effective.
This study examined these issues in the context of predicting physical activity (PA) using psychological variables. For this purpose, we used data from a large online survey of approximately 20,000 people to examine psychological variables, such as personality and physical activity. PA has become an important health issue 
(Haskell et al., 2007;
Kohl et al., 2012)
, and interventions and predictions focusing on personality are gaining attention in the healthcare industry 
(Mosadeghrad, 2014)
. Cluster profiling can also be considered for predicting PA or other outcomes 
(Chapman & Goldberg, 2011;
Steca et al., 2010;
Stieger et al., 2020;
Nelson, 2023)
. However, the extent to which personality classification based on clustering predicts PA and the classifications that are effective for this purpose have not yet been explored.
Regarding personality, we focused on the Big Five model or five-factor model (FFM), which is a widely accepted framework for describing human personality 
(Goldberg, 1990)
. It comprises five core traits: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. We also focused on self-control 
(Tangney et al., 2004;
Boat & Cooper, n.d.;
Boat et al., 2022;
Stieger et al., 2021)
 and regulatory focus theory 
(Laroche et al., 2019;
Latimer et al., 2008;
Lockwood et al., 2002)
, which has been studied in the context of PA promotions. We examined the effects of these variables on the prediction of PA incorporating two commonly used clustering methods: K-means and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs).
We compared the predictive accuracy based on profiling with that of the dimensional approach model, in which each characteristic was used as a continuous variable for a predictor. While the prediction accuracy might decrease owing to the coarse-graining effect of cluster classification, it could potentially increase if there were complex nonlinearities and interactions among variables that the simple dimensional-approach model failed to capture, and if cluster classification could capture those patterns.


Methods


Data
Data were obtained from a large-scale cross-sectional survey of physical activity and psychological factors among Japanese-speaking adults. Part of the data has been reported elsewhere 
(Oba et al., 2023)
 for details regarding the sampling strategy. In short, these data cover N = 20,611 residents of Japan (adults aged ≥18 years) sampled from all prefectures in the country. Each participant was registered in a database of potential survey panels and received an email invitation to participate. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Approval ID: 2022-1279). For statistical analyses, we excluded data from (a) 30 participants who reported being less than 1.0 m tall or weighing less than 10 kg, and (b) 8 participants who reported total PA hours (sum of walking and moderate/intensity PA) exceeding 24 hours per day, as we deemed these data unreliable. The remaining data from 20,573 samples were analyzed.


Measures
Our survey included personality and psychological variables as well as a wide range of measures related to health behavior (e.g., life environment, disease history, and mobile health usage). In this study, we report only on the Big Five personality traits, regulatory focus, and self-regulation, focusing on how physical activity is predicted by these psychological variables.


Personality
The Big Five personality traits were assessed using the Japanese version of the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI-J) 
(Gosling et al., 2003;
Oshio et al., 2012)
. This scale consists of 10 items, with two items representing each of the five personality factors (Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness). Either of the two items was reverse scored. Items were rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The mean of each item pair is calculated as the factor score.


Regulatory focus
Two types of regulatory focus (promotion and prevention) were measured using the Japanese version of the Promotion/Prevention Focus Scale 
(Lockwood et al., 2002;
Ozaki & Karasawa, 2011)
. This scale consists of 16 items, eight for each factor (promotion focus and prevention focus). Items were rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The sum of the scores of the eight items corresponding to each factor was used as the score for that factor.


Self-control
Self-control was measured using the Japanese version of the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS-J) 
(Tangney et al., 2004;
Ozaki et al., 2016)
. This scale consists of 16 items, including 9 reverse-scored items. Respondents rated each item on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all like me) to 5 (very much like me).


International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form
PA levels were assessed using the Japanese version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) 
(Craig et al., 2003;
Murase, N et al., 2002)
. See for the validation against objective measures 
(Lee et al., 2011)
. The IPAQ-SF assesses PA levels of the following three categories: (a) walking, (b) moderate-intensity activity, and (c) vigorous-intensity activity. For each category, the participants reported the number of days and time spent on the activity (lasting for at least 10 minutes) over an average week (but not for the last week). The weekly minutes spent on each PA category were calculated by multiplying the frequency and duration.


Statistical analyses
We first tested how well the dimensional-approach models predicted PA. Trait variables were subjected to a linear regression model as continuous predictors (i.e., Big Five personality scores, two types of regulatory focus, and self-control) to predict IPAQ-assessed PA. Second, the trait variables were used to identify meaningful clusters of individuals (the number of clusters was determined by several established statistical criteria), and cluster membership was used to predict PA. The predictive performances of these "classification-approach" models were then compared with those of the dimensional-approach models. Third, we systematically explored how the number of clusters to be included in the classificationapproach model influenced the predictive performance and expected that the performance would improve as the number of clusters increased. In particular, we focused on the predictive power of the number of clusters selected in the established metric relative to the dimensional-approach model and how many clusters are needed to achieve a predictive performance comparable to that of the dimensional-approach model.


Predictors
For the predictor, five models were created by combining the Big Five scores (TIPI-J) and regulatory focus/self-control variables. The first set included only the Big Five scores, whereas the second included regulatory focus (promotion and prevention focus scores) to the first set. The third set added a self-control score to the first set, whereas the fourth set included all scores. The fourth set included only the regulatory focus and self-control variables. The fifth set of variables did not include the Big Five scores and only comprised regulatory focus and self-control scores. Models in which variable sets 1-5 were included in the multiple linear regression analysis as explanatory variables were called Model 1-Model 5, respectively.


Outcome
The outcome predicted by the models was the total PA level (min/day), as assessed using the IPAQ-SF. Owing to the skewness in the distribution of total PA, it was log-transformed and used as the dependent variable.


Classification-approach models
The clustering methods used were K-means and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Before applying these clustering methods, the scores for each scale were normalized such that the mean was zero and the standard deviation was one. This is because K-means tends to render results more sensitive to variables with large variances. K-means was performed using k-means, which is a function of R. The cluster size for K-means clustering was evaluated using the gap statistic 
(Tibshirani et al., 2001
). The gap statistic was computed using the function clusGap of the cluster packages for R. GMM was performed using the scikit-learn function, GaussianMixture. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was used to evaluate the number of clusters 
(Schwarz, 1978)
. A smaller BIC indicates a more probable model. For both K-means and GMM, optimization was executed starting from 30 random initializations, and the best solution was selected. The number of clusters K varied from 1 to 30. However, for the GMM, as the number of clusters increases, the likelihood tends to become extremely high because of the assignment of components to a small number of samples, which can cause the BIC to become unstable and less reliable. Thus, BIC was evaluated for cluster numbers of up to 20. In addition, from the perspective of computational cost, the gap statistic was evaluated for cluster numbers of up to 20. Based on the patterns observed for up to 20 clusters, the likelihood that an optimal solution would include a cluster size greater than 20 is considered low.
A model was constructed to predict the total PA using the labels resulting from each cluster, with the cluster labels as explanatory variables, and the prediction accuracy was evaluated.
Prediction accuracy was evaluated using the explained variance (R 2 ) and cost of cluster mean prediction (CCMP) 
(Katahira, 2023)
.


Principal component analysis (PCA)
To characterize the distribution of each cluster, PCA, a method for dimensionality reduction of data, was applied to the personality scores. PCA is a statistical tool that decomposes the variance in a dataset into principal components (PCs). K-means divides the data such that they are partitioned along the first principal component axis with the largest variance, followed by the second principal component direction. We visualized the structure of the clusters by color-coding the clusters in the PC1 and PC2 score spaces.


Results


Demographics and descriptive statistics
Demographic information and descriptive statistics of the scores for each scale are presented in 
Table 1
. This table also includes the profiles of the four clusters generated by K-means clustering using the Big Five scores (variable set 1). The mean age of the respondents was 52.65 (SD = 17.77), ranging from 19 to 94. 
Table 2
 presents the correlation coefficients among the eight psychological variables, comprising five Big Five scores, two regulatory focus scores, and a self-control score. Weak correlations with coefficients between r = .1 and r = .2, were observed for all variables except for total PA and prevention focus.


Dimensional-approach models
First, we examined the extent to which a dimensional approach model, specifically, a linear regression model, could explain total physical activity (PA). In this model, we included the scores from the Big Five model as well as other psychological characteristics, such as regulatory focus and self-control, as explanatory variables. These variables were directly included in the model as continuous variables without classification. 
Table 3
 shows the R 2 values for Models 1-5 using the five predictor sets. Model 4, which included all the variables, had the highest R 2 (.054. Thus, Model 4 explains 5.4% of the variation in PA. Model 4 had a significantly higher likelihood than Model 2, without regulatory focus (F(1, 20565) = 19.83, p < .001). The likelihood was also significantly higher than in Model 3 without self-control (F(2, 20566) = 89.97, p < .001). Model 2, which included the Big Five and regulatory focus, had R 2 = .053, which was close to the explanatory power of Model 4, indicating that the contribution of self-control was smaller than that of regulatory focus. 
Table 4
 presents the estimation results for Model 1, which includes only the Big Five variables and Model 4, which incorporates the full set of variables. Although Neuroticism did not have a significant effect, the other Big Five scores (Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness) showed significant effects. These results indicate that despite the correlations among the Big Five variables 
( Table 2)
, the four Big Five variables independently contribute to explaining PA. In Model 4, promotion focus and self-control had significant positive effects, whereas the effect of conscientiousness was no longer significant.


Classification-approach models
We first evaluated the number of clusters in an unsupervised manner for the clustering methods, including K-means and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The Gap statistic was calculated to determine the optimal number of clusters (K) using k-means 
(Fig. 1)
. A higher Gap statistic value indicates better clustering. For Variable set 1, K=4, and for variable set 4, K=5 were deemed optimal, as they had the highest values and were also higher than the mean + standard error (SE) of the number of clusters K-1 
(Tibshirani et al., 2001)
. For GMM, the BIC suggests that the optimal number of clusters is between 5 and 12, as these values minimize the BIC.  
Table 1
. For K-means using only the Big Five (Variable set 1), the R 2 is approximately 0.03 for K=4, which is approximately 60% of the dimensional-approach model. Around the number of clusters exceeding 10, R 2 exceeds .04 and approaches .045, the R 2 of the dimensional-approach model. Comparing the R 2 values of the predictive models using K-means and GMM cluster labels, k-means outperformed k-means for most cluster numbers 
(Fig. 3A)
. This is consistent with the results of a previous study that compared K-means and GMM on different datasets 
(Katahira, 2023)
. 
Katahira (2023)
 argues that when the predicted variable is a linear function of the explanatory variables, K-means provides a partition that leads to the best prediction, which is consistent with our results. 
Fig. 3B
 shows the CCMP, which evaluates the prediction accuracy of cluster-mean based prediction; the lower the CCMP, the higher the prediction accuracy. This criterion penalizes excessive numbers of clusters. However, CCMP is almost a mirror image of R 2 shown in 
Fig.   3A
, with almost no penalty effect. This can be attributed to the fact that the present data contained a sufficiently large number of samples. Therefore, the penalty for an excessive number of clusters did not take effect. 
Fig. 3
 shows the mean scores for each cluster of K-means, where the number of clusters was four 
( Table 1)
. The clusters were labeled in order of the mean values of extraversion.


Cluster profile
Panel A shows the results for the cluster solution with only the Big Five and Panel B shows the results for the cluster solution with full variable sets. Regarding the Big Five scores, Panel B, with the addition of promotion focus, prevention focus, and self-control, did not change significantly from Panel A, with only the Big Five. Cluster 1 has higher Neuroticism and higher prevention focus, corresponding to the "overcontrol" type in the ARC typology 
(Chapman & Goldberg, 2011;
Steca et al., 2010)
; Cluster 4 is the opposite, with higher neuroticism and higher prevention focus, corresponding to the "resilient" type in the ARC typology or "role model" in 
Gerlach et al.'s typology (Gerlach et al., 2018)
. Cluster 3 can be described as the reserved type, characterized by high agreeableness and conscientiousness. Cluster 2 can be seen as a mirror image of Cluster 3. 
Figure 4A
 shows the distribution of clusters obtained by plotting the first and second principal components of the PCA using the five Big Five variables employed in the clustering process.
The four cluster solutions obtained from the Big Five alone are represented by different colors.
The variance explained by these two principal components was 64%. In K-means clustering, the data were divided into three segments along the first principal component, and the middle segment was further divided in the direction of the second principal component. This is a typical tendency when applying K-means clustering to data with a unimodal distribution, where the cluster structure is not distinct. However, the GMM does not correspond directly to the principal components.
The first principal component had positive loadings on Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness, and negative loadings on neuroticism ( 
Figure 4B)
. The second principal component has a positive loading on agreeableness. Cluster 1 was the group with a low PC 1 score (i.e., high neuroticism and low others); Cluster 4 was the opposite. Cluster 2 is the group with a high PC 2 score (i.e., high agreeableness and low extraversion and openness), and Cluster 3 has the opposite.
From the distribution of the PC scores, no clear cluster boundaries with decreasing densities were observed ( 
Figure 4D
), suggesting that these clusters may not represent typical types within the population. The clusters obtained by K-means might be better interpreted as "segments" divided along the principal component axes.


Discussion
The classification of individuals based on personality and other characteristics is useful in marketing, business, and basic research. Although classifying individuals results in loss of information, the extent to which this is the case has not been sufficiently examined. In this study, we examined the prediction of PA through clustering based on personality and other psychometric characteristics by comparing it with a dimensional approach model (i.e., linear regression).
The main finding of this study is that for a commonly used number of personality clusters (profiles: approximately three to five), the accuracy of clustering-based predictions is significantly less than that of dimensional-approach models. To achieve the equivalent prediction accuracy of the dimensional-approach model, the number of clusters should be more than 20. The number of clusters, K=4, which was selected by a criterion for the number of clusters, provides only approximately 60% of the explanatory power of the dimensionalapproach model. This means that even if the number of clusters is optimized within the unsupervised learning framework (without the outcome variable to be predicted), it does not necessarily result in the best classification in terms of prediction. Determination of the number of clusters depends on the objective. Clustering can be used to understand and interpret the profile of each cluster, which in turn can be used to design interventions. In doing so, the tradeoff between predictive accuracy and interpretability should be considered. People who base their decisions on clusters should be aware that they sacrifice the predictive power or rich information inherent to continuous variables. It is challenging to tailor an intervention while preserving the continuum of personality traits and other individual differences, including the use of personality scores (without clustering), to predict the preference or suitability of health messages, for which a predictive model has been developed as a knowledge base 
( de Vries et al., 2017)
. Intervention components do not have to be delivered in a deterministic manner, and a predictive model can be used to adjust the probability or mixture rate of multiple intervention components.
In the present study, the dimensional approach models with personality traits as predictor variables explained at most 5% of the PA variation, suggesting that the model's performance was inadequate in terms of prediction. However, this low performance was not surprising,
given that the Big Five traits are known to have weak correlations with PA (r = .1 (i.e., R 2 = .01) or even lower 
(Wilson & Dishman, 2015)
. Prediction performance could have been improved if health-related or more PA-specific trait variables were included in the analyses, as the trait measures assessed only general tendencies (e.g., 
Gomez et al., 2013)
. Indeed, a model using other PA-specific traits (e.g., stage of change) in our dataset explained 19% of the variance in PA 
(Oba et al., 2023)
.
The distribution of the trait scores in this study did not show a clear cluster structure. Many clustering methods, such as K-means and GMM, yield clustering results that segment the feature (trait score) space, even for unimodally distributed features with no clear cluster structure 
(Katahira et al., 2020;
Katahira, 2023)
. Moreover, the non-normality in the distribution leads to the selection of solutions with multiple clusters, even in a unimodal case 
(Katahira et al., 2020)
. It is conceivable that this was also the case in the data obtained in this study. While it may still yield a useful segmentation for prediction, the user should be aware that the boundaries of that segmentation are not naturally derived from the distribution of features (i.e., variables) but are determined by the nature of the clustering methods.
This study has several limitations. The first limitation of this study is that the TIPI-J used as the Big-Five personality instrument has only 10 items, which might be less reliable than other instruments because it has fewer items. It is also possible that this makes it difficult to identify a clear cluster structure. The second limitation is the use of a self-report measure of PA, which may have been biased due to traits that might be related to personality. It may be necessary to conduct a similar investigation using an objective measure of physical activity such as a pedometer. Third, the unsupervised clustering methods used for the classification model were limited to K-means and GMM. The results of this study recommend the use of K-means for PA prediction, which has better prediction accuracy than the GMM. However, we did not discuss other commonly used methods, such as hierarchical cluster analysis or latent profile analysis. We do not expect these methods to provide better methods in terms of prediction than K-means; however, discussing these methods will be a topic for future research. Finally, this study focused on the problem of predicting PA. In many cases, predicting responsiveness to intervention rather than predicting PA or other outcomes is required for practical applications. Predicting the response to an intervention is a more complex problem, and further research is required to determine the extent to which the findings of this study are applicable. Nevertheless, the framework and findings of this study may serve as a useful starting point for addressing this challenge.
