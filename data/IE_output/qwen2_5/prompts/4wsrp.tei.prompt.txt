You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Most decisions do not happen instantly. Instead, they arise from a noisy, dynamic process. As a result, choices are not due solely to underlying utilities/values -they can also reflect context and manipulations. Thus, to understand preferences we must study the choice process and decompose it into its constituent mechanisms.
Many decisions are well captured by a class of models known as sequentialsampling or evidence-accumulation models, the most well-known of which is the driftdiffusion (or diffusion-decision) model (DDM). These models assume that the decisionmaker evaluates the options in front of them, gathering evidence to support one over the other 
(s)
. When the net evidence favoring one option reaches a pre-specified boundary, a choice is made ( 
Fig. 1a-b
). These models capture links between underlying values, choice probabilities, and response times (RT) (and other measures, see below). For instance, choices between two options with very different values are fast and consistent, while choices between two options with similar values are slow and inconsistent. Drift-diffusion models thus allow us to estimate preferences 
(i.e., values)
 from both choice and RT data 
(Konovalov & Krajbich 2019;
Clithero 2018;
Berlinghieri et al. 2023)
.
The DDM has several appealing features. First, under basic assumptions, it is the optimal decision-making rule in the sense that it minimizes RT for a desired accuracy rate 
(Wald 1945;
DeGroot 1970;
Bogacz et al., 2006;
Bhui, 2019a
Bhui, , 2019b
; but see 
Fudenberg et al. 2018
, Tajima et al. 2016
. Second, empirically it provides a tight match to choice and RT distributions across many domains of cognition including memory, perception, and preference 
(Ratcliff et al., 2016;
Evans & Wagenmakers, 2019;
Busemeyer et al., 2019)
. Third, it has substantial support from neuroscience, where decision-related neurons appear to ramp up their activity until they hit a threshold just prior to choice 
(Gold & Shadlen 2007;
Forstmann et al., 2016
, but see Latimer et al. 2015
, Zoltowski et al. 2019
. The DDM has a lot going for it.
In recent years, the DDM (and other related models) have been used to uncover the dynamics of economic/value-based choice 
(Krajbich & Smith 2015;
Clithero 2018
).
This research is exciting, in part because it has attracted researchers beyond psychology, from economics 
(Krajbich et al. 2014;
Webb 2019;
Alos-Ferrer et al. 2021;
Hebert & Woodford 2023;
Baldassi et al. 2020;
Berlinghieri et al. 2023)
, marketing 
(Chiong et al. 2024)
, finance 
(Frydman & Nave 2017)
, and neuroscience 
(Shohamy & Shadlen 2016)
. In this chapter we will discuss this work and highlight the different ways in which the DDM has been used to gain novel insight into the economic choice process.


Starting points vs. drift rates
In the standard DDM, there are three factors that can affect which category is favored.
The first factor is the evaluation of the options available in this particular choice problem. The second factor is a predisposition towards one category over the other across choice problems 
(Edwards, 1965)
. The third factor is response caution, i.e., how much evidence is required before deciding. These three factors, plus noise, combine to determine the outcome of a particular choice.
The evaluation of the available options determines the drift rate. It may reflect a combination of explicit considerations and memories, as well as implicit associations 
(Bakkour et al. 2019)
. In the standard DDM, the drift rate is assumed to be constant throughout the trial. In addition to reflecting the relative weights that the decision-maker puts on the attributes, the drift rate may also include a constant that reflects a preference towards one category over the other. One can think of this preference as a "bias", since it favors one option over the other based purely on the options' labels. The drift rate serves an analogous role to utility in static choice models.
A decision-maker's predisposition is reflected in the starting point of the decision process, i.e., evidence that has already "accumulated" before the options have been presented 
(Cerrachio et al. 2023)
. If there is any prior or contextual information, the decision-maker may already have reason to favor an option 
(Desai & Krajbich 2021)
.
For example, when deciding what drink to order at an Italian restaurant, a diner may already be favoring wine over beer before seeing the menu. Non-neutral starting points can be optimal in environments where information is noisy and time is costly.
Starting points and drift rates can have different-sized impacts on behavior depending on time constraints. When time is tight or very costly, then decision-makers will exert less response caution, resulting in narrower decision boundaries. In such cases, decision-makers will spend less time evaluating their options and thus be more influenced by their predispositions. When time is plentiful, decision-makers should thoroughly evaluate the options, reducing the effects of predispositions 
(Chen & Krajbich 2018)
.
Whether a behavioral effect is due to drift rates or starting points is an important distinction. Drift rates reflect how a person perceives the options, while starting points reflect considerations before seeing the options. In one notable example, 
Izakson, Yoo et al. (2024)
 investigated decoy effects, finding that nearby consumer products influenced subjects' values for target products. However, upon further analysis, the authors found that this was due to starting points not drift rates -the effect disappeared for slower decisions. Thus, in that setting, decoys did not systematically change how subjects perceived the target items. Instead, the decoys provided contextual information that subjects used to get a head start on their decisions. Rather than requiring new theories about contextual value distortions, this alternative interpretation of the choice data relied on a simple, intuitive mechanism. choice between two goods. B) The decision-maker samples evidence in favor of both options until they hit a decision boundary. C) In the stDDM, different attributes enter the drift rate at different times. In this example, initially there are no attributes, then taste enters in, and later healthiness enters in. D) In the aDDM, shifts in attention between options alter the drift rate, favoring the fixated option. E) In the maaDDM, shifts in attention between options and attributes alter the drift rate, favoring the fixated element. F) The circular DDM models continuous rather than discrete choices, in this case the strengthof-preference between the two options. The decision-maker may start with information that biases them towards preferring one option over another. For example, when in a coffee shop, people may be predisposed to favor tea (green line), but when in an ice cream parlor, they may be predisposed to favor a milkshake (purple line), regardless of the actual options on the menu (which determine the drift rate). In this example, the gray area represents evidence that is accumulated before the actual decision, i.e. the starting-point.
Researchers have started to use the DDM to study the role of starting points, drift rates, and other DDM parameters on economic choice. 
Enax et al. (2016)
 found that color-coded nutrition labels increase the drift-rate, but not the starting point, towards healthy foods. 
Yu et al. 2021
 found that people develop harmful or helpful predisposition towards antisocial and prosocial peers. 
Desai & Krajbich (2022)
 showed that if options from Category A are generally better than from Category B, people will develop starting-points favoring Category A. 
Zhao et al. (2020)
 demonstrated that starting points play a large role in explaining loss aversion.  decomposed a battery of 19 common behavioral nudges and classified them based on the mechanism through which they operate. For example, price information and cognitive load operate primarily through starting point; default options, accept/reject framing, and accountability operate primarily through drift rate; social norms/recommendations use both. Overall, this line of research is demonstrating that economic phenomena can be attributed to a mix of drift rates and starting points.


Latency effects
One interesting development that is unique to value-based DDMs is the consideration of multi-attribute choice. Unlike standard perceptual and memory tasks, most value-based decisions involve trading off different attributes of the options. For example, when choosing what to eat, a decision-maker has to decide how much to consider the tastiness vs. the healthiness of the options. These attribute weights add another layer of complexity to the choice process.
In recent years the field has developed DDMs that allow for the drift rate to change by adding in attributes over time 
(Fig. 1c)
. These models assume that decision makers incorporate attribute information serially. Attributes that enter the drift rate faster have earlier and thus larger effects on decisions.
Attribute latencies have been estimated in a couple different ways. One way is through formal modeling of choice and RT distributions using a time-varying DDM 
(Sullivan & Huettel 2021
, Meier et al., 2020
Barakchian et al., 2021)
. In this case, the drift rate depends not only on attribute weights but also on the relative start time of one attribute compared to another. The other way is with mouse-tracking experiments where a decision-maker's hand movements while selecting an option reveal their attribute latencies 
(Sullivan et al., 2015;
Chen et al., 2024a,b)
. 
Chen et al. (2024b)
 demonstrated that the mouse trajectory-derived latency is highly correlated with the estimated latency from the time-varying DDM, indicating a strong correspondence between mouse movements and decision mechanisms as modeled by DDM.
These latency models have provided a richer understanding of the choice process in a variety of domains. 
Sullivan & Huettel (2021)
 and Meier et al. 
2020
applied latency models to dietary choice and found that when health considerations are delayed relative to taste consideration, differences in weights on taste and health matter less for choice ( 
Fig. 2a)
. In intertemporal choice, 
Amasino et al.(2019)
 and 
Chen et al. (2024a)
 showed that when decision-makers consider reward information before time information, they tend to be more patient. 
Chen et al. (2024b)
 also applied a latency model to social decisions. They found that selfish individuals take longer to process others' payoffs, whereas the opposite was true for prosocial individuals. In the domain of risky choice, 
Chen et al. (2022)
 found age differences in the order of attribute processing, with older adults considering probability information earlier.
Manipulating the order in which attributes are considered can alter the decision process, demonstrating that attribute latency causally influences choice. For example, Chen et al. (2024a) had decision-makers process the rewards/times first, which forced rewards/times to enter the decision process earlier, resulting in more/less patient choices. Meier et al. 
2020
found that cueing attention to healthiness can both shorten the health latency and increase the weight on health, while 
Sullivan & Huettel (2021)
 only found effects on the attribute weights 1 . Additionally, Meier et al. 
2020
found that electrical stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) caused a change in the relative weights on taste and healthiness, but not in their latencies. correlates with increased choice of the option that is better on that attribute (in this case tea instead of milkshake). D) In the circular DDM, a starting point bias towards an option leads to a higher value for that option, but only for the fastest decisions (adapted from 
Izakson, Yoo et al. 2024
).


Relation to dual-process models
Drift diffusion models provide a framework to think about dual processes. Dualprocess models assume that an intuitive system (System 1) and a deliberative system (System 2) interact to reach a decision 
(Kahneman 2011)
. The DDM provides a natural way to think about these two systems; System 1 contributes to the starting point of the choice process, while System 2 contributes to the drift rate.
Some proponents of dual-process theories have argued that time pressure promotes intuitive responding (e.g., 
Rand et al. 2012)
. In the DDM, time pressure indeed puts more emphasis on the starting point. For example, 
Chen & Krajbich (2018)
 showed that decision-makers vary in their starting point towards selfish or altruistic choices, and that time pressure accentuates the effects of these starting points, making prosocial people more prosocial and selfish people more selfish. However, subsequent work has argued that these effects may also/instead be due to attentional priorities 
(Teoh et al. 2020)
 or attribute latencies 
(Chen et al. 2024b
). These competing mechanisms highlight the complexity belied by the standard dual-process account.
Alternatively, one can also think of System 1 and System 2 as different drift rates, either operating in parallel (Alos-Ferrer 2016) or in sequence 
(Diederich & Trueblood 2018
). In the Diederich & Trueblood model, System 1, drives evidence accumulation at the beginning of a decision, while System 2 takes over later in the decision. Such a model can also explain why intuitive decisions tend to happen earlier and more often under time pressure.
Overall, the DDM framework paves the way for more detailed modeling of dualprocess cognition, enhancing our understanding of intuitive versus deliberative decisionmaking across various domains.


The attentional DDM
Another development in DDMs allows for the drift rate to shift back and forth over the course of a decision as the decision-maker shifts their attention between options and attributes ( 
Fig. 1d
). This idea builds on an older literature on Decision Field Theory 
(Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993;
Diederich, 1997)
, except that now attention is linked to eye movements. These gaze-informed DDMs, like the attentional DDM (aDDM; 
Krajbich et al. 2010)
 and the gaze-weighted linear accumulator model 
(GLAM;
Thomas et al. 2018)
, assume that the fixated information gets more weight in the drift rate than non-fixated information.
There is both correlational and causal support for these models. Studies have repeatedly shown correlations between relative dwell time, final fixation location, and choice ( 
Fig. 2b
; see Krajbich 2019 for a review). Decisions with high overall value display shorter RT and larger dwell advantage effects, which is consistent with multiplicative 
(Smith & Krajbich 2019;
Krajbich, Mitsumasu et al. 2021)
, rather than additive 
(Cavanagh et al. 2014;
Stewart, Hermens, & Matthews, 2016)
, effects of gaze (see 
Westbrook et al.
 2020 for a hybrid model). More recent models have argued that gaze amplifies goal-consistent information, rather than value per-se 
(Kovach et al. 2014;
Sepulveda et al. 2020
; see also 
Frömer et al. 2019
).
There is also now a wealth of evidence that gaze manipulations can bias choice proposed models where gaze is drawn to options that the decision maker is least certain about 
(Song et al. 2019;
Callaway et al. 2021;
Jang et al. 2021;
Li & Ma 2021)
 or, in multi-alternative choice, to options that the decision maker is favoring . There is also empirical evidence that, in some cases, gaze is drawn to the preferred option over time 
(Sepulveda et al. 2020;
Westbrook et al. 2020;
Gluth et al. 2020
). However, our own unpublished findings have found it to occur primarily in experiments with small sets of repeated/overlearned options, suggesting that gaze may be drawn to specific stimuli rather than value per se 
(Cavanagh et al. 2019)
. However, this issue requires further investigation.


aDDM extensions
When options have multiple attributes, gaze can shift between those attributes, which can also affect the drift rate. The multi-attribute aDDM (maaDDM) assumes that the value of an attribute is also amplified by gaze 
(Yang & Krajbich 2023;
Fisher 2021
).
Thus, the drift rate is determined by both the option and the attribute currently being fixated on 
(Fig. 1e)
. Yang & Krajbich found that in most of their cases, unattended attributes of unattended options are discounted twice, once for each factor. This aligns with the idea that attention is a gradient, with items farther from the focal point yielding less information 
(LaBerge & Brown, 1989)
.
A key prediction of the model, borne out in the data, is that attributes that are fixated longer receive more weight in the decision process 
(Fig. 2c)
. However, this effect is less pronounced than the option-wise gaze effect 
(Yang & Krajbich 2023)
. Also, 
Fisher (2021)
 found that directing gaze to either appetitive or aversive attributes of an item increased the probability of choosing that item, in line with the goal-consistent story mentioned above.
The work on the maaDDM addresses some questions raised by the aDDM but also poses many new ones. It helps to address the debate about additive vs. On the other hand, the issue of causality is murkier with multi-attribute gaze. The results from Yang & Krajbich 2023 indicate that the allocation of gaze between attributes helps to explain choice, above and beyond a decision-maker's average weight on the attributes. However, it is also true that decision-makers gaze longer at attributes that they on average put more weight on. If attention is drawn to important attributes, then it is possible that from trial to trial, subjective attribute weights fluctuate, causing decision-makers to shift their attention accordingly. Future work will need to investigate causal manipulations of attribute-wise attention to determine how it affects choice.
Another issue raised by the maaDDM is how attributes interact. In the examples from Yang & Krajbich 2023 and Fisher 2021, the attributes did not necessarily interact.
In one task the attributes were two possible outcomes of a 50/50 lottery; in another dictator-game the attributes were payoffs for the decision-maker and an anonymous recipient. However, in many multi-attribute decisions, the attributes necessarily interact.
In risky-choice, decision-makers are often presented with an outcome and a paired probability (e.g., 25% of winning $100), or in temporal-discounting tasks, decisionmakers are presented with an outcome and a delay (e.g., $100 in 30 days). In the riskychoice setting, 
Glickman et al. (2019)
 proposed one solution where non-fixated elements (i.e., probabilities or rewards) are reduced in magnitude before entering into the utility calculations that determine the drift rate. However, in intertemporal choice, researchers have found that within-attribute accumulator models outperform withinalternative ones 
(Amasino et al. 2019;
Dai & Busemeyer, 2014)
. Another interesting wrinkle in this story is evidence that using a within-alternative vs. within-attribute strategy in risky choice depends on whether probabilities are known or learned through experience (Farahashi et al. 2019). There is currently no model that can account for how attributes interact across different choice domains.
One potential solution to this problem is the idea of interactive attention 
(He & Bhatia, 2023)
, where attention to an element depends on its paired element. For example, in risky choice, a decision-maker would gaze longer at a reward paired with a higher probability (also see 
Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993)
. This interactive attention dynamic implies that the drift rate is a multiplicative function of probability and reward, even though the only thing being accumulated is reward information.


Multiple options and continuous responses
While much of the DDM literature has focused on binary choice, many decisions in life involve more than two options (Towal et al. 2013). Other decisions require us to assign a value to an item, e.g., making an offer on a car or house 
(Johnson & Busemeyer 2005)
. These more complex decisions are relatively underexplored in the DDM literature, but are gaining momentum.
A core issue when extending the DDM to multiple options is the nature of the comparison process. Do decision-makers continue to compare options or do they evaluate the options independently? If they compare, do they compare all pairs of options, or just the best options, or what?
There are several good arguments for a model that primarily compares the best options. The "best vs. next" model is asymptotically optimal in the sense that it minimizes RT for near-perfect accuracy. Moreover, Krajbich & Rangel 2011 found that the best vs. next model outperformed the "best vs. average" model in predicting behavior out of sample. A variant of this model also performed well when explaining choices in sets of 9, 16, 25, and 36 options 
(Thomas et al. 2021)
. 
Callaway et al. 2021 and
Sepulveda et al. 2020
 argued that a model that focuses attention on the best and second-best options is optimal and 
Callaway et al. (2021)
 showed that such a model can account for several interesting patterns in the Krajbich & Rangel trinary-choice data, such as longer fixations as the decision progresses and more fixation time on higher value items. Thus, there is a lot of support for models that increasingly focus on the best options over time.
On the other hand, there is some evidence that the choice process may shift away from a relative comparison model as the number of options grows. Choice overload is a well-known phenomenon where people find it more difficult to choose from larger sets 
(Chernev et al., 2015;
Iyengar & Lepper, 2000;
Scheibehenne et al., 2010
).
An issue that surely lies at the heart of choice overload is limited working memory. As sets grow, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of multiple options. 
Thomas et al. 2021
 found that for the larger set sizes, the best fitting model shifted from a relative comparison model to a probabilistic satisficing model 
(Reutskaja et al. 2011)
. Consistent with limited working memory, they also found that subjects looked at a smaller fraction of items, and thus a roughly constant number of items, as set size grew.
In multi-option, multi-attribute settings, decoy effects can occur when the addition of a third option distorts a decision maker's preference between two existing options (Roe, 
Busemeyer, Townsend 2001;
Trueblood 2022)
. Models that incorporate gaze processes can help to explain decoy effects 
(Gluth et al., 2018;
Molter et al., 2022;
Noguchi & Stewart, 2018;
Marini et al. 2020)
. For example, 
Noguchi & Stewart (2014)
 found that eye-movements and choices were most consistent with a story where people compare pairs of alternatives on single dimensions, which led them to propose a model where evidence is accumulated based on pairwise ordinal comparisons of attribute values 
(Noguchi & Stewart, 2018)
. They also found that more similar options receive greater attention, making them more likely to be selected for comparison. 
Gluth et al. (2018)
 argued that high-value decoys attract attention away from the best options, leading to slower and less accurate choices. 
Molter et al. (2022)
 further confirmed the importance of gaze-dependent evidence accumulation but also found support for similarity-dependent inhibition mechanisms.
Another exciting area of research is modeling decisions on continuous scales (for a review see, 
Rasanan, A. H. H., et al. 2024)
. Consider someone deciding how much they are willing to pay (WTP) for a car. Like with the DDM, we can think of this decision as a dynamic process that starts from a prior expectation and evolves as the decisionmaker evaluates the car. We can model the decision variable as starting at the center of a circle (or circular sector) and accumulating evidence over time until it reaches the edge of the circle 
(Fig. 1f)
. The angle of that intersection point determines the decisionmaker's reported value 
(Kvam & Busemeyer 2020;
Kvam & Turner 2021)
. In these models, the drift angle reflects the decision-maker's evaluation of the good. A circular diffusion model was first applied in an economic setting by 
Kvam & Busemeyer (2020)
, who asked participants for their WTP to play a gamble and their willingness to accept (WTA) to give up that chance. Their model captured the reported price distributions, including the right-skew for low-probability gambles and left-skew for high-probability gambles. The model also provided an explanation for the difference in skew between WTP and WTA conditions, attributing it to variations in the starting points for each price type; buyers typically start low, while sellers generally start high. This offers a unified, process-level account that explains WTP and WTA disparities using a simple model. Another notable example is 
Izakson, Yoo et al. (2024)
, discussed above, which provides a glimpse at how these continuous diffusion models could be used to study decoy effects in a WTP task. Consistent with what the authors found in binary choice, decoy values had an attractive force on the WTP for the target items, but only for the fastest decisions 
(Fig. 2d)
. The authors found that this pattern could only be explained by a model where decoys affect the starting point of the process and not the drift-rates of the goods.


Social use of DDM
Researchers can learn a lot from a decision-maker's RT. A related question is whether decision-makers learn from each others' RT. For example, one might be able to infer another's strength-of-preference or belief from their RT 
(Gates et al. 2021;
Bavard et al. 2024)
. This RT inference could occur in either cooperative or competitive settings. In the former, people could learn more from each other. In the latter, people could access private information to gain a competitive advantage.
There are now a few examples in cooperative settings. 
Frydman & Krajbich (2016;
 and 
Tump et al. (2020)
 both examined information cascades games where people are trying to guess the state of the world. Participants receive private information but also see other people's guesses. Frydman & Krajbich showed that players are slower to guess when they have conflicting information, and so subsequent players are less likely to follow someone who guessed slowly. Similarly, Tump et al. showed that players with better information guess earlier in the sequence, providing guidance to those with worse information.
In competitive settings, 
Konovalov & Krajbich (2017;
 and 
Cotet et al. (2021;
 have studied RT inference in bargaining. When bargaining, a quick rejection likely signals that your offer was way off, while a slow rejection likely signals that you were close to acceptance. 
Konovalov & Krajbich (2023)
 showed that laboratory bargainers indeed adjust their second offers more after being rejected quickly vs. slowly, and that they prefer to reject others more quickly. 
Cotet et al. (2024)
 showed that the same information is present in RT data from eBay bargaining, but that bargainers there instead seem to be discouraged by slow rejections.


Neural basis of economic DDM
Research in neuroeconomics has largely focused on utility/value/reward representations in the brain (e.g., 
Schultz et al. 1997;
Plassmann et al. 2007;
Bartra et al. 2013;
Castegnetti et al. 2021)
. However, without a model of the choice process, it is challenging to further decompose these brain regions into distinct components, or to know how these utility representations determine choice. The DDM offers a framework for addressing these issues.
Much of the research connecting the DDM to decision neuroscience originated from studies of perceptual decision-making (for reviews, see 
Kiani, 2013, and
O'Connell et al., 2018)
. Using a dot-motion task, researchers showed that motionsensitive neurons display steady activity proportional to motion strength, while eyemovement neurons ramp up their activity over time with a slope proportional to motion strength (the macaque decision-makers choose with their eyes). Moreover, these latter neurons reach a threshold level of activity before triggering a choice. These patterns align well with the DDM (for a review, see 
Gold & Shadlen 2007)
. This evidence is supported by studies not only in monkeys 
(Roitman & Shadlen, 2002;
Jun et al., 2021)
, but also in mice 
(Hanks et al. 2015)
, rats 
(Brunton, Botvinck, Brody 2013)
, and humans 
(Kelly & O'Connell, 2013;
O'Connell et al. 2012;
Gherman et al., 2024;
Gluth et al., 2013;
Twomey, Murphy, Kelly, & O'Connell, 2015;
Lui et al., 2021)
. Much of the work in humans supports the existence of a localized centroparietal source that tracks evidence accumulation 
(O'Connell et al., 2018)
. Consequently, a growing body of human research continues to map key parameters of the DDM onto MEG/EEG signatures (for reviews, see 
Nunez et al., 2024;
Harris & Hutcherson, 2021)
.
However, more work is needed to determine if scalp potentials encode evidence accumulation, correlated processes, or mixtures of signals 
(Philiastides, Heekeren, & Sajda, 2014;
Frömer et al., 2024)
.
Compared to perceptual choice where decision-makers sample external evidence from the stimuli, in economic choice decision-makers often sample internal representations of utility/value/reward 
Shohamy & Shadlen 2016)
.
Thus, reward regions like the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) serve an analogous role as the motion-sensitive neurons in the dot-motion task. These regions provide input to evidence accumulation regions elsewhere in the cortex.
While less suited for studying neural dynamics, fMRI has been used to study economic evidence accumulation in the brain. Several studies have identified the DLPFC, insula, pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), and intraparietal sulci (IPS) as potential accumulation regions 
(Basten et al. 2010;
Gluth et al. 2012;
Rodriguez et al. 2015;
Magrabi et al. 2022)
. Notably,  used effective connectivity analyses to identify a chain of decision-related activity that starts with VMPFC sending input to preSMA and IPS, followed by preSMA, IPS, and DLPFC sending excitatory/inhibitory signals to the left/right motor cortices for right/left choices, respectively. These results paint a rich picture of how economic decisions unfold in the brain.
For a more granular picture of how economics decisions unfold, it is useful to combine the temporal resolution of EEG/MEG with the spatial resolution of fMRI.
Research with EEG/MEG aligns well with the fMRI results described above, as it has identified both parietal and frontal regions that track economic evidence accumulation 
(Hunt et al. 2012;
Polania et al. 2014)
. Some of the best research on economic evidence accumulation used concurrent fMRI and EEG 
(Pisauro et al. 2017)
, revealing centroparietal activity that closely matched the ramping signature predicted by DDM, which could be traced to activity in the SMA, which in turn showed functional connectivity with the VMPFC and striatum. Similar results have been found in monkeys, where orbitofrontal neurons reflect relative stimulus values while anterior cingulate neurons integrate the evidence 
(Hunt et al. 2018)
. Causal evidence from human lesion patients further support the importance of dorsomedial PFC in the decision process 
(Vaidya & Fellows, 2015)
.
If people are sampling internal evidence to make their decisions, then memory should play a role (Shohamy & Shadlen 2016). In an fMRI study, 
Bakkour et al. (2019)
 found that longer decision times engage the hippocampus more, leading to the conclusion that in economic decisions, memory-related regions are more active during decisions with longer RT. This finding was further supported by evidence showing that patients with hippocampal damage are selectively impaired in economic decisions but not in perceptual decisions. Related research with the aDDM/GLAM has found that people accumulate evidence for options even when they are invisible and need to be retrieved from memory. In such cases, attentional discount factors are even more extreme 
(Weilbacher et al. 2021;
Eum et al. 2023
).
There has also been some investigation into the neural effects of attention in DDM processes. 
Lim et al. (2011)
  Another advantage of taking a DDM perspective is that it can provide new interpretations of findings in the literature. In one persuasive example, 
Hutcherson & Tusche (2022)
 argued that DLPFC activity during self-control tasks, which has often been associated with impulse inhibition, is better explained by there being more evidence accumulation in conflicting decisions. They showed that the typical correlation between DLPFC activity and self-control is reversed when self-control is the typical response.
Admittedly, while significant progress has been made in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying preference formation during decision-making, incorporating relevant neuroscience and mathematical frameworks from psychology is still in its early stages. More work is needed to integrate neurophysiological data into economic decision models.


Emerging trends


Reinforcement learning with DDM
A major topic in decision neuroscience is reinforcement learning (RL). But like with utility/value models, work in RL tends to ignore how values lead to choices. Recent research has sought to enhance RL research by integrating the learning models into DDM-like choice models 
(Ratcliff & Frank 2012;
Pedersen, Frank, Biele 2017;
Fontanesi et al. 2019;
Miletic et al. 2020;
2021)
. Other research has exploited the dynamics of the choice process, using eye-tracking and mouse-tracking to better understand RL 
(Cavanagh et al. 2014)
 and the distinction between model-free and model-based learning 
(Konovalov & Krajbich 2016;
. There are now freely available software packages designed to fit RLDDMs 
(Pedersen & Frank 2020;
Fengler et al. 2022)
, indicating that more great work is yet to come.


Natural language processing as input to DDM
The advancement of powerful machine-learning techniques has enabled the extraction of detailed quantitative representations of words and sentences. Recently, researchers have begun integrating these representations from large-scale digital data into cognitive-process models 
(Bhatia & Aka, 2022)
. For instance, 
Zhao et al. (2021)
 utilized a thought listing paradigm to examine memory-based decision-making. They obtained vector representations of decision-related thoughts and grouped these thoughts into distinct clusters. These thought clusters were then used as inputs for sequential sampling models for decisions made from memory. Instead of using eyetracking to observe information sampling, this approach demonstrates the value of using semantic vectors to model thought content during naturalistic decision-making 2 .


Field settings
One critique of research on the DDM is that it has, until very recently, been limited to fast, repeated decisions in the lab. Thus, a critical step forward is determining whether the framework extends to slow, infrequent decisions in the field. In principle there is nothing limiting the DDM to fast decisions -the model is agnostic to the time scale of evidence accumulation. From a practical perspective, it may seem implausible that people are accumulating evidence over minutes, hours, or days. Nevertheless, there are now a few examples of DDM-like behavior in the field.
One example was described above (Social use of DDM), where 
Cotet et al. (2024)
 found that sellers bargaining on eBay take hours longer to reject higher offers and to accept lower offers on their products. Buyers exhibit analogous behavior in response to sellers' counteroffers. Clearly, there is information in RT in real markets, contrary to many economists' intuition that people should know ahead of time what offers they will accept.
In another field setting, 
Card et al. (2024)
 examined editors' RT at top Economics journals. They found that papers with slower revise-and-submit decisions are less likely to be ultimately accepted at the journal and receive fewer future citations. In contrast, papers with slower rejection decisions receive more future citations.
Finally, Chiong et al. (2024) examined users' RT to mobile ads and found that the RTs predicted out-of-sample ad-engagement better than choices.


Conclusion
All told, there are countless exciting developments occurring in the realm of sequential sampling models. This chapter merely scratches the surface of the theoretical developments and applications of these models to decision-making problems. We look forward to the next advancements in the field and hope that this chapter has given you some new ideas for your own research.

Results derived from the models inFigure 1.A) The DDM with attribute latencies correctly predicts that when the latencies are more staggered, the attribute information has less impact on the drift rate. In this example adapted from
Sullivan and Huettel (2021)
, choices are less sensitive to the predicted drift rates (based on taste -health information), as the latencies diverge. This can be seen by noting the shrinking distances between the three curves from left to right. B) In the aDDM, a relative dwell time advantage towards one option (e.g. left) correlates with increased choice of that option. C) In the maaDDM, a relative dwell time advantage towards one attribute (e.g., calories in theFig. 1 example),


(
Bhatnagar & Orquin 2022)
, contrary to earlier claims
(Mormann & Russo 2021)
. Somemanipulations are more effective than others and, because of covert attention, shifting a person's gaze does not guarantee that you have shifted their attention. Manipulations that bias relative dwell time are more effective than those that bias first fixations, consistent with the aDDM (Bhatnagar & Orquin 2022). Gaze-informed DDMs have been used to explain a variety of behavioral phenomena/models including Prospect Theory (Sheng et al. 2020; Zilker & Pachur 2022, 2023), the endowment effect (Ashby et al. 2012; Sheng et al. 2023), preference reversals (Kim, Seligman, Kable 2012), opportunity-cost neglect (Smith, Krajbich, Spiller, in review), prosociality (Krajbich et al. 2015), morality (Pärnamets et al. 2015), brand preference (Yang et al. 2024), etc. There is still an open question of what influences gaze. Several articles have


multiplicative gaze effects
(Cavanagh et al. 2014;
Smith & Krajbich 2019;
Westbrook et al. 2020)
. The additive models interpret the correlation between gaze and choice as resulting from the decision-maker shifting their attention to the likely choice. But this model cannot explain why the allocation of gaze between attributes would matter. That would require a new, separate mechanism. Gaze amplifying fixated information is a more parsimonious explanation for both option-wise and attribute-wise gaze effects on choice.


demonstrated that reward regions (i.e., striatum and VMPFC) are modulated by attention, showing opposite correlations with value difference (left -right) depending on fixation location, as predicted by the aDDM. Similarly, in monkeys, value related activity in the orbitofrontal cortex is amplified when subjects fixate near the stimulus (McGinty et al. 2016; Hunt et al. 2018). Krajbich, Mitsumasu et al. (2021) used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to disrupt brain activity crucial for guiding visual attention. As a result, subjects' high-value choices were slower and less correlated with relative gaze time, consistent with less attentional discounting in the aDDM.


It is unclear why cueing affected latencies in one paradigm and not the other, but perhaps it is due to the fact that the cues were manipulated within-subject in the Meier task but between-subject in the Sullivan & Huettel task.


Limitations of this approach are the interpretability of the high-dimensional vector representations and the question of whether representations derived solely from language models are sufficient for characterizing mental representation.
