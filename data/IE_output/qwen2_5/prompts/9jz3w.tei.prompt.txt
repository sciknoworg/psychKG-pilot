You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction


Problem Field
Human collaboration is an issue in maritime safety (see 
Batalden & Sydnes, 2014;
Chauvin et al., 2013;
Lee et al., 2020;
Sánchez-Beaskoetxea et al., 2021)
. In this paper, we use the definition of collaboration proposed by 
Bedwell et al. (2012)
 as an evolving process of two or more social entities actively and reciprocally engaging in joint activities aimed at achieving at least one shared goal. Reviews of maritime accident investigations have revealed various al., 2008), TDM 
(Kocher et al., 2020)
, and maritime collaboration in general 
(Acejo et al., 2018;
Chauvin et al., 2013;
Lee et al., 2020)
. Crew members develop TSA by sharing SA through communication 
(Cooke et al., 2000;
Endsley, 2021;
Orasanu, 2000)
. TSA is central to TDM 
(Endsley, 2000)
. TDM is important for successful collaboration (e.g., 
Cannon-Bowers et al., 1993;
Endsley, 2021;
Kocher et al., 2020;
Reader, 2017;
Warner et al., 2005)
.
In ship navigation, team decisions are made about things such as course adjustments, planning 
(Gruner et al., 2022)
, and task distribution. Since TSA is developed through sharing SA it can be studied by measuring SSA, which is "the degree to which team members have the same SA on shared SA requirements" 
(Endsley & Jones, 1997)
. Therefore, in this study, we examined SSA.
Ship bridge crews use various information technologies to enhance communication, TSA, and TDM. Examples are Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS), radar, and radio 
(Sharma et al., 2019)
. Improving these information systems may improve communication and TSA, and thus TDM. In turn, these facets of collaboration improve safety and efficiency.


AR for Ship Navigation
Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential to facilitate collaboration through communication, TSA, and TDM, thus improving collaboration in safety-critical operations such as ship navigation 
(Merino et al., 2020;
Nordby et al., 2024;
.
In this publication, we follow 
Azuma et al.'s (2001)
 definition of AR as supplementing the real world with virtual objects that appear to coexist in the same space and time as the real world. AR can be displayed on different types of hardware, such as immersive headsets 
(Frydenberg et al., 2021)
 and fixed displays 
(Oh et al., 2016)
. Virtual objects are mainly visual but can also be auditive or haptic 
(Lyons et al., 2000)
. While AR has been introduced in many industries, the effects on operator performance are understudied 
(Grabowski et al., 2018;
S. Kim et al., 2016;
Neumann et al., 2021)
, especially in the maritime industry (de la Peña Zarzuelo et al., 2020).
AR can facilitate ship navigation. Examples of information to display in AR for ship navigation are Automatic Identification System (AIS) information, sea markers, heading, engine data , no-go zones 
(Laera et al., 2020)
, and weather status 
(Laera et al., 2024;
. A welldesigned, usable AR interface can increase SA 
Wickens, 2008)
. For example, by presenting information where and when the operator uses it while moving around on a ship bridge 
(Rowen et al., 2021)
. It can also ease the mental mapping of 2D screens to the outside world by projecting information onto the outside world 
(Frydenberg et al., 2018)
. The time operators look down at screens, thus not looking out of the ship bridge windows is called head-down time. Excessive head-down time can represent a safety issue 
(Hareide & Porathe, 2019)
. AR can improve SA by reducing head-down time during complex ship navigation 
(Gernez et al., 2020;
Houweling et al., 2024)
. It has been shown to positively influence SA and communication in complex ship navigation . AR can support SA and decision-making during ship berthing 
(Falk et al., 2020)
. Prototypes have been shown to reduce reaction time and cognitive load 
Laera et al. (2024)
. AR concepts may improve communication and SSA in icebreaker operations 
(Frydenberg et al., 2021)
. More examples of AR for maritime collaboration are discussed in Van den Oever et al. (2023).
Research on AR for collaboration in ship navigation has only started and more research is needed 
(Merino et al., 2020;
Ramirez-Peña et al., 2020;
.
Furthermore, in a recent review, we argued that research on AR applications in maritime work often lacks grounding in the cognitive and social mechanisms they are intended to support . The impact of AR on components of collaboration is especially underexplored . AR for ship navigation should be studied in the field. It has mostly been studied by simulating it 
(Houweling et al., 2024;
Laera et al., 2023;
. In behavior like visual search, VR simulations are sufficiently realistic to generalize to reality 
(Van den Oever et al., 2022)
. Simulator studies have the benefits of experimental control and safety 
(Frydenberg et al., 2021;
Laera et al., 2023)
. However, for a more ecologically valid understanding of AR prototypes, it is necessary to study them in real-world settings 
(Carter et al., 2008)
, as some other studies have done with AR for maritime operations (e.g., 
Falk et al., 2020;
Okazaki et al., 2017)
. AR for ship navigation should also be studied at higher technology readiness levels (TRL; Van den Oever et al., 2023).


The Current Study
To bring research on AR for ship navigation to the next TRL and higher ecological validity, the current study tested an AR prototype in the field, on two voyages. We wanted to examine how AR can facilitate collaboration during ship navigation. To answer this question, we asked five subquestions: 1) How can AR contribute to communication? 2) How can AR contribute to team situation awareness? 3) How can AR contribute to team decisionmaking? 4) What are the advantages of using AR for collaboration during ship navigation? 5)
What are the disadvantages of using AR for collaboration during ship navigation?


Methods
A prototype called "Sjør" was developed and evaluated in a research through design study 
(Zimmerman et al., 2007)
. It was developed in four phases, following an agile, iterative development process 
(Rogers et al., 2023;
Schwaber, 1997)
. In the first phase, the prototype design was informed by interviews and use case workshops on a platform supply vessel. In the second phase, the first version of the prototype was developed for individual navigation by the fourth author (see https://github.com/imable/sjoer; Van Beek, 2022a, 2022b). In the third phase, requirements for AR for collaborative navigation were collected.
In the fourth phase, the second version of the prototype was developed by the third author (see https://github.com/thbc/sjoer; 
Orthmann, 2024)
. It aims to facilitate collaborative navigation using two HL2s. It is the second version of the Sjør prototype that is described and evaluated in the current paper.
Sjør was tested in a field study. Data was collected through interviews, observations, and questionnaires. We followed a realist epistemology: reporting the experiences, meanings, and reality of the participants 
(Braun & Clarke, 2006)
. The project was registered and approved in the System for Risk and Compliance of the University of Bergen before data collection.


The Prototype
The Sjør prototype was designed to facilitate collaborative ship navigation by supporting TDM, TSA, and communication. It was developed in Unity using C# (Unity, 2023) based on the OpenXR standard (Khronos Group, N.D.). The interface design followed Ocean Industries Concept Lab's user interface design framework for augmented-reality-supported maritime navigation 
(Nordby et al., 2024)
. It runs on a set of two Microsoft HL2 headmounted displays (HMDs) and requires a smartphone Wi-Fi hotspot to connect to online servers and GPS information. We consider Sjør to be at TRL 7system prototype demonstrated in relevant environment (European Commission, 2014). Such a TRL is higher than most AR prototypes for maritime operations seen in the scientific literature (Van den Oever et al., 2023). The Sjør software is open source and available on https://github.com/thbc/sjoer 
(Orthmann, 2024)
. The prototype includes the features of POI pins of vessels, POI pins of sea markers (e.g., lighthouses and buoys), and a settings menu.
Collaborative features include marking POI pins and crosshairs to point (see 
Figure 1
). 
Table 1
 describes the features and their purposes.   A hand-interacting menu to control the GPS connection settings, vessel settings, eye-tracking toggle, brightness, multiplayer, and logging.

Note: The menu is opened by holding up one hand and operated with the other hand. A high-level menu is presented to the user. The information shown to the right indicates the HL2 is connected to the other HL2.


System Architecture
The software is conceptually organized into modules.  


Positioning
To align virtual POI pins in a HL2 with the outside-world POIs they refer to, each HL2 must know its own geographical location and orientation, as well as the locations of the POI referred to. This involves translating real-world GPS position and orientation to the 3D
Cartesian world coordinates used by the HL2s. For our prototype, this translation is done by the Positioner, following the instructions and algorithm of Van Schaik (2016). This section provides equations that transform the GPS coordinates of POIs so that POI pins can be positioned on them.
A cylindrical display with a five-meter radius surrounds the user (see 
Figure 4)
. The POI pins, POI cards, and crosshairs are displayed on this cylinder aligned with the POIs they refer to, as shown in 
Figure 1
 and 
Figure 4
. Equation 
1
formalizes the horizon plane, which is a cross-section of the cylinder, to define the cylinder's radius. Equation 
2
formalizes the graphics areas on the cylinder. 3D vector P represents the position of the user and 3D
vector O the direction of a POI from the perspective of the user. Both are described in the 3D Cartesian coordinate system that the HL2 uses, in which the distance between two points is in real-world meters. For example, a graphic at the coordinate (0 1 0) is 1 meter above the coordinate (0 0 0). Equation

  (3)


Vessels Voyages, and Participants
We tested the prototype in a field study on three multi-day voyages in Norwegian coastal waters to answer the research questions listed in the section 1.3. The Current Study. The prototype was tested by ship crews while navigating. Two of the voyages were with a 35meter research vessel in coastal waters and harbors near Bergen, Norway. They lasted 4 and 3 days. The third voyage was with a 77,5-meter research vessel from Tromsø to Bergen, in coastal waters, open sea, and harbors. It lasted 3 days. In total 12 participants with various levels of ship bridge experience tested the prototype, were interviewed, and filled in questionnaires. All participants gave informed consent.


Data Collection Tools
Audio and video data were collected with the HL2s on which the prototype ran, a GoPro camera, a 3D camera, a smartphone, and voice recorders. A System Usability Scale (SUS; 
Brooke, 1996)
 and a Technology Acceptance Model questionnaire (TAM; 
Davis, 1985)
 were recorded on paper. An interview guide was used to structure the interviews during and after testing the prototype. The data collection tools are available on the Open Science Framework (OSF): https://osf.io/gs3yk/?view_only=2cea56e71a0f4b998fb342f2dfee53fc.


Procedure
The first author carried out the study. At the start of each voyage, they set up and tested the prototype to ensure it functioned properly. The crew was informed about the study and asked to participate when they had time in between their responsibilities as bridge officers.
When crew members had time, they were introduced to the study and prototype and gave informed consent to the data collection. Participants went through a familiarization with the prototype under guidance from the researcher. When they were sufficiently familiarized, participants tried using the prototype in combination with their bridge tasks and were asked about the prototype using the interview guide. Most participants tested the prototype several 


Analysis
Audio recordings were automatically transcribed with Microsoft Word for the web 
(Microsoft, n.d.)
. Nineteen transcripts and two observation notes were prepared for analysis by the first author and two research assistants by correcting words misunderstood by the transcriber software making important segments bold and removing superfluous timestamps. Qualitative data from the interviews and observations were thematically analyzed 
(Braun & Clarke, 2006)
. Two coders, the first author and another research assistant, coded the transcripts and observation notes in NVIVO 14 (Lumivero, 2023) following a codebook based on the codebook of a VR simulator study of AR for ship navigation .
The coders first coded two transcripts together and discussed their interpretation of the codes. Next, they coded two more transcripts individually and discussed their interpretation of the codes. After that, they coded the rest of the transcripts separately. A Cohen's Kappa of 0.87 over the rest of the transcripts indicates a well above acceptable inter-rater agreement 
(McHugh, 2012)
. The coders discussed code interpretations and the first author resolved disagreements to finalize the coding. A theme in the disagreements was that the second coder used wider code meanings than the first coder. Some codes were merged into these wider meanings, such as "integrate communication support" and "integrate portophone" into "integrate more communication support". The final codebook is available on OSF: https://osf.io/ywkrz. After that, the first author thematically analyzed the codes by making a code map. Quantitative data from the questionnaires were analyzed. The Cronbach Alpha of the SUS was 0.87, which is similar to previous uses of the SUS 
(Borsci et al., 2015)
. The Cronbach Alpha of the TAM was 0.93, with an Alpha of 0.95 for the Perceived Usability Scale and 0.93 for the Perceived Ease of Use Scale. This is similar to previous TAM uses 
(Legris et al., 2003)
.


Results


Qualitative Results
Qualitative data was collected and thematically analyzed for each of the sub-questions and about what maritime operations to use AR in. A code map showing a graphical overview of the qualitative data is available on OSF: https://osf.io/jsn3r.


Situation Awareness and Decision-Making
The topic of situation awareness frequently came up in the debriefing interviews.
Participants thought AR could help by making information more accessible, which would
give them a better overview, and reduce head-down time. This helps anticipate future situations (level 3 SA) and make decisions. On some occasions, participants used the prototype to communicate about SA to build TSA. Either by two crew members using AR or by cross-referencing between AR and conventional ship navigation systems. Thus, AR can contribute to TDM. On the other hand, AR could limit TSA and TDM by causing attentional capture and limiting vision.


Collaboration
AR can be used for collaboration in two ways: by multiple crewmembers using AR, or by one crew member using AR and communicating with crew members. For multiple crew members using AR, the participants found the crosshair useful for pointing. Marking of pins for collaborators was found to be useful for communication. These functions can speed up sharing SA and decision-making as a team. Multiple crew members using AR can also facilitate collaboration with little verbal communication in a similar fashion to current operations. One crew member using AR can improve collaboration because they get different information from a different perspective than their crew members.


Advantages and Disadvantages
On top of SA, decision-making, and communication, several advantages and disadvantages were identified. Major disadvantages were insufficient screen quality (including field of view size), physical discomfort, and risk for cognitive overload, resulting in mediocre usability.
Participants also saw risks for overreliance and technology limitations and failures.
Advantages included high usability, operator mobility, and the support of mental-mapping 2D
charts from ECDIS and radar to the 3D outside world. Generally, participants believed that AR would be accepted and useful as a navigation tool, albeit more by the younger generations than the older, as one participant said (paraphrase): "Don't get me wrong, I am not against this. I think this could be the future, but it is also for the skippers of the future."


Developing AR for Ship Navigation
These insights resulted in suggestions for further developing AR for ship navigation. A key improvement is to make the AR more accurate in space and time, for example by connecting it to the ship sensors. Other developments that were suggested included increasing screen quality, adding information, adding more control over settings and filters, integrating with other information systems like ECDIS and radar, and adding more communication support 


Quantitative Results
Confirming the qualitative data, quantitative data about AR for ship navigation, using the SUS and the TAM, indicate mediocre usability and technology acceptance. On the SUS, it got a score of 63.33 (SD = 18.2), which corresponds to a usability grade of "C-" on a scale ranging from "F" (absolutely unsatisfactory) to A+ (absolutely satisfactory). This puts it slightly below the average grade C (68, SD = 12.5) found in usability studies 
(Borsci et al., 2015)
. The TAM scores were 3.51 out of 7 (SD = 1.19) for perceived usefulness, 3.01 (SD = 1.17) for perceived ease of use, and a total score of 3.26 (SD = 1.02). This indicates a neutral attitude and mediocre behavioral intention to use AR for ship navigation 
(Legris et al., 2003)
.


Discussion
Our study demonstrates that mobile, head-worn AR can facilitate collaborative ship navigation. AR for ship navigation can facilitate communication about SA, thereby improving TSA, thus supporting TDM. This is in agreement with previous research 
(Laera et al., 2023;
. It can function with multiple AR users visually augmenting their communication. It can also function with one AR user while other operators use conventional systems. AR can give a complimentary perspective to conventional systems by facilitating mental-mapping of 2D screen information to the outside world. Increased operator mobility is also a benefit, as previously found by 
Rowen et al. (2021)
. AR could be even more useful for individual ship navigation, which previous research focused on (e.g., 
Frydenberg et al., 2021;
Laera et al., 2024;
. Disadvantages of AR for ship navigation to consider in future research and development are cognitive overload, visual clutter, attentional capture 
(Gibson et al., 2018;
H. Kim & Gabbard, 2022;
, overreliance 
(Kristić et al., 2021)
, and hard to achieve acceptance and usability 
(Clark et al., 2020)
. To become truly useful, AR for ship navigation must be highly accurate in both space and time;
have various features and settings while avoiding visual clutter, attentional capture, and cognitive overload; and be integrated with other ship bridge systems like ECDIS and radar.
Furthermore, usability and technology acceptance should be emphasized 
(Nordby et al., 2019
(Nordby et al., , 2019
. Until AR becomes unobtrusive, it is best suited for intermittent use: a tool for increasing TSA in specific situations, similar to binoculars. These findings might generalize to AR for other safety-critical operations such as dynamic positioning of maritime vessels, maintenance and inspection, surgery, and flying.


Limitations
Our findings should be interpreted in the context of three limitations. Firstly, by testing a real prototype in real operations we traded experimental control for ecological validity.
Experimental control was limited in our field test because we were limited in our capacity to rigidly control the testing, repeat testing, test the prototype's performance, and testing with a large sample, as compared to lab studies such as 
Rowen et al. (2021)
. However, by preparing different ways of testing the prototype, we were able to deal with some of the serendipity of field research 
(Frydenberg et al., 2019)
. We believe the tradeoff of experimental control for ecological validity was worth it, as field tests are under-represented in comparison to lab tests 
(Carter et al., 2008)
 and next-level TRL testing of AR for ship navigation is called for (Van den Oever et al., 2023). Furthermore, our transdisciplinary method allowed for addressing challenges otherwise inaccessible 
(Podtschaske et al., 2018)
. Secondly, the prototype was only tested in calm weather circumstances with little wind, rain, or fog. This means that our findings may not generalize to difficult navigation circumstances. Thirdly, an experimental demand characteristic effect may have influenced the behavior of participants 
(Orne, 2017)
. To minimize this effect, participants were informed that the prototype was tested rather than them and that their criticism of the prototype and AR as a navigation tool was appreciated.


Implications for Research and Practice
There are several potential directions for following up the current study. Further research could study AR for collaboration in other maritime operations such as maritime traffic control and maintenance and inspection (see . Further research into AR for ship navigation could performance test AR systems with higher TRL, with a focus on a higher accuracy in space and time. Researchers of AR in other industries such as medicine and aviation could use findings from the current study, such as providing various features focused on SA while avoiding visual clutter, attention capture, and cognitive overload. For all applications of AR, the question of how it serves humankind can be studied 
(Jasanoff, 2016)
. The maritime industry may use our findings to develop AR for maritime collaboration to allow for safer, more efficient, and more sustainable work in safety-critical operations such as ship navigation. In particular, such AR can reduce the risk of accidents in complex, safety-critical operations that require collaboration 
(Grabowski et al., 2018)
. AR should also be evaluated for usage on moving platforms 
(Duncan et al., 2013)
. We invite both research and industry to use our prototype, which is available on GitHub:
https://github.com/thbc/sjoer/ under a GPL-3.0 open-source license. 


Conclusion

Overview of the Sjør prototype features.Note: There are several POIs: one opened POI pin with a corresponding card shown above.There are also unopened POI pins. Sea marker POIs are shown at the bottom. The crosshair of where the collaborator points with their left hand is shown in the center. The left hand of the collaborator is seen at the bottom left.


Figure 3 provides an overview of the system architecture as a Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram. The Data Pipeline retrieves a) AIS data from Barentswatch and b) GPS position and orientation from the smartphone. Sea marker data is retrieved from Kystverket (n.d.). These three streams are passed on to the Scene Renderer as Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). The Scene Renderer processes these DTOs into InfoItems (Unity Game Objects) to enable user interactions through eye-tracking, gesture, and voice. The Graphics Pipeline then renders these InfoItems as 3D models to display relevant data. The Global Player and Camera Object monitor the HL2s current location and orientation in relation to the vessel and pass this information to the Positioner. The Positioner translates GPS DTOs into Unity coordinates so that InfoItems are displayed in the right places. Global Helper Functions provide utility functions, including unit conversion and mathematical functions for positioning objects.Using Open Sound Control, the Multiplayer module manages all aspects of network connectivity between HL2s within a local Wi-Fi network. This module also establishes connections, enables data exchange, and implements the crosshair and item marking.

formalizes the rotation matrix that aligns the graphics in the HL2s with geodetic north so that POI pins and cards on the cylinder align with the POIs they refer to. The matrix corrects the offset of the heading of the vessel and the rotation around the Y-axis of the HL2, similar to
Leite et al. (2022)
. Position and orientation are updated continuously to accommodate the movement of the own vessel, the HL2, and POIs.

times. At the end of the voyages, participants filled in questionnaires. Participants who had time were interviewed again on top of the interviewing during the prototype testing. Audio and video were recorded during testing and audio was recorded during interviews. The researcher made notes while observing and interviewing. At any moment, participants could interrupt data collection to attend to their responsibilities as ship crew.


AR can facilitate collaborative ship navigation. AR for ship navigation can improve communication and TSA, and thus TDM. Key advantages are increasing information accessibility, supporting mental-mapping between 2D charts and the outside view, increasing head-up time, and augmenting communication. AR may be especially useful in time-critical operations in medium-busy waterways. Further research and development should aim at achieving high accuracy, usability, acceptance, and unobtrusiveness. Then, AR could increase safety and efficiency by improving collaboration in safety-critical operations like ship navigation.

tools. Hardware and software must be further developed in co-creation with ship crews to become usable in daily work. While developing AR, it is important to consider usability, cognitive load, attentional capture, and overreliance.Maritime Operations where AR may be RelevantAR would be more useful in some ship navigation operations than others. It would be most useful for medium-busy waterways like fjords. Too low traffic density would make it obsolete and too high traffic density can cause obstructive visual clutter. AR could be especially useful during individual navigation. For collaborative ship navigation, it would be useful for intermittent use by lookouts and in high-speed navigation like ferries. Furthermore, it would be useful during dynamic positioning. Besides navigation, participants thought AR could be useful for ship maintenance and inspection.
