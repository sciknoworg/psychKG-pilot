You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
In 1972, Irving Janis, a researcher out of Yale University, introduced the concept of "groupthink."
This paper explained how highly cohesive groups make poor decisions due to their desire for unanimity overriding their motivation to appraise alternative courses of action realistically. According to Janis, groupthink occurs when members are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group. Their strivings for unanimity override their motivation to appraise alternative courses of action realistically 
(1972)
.
Groupthink can lead to disastrous consequences, as illustrated by several historical events such as the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Challenger space shuttle disaster. Although Janis's work primarily focused on historical situations, the prevalence of groupthink in modern society is a significant concern that has yet to be fully addressed. In particular, the prevalence of groupthink in educational settings is a pressing issue.
One way in which groupthink manifests itself in schools is through peer pressure. When students are surrounded by their peers, they may feel pressure to conform to the group's opinions and behavior rather than express their thoughts and ideas. This can create a shallow learning environment where students are not exposed to diverse perspectives and are discouraged from engaging in critical thinking. This concept of people of similar social standing influencing each other has been defined as peer pressure 
(Jones, 2000)
. Though these ideas may seem distant, peer pressure can often force people from the same social group (such as age, grade, or status) to act or behave like themselves 
(Weinfied, 2010)
. With peer pressure being a factor that affects youth, it thus presents the question: Does groupthink affect students?
It seems like an obvious answer: yes. However, more empirical data needs to be collected on whether or not groupthink is an issue within youth groups. This is because the variables that can be used to predict groupthink (cohesion, conformity, concurrence seeking, anxiety, hidden profiles, and trust) have only recently been quantitatively researched 
(Baptist, 2015)
. In past research, only descriptive studies on experiments have been conducted, which presents a gap in the literature for this paper to fill.
Moreover, due to the recency of Baptist's study, the research on groupthink has paused, with few studies done since then. Thus, with this paper, I plan to examine the presence of groupthink in Taiwanese adolescents quantitatively and qualitatively.


Literature review


Basis of Knowledge
All papers on groupthink derive their basis of knowledge from Irving Janis' 1972 book Victims of Groupthink: A Psychological Study of Foreign-Policy Decisions and Fiascoes. This study examines numerous historical events that ended poorly, not because of unintelligent personnel but because groupthink led to bad decision-making 
(Janis, 1972
).
Janis concludes this study by providing a model of how increasing groupthink behavior can increase the probability of making decision errors. He later continued to add to the field in 1991 with a study detailing eight observable symptoms of groupthink: the illusion of invulnerability, the belief in the inherent morality of the group, collective rationalization, out-group stereotypes, self-censorship, the illusion of unanimity, direct pressure on dissenters, and self-appointed mind guards.


Initial Studies
The first to build on Janis' research and collect empirical evidence of groupthink was Matie Flowers in 1977. In this study, 120 undergraduates were split into ten groups in a 2x2 experimental design to test for group cohesiveness and leadership style on the diversity of solutions proposed to the problems in the experimental groups. The results of this study found that a strong leadership style supports Janis' groupthink model 
(Flowers, 1977)
. Another study was done on 208 business students and had a similar conclusion that directive leadership in a group work setting can induce symptoms of groupthink 
(Leana, 1985)
. Thus, these papers stress the importance of a group leader to induce groupthink behavior; however, due to the nature of this study's focus on adolescents (where often no leader is clearly defined), the variable of leadership style is irrelevant. These papers found inconclusive results on the effects of group cohesion on the presence of groupthink behavior. These studies only focus on two independent variables that could be factors of groupthink. However, groupthink is a complex concept, the variables of which were not fully researched until recently. More research was done in a 1989 quantitative case study which re-examined the "fiascos" that Janis initially had looked into and defined seven additional antecedents of groupthink: compliance, group insulation, group homogeneity, crisis, external threat, decision difficulty, and recent failure. In addition to group cohesion and leadership, these would be the basis of future research on groupthink.
In total, there are fifteen studies identified as experiments on groupthink elements. A typical study selects subjects and divides them into groups of three to six. The groups then complete a decision task in 20 to 40 minutes. Questionnaires are completed before or after the decision task. In addition to evaluating the outcome of the decision task, video or audio tapes of the decision meeting are analyzed.
Over several decades, the groupthink paradigm has spawned much study and literature. However, the findings of this research only give limited support for the hypothesis 
(Aldag & Fuller, 1993;
McCauley, 1989
). Furthermore, many factors initially connected with groupthink have shaky conceptual definitions and ties to the phenomena.
Similarly, 
Rose (2011)
 argued that one challenge with operationalizing groupthink is that most of its variables must be characterized. As a result, academics have had to establish their metrics and ways to investigate groupthink. As a result, there has yet to be an agreement on operationalizing the causes of groupthink or assessing the other factors 
(Esser, 1998)
.


Development
The paper that continued the expanse of this paper and research project discussed and measured the predictors of groupthink 
(Baptist, 2015)
. Baptist, after decades of research prior, attempted to objectify, validate, and comprehensively measure the antecedents of groupthink. He states, "What appears to cause groupthink does not always cause it. The disastrous outcomes are almost due to random chance" 
(Baptist, 2015)
. Thus, the study focuses on developing an instrument to measure the different variables of groupthink consistently. With a sample size of 253 students and working adults, the experiment surveyed groups that had previously worked together to determine the validity of all the proposed proponents of groupthink: Highly Cohesive (9 items), Promotional Leadership (11 items), Conformity (12 items), Concurrence Seeking (13 items), Anxiety (12 items), Collective Efficacy (12 items), Hidden Profiles (9 items), and Trust (10 items) 
(Baptist, 2015)
. The surveys were conducted on the Likert scale (1-5) and based on thoroughly examining the literature and assessing the potential variable predictors of groupthink.
An SSCI (or Impact) study of Janis' (1972) initial work on groupthink was conducted using the Web of Science database. This enables backtracking and identifying every reference of a certain source across all areas to account for missing literature and scales and ensure that no unresolved gaps in the study within a topic remain unmentioned.
With the surveys completed, the data was then thoroughly analyzed by estimating the reliability of the study, reversing the coding of items, performing exploratory factor analysis, and creating multiple linear regressions for the scales. After the analysis, the hypotheses for the scales were tested: Highly Cohesive, Promotional Leadership, Conformity, Anxiety, Collective Efficacy, and Trust were all significant proponents of groupthink and, thus, will be the scales used in this study. The results from this study furthered the discussion and exploration of the measurement of groupthink and gave an instrument that can be used to measure groupthink. The experiment in my study will attempt to replicate the conditions of a group work environment and use the selected survey questions (based on the conditions of high school group dynamics) from the Baptist's study.


Political Academic Groupthink
As evident in Janis' (1972) journal, groupthink greatly affects political decisions and opinions.
Modern politics in the United States is centered around the concepts of somewhere on the liberal-to-conservative spectrum. A study was conducted to assess the political ideologies of 10,040
American law professors 
(Bonica, 2015)
. Throughout the various universities in America, it was found that a large majority (85%) of people in the educational sphere are liberal or left-leaning centers (2015). It was concluded that the liberal tilt of the legal academy is primarily due to a scarcity of conservatives rather than a more leftward shift in liberal faculty. Though a lean of an environment may not, in itself, be an issue, it has been studied that sociopolitical discrimination, especially from the liberal majority, does exist in the Academy of social psychology 
(Redding, 2012)
. This was built upon a previous study by 
Inbar and Lammers' (2012)
, which surveyed 800 social and personality psychologists about the discrimination of sociopolitical out-groups in the workplace. It was discovered that one in three people said they and others in their department would discriminate against conservatives in faculty hiring, would be less likely to favor conservative grant applications and journal submissions (one in four), and would be less likely to invite conservative colleagues to participate in a symposium (one in six).
Moreover, a recent examination of 306 politically relevant abstracts from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology indicated that liberals are somewhat more favorably defined than conservatives. In contrast, conservatives are more frequently the object of explanation or scapegoat than liberals (Hippel & Buss, 2017). The same study surveyed 335 members of the Society for Experimental Social Psychology (SESP). Less than 2% described themselves as conservative 
(Hippel & Buss, 2017)
.
Though the psychology academy and the high school setting are vastly different, the same principles of the consequences of groupthink can be applied. Because it is known that liberal people make up the majority, conservatives feel fear of expressing their opinions. Discrimination, however, must be eliminated since sociopolitical diversity is essential for academic research, education, and ethical professional practice. Recent research suggests that the assumptions underlying psychology's value system of promoting racial, ethnic, gender, or sexual orientation diversity-that doing so recognizes people's identities, alleviates discrimination, and has educational benefits-may be even more compelling in terms of sociopolitical ideas. For my study, specifically in the secondary educational environment, where people are developing opinions that shape their lives, fear of expressing opinions and opening conversations up harms the academic epistemology of the school. Thus, the basis of this study will be on discussing how groupthink manifests among Asian International youth. The study will test on more specific topics of political discussion (Abortion rights, Gun control, Capital punishment) to obtain more nuanced possibilities of opinions that will, perhaps, test for symptoms of groupthink better.


Method
Groupthink is a reasonably new subject with relatively little quantitative research done in the field. The limited amount of empirical research on groupthink may be due to the need for proper tools to measure groupthink and its variables. The problem is that groupthink is difficult to comprehend and predict in advance without looking back. Despite the existence of the factors that lead to groupthink, and comparable communication methods to those used by groupthink groups, groupthink does not always happen. In other words, what often causes groupthink does not always result in it. The unfavorable consequences of groupthink are mostly due to chance. Nonetheless, to test an instrument that can reliably and accurately assess the variables associated with groupthink within an educational sphere would hopefully determine the scale at which groupthink is an issue.


Participants
The study was conducted to determine the existence of groupthink within a student learning environment. Thus, the participants were all high school students aged 15-18. Participants were briefed and given consent in a form sent before the experiment. Surveys were sent through teachers to their students who must have been above the age of 14 to participate in the experiment.


Descriptive Statistics
22 participants voluntarily participated in the experiment and completed a follow-up survey. Of those participants, all 22 were students split between 4 experimental groups, with a mean group size of 5.50 (SD = 0.577). No demographic information was collected on the subjects due to the research being a study on groupthink in the school environment rather than the actions or effects of a single race on the study. All groups met face-to-face in a conference room for the experiment.


Research Design and Measures
The procedure design was a mixed method with an experiment, followed by a survey and a one-on-one interview with one person from each experimental group. To begin, an initial consent and briefing survey was sent to teachers to administer to their students. Once enough subjects had consented to the experiment, The experiment had all participants were placed in a study room and told to discuss the following topics in 5-minute intervals and come to a consensus: gun control, abortion rights, and capital punishment. The following interviews allowed for more niche answers to the research question: "Does groupthink exist within an international educational community?"
The survey items were taken from a study conducted directly for groupthink testing 
(Baptist, 2015)
. The survey included eight scales measuring groupthink: Highly Cohesive, Promotional 
Leadership, Conformity, Concurrence Seeking, Anxiety, Collective Efficacy, Hidden Profiles, and Trust.
 The survey was arranged on a Google Form, with each question following a 5-point Likert scale. It asked subjects to indicate their agreement with each question about the prior experiment, from 1(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). For the specific environment of an educational structure, only six of the total eight scales were used 
(Highly Cohesive, Conformity, Concurrence Seeking, Anxiety, Collective Efficacy, and Trust)
. This was done because, within a school environment, there is no designated leader within the group to lead the ideas to have groupthink occur. Similarly, it does not make sense for a participant to withhold information from the group for unassociated reasons other than groupthink. Thus, Hidden Profiles was removed.
To define each of the factors, Highly Cohesive refers to the extent of how close the group was in their way of thinking and beliefs said aloud (although these ideas could contradict the actual beliefs of the subjects. Conformity refers to the extent to which the participants felt they had to censor themselves in the conversation instead of speaking their minds. Concurrence Seeking refers to the extent to which the group Tries to reach a consensus without viewing other viewpoints to keep the group together. Anxiety as a variable seeks to question whether or not a time constraint or stress from group factors could cause groupthink. Collective Efficacy refers to how the group worked together towards a common goal (the objective of consensus) and to what extent new ideas were involved. Lastly, Trust was another two-way variable that measured whether or not there was too much or too little trust in the group. This could be in support between subjects or the group's trust being too strong to bring up opposing ideas.
The study asked participants how often they thought their group had engaged in groupthink, which was the first criterion variable. With questions that have a high Factor Coefficient (listed below), they helped indicate to what extent that factor of groupthink existed within the group setting.


Results
The 22 responses from 32 survey items were processed and put into the tables below. Along with the mean and standard deviation of each item, the Factor Coefficient (FC) used to determine the validity of each item was included 
(Baptist, 2015)
. The underlined items indicate a factor coefficient of 0.600 or higher, meaning that the survey item had a high correlation to the related survey category. On the other hand, the low scores (not underlined) correlate to the opposite survey category for each entry. Both sides of the scale were measured to measure the constraints of the different variables.  Free thinking was not visible in the group experiments by the low mean value, and, like this, conformity was highly observed. This adds more evidence to answer the research question that groupthink exists within the observed community. Again, this is a variable with question two composite variables defining its perimeters: the underlined factors were related to Mindguarding, and the others correlated to Reservation higher than those they were previously, meaning that participants had a large inclination to hide the ideas they had in order to preserve group cohesion. The items listed for Reservation Encouragement all scored a mean of <0.240. Once again, this is more drastic than the previous measures, highlighting the importance of being comfortable within the group mattering more than the actual discussion being held. These items display the extent of groupthink within the culture, but more data should be collected. The issue of Anxiety within the group discussion did not seem to pose an issue and contribute to groupthink behavior. All positive items correlating to Anxiety (except one) scored <2.30. This means that anxiety did not affect the participants' thinking and free speech. This could be due to the time constraint for each subject being five minutes to conclude one topic.  erratically. This could be due to the specific wording of the survey items. While the items relating to the group's environment being trusting were measured highly >3.90, the items about how free the space was to express ideas related to trust openly were rated lower <2.15. Meanwhile, the survey items set to test the groupthink variables measured high >3.90.


Discussion
Overall, the data seems to support that groupthink largely exists within an international educational community among students. Within the data, all the measures besides Anxiety seemed to have a moderate to severe effect on the actions of the experimental groups. Again, the Anxiety variable seems not to have affected the groups due to the broader time constraint of 5 minutes given for each subject.
Trust also seemed to be a confounding variable as well. When taking a closer look at the survey items in particular, it can be seen that the subjects felt that the environment was "supportive" and maybe even to the point that there was too much trust and support within the group for people to bring up new ideas that could break the trusting culture.
The conclusions found by the study are also supported by the post-experiment interviews run within each group to obtain more niche answers to the questions the study presents. When asked if and why groupthink exists within the study's educational environment, one student said: "Yeah, I think it does exist… I think because of the culture of TAS, the desire for people to fit in and to be liked. Because of this, people do not want to give "hot takes" so that they do not get ridiculed." The international culture of the study area could also be a factor in the existence of groupthink. Another student asserted that "the culture is to be quiet and not answer questions because they fear being wrong or not aligning with TAS beliefs and ethics… it exists. Why it happens is a combination of things. One of them is the fear of getting things wrong and being embarrassed in front of other people, and also, people kind of get used to it". It seems now that the issue of groupthink is most definitely present within the space of the study, but that question then turns to how it can be resolved.
Interviewed participants were asked such a question and responded: "Solving this issue is possible but will be a challenge. Teachers already attempt to fix this by encouraging respectful listening and participation in group discussions. This still does not work because of the culture everyone is used to.
If students are aware of the fact that they are influenced by groupthink, then maybe they can take steps to combat it". All interviewees spoke somewhat along the lines that the change in the groupthink culture comes from the teachers and students working together to open up discussion within and outside the classrooms.


Suggestions for Future Research and Conclusions
The results follow the trend that groupthink is a difficult item to measure. The 8 variables that
Baptist presents in his paper, even admitted by himself, can not completely accurately measure groupthink (2015). My study aimed to test these variables in an environment that had previously been not excluded from groupthink research. Results lined up with the research of past papers, finding that there is a moderate to strong presence of groupthink in educational environments. The cultural aspect of the study also seemed to have an effect on the results. The study done by Mattie Flowers, with a predominantly American sample, had seen less defined results for groupthink 
(1977)
.
The study above should be replicated at a much larger scale. The small sample size and the lack of participant diversity limited the study. Thus, future research would benefit from working within different ethnic and cultural communities to see if the idea of groupthink is uniform or variable worldwide. As this area of study progresses, it remains crucial to identify the factors that contribute to groupthink and develop strategies to mitigate it. Groupthink poses a genuine and prevalent risk in various everyday group settings. Therefore, comprehending the root causes of groupthink and discovering effective prevention methods is paramount. By enhancing one's ability to navigate these factors within a group, individuals can increase their satisfaction, productivity, and overall enjoyment of their group involvement.
The measures of the study were not perfect either. From the collected quantitative data, only rash qualitative remarks were able to be derived. A way to complicate and justify the quantitative data would be useful in creating a truly sound measure to see if groupthink exists. Furthermore, future research could record demographic, sex, and other variable information to determine if any other factors contribute to groupthink. This study only seeks to determine whether or not groupthink exists in a specific environment. The study should also be done in a longitudinal manner, in which it measures the propensity of groupthink over time to see how the subject evolves with age and different social groups. Measures of the causes and lasting effects of groupthink would have to come in another study.

Collective Efficacy seemed to be largely small: subjects did not work together well to reach a decisive conclusion. Rather than be a positive variable for groupthink, Collective Efficacy could serve as a recognition of the disjunct of the collection due to the problems brought on by groupthink. This means that rather than groupthink causing the subjects to work together, groupthink caused people to think less. The above was demonstrated by the mean score of the survey items being >2.27.
