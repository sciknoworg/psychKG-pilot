You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

INTRODUCTION
Human actions exhibit a "freedom from immediacy" 
(Shadlen & Gold, 2004)
, which refers to the ability to organise behaviour so it is not driven merely by current stimulation. Thus, while simpler actions such as reflexes may be the direct result of external stimulus triggers, voluntary actions imply inhibiting such influences. While inhibition of prepotent responses has been widely studied in psychology 
(Mischel & Baker, 1975;
Stroop, 1935)
, there has been little consideration of the subjective aspects of stimulus-independence, freedom of choice and autonomy of voluntary action. Here, we focussed on the subjective experience of acting independently of stimulation. We investigated whether the subjective experience of freedom of choice accurately reflected participants' ability to silence incoming information and to make decisions unaffected by the stimulus environment.
The ability to direct attention towards some items in our sensory field and to ignore others has been studied extensively 
(Cowan & Morey, 2006;
Driver, 2001;
He, Cavanagh, & Intriligator, 1996;
Treisman & Gelade, 1980)
. Active suppression of irrelevant information contributes to action-selection processes 
(Caputo & Guerra, 1998)
. However, attentional filtering is imperfect: when conflicting information requires that some visual inputs are ignored, response time increases and accuracy decreases 
(Botvinick, Nystrom, Fissell, Carter, & Cohen, 1999;
Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974;
Lu & Proctor, 1995;
Munoz & Everling, 2004;
Stroop, 1935)
. Conflict monitoring models have successfully described the processes whereby effortful cognitive control allows detachment from part of the incoming sensory information. It remains controversial however whether detachment involves simply filtering out unwanted information, or actively suppressing it 
(Weldon et al., 2013)
. Thus, limited attentional resources may limit the ability to resist unwanted influences on decision processes, and to decide independently of such influences.
The effect of irrelevant and distracting information on our decisions has mostly been studied with perceptual decision-making tasks. Only a handful of studies have tested whether and how these effects extend to "free" choice tasks 
(Charles & Haggard, 2019;
Schlaghecken & Eimer, 2004;
Sidarus & Haggard, 2016)
, in which participants decide for themselves how to respond. In a recent paper, we addressed this question 
(Charles & Haggard, 2019)
 by asking participants to perform a random-dot-motion discrimination task in which dot motion was either predominantly unidirectional, prompting a response consistent with the dominant motion direction, or predominantly bidirectional, prompting a free choice of how to respond. We found that when participants chose 'freely', their responses were in fact biased by small, random fluctuations in the motion energy of the visual display shown on screen. This suggests that participants relied on this external information to break the symmetry between responses.
Interestingly, participants remained unaware of this influence of sensory information on their "free" choices, since subjective ratings of freedom of choice did not accurately track the objective freedom measured as the degree to which responses were independent of stimulus energy.
Here, we investigated the subjective sense of freedom directly, by testing whether people can voluntarily detach from sensory influences, and whether people have accurate insight into the success of their attempts to detach. Twenty-two participants completed a random-dot motion discrimination task where the instructions on how to respond to the dots changed from trial to trial. Subjects were instructed on each trial to either adhere to the stimulus by responding in the direction congruent to the direction of dot motion, to oppose it by responding incongruently, or to detach from it and make a free choice independent of on the information on the screen. After each response, participants judged the extent to which their responses were independent of, or constrained by, the dot-motion stimulus. We found a modest ability to detach from sensory information, coupled with a strong tendency to feel freer when opposing stimulus information than when adhering to it.


METHOD


PARTICIPANTS
Twenty-two healthy participants (9 males; mean age of 22.59 years, range of 19-24 years) took part in the present study having issued informed consent. This study was on data powered to achieve a 95% chance of detecting a biasing influence of dot-motion on free choices (d = 0.74 from 
Charles and Haggard, 2020)
 at an alpha of .05. Participants were recruited via the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience participant pool, and all were compensated for their time. The study was approved by the University College London Department of Psychology Ethics Committee.


STIMULI
Stimuli were presented on a computer monitor with a refresh rate of 60Hz and appeared at a 5°-diameter aperture centred at the fixation point. Stimuli were random-dot-kinematograms (RDM) of 7 dots moving consistently leftward or rightward (produced in psychtoolbox). The dots were shown for a single frame before being replotted three frames later. When replotted, a subset of the dots were offset from their previous location to produce apparently coherent motion in one direction (to the right or to the left), whilst others where offset and plotted randomly (see 
Roitman & Shadlen, 2002)
. To ensure a consistent level of difficulty over all participants, motion coherence (i.e., the proportion of dots moving coherently relative to those replotted randomly) was determined during an initial training session using a preliminary 2down-1-up staircase procedure 
(Levitt, 1971
, see Methods AA) and was then fixed for the duration of the experiment.
At one of three time-points during RDM presentation, the dots in the display changed colour. RDM stimuli were displayed for a total of 2500ms (or 150 frames at 60 Hz), and the colour change occurred randomly at either 650ms (Early), 1250ms (Mid), or 1900ms (Late). Dots were initially presented as white on a black background, and could then change to be red, green, or blue, these three colours being matched for luminance and contrast.


PROCEDURE & DESIGN


Staircase
The experiment started with an initial training block of trials in which a 2-down-1-up staircase procedure 
(Levitt, 1971
) was implemented, in order to find the level of motion coherence at which participants could perform at an accuracy level of 70.7%. Participants were instructed to respond if the motion was directed to the left or to the right. The coherence of the RDK stimulus started at a value of 40%, with an initial step size of 6%. The step-size was then halved every 2n runs until it reached a minimum value of 1.5%. The appropriate coherence level was computed by calculating the mean coherence over the final 40 trials of the block, and this coherence level was then set for the remainder of the experiment. For further detail, see supplementary materials.


Main Experiment
The main experiment consisted of 16 blocks of 63 trials. Participants performed the whole experiment in two sessions of 1.5hr, either on the same day, or on consecutive days. Each 
Figure 1
 -Experimental protocol. After an initial fixation period a dot-motion stimulus was displayed in the centre of the screen for 2500ms with a predominant direction of motion either to the left or to the right. After a randomised variable delay (600ms, 1250ms or 1900ms), the dots changed color, indicating the response mode required. Participants could be asked to make a response congruent with the direction of the motion (adhere), to make a response incongruent with the direction of dotmotion (oppose), or to make a free choice whilst trying not to be influenced by the stimulus (detach).
Participants had 1500ms to make a response following stimulus presentation. At the end of each trial, participants were required to rate their subjective freedom of choice, indicating whether they felt their choice was guided entirely by what they saw on the screen or whether they felt they decided independently how to act. trial started with a fixation cross presented at the centre of the screen for 900ms. The cross was then replaced by the RDM stimulus with dot-motion stimulus moving either to the left or to the right at random. At some point during the stimulus presentation, the dots changed colour. The colour provided instruction on how to respond to the stimulus on that trial. On 
1
adhere trials, participants were to respond with the side congruent with the direction of the motion they perceived in the stimulus; on (2) oppose trials, participants were to respond with the opposite side than the perceived motion direction; on (3) detach trials, participants were to pick freely one button to press, their response choice trying not to be influenced by the direction of the dot motion. Instructions were randomised across trials. The colour change could occur at one of three randomised timings: early (600ms), mid-way through (1250ms), or late (1900ms). The colours used to specify the instructions were counterbalanced across participants (i.e. red, green, and blue cycled through instructing adherence, opposition, or detachment for successive participants). A second fixation cross appeared for 1500ms after the stimulus indicating time to respond. Participants were instructed to respond as accurately and as quickly as possible after stimulus presentation had ended. Following the response, participants were required to estimate how much their response choice was guided by the dotmotion, reporting their subjective experience of being more or less detached from the stimulus.
To do so, a scale was presented for 3000ms and participants could move the slider with the ',<' and '.>' keys to reflect how they felt about their response. One end of the scale indicated absolute independence of the stimulus ('I decided what to do myself, completely independently of what I saw on the screen"), while the other indicated complete dependent on the stimulus ("My response was determined entirely by what I saw on the screen") (due to an error in the coding of the experiment, wording was slightly different for different participants, see supplementary materials for details). Participants were instructed to use the entire range of the scale rather than only the extreme values and that their response should be guided by how they came up with their response on that given trials rather than the instruction on that trial. The side of the scale indicating freedom/constraint was counterbalanced to the left/right over participants. Therefore, our design was a 2x3x3 within-subjects design with factors dot-motion direction x instruction x onset, with 864 total trials of interest over 16 blocks. In each block, nine further "catch trials" were randomly interleaved. In these, movement coherence was increased to 65%, making the identification of the correct dot-motion direction a trivial task. Their purpose was to ensure that participants could accurately follow instructions to adhere, oppose, or detach, as given by their respective colour changes.


ANALYSIS


Measures of objective and subjective freedom of choice
Our experiment was designed to analyse both objective freedom of choice (i.e. the degree to which participants were truly able to decide independently of the stimulus) and subjective freedom of choice (i.e. the degree to which participants felt they were able to act freely of any influence by the stimulus). Responses could be of two possible types: (1) pro-responses were those congruent to the dominant dot-motion direction for a given trial, and (2) anti-responses were those incongruent to the dominant dot-motion direction. Our analyses of subjective freedom of choice involved an analysis of self-reported estimates of freedom according to instruction, instruction onset time, and response type (all of which are within-subject factors).
Our analyses of objective freedom of choice centred on two dependent measures: (1) the proportion of responses made congruent to motion direction for each instruction, and (2) our measure of the association between different response types and stimulus strength (see below). Our two objective measures of freedom of choice were analysed according to the same factors (instruction, onset time, and response type). Regressions were performed to test whether differences in subjective freedom of choice could be explained by differences in objective performance (i.e. in the proportion of motion congruence, in response time, and in reverse correlated motion energy).


Motion energy analysis
We intended to investigate the correspondence between the strength of the information present in the stimulus and subsequent responses, providing an objective measure of freedom of choice. To do this, we first applied spatiotemporal motion filters to dot position over time to compute motion energy time-courses for each trial 
(Adelson & Bergen, 1985;
Kiani, Hanks, & Shadlen, 2008)
. This process produced a 140-sample time-course of motion energy (having removed 28 initial/final samples affected by the ramping of the motion energy filter) where positive values corresponds to rightward motion. These values were collapsed across trials and across time, producing motion energy distributions as seen in 
Figure 2A
. Leftward trials were sign-flipped, so that all values would represent the magnitude of motion energy in favour of the dominant motion direction (with negative values representing the magnitude of motion energy in opposition to the dominant motion direction, see 
Figure 2B
). These values were then expressed as z-scores using the overall mean and standard deviation of the distribution, ensuring even and comparable amplitudes across participants (see 
Figure 2C
). Finally, we reverse correlated these normalised distributions according to response type ( 
Figure 2D
), sorting individual samples of motion energy according to whether they were followed by a pro-(congruent with the stimulus direction) or an anti-(incongruent with stimulus direction) response. From these reverse correlated motion energy distributions, we could compute the mean motion energies associated with pro-and anti-responses. The reverse correlated motion-energy values were then averaged separately for each condition and each participant and analysed with repeated measure analysis of variance (rANOVA) and paired t tests (two-tailed, unless specified otherwise) in R. 


RESULTS


ACCURACY & RESPONSE MODE UNDER DETACHMENT
We first inspected participants' ability to follow and complete the task for each instruction.
When asked to adhere to or oppose dot motion, participants generally responded correctly. 
Figure 3
 shows 67.74% (SD = 6.36) of congruent responses on adhere trials, and 34.00% (SD = 8.18%) on oppose trials. These values are predicted from the staircase procedure used to set individual coherence levels. We found no significant difference in accuracy between these two instructed conditions ( (1, 21) = 4.01, = .058, G 2 = 0.015). We did however find a main effect of instruction onset time ( (2, 42) = 6.91, = .003, G 2 = 0.034); accuracy dropped when instruction came late relative to both early ( 
21
  We next considered participants' responses when they were instructed to detach from the stimulus. Across all participants, there was no bias to respond right or left ( 
21
 suggesting that participants had some ability to detach from the stimulus.


SUBJECTIVE FREEDOM OF CHOICE
Next, we considered participants' subjective experience of freedom of choice, based on participants' estimates of stimulus-independence after each trial. Unsurprisingly, subjective freedom of choice was higher for detach than for instructed trials (main effect of instruction,
(2, 42) = 66.31, < .001, G 2 = 0.703; detach > adhere, (21) = 9.00, < .001, = 2.60;
detach > oppose, (21) = 7.45, < .001, = 1.98); people felt freer when allowed to decide freely what to respond than when instructed to respond by adhering or opposing dot-motion.
Within the instructed trials (adhere and oppose), we found significant effects of instructions on subjective reports of freedom of choice. Participants reported an increased subjective sense of freedom on oppose trials than on adhere trials ( (21) = 4.83, < .001, = 0.92). This effect could not be explained by differences in proportion of correct choices between conditions, as no significant difference in accuracy was observed between the two conditions. A control analysis regressing differences in reported subjective freedom of choice between adhere and oppose trials on differences in accuracy and response time between these two instructions confirmed that the increased sense of freedom when opposing was still present after accounting for differences in performance between the two conditions ( instruction = 5.48, (19) = 1.45, = .002 ). However, accuracy was related to subjective freedom of choicewe observed an interaction between response type and instruction ( (2, 42) = 13.75, < .001, G 2 = 0.022), revealing a tendency to report greater freedom for incorrect responses (adhere-incorrect > adhere-correct, (21) = 4.92, < .001, = 1.13 ;
oppose-incorrect > oppose-correct, (21) = 3.68, = .001, = 0.77 ). This might arise because incorrect responses are likely to be associated with reduced attention to the stimulus display. No effect of instruction timing was observed on subjective freedom of choice ratings ( (2, 42) = 1.71, = .193).
We then focussed on the Detach condition. We found that within detach trials, participants experienced greater freedom for anti-responses than pro-responses ( (21) = 2.54, = .019, = 0.71). The response was freely chosen in both of these cases, but where the choice happened to oppose dot motion, the subjective sense of freedom of choice was greater. This effect was not due to anti-responses having longer reaction times, as RT was In sum, we found a strong and general tendency to associate opposition with a greater sense of freedom; responses on oppose trials were judged to be freer than responses on adhere trials, and participants felt freer on those detach trials where their responses opposed the dotmotion, rather than adhering to it.


CORRELATION BETWEEN SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE FREEDOM OF CHOICE
Our results suggested that our participants tended to subjectively mistake opposition for detachment. We tested whether the frequency of responses that adhered to or opposed dot motion on detach trials for each individual participant could explain differences in subjective judgments of freedom for these two types of responses.
To test this we computed Pearson correlation coefficients between the difference in selfreported freedom of choice for motion-congruent and motion-incongruent responses and the difference in the proportion of motion congruent responses and motion incongruent responses in the detach condition ( 
Figure 7)
. Interestingly, we observed a significant positive correlation between the difference in subjective freedom reported for motion congruent and motionincongruent responses and the bias towards motion congruent responses ( = 0.42, = .049).
Participants who made more congruent responses tended to report greater freedom when making an incongruent response. This suggests that breaking from a habitual mode of response was associated with increased freedom. Importantly however, we observed that even when regressing out the effect of habit on response, there was still a significant increase in freedom of choice associated with opposing the stimulus, as demonstrated by a positive intercept in the regression ( (20) = −2.81, = .011). This confirmed that there was an intrinsic link between opposition and freedom that could not be solely explained by the fact that opposition was rarer than adherence.


INFLUENCE OF SIGNAL STRENGTH ON RESPONSE CHOICE
We found that although our participants on the whole held no bias for opposing or adhering to the stimulus when required to detach, they associated a greater sense of freedom with responses that opposed the information shown on screen. In a final set of analysis, we further explored differences between pro-and anti-responses, with the aim of understanding what influenced response choice when required to detach. To do this, we investigated how signal strength impacted participants' tendency to adhere to or oppose the stimulus. Our stimuli involved continuous fluctuations of motion energy. We could therefore use reverse correlation analysis to determine the strength of the motion energy information present in the stimulus that preceded pro-vs anti-responses. The analysis pipeline used to generate this measure can be seen on 
Figure 2
 and is described in the associated methods section.
Unsurprisingly, in instructed trials, correct responses (pro-responses on adhere trials, and anti-responses on oppose trials) were associated with signal strengths above the global stimulus mean. Conversely, incorrect responses were associated with signal strengths below the normalised mean in both conditions (interaction between instruction and response type,
(1, 21) = 65.18, < .001, G 2 = 0.167; adhere-correct > adhere-incorrect, (21) = 4.69, <
.001, = 0.82; oppose-correct > oppose-incorrect, (21) = 6.10, < .001, = 1.12). These results confirm that trial-by-trial fluctuations in stimulus strength did, as expected, influence response accuracy in instructed trials. Note that no effect of instruction timing was observed ( (2, 42) = 0.07, = .934).
We then considered how signal strength influenced response choice in detach trials.
Surprisingly, we observed that the relationship between signal strength and response type for those trials qualitatively resembled that seen in the oppose condition. That is, anti-response trials had high mean signal strengths, while pro-response trials had lower and more broadly distributed mean signal strengths. However, this difference showed only a trend towards significance: (1, 21) = 3.25, = .086). This hints at a tendency to, when required to detach, oppose perceptual signals that are particularly strong and salient and, conversely, adhere to signals of weaker strength, though this effect requires confirmation. 


DISCUSSION
In the present study, we investigated the ability to detach from incoming sensory information and make choices free of influence. We asked participants to respond to a dot motion stimulus by making a response congruent to the direction of dot-motion (adhere), in opposition to the direction of dot-motion (oppose), or to make a response independent of the stimulus by detaching from the information presented to them (detach). By then asking for subjective ratings of freedom of choice, we could estimate not only participants' objective ability to resist immediate suggestion, but also their ability to introspect their success in doing so. We found a strong and general tendency to experience a greater sense of freedom when opposing sensory information than when adhering to it, whether opposition was instructed or was the result of the participant's own choice when they were to detach from the stimulus.
Only a few experimental studies have investigated the origins of subjective sense of freedom 
(Charles & Haggard, 2019;
Filevich et al., 2013)
, despite its major, even constitutive, role in individual mental life. The idea that apparently autonomous decisions are influenced by many subtle factors has been widespread in modern psychology 
(Packard, 1957;
Sunstein, 2015;
Wilkinson, 2013)
, but subjective aspects of such influence have been neglected. In a previous study 
(Charles & Haggard, 2019)
, we found that when instructed to make a free choice, participants' decisions tended to follow fluctuations in the stimulus, but that participants reported higher subjective freedom when their responses opposed the direction of dot-motion.
One interpretation of these findings is that inhibition of a prepotent stimulus-response association in favour of a less habitual response boosts the experience of freedom. The results of the present study replicate and extend these findings. We here introduced adhere, oppose, and detach conditions that established two stimulus-response mappings (of equal strength)
and allowed us to test the subjective and objective ability to detach from the stimulus and the established modes of response. We found a general tendency to feel freer when opposing the stimulus than when adhering to it. This was true both when opposition was instructed (on oppose trials) and self-generated (on detach trials). The bias to feel freer when opposing was not simply due to less frequent choices feeling more free; even after accounting for effects of response frequency within the detach condition, we still found increased subjective freedom for responses that opposed dot-motion compared to those that followed it. It may be the case that adherence is in some sense a default mode of response to the world and inhibiting our tendency to follow instruction (by opposing it) boosts our sense of freedom. There may therefore be an intrinsic relationship between response inhibition and the subjective experience of freedom, consistent with the long-held idea that inhibition is central to the experience of voluntary control 
(Mayr, 2004)
.
We also found tentative evidence to support the idea that our subjects mistook opposition for detachment when deciding how to act in the detach condition. Our investigation of how participants responded to signals of different strengths revealed that where participants were required to detach, they tended to oppose stronger signals and adhere to weaker signals.
There are two possible interpretation of this influence of stimulus strength on free choice. First, participants may discard sensory information from decision-making processes, but particularly strong signals may nevertheless leak into decision making and influence choice. This would be consistent with the directed forgetting literature 
(Anderson & Hanslmayr, 2014;
Anderson et al., 2004;
Yang, Lei, & Anderson, 2016)
 where the erasure of information from memory is more efficient for weak compared to stronger content. Alternatively, people may be unable to discard sensory information at all and their response strategy when instructed to detach might be slightly biased towards opposition. Being unable to discard sensory information would extend priming of free choice responses 
(Eimer & Schlaghecken, 2003;
Parkinson & Haggard, 2014
) by subliminally presented information to include biasing by supraliminal sensory information. However, we found no evidence supporting simple methods of shifting response strategies on detach trials and positing more complex methods seems unparsimonious. We therefore suggest that people have some ability to detach from incoming sensory information, though their success in doing so may depend on strength of incoming information 
(Koizumi, Maniscalco, & Lau, 2015)
. Since the trend to oppose when required to detach was weak in our data, further research will be required to verify these effects.
We were interested here not only in subjective and objective freedom alone, but in the degree to which our subjective experience of freedom accurately tracks our objective ability to be free. Previous research suggests that people may have relatively poor insight into the extent to which their decisions have been influenced by external information 
(Charles & Haggard, 2019)
. For example, subliminal primes influence behaviour, but also increase the subjective sense of control over one's actions 
(Wenke, Fleming, & Haggard, 2010)
. We observed that the sense of freedom of choice was influenced by the frequency of a particular response, with the inhibition of frequent responses being associated with a boosted sense of freedom. This suggests that we are able to track our own habits, and that our subjective experience of freedom is in part based on our ability to inhibit and be free of those habits. This would then mean that our experience of freedom is not some function of our environment alone, but that it is given by how we deal with our habitual responses to input. Feeling that we are free of influence depends upon whether acting free of influence requires us to inhibit some dominant mapping of stimulus to action. This is not necessarily illusory in a general sense, though deriving feelings of freedom from inhibition can lead to illusory boosts in freedom as demonstrated by the boosted freedom we found when instructing participants to oppose dotmotion. Follow-up studies should help clarify what form these stimulus-response mappings take, how and why their inhibition boosts our sense of freedom, and how this can lead to metacognitive illusions of freedom of choice.
More generally, further research is needed to achieve a more precise understanding of how free choices are made and to provide a more mechanistic description of the processes involved that might explain the possible preference for opposition when attempting to detach from influence. Conflict monitoring models 
(Yeung, Botvinick, & Cohen, 2004)
 describe how irrelevant information is silenced by attentional processes in favour of decision-relevant information. However, in those models, choice is still dictated by external evidence rather than being internally generated as here. Models of evidence accumulation 
(Mulder, van Maanen, & Forstmann, 2014)
 may provide a stronger theoretical framework to describe the present task. Indeed, some authors have proposed that accumulation of internal neural noise could be an effective way to model free choices, providing a mechanism for breaking the symmetry between options and for deciding when and how to act in the absence of external information 
(Schurger, Sitt, & Dehaene, 2012)
. Such models could potentially be extended to capture how successfully agents discard information they wish to ignore and may speak to any real tendency to oppose information we mean to discard. This will require meaningful response time data, which the present task design precluded.
Being able to detach from our immediate environments is a centrally important feature of human mental lifein order to exercise voluntary agency, we must be able to ignore triggers to act. Habitual opposition is commonly seen in adolescent behaviour 
(Laursen & Collins, 1994)
, and this may be seen as an affirmation of independence and autonomy in light of our findings. More broadly, it is important to understand how and why people feel that they are making free and independent decisions in some situations but not in others, understanding the accuracy of those judgment on their own freedom of choice. In a world filled with evermore subtle attempts at influence and coercion 
(Sunstein, 2017;
Wilkinson, 2013)
, it is more vital than ever that we understand how we detach from unhelpful or unwanted information and whether we are aware of when we fail to act truly autonomously.

Analysis pipeline for motion energy data. To obtain an objective measure of freedom of choice, we reverse correlated the strength of the signal depicted, ie motion energy, to the response choice. Computing the motion energy from dot coordinates for each trial allowed us to produce two motion energy distributions, one corresponding to left-moving dot-motion stimuli, and one right-moving dot-motion stimuli (A). We then flipped the sign of the negatively-centred distribution resulting in a single motion energy distribution where more positive values represent stronger motion energy in favour of the dominant motion direction, and more negative values represent stronger motion energy in opposition to the dominant motion direction (B). These sign-flipped distributions were then normalised (C), and individual motion energy values were then sorted according to whether they were followed by a pro-(congruent with dominant motion direction) or antiresponse (incongruent with dominant motion direction).

A significant effect of instruction time was also observed ( (2, 42) = 150.77, < .001, G 2 = 0.089); participants responded faster to later instructions (see Supplementary Material for more details).

Analysis of the number of motion-congruent responses made by each participant found no deviation from the chance level of .5 (for all 22 Bonferronicorrected Chi-squared tests against expected frequencies of .5, none reached significance),
