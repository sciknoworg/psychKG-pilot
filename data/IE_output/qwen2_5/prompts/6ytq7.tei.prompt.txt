You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Amidst concerns over democratic backsliding and political violence, an emerging body of scholarship suggests some individuals express a desire to 'watch the world burn' 
(Arceneaux et al. 2021, 2)
. According to this literature, those who perceive themselves as losing out from society and the political system have a stronger 'mindset to gain status' 
(Petersen, Osmundsen and
Arceneaux 2023, 1489)
, and are more willing to engage in potentially destructive behaviors, independent of political orientation and beliefs 
(Farhart et al. 2023;
Landry, Druckman and Willer 2024;
Petersen, Osmundsen and Arceneaux 2023
).
The 'Need for Chaos,' as it is so deemed, seemingly captures much of the discontent apparent in modern politics (see, e.g., 
Thompson 2024)
, underscoring the need to further understand those seeking to 'burn it all down' 
(Petersen, Osmundsen and
Arceneaux 2023, 1489
).
Yet, we do not know whether the expressed willingness to engage in these potentially destructive acts, as measured in previous studies on Need for Chaos, translates into actual behavior 
(Farhart et al. 2023;
Petersen, Osmundsen and Arceneaux 2023)
. Studies have also yet to test whether Need for Chaos shapes real-world contexts of decision making, such that we can better understand the potential motivations behind, and limits of, one's desire to 'burn it all down' 
(Petersen, Osmundsen and Arceneaux 2023;
1489)
. Previous evidence suggests higher Need for Chaos is shared by 'a divergent set of malcontents,' not all of whom endorse violence or 'want destruction for the sake of destruction' 
(Arceneaux et al. 2021, 1;
14)
. Thus, in this paper, we ask whether this 'mindset to gain' 
(Petersen, Osmundsen and
Arceneaux 2023, 1489)
 influences decision making about salient political events-specifically, whether Need for Chaos is associated with risky decision making, depending on how choices are framed.
Perhaps the most widely accepted and validated explanation for decision making under risk, Prospect Theory emphasizes that although most people are generally risk-averse, losses 'loom larger' than gains 
(Tversky and Kahneman 1981, 456)
. In turn, people of-ten reverse preferences for objectively equivalent options, such that they are risk-averse towards choices framed as prospective gains but risk-seeking towards choices framed as prospective losses 
(Kahneman and Tversky 1979;
Tversky and Kahneman 1981)
. However, contextual and individual differences in how people perceive gains and losses can moderate framing effects 
(Fitz et al. 2024;
Chong and Druckman 2007;
Kahneman and Tversky 1979;
Slovic et al. 2004;
Tversky and Kahneman 1981)
, such that certain individuals are risk-seeking towards prospective gains but risk-averse towards prospective losses (Tversky and 
Kahneman 1992)
. As such, we argue that whether individuals higher in Need for Chaos perceive themselves as having 'more to gain' or 'less to lose' depends on how consequences are framed, and that it may be choices framed as gains, rather than losses, that prompt their risky choices.
Using a framing experiment based on the fourfold pattern of decision making elucidated by Prospect Theory 
(Tversky and Kahneman 1981;
1992)
, we test whether Need for Chaos-a validated measure of one's discontent with society and the political system, independent of political orientation and beliefs 
(Farhart et al. 2023;
Petersen, Osmund-
sen and Arceneaux 2023)-moderates decision making as a result of gain and loss frames.
Results from two studies of US adults (N = 2,813; N = 3,094), fielded on the heels of salient funding negotiations in the US Congress in 2023, suggest that while most respondents are risk-averse toward potential gains but risk-seeking toward potential losses, those with higher Need for Chaos are risk-seeking toward potential gains but risk-averse toward potential losses. Our findings suggest that people who perceive themselves as having already lost out from society and the political system, like those higher in Need for Chaos, may respond differently to gain and loss frames, and have important implications for how strategic messaging influences political attitudes and behavior.


Need for Chaos and Decision Making Under Risk
According to extant literature, Need for Chaos is a combination of 'status-oriented personality traits' and 'contexts of marginalization' that captures those who are 'disaf-fected with current society and their (perceived) status in it' 
(Petersen, Osmundsen and Arceneaux 2023, 2, 6
; see also 
Arceneaux et al. 2021;
Farhart et al. 2023)
. Evidence thus far suggests Need for Chaos is positively associated with psychological traits like the dark triad and narcissism 
(Arceneaux et al. 2021)
 and greater willingness to engage in risky, potentially destructive behaviors, e.g., conflict-oriented decision making, illegal protests 
(Arceneaux et al. 2021)
, acts of partisan violence 
(Landry, Druckman and Willer 2024)
, and sharing conspiracy theories online 
(Farhart et al. 2023;
Petersen, Osmundsen, and Arceneaux 2023)
. These individuals express greater willingness to engage in these acts independent of partisanship 
(Petersen, Osmundsen and Arceneaux 2023)
, ideology, and beliefs 
(Farhart et al. 2023
), suggesting they might see the benefits of risky acts as outweighing the costs, and are willing to take risks to achieve an outcome better than, or at least as good as, their current state 
(Kahneman and Tversky 1992)
. Other research suggests that the mere 'image[] of winning' 
(Slovic et al. 2004, 316)
 can evoke a more affective mode of information processing, motivating riskier choices even when one knows the probability of a better outcome is low (see also 
Denes-Raj and Epstein 1994)
. Taken together, we would expect those who perceive themselves as already 'losing out' from society and the political system, like those higher in Need for Chaos, to have a more affective response towards the possibility of winning, and whose 'mindset to gain' 
(Petersen, Osmundsen and
Arceneaux 2023, 1489)
 would motivate risky decisions when choices are positively framed.
But what might we expect when those higher in Need for Chaos are tasked with choosing between options that emphasize losing, rather than winning? Prospect Theory contrasts with expected utility theory to emphasize the importance of gain and loss frames, positing that decision making reflects a two-stage process wherein choices are framed and individuals evaluate choices based on that frame 
(Tversky and Kahneman 1979;
1981)
. Because most people evaluate choices based on the direct consequences of an outcome but losses 'loom larger' than gains, people are often risk-averse towards prospective gains but risk-seeking towards prospective losses 
(Tversky and Kahneman 1981, 456)
.
Nevertheless, how one responds to framing can depend on context (e.g., incentives and the perceived probability of an event, see 
Laury and Holt 2005;
Tversky and Kahneman 1992)
 and the 'the norms, habits, and personal characteristics of the decision-maker' 
(Tversky and Kahneman 1992, 453)
. Therefore, it may be that the contexts and characteristics captured by Need for Chaos moderate framing effects.
On one hand, it may be reasonable to assume that Need for Chaos is related to one's tolerance for risk. Previous research found a positive relationship between risk tolerance and risky choices, suggesting those with a higher risk tolerance make riskier, but more coherent decisions, regardless of whether choices are framed as prospective gains or losses 
(Kam and Simas 2010)
. Other related work found a positive relationship between risk tolerance and political participation, suggesting more risk tolerant individuals might perceive greater returns from participating relative to the costs 
(Kam 2012)
. As such, we might also expect those higher in Need for Chaos to make riskier decisions, regardless of frame, if risk tolerance is related to their expressed willingness to reject the status quo.
On the other hand, it remains that Need for Chaos is a combination of traits and state, suggesting there may be limits to when they are willing to take greater risks. Consequences of risky behavior can 'carry sharp and strong affective meaning,' such that 'responses to uncertain situations. . . have an all or none characteristic that is sensitive to the possibility rather than the probability of strong positive or negative consequences, causing very small probabilities to carry great weight' 
(Slovic et al. 2004, 318, emphasis original;
 see also 
Loewenstein et al. 2001)
. According to Prospect Theory, greater sensitivity to possibility, rather than certainty, can yield framing effects inverse to those we would typically expect as a result of gain and loss frames. In this case, people may be risk-seeking, rather than risk-averse, towards prospective gains and risk-averse, rather than risk-seeking, towards prospective losses 
(Tversky and Kahneman 1992)
. We show this fourfold pattern of decision making in 
Table 1
. Further, just as the mere possibility, or 'image[] of winning' 
(Slovic et al. 2004, 316)
 can evoke a more affective mode of information processing and motivate riskier choices ). However, none of these scenarios provided respondents with information about the potential consequences of these acts, or took into account how they might evaluate these actions in the context of previous losses. Although presenting people with additional information about costs can elicit a 'sunk cost effect' 
(Tversky and Kahneman 1992;
457)
, those who account for previous losses may be more risk-averse when presented with information in a loss frame 
(Tversky and Kahneman 1981;
1992)
. Thus, in line with the 'possibility' effect outlined in Prospect Theory, we argue that a more plausible explanation is that those higher in Need for Chaos would view a decision in a loss-oriented frame as the choice between outcomes worse than, or equal to, their current state 
(Kahneman and Tversky 1992)
. In other words, we expect those higher in Need for Chaos to be more riskaverse, rather than risk-accepting, when presented with choices in the loss frame.
To reiterate, we argue that although Need for Chaos may be associated with risky decision making, whether they make risky decisions depends on how choices are framed.
Given their 'mindset to gain status' (Petersen, Osmundsen and Arceneaux 2023, 1489), we expect those higher in Need for Chaos to be more risk-seeking when deciding between options framed as prospective gains, but more risk-averse when deciding between options framed as prospective losses. As such, we hypothesize:
H1: Need for Chaos moderates framing effects, such that those higher in Need for Chaos will be less risk-averse (or more risk-seeking) when presented with choices framed as prospective gains (Gain Frame x Need for Chaos).
H2: Need for Chaos moderates framing effects, such that those higher in Need for Chaos will be less risk-seeking (or more risk-averse) when presented with choices framed as prospective losses (Loss Frame x Need for Chaos).


The 2023 Debt Ceiling and Government Shutdown Debates in US Congress
We test our hypotheses with data from two studies, both of which were fielded on the heels of two salient and contentious funding negotiations in the US Congress. Macroeconomic outcomes consistently rank high on Americans' list of policy priorities (see, e.g.,
Linde and Vis 2016) and economic perceptions are endogenous to politics 
(Enns, Kellstedt and McAvoy 2012)
. Therefore, while not every citizen is equally focused on the economy 
(Singer 2011)
, nor politics in general 
(Miller et al. 2023)
, frames focused on real-world, economic contexts of decision making should help us to assess whether disaffected, gainseeking individuals-like those higher in Need for Chaos-react differently to gain and loss frames. Testing our hypotheses using frames about salient political events is also important given Need for Chaos is partially driven by context (Petersen, Osmundsen and Arceneaux 2023) and one's belief that an event will occur can moderate risky choices 
(Laury and Holt 2005;
Tversky and Kahneman 1992
; see also Oliver 2018; 2021).
For context, we plot the salience of the 2023 US debt limit and government shutdown debates (over a one-year period, limited to searches in the US) using Google Trends data in 
Figure 1
. 2), suggesting these data have the potential to capture periods when these issues were of greater interest among the American public.  Congress has yet to vote on this deal and the economic impact remains unknown.
Imagine that raising the debt ceiling is expected to affect 6 million jobs and you are tasked with deciding between two alternative deals. Which would you choose? 
(Fitz et al. 2024, 3)
.
One half of Study 1 respondents were randomly assigned to receive choices framed as potential gains; the other half of respondents received choices framed as potential losses:
[Jobs Gained Frame] If Deal A is chosen, 2 million jobs will be preserved; If Deal B is chosen, there is a 1 3 probability that 6 million jobs will be preserved and 2 3 probability that no jobs will be preserved.
[Jobs Lost Frame] If Deal A is chosen, 4 million jobs will be lost; If Deal B is chosen, there is a 1 3 probability that no jobs will be lost and 2 3 probability that 6 million jobs will be lost. 
(Fitz et al. 2024, 3)
 Study 2: September 2023 Government Shutdown Debate in US Congress
We designed Study 2 after Study 1. 
1
 We launched Study 2 on 30 September 2023, shortly after Congress passed a funding bill to avert the government shutdown, and concluded Study 2 on 6 October 2023. We used Qualtrics to collect a sample of US adults (N = 3,100) via Prodege, another online survey provider used in similar research 
(Benoit et al. 2016;
Chen, Kteily and Ho 2018)
 that provides respondents with proprietary compensation in exchange for their survey participation and clients with survey samples that are balanced with the US Census (ESOMAR 2023).
As in Study 1, we first asked respondents a series of demographic questions. Respondents were then asked one attention check question; those who answered the question incorrectly were automatically eliminated from the survey. 2 Respondents then received a series of randomized questions on Need for Chaos, as well as the social, political, and psychological determinants included in Study 1. 3 Finally, all Study 2 respondents received the following prompt and were randomly assigned to receive choices framed as either 'jobs gained' or 'jobs lost.' While we adapted the prompt from Study 1 such that it referred to the September 2023 government shutdown debate in US Congress, respondents (who were randomly assigned to receive one of two choice frames) received 'jobs gained' or 'jobs lost'
1 We pre-registered our survey design and H2. Thus, H1 deviates from our pre-registration plan in the sense that we failed to include a hypothesis for respondents presented with the 'jobs gained' frame. Note that we will make our pre-registration plan, which we deposited in a permanent online repository prior to data collection, publicly available upon the acceptance of this manuscript. choices identical to those presented by 
Fitz et al. (2024, 3


):
As you know, the U.S. government's funding is set to expire on October 1, 2023, upon which the federal government is at risk of a shutdown. Congress has yet to reach a funding agreement that would avoid a federal government shutdown and the economic impact of a government shutdown remains unknown.
Imagine that a federal government shutdown is expected to affect 6 million jobs and you are tasked with deciding between two alternative deals. Which would you choose?
[Jobs Gained Frame] If Deal A is chosen, 2 million jobs will be preserved; If Deal B is chosen, there is a 1 3 probability that 6 million jobs will be preserved and 2 3 probability that no jobs will be preserved.
[Jobs Lost Frame] If Deal A is chosen, 4 million jobs will be lost; If Deal B is chosen, there is a 1 3 probability that no jobs will be lost and 2 3 probability that 6 million jobs will be lost. 4


What Is Need for Chaos?
Given the recency of existing research on Need for Chaos, it is important to take a closer examination of this measure and its relationship with other covariates before proceeding to our main results. As shown in 
Table 2
, and consistent with extant literature with social and political institutions (Q4 and Q5) and the least agreement with the statement on general destruction (Q7). However, item and factor analyses indicate all seven items fit together into a unidimensional Need for Chaos scale. 5
5 In our pre-analysis plan, we stated we would ask respondents, and scale together responses to, eight questions included in the original Need for Chaos battery. However, consistent with previous literature 
(Arceneaux et al. 2021;
Farhart et al. 2023;
Petersen,
 Osmundsen and Arceneaux 2023), item and factor analyses indicated responses for the eighth item ('There is no right and wrong in the world.') did not fit with those for the remaining seven items. Therefore, we deviate from our pre-analysis plan to include only these seven measures, shown in Table 2, in the Need for Chaos scale. Note: For each statement, respondents were asked to indicate, 'How much do you disagree or agree with the following statementsÂ¿ with response options on a seven-point scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.
We illustrate the distribution of the seven-item Need for Chaos scale (recoded to range from 0 to 1) for Study 1 (M = 0.17, Mdn = 0.10, SD = 0.20) and Study 2 (M = 0.18, Mdn = 0.10, SD = 0.21) in 
Figure 2
. Similar to previous findings 
(Arceneaux et al. 2021;
Farhart et al. 2023;
Petersen, Osmundsen, and Arceneaux 2023)
, approximately 26 per cent and 27 per cent of respondents (in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively) had a combined Need for Chaos score of zero, indicating individuals who strongly disagreed with all statements in the Need for Chaos battery. Considered alongside results from item and factor analyses, we take this as more evidence to suggest that although nearly two-thirds of each sample has a non-zero Need for Chaos score, many individuals do not agree with chaotic sentiments for chaos's sake; rather, they may harbor a more diffuse dissatisfaction with the current state of society and the political system. To better understand the attributes associated with Need for Chaos, we regressed Need for Chaos on covariates included in previous studies 
(Farhart et al. 2023;
Petersen,
 Osmundsen and Arceneaux 2023), as well as additional measures that can affect how people process information and are susceptible to framing (i.e., numeracy and political knowledge, see 
Fitz et al. 2024)
. Similar to previous literature 
(Farhart et al. 2023
  Though not shown in 
Figure 3
, we also tested whether a number of other covariates are associated with Need for Chaos 6 . Study 1 included a measure of general risk tolerance 
(Kam and Simas 2010)
; Study 2 included measures of perceived social status 
(Adler et al. 2000)
, cognitive reflection 
(Frederick 2005)
, and white identity 
(Jardina 2019)
. Adding these covariates to models for Study 1 and Study 2 indicate Need for Chaos is positively associated with risk tolerance and cognitive reflection; we find no significant relationship between Need for Chaos and social status or white ID 7 .
As for the significance of these initial results, the negative relationships between
Need for Chaos and age, female gender, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are consistent with previous scholarship associating status seeking with 'young male syndrome' 
(Arceneaux et al. 2021, 7
; see also 
Wilson and Daly 1985)
, as well as that which links 'undercontrolled' personality types with externalizing tendencies, e.g., greater interpersonal conflict 
(Asendorpf et al. 2001
; see also 
Arceneaux et al. 2021)
. The positive relationship between Need for Chaos and need for cognition, as well its negative relationships with objective numeracy and political knowledge, also support our assumption that those with greater perceived losses-in this case, a higher Need for Chaos-may take a more inclusive account of previous losses when tasked with decision making under risk, and may be less susceptible to loss frames 
(Fitz et al. 2024)
. Results from both samples further suggest that neither party ID nor income are associated with Need for Chaos, echoing previous research that found 'chaotic motivations can supersede those rooted in partisanship' 
(Farhart et al. 2023, 1)
 and that those higher in Need for Chaos 'do not need to be deprived in an absolute sense' 
(Arceneaux et al. 2021, 2)
. Altogether, these initial findings help to further validate these samples and the Need for Chaos scale, suggesting Need for Chaos has the potential to capture whether those disaffected with society and the political system react differently to gain and loss frames.


Results
Turning to our main analysis, we first examine whether most respondents are susceptible to conventional framing effects-that is, whether they tend to be risk-averse toward potential gains but risk-accepting toward potential losses. Reiterating previous scholarship using data from Study 1 
(Fitz et al. 2024)
, most respondents (67 per cent) randomly as-signed to the 'jobs gained' frame (M = 0.67, SD = 0.47) chose the 'certain' Deal A; (59 per cent) who received the 'jobs lost' frame (M = 0.59, SD = 0.49) selected the 'risky'
Deal B. Adding to these findings, we also find that most Study 2 respondents (67 per cent) randomly assigned to the 'jobs gained' frame (M = 0.67, SD = 0.47) chose the 'certain'
Deal A, while the majority (61 per cent) of those who received the 'jobs lost' frame (M = 0.61, SD = 0.49) chose the 'risky' Deal B.
We further demonstrate these framing effects, as well as results for our main analysis, in 
Table 3
. In these logistic regression models, we use 'choice of risky deal B' as the dependent variable (coded 0 for respondents who chose the 'certain' Deal A and 1 for respondents who chose the 'risky' Deal B, regardless of frame). All models include a binary independent variable indicating which frame they received (coded 0 for respondents who received the 'jobs gained' frame and 1 for respondents who received the 'jobs lost' frame)
to test whether exposure to loss frames is positively associated with choosing the 'risky'
deal B. To test whether Need for Chaos moderates the effects we might typically expect as a result of gain and loss frames, models 2 and 4 also include an interaction term for Frame
x Need for Chaos. Here again, Frame is positively associated with choosing the risky Deal B; we also find that the interaction term for Frame x Need for Chaos is negatively associated with choosing the risky Deal B. 8

Discussion and Conclusion
Using original data collected during the May 2023 US debt ceiling and September 2023 US government shutdown debates in the US Congress, we test whether the Need for Chaos moderates decision making in response to gain and loss frames. Consistent with fourfold pattern of decision making elucidated by Prospect Theory 
(Kahneman and Tversky 1979;
Tversky and Kahneman 1981;
1992)
, we find most respondents are risk-averse when presented with choices framed as prospective gains, but risk-seeking when presented with choices framed as prospective losses. Conversely, those higher in Need for Chaos are more risk-seeking towards prospective gains but more risk-averse towards prospective losses. Our results are consistent across both studies, providing strong evidence to suggest those higher in Need for Chaos respond differently to strategic frames.
As for what we make of these results, our evidence is consistent with prior research that found individuals who take a more inclusive account of previous losses respond differently to gain and loss frames 
(Tversky and Kahneman 1992
). While we cannot know for sure, at least with these data, the extent to which this particular mechanism explains their choices, our findings help to advance our theoretical understanding of Need for Chaos by demonstrating that not all 'chaotic' individuals are merely disaffected risk-takers who want to 'burn it all down' 
(Petersen, Osmundsen and Arceneaux 2023;
4)
. Rather, they are 'a divergent set of malcontents' 
(Arceneaux et al. 2021, 1)
 who, like others influenced by strategic frames, make decisions that reflect the 'circumstances and the environment that people find themselves in' 
(Oliver 2018;
. Thus, while we in no way aim to justify the attitudes or actions of those with nefarious intent, we do agree with others (e.g., Oliver 2018; 2021) who emphasized that assumptions based on a singular conceptualization of rationality ignore heterogeneous preferences. Given more than two-thirds of respondents in both samples had a non-zero Need for Chaos score, the implication is that researchers should direct greater attention to what is a gain and loss, and for whom.
These findings also have broader implications for elite decision making. Evidence to suggest Need for Chaos is both trait-and context-specific, and that those higher in Need for Chaos react differently to strategic frames, suggests discontent with society and the political system may be particularly influential on one's preferences in contentious political environments. This presents a unique set of challenges for elites looking to gain or maintain political support, as they need to not only strategize the content of their messaging, but also anticipate how various segments of their target audience will respond. Attempts to appeal to various groups with different frames may prove ineffective, and even costly, as targeted messaging can be seen as less credible, especially among those who do not identify with the targeted group (see, e.g., 
Hersh and Schaffner 2013)
. Thus, we look forward to scholarship that continues to examine the causes and consequences of Need for Chaos, and that which investigates whether (and which) elites might shift their approach to strategic messaging over time. Following Kamala Harris's loss to Donald Trump in November 2024, for example, Harris-Walz campaign officials expressed frustration with the strategy of testing and using only the highest-scoring political ads, regardless of whether ad messages aligned with each other or with the broader campaign. As one official put it, 'You can't get to a storyline if you're optimizing for each individual product,' 
(Stuart 2024
).
To that end, we also look forward to research that investigates the stability and downstream effects of Need for Chaos, and whether Need for Chaos moderates framing effects in other social and political contexts. Assessing whether Need for Chaos moderates policy frames on abortion, for example, would be worthwhile considering who tends to score higher in this measure (i.e., those who are younger, white, and male) and links between abortion attitudes and those toward historically marginalized groups 
(Deckman et al. 2023)
. Regardless, we suspect that while Need for Chaos may help to signal a particular sentiment of disaffection, many of these individuals-when tasked with making judgments and decisions on matters of real-world importance-will focus more on what they might have to gain or lose, as opposed to lofty goals aimed at dismantling society and the political system. As we continue to broaden our understanding of Need for Chaos amidst the current social and political climate, our hope is that these objectives are not one and the same.  
(
Denes-Raj and Epstein 1994)
, taking a more inclusive account of previous losses can motivate less risky choices
(Tversky and Kahneman 1981)
. Previous research on Need for Chaos asked respondents about their willingness to share conspiracy theories '[a]ssuming you could choose the people who saw it' (Farhart et al. 2023; Petersen, Osmundsen and Arceneaux 2023), their likelihood of taking part in illegal protests (Arceneaux et al. 2021), and their likelihood of engaging in politically violent behaviors, should the 'other party's nominee win[] a contested 2024 presidential election' (Landry, Druckman and Willer 2024, 9

Albeit an indirect measure, it nevertheless helps to demonstrate what we might expect with regard to issue salience over time: The first spike in popularity for the US debt ceiling issue corresponds with when the US government hit its debt limit in January 2023; the peak spike in popularity for this issue corresponds with congressional negotiations and the subsequent funding bill in May 2023. Similarly, the US government shutdown reached its peak popularity during congressional negotiations and the subsequent funding bill in late September 2023. Both studies were fielded around these peaks (indicated by the vertical, dashed lines in late May for Study 1 and late September for Study


Study 1: May 2023 Debt Ceiling Debate in US CongressFor Study 1, we use data from
Fitz et al. (2024)
, who found objective numeracy exacerbates framing effects in the context of the May 2023 debt ceiling debate in US Congress. Fitz et al. launched Study 1 on 27 May 2023, shortly after the announcement that the White House and US Congress reached a deal to raise the federal debt ceiling, and concluded the study on 28 May 2023, prior to the bill's release. Data for Study 1 include a sample of US adults (N = 3,463) obtained via Lucid, an online survey provider used in similar research (Guay and Johnston 2021; Farhart et al. 2023; Kreps and Kriner 2022) that provides respondents with proprietary compensation in exchange for their survey participation and clients with survey samples that align with US Census demographic benchmarks (Coppock and McClellan 2019).Study 1 was designed such that respondents first received a series of demographic questions (i.e., age, income, race, ethnicity, gender, and religiosity), followed by a series of randomized questions assessing Need for Chaos as well as other social, political, and psychological factors (i.e., objective numeracy, partisanship, ideology, political knowledge, need for closure, need for cognition, trust in government, interest, authoritarianism, and
Big Five personality traits). Respondents who failed a randomized attention check (N
= 650) were automatically eliminated from the analysis, yielding a total sample of N =
2,813. Following these questions, all Study 1 respondents received the following prompt: As you know, the U.S. government has reached its debt limit and is at risk of defaulting on its debt as of June 5, 2023. The White House and GOP nego- tiators have reached a compromise to raise the debt ceiling and avoid default, but

In Study 2, 51 respondents failed the pre-treatment attention check, yielding a total sample of N = 3,049.3  We include complete question wording and coding in the Supplementary Materials and summary statistics for all measures in our analyses in Appendix A.


We include these results in Appendix B.


We also tested measures assessing the importance of other race and ethnic identities; all were non-significant and did not substantively change the results.


As an additional check, we tested our hypotheses again, this time including all aforementioned covariates used to assess Need for Chaos, shown inFigure 3. These results are robust to these additional measures and are included in Appendix C.








To interpret results for the interaction term, we calculated the predicted marginal effects of Frame x Need for Chaos for Study 1 and Study 2 (based on
