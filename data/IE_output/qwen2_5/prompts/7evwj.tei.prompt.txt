You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Having control over how your life proceeds is considered a basic human right 
1
 . This capacity, known as agency, is an essential aspect of how individuals interact with the world 
[2]
[3]
[4]

[6]
[7]
 . Imagine how a person might recall their evening activities: "I arrived home from work and decided to make lasagna for dinner, but realized I was out of cheese, so I drove to the grocery store." This recollection reflects how actions (driving) stem from internal states (hunger) and decisions (making dinner), influenced by personal preferences (lasagna). Moreover, this example not only illustrates how our memories often involve sequences of connected events, but also highlights our active role in determining how these events are connected. Surprisingly, we know very little about how such agentive narratives are encoded and recalled.
What is known about the role of agency in memory? When people can choose the identity or order of items that they learn about, their episodic memory is improved 
[8]
[9]
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
[14]
[15]
[16]
 . However, this finding about the role of agency largely depends on studies using lists of isolated and unrelated words, images, or videos as memoranda. Little attention has been given to examining how agency affects memory for a sequence of causally and semantically connected events, such as driving to get ingredients to make dinner. It is important to fill this gap, because life's events do not occur in isolation, nor are they remembered in isolation. In this study, we set out to determine how agency over an interconnected sequence of events affects memory for those events. In particular, we asked: how are three fundamental determinants of memory -temporal, causal, and semantic relationschanged when a narrative event sequence is shaped by our own actions and decisions?
One possibility is that increasing agency will increase the role of temporal context in memory. An influential body of work has modeled how temporal order during encoding has a powerful effect on temporal order at recall 
[16]
[17]
[18]
 . When freely recalling a list of words, words encoded nearby in time tend to be recalled nearby in time, despite this not being an explicit demand of the memory test. This effect can be explained by the storage and retrieval of temporal context representations bound to each word 
[16]
[17]
[18]
 . Recent work has shown that temporal memory effects can be modulated by agency. For example, Houser et al. 
19
 found that agency improved the temporal order memory of participants in a textbased object exploration game, relative to participants who observed the same objects passively. The authors ascribe this difference to an increased binding of items to their temporal context in the active exploration condition. Therefore, agency may generally strengthen associations between items encoded nearby in time, with the potential to exert a similar effect in memory for narrative event sequences.
Agency could also affect memory via its interaction with the causal networks and semantic networks that link events. Let us consider causal networks first: studies using written stories and audiovisual movies have demonstrated the important role of causality in memory 
[20]
[21]
[22]
[23]
[24]
[25]
[26]
[27]
 . A key finding is that events in a story with stronger or more numerous causal relations between events are more likely to be recalled . How might agency alter the influence of causal connections on memory? Making a choice that affects the future seems to give an agent causal power 
[34]
[35]
[36]
 and thus agency may emphasize the causal associations between events and enhance the influence of causality on memory 
11,
13
 . However, causal relations can also guide narrative recall so powerfully that participants follow a causal strategy even when instructed otherwise 
29
 . Thus, another possibility may be that the impact of causal connections on event memory may be invariant to whether the viewer has agency over the events.
Agency could also modulate the role of semantic relations in memory. Semantic relations between individual items affect the order and probability of recall, such that semantically related words are more likely to be recalled successively than unrelated words 
[37]
[38]
[39]
 . In the context of event memory, Lee & Chen 
31
 showed that more semantically central events (i.e., events with short semantic paths to many other events in a story) were more likely to be recalled. However, it is not clear how such effects might be changed by agency in the context of an interactive narrative, especially because semantics can vary substantially from person to person. For example, chocolate ice cream is often considered a tasty dessert, but if I had a recent bout of food poisoning after eating some, it takes on a negative quality for me; this personal experience would change my semantic associations with chocolate ice cream, pulling them away from its position in 'normative' semantic space. Thus, if agency emphasizes an individual's own past experiences and knowledge, then this may decrease the capacity for memory to be predicted from normative (generic) semantic relations that are measured using word co-occurrences in large corpora 
[40]
[41]
[42]
[43]
 .
If agency emphasizes one's own past experiences and knowledge, its impact on memory may extend beyond a general enhancement; having agency could cause the individual's unique perspective to play a greater role in shaping what is remembered or forgotten. Previous research on agency has primarily examined memory for isolated items, consistently showing improved memory when people can choose what to learn 
[8]
[9]
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
[14]
[15]
 . One account for this general improvement is that choice is inherently rewarding 
44,
45
 and such motivational factors can enhance memory encoding 
46
 . Additionally, it has been proposed that agency increases the self-relevance of the current input 8 , which could boost episodic memory by encouraging integration of the input with existing networks of self-relevant knowledge -a form of deeper elaborative processing 
[47]
[48]
[49]
[50]
 . Extending these ideas from isolated items to sequences of inter-connected events, one may predict enhanced memory for events that involve making a choice, and this effect should be consistent across individuals. However, if agency activates self-relevant knowledge, it may amplify inter-individual differences in memory. For example, two friends exploring the main street of a new city together might visit shops together in the same sequence, but each would experience their own thread of thought reflecting their respective interests (e.g., history vs. food); for each individual, a distinct "personalized" network of connections across time would be generated, making different shops memorable or forgettable for each person.
In this study, we examined how agency affects memory for complex event sequences by having participants read interactive narratives, i.e., "choose-your-own-adventure" stories. Every few sentences, participants were offered a choice about how the story would proceed. In the Free condition, these choices were always granted (full agency); in the Yoked condition, choices were not always granted (partial agency); in the Passive condition, choices were not offered (no agency). Critically, a number of events in the narrative were designed to be identical across all participants in all conditions, allowing us to test whether agency personalizes memory for story events. After reading, participants freely recalled the story.
Our results reveal that agency reshapes the way in which narrative events are recalled. Participants in the Free condition remembered more divergent subsets of events from each other relative to the Yoked and Passive participants, even when all events were identical across conditions; in other words, agency personalized memory. Furthermore, generic semantic associations between events (estimated via sentence embeddings 40 ) were worse at predicting memory in the Free condition, which may also stem from the personalizing influence of agency on memory. Meanwhile, the impact of causal connections on memory was not changed by agency. Finally, in the Free condition, temporally adjacent events were more likely to share the same mnemonic fate (either both remembered, or both forgotten), which we term the neighbor encoding effect. Overall, the results show that the introduction of agentive control changes fundamental organizing principles of episodic memory for naturalistic events, particularly in terms of how semantic and temporal associations between events shape what is subsequently remembered. We speculate that the activation of self-relevant knowledge needed to make decisions drives this change in the structure of our episodic memories.


Results
We conducted the experiment with two different interactive stories, Adventure and Romance. In all conditions, participants read the story in a self-paced manner, one sentence at a time. In the Free condition (Adventure: N=22; Romance: N=100), the story periodically came to a "choice point" at which participants were offered 2-4 options for what could happen next. Participants indicated their preferred option, and the story proceeded following the plotline of their choice. Thus, each Free participant generated a unique "story path" through the narrative tree ( 
Figure 1
). In the Yoked condition (Adventure: N=45; Romance: N=53), participants encountered the same choice points and options, and made their selections, but these selections were ignored. They were instead obliged to follow the story path of a previously collected Free participant. Consequently, Yoked participants sometimes did have their choice granted and sometimes did not, depending on whether they happened to make the same choice as the Free participants to whom they were yoked. Yoked participants were told in advance that they might not always have their choices granted, but they were not informed about the existence of Free participants. In the Passive condition (Adventure: N=49; Romance: N=55), participants encountered the same choice points but did not get to choose; these participants also followed the story path of a previously collected Free participant. Thus, the three conditions were designed to give participants three different levels of agency: Free had the most perceived control over the story, Yoked had an intermediate amount of perceived control (i.e., choices were sometimes granted by chance), and Passive had the least. For the Adventure story, each of the 22 story paths generated by Free participants was read by 2-3 Yoked and 2-3 Passive participants. For the Romance story, 18 of the original 100 Free participants were selected semi-randomly, and 2-3 Yoked and 2-3 Passive participants read each of these 18 story paths (see Methods). There were minor differences in the data collection procedures for the two stories; see Methods for details. The Romance story had an additional design feature: 50% of events were identical across all participants ( 
Figure 1
).
After story reading, all participants were asked to recall the story in as much as detail as possible, by typing in a customized text box (see Methods). For the Romance story only, a multiple-choice recognition test was administered, as well as a number of trait surveys. All data were collected on Prolific. Each story path was segmented into "events" of a few sentences (see Methods) for subsequent analyses. Recall was scored for accuracy, and semantic and causal relations between story events were calculated or determined via human judgment. See Supplement S1 and Supplementary 
Figure S1
 for information about a novel GPT-based method for identifying causal relations in narratives. Responses for a third story were collected but not reported here due to poor data quality; see Supplement S2 for details. The story begins at the leftmost point of the tree ("Start") and proceeds to the right; each line-split represents a choice-point, where options are offered, and each node (circles in popout) represents a choice option. Thus, an individual story can be visualized as a path through the tree, e.g., one participant chose the red nodes (choice options) while reading, resulting in Story Path 1, whereas another participant chose the blue nodes while reading, resulting in Story Path 2. The Romance story was designed to have half of its events shared across all participants, as seen in central sections of the tree where all lines merge. B, Schematic of the CYOA paradigm with self-paced reading. Sentences were presented in black text on a white screen. Participants hit 'Enter' to proceed to the next sentence until arriving at a choice point. At a choice point, options were listed below the story text, and participants indicated their choice using the mouse.
Agency did not improve recall performance. For each participant, events were binned according to whether they were remembered or forgotten. Independent raters compared each sentence of recall to the story path read by the participant; if any part of a given event was mentioned in any recall sentence, it was counted as remembered. There were no significant differences in recall performance across conditions in either story (Adventure: F(2,113)=1.43, p=0.243; Romance: F(2,123)=0.67, p=0.513; Supplementary 
Figure S3
). See Supplement S4 for details about recognition memory performance; see Supplement S5 and 
Supplementary Figures S5-1
 and S5-2 for analyses of how having choices granted vs. denied affected memory.
Agency magnified individual variability in recall and choice. The Romance story, by design, had half of its events shared across all participants ("shared story sections"), regardless of condition ( 
Figure 1A
). While participants made many choices during these shared story sections, unbeknownst to them, all choice options led to the same subsequent events. This allowed us to examine inter-participant variability in terms of memory (which events were recalled) and choice behavior (which options were selected) when all events were perfectly matched across participants, i.e., all participants read these events, and the events were composed of identical text.
Individual variability in recalled events. A recall score (0 = Forgotten, 1 = Recalled; see Methods for details) for each of the 64 events in the shared story sections was extracted for each participant, composing a vector of recall performance 
(Figure 2A
). To assess the memory similarity across participants, we computed the inter-participant correlation (ISC), i.e., the Pearson correlation between each pair of participants' recall performance vectors, i.e., "Recall ISC". While events differed in their overall memorability, Recall ISC was significantly above zero in all three conditions (Romance: Free: mean r = 0.136, p < 0.001; Yoked: mean r = 0.226, p < 0.001; Passive: mean r = 0.249, p < 0.001; one-sample ttests against zero), indicating that individuals tended to remember events more similarly to one another than would be expected by chance. Interestingly, when comparing across the conditions, Free participants had reduced Recall ISC relative to Yoked and Passive participants, indicating that agency induced greater individual variability in terms of which events were recalled (Figure 2B, left; Romance: F(2,3013) = 48.1, p < .001; post-hoc tests: p < .001; Free vs. Passive, p < .001). Out of the 64 events, 15 were "choice events" (the event that the participant chose to occur next; e.g., "Sleep beneath the bridge" in 
Figure  1B
). To examine whether the reduced Recall ISC observed among Free participants was driven by these choice events, we repeated the analysis using only the 49 non-choice events. The results were largely unchanged: Recall ISC was still significantly above zero in all three conditions In the Yoked and Passive conditions, multiple participants followed the story-path corresponding to each of the 18 unique Free participant story-paths. To ensure that the above-reported higher inter-participant memory similarity in the Yoked and Passive conditions was not due to participants sharing the same story-path, we conducted nonparametric tests of Recall ISC ( 
Figure 2B
-C). We randomly sampled one Yoked and one Passive participant from each of the 18 story-paths to form a sample of 18 Yoked and 18 Passive participants; thus, no pairs within these samples read the same story-path. This process was repeated 10,000 times to generate distributions of Recall ISC for both the Yoked and Passive conditions. The analysis confirmed that the Free condition's Recall ISC was significantly lower than that of the Passive (p < 0.001; excluding choice events, p < 0.001) and the Yoked (p < 0.001; excluding choice events, p = 0.006) conditions ( 
Figure 2B
-C, right).
Individual variability in choices made. The option that was selected (1 or 2) at each of the 15 choice-points in the shared story sections was extracted for each Free and Yoked participant (Passive participants made no choices), composing a vector of choice selections. To assess the choice similarity across participants, we computed the interparticipant (Pearson) correlation between each pair of participants' choice selection vectors, i.e., "Choice ISC". Within-group Choice ISC was significantly above zero in both conditions (ps < 0.001), showing that certain choice options were intrinsically preferred over others. Comparing across conditions, Free participants had significantly reduced Choice ISC (mean r = 0.208) compared to Yoked participants (mean r = 0.256), indicating that agency (full as opposed to partial) induced greater individual variability in terms of which options were selected (p = 0.035, two-sample t-test).
Divergence from the group. Each Free participant's memory divergence score was calculated as one minus the Pearson correlation between their recall performance vector and the group averaged recall performance vector. In other words, the more different their memory performance vector was from the group average, the higher their memory divergence score. Similarly, we calculated each Free participant's choice divergence score as one minus the Pearson correlation between their choice selection vector and the group averaged choice selection vector. Memory divergence and choice divergence were correlated with each other (Romance: r(18) = .405, p = .095; r(100) = .296, p = .003). In other words, the more idiosyncratic their memory for shared events, the more idiosyncratic their choices.
Overall, these results support the idea that agency magnified individual variability in, i.e., personalized, both memory and choice behaviors. This effect was observed while all events were held constant across conditions. Event recall was predicted by semantic and causal centrality. Narrative networks were computed for each unique story path following the methods of Lee & Chen 
31
 For semantic narrative network analysis, each event was converted into an embedding vector using the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE 40 ). Semantic centrality, a measure of how strongly interconnected a given event was with other events in the narrative via shared meaning, was calculated for each event by averaging its embedding cosine similarity with all other events in the story path. The effect of semantic centrality (semantic influence) on memory was computed as the Pearson correlation between semantic centrality and recall (an event-by-event vector of remembered=1, forgotten=0) for each participant. For both stories, semantic centrality significantly predicted recall, i.e., a significant semantic influence on memory was was observed, in all three conditions (ps < 0.001, one-sample t-tests against zero; Supplement S6 and Supplementary 
Figure S6
).
For causal narrative network analysis, independent human raters judged which pairs of events were causally linked in a given story path (Adventure: 1 rater per path; Romance: average of 3 raters per path; see Methods). Causal centrality, a measure of an event's causal connectedness to other events within a narrative, was calculated for each event by averaging across its causal connections with all other events in the story path. The effect of causal centrality (causal influence) on memory was computed as the Pearson correlation between causal centrality and event-by-event recall for each participant. For both stories, causal centrality significantly predicted recall, i.e., a significant causal influence on memory was observed, in all three conditions (ps < 0.001, one-sample t-tests against zero; Supplement S6 and Supplementary 
Figure S6
).
In sum, both semantic centrality and causal centrality predicted recall of interactive narratives, echoing the findings of earlier studies on the effects of semantic and causal relations on memory for narratives 
28,
[31]
[32]
[33]
 .
Agency reduced the influence of semantic but not causal centrality on recall. We next compared the strength of semantic and causal influences on memory across the three conditions (Free, Yoked, Passive). Importantly, because Yoked and Passive participants read the story paths generated by Free participants, event content was matched across conditions; only the degree of perceived agency varied. For both stories, we observed significant differences across conditions, wherein Free had lower semantic influence on memory compared to Yoked and Passive (Adventure: F(2,113) = 3.04, p = 0.052; Romance: F(2,123) = 11.46, p < .001; 
Figure 3A
-B, top row). In contrast, causal influence on memory was not different between conditions ( 
Figure 3A
-B, bottom row). There was a significant network type x agency interaction for the Adventure story (F(2,113) = 3.27, p = .042) and a trend for the same for the Romance story (F(2,123) = 2.99, p = .054). Note that semantic and causal centrality were often correlated with each other, but had weak or even negative correlations in some story paths, enabling analyses showing that they separately predicted event recall (Supplement S7 and 
Supplementary  Table S7
).
These results show that when participants had agentive control over the plot of a narrative, semantic influence (the impact of semantic centrality) on later memory was reduced; meanwhile, causal influence (the impact of the causal centrality) on recall was relatively unaffected. This weakening of semantic influence suggests that Free participants' semantic space may have shifted away from the generic (normative) semantic space captured by generic text embeddings. In contrast, causal influence was unchanged by agency. Agency introduces temporal dependencies in memory. In the Free condition, participants actively made choices which determined the future. We reasoned that, as a result, they might have formed expectations about upcoming events which would consequently link temporally contiguous events together more strongly in memory, relative to the conditions with lower agency. Thus, we examined whether recall performance for a given event could be predicted by whether its temporally neighboring events at encoding were recalled, which we term the "neighbor encoding effect". First, for each participant and for each event, we calculated the average of the recall scores for the immediately previous and next events at encoding (the neighbors); for the first and last event, there were neighbors on only one side, and thus these entries consisted merely of recall performance for the next and previous event, respectively. This procedure generated a vector of neighbor recall performance for each participant. We then calculated the neighbor encoding effect as the correlation between the neighbor recall performance vector and the original recall performance vector for each participant ( 
Figure  4A
).
The neighbor encoding effect was positive in all three conditions for both stories (Adventure and Romance, ps < 0.001), and significantly different across the three conditions in the Romance story, with Free having a higher neighbor encoding effect compared to Yoked and Passive (F(2,123) = 12.1, p < 0.001; post-hoc tests: Free vs. Yoked, p = 0.001; Free vs. Passive, p < 0.001; 
Figure 4B
). Overall, these results suggest that agency enhanced the tendency for temporally neighboring events at encoding to share the same subsequent memory status, either both recalled or both forgotten.
The neighbor encoding effect is distinct from the "temporal contiguity effect", which describes the phenomenon that recalling one item from a randomized list tends to trigger the recall of items which were experienced nearby in time 
19,
39
 ; the neighbor encoding effect does not incorporate any information about the temporal order of recall. To examine temporal order effects during recall in our data, we calculated the temporal violation rate as the frequency with which each participant recalled events out of order. For each participant, recall was divided into segments (brief sentences). We counted the number of times that a recall segment referred to an event that occurred earlier in the story than the events referred to by the previous recall segment; this was then divided by the participant's total number of recall segments. There was no significant difference in temporal violation rate across conditions in either story (Adventure: F(2,113) = 2.56, p = .081; Romance: F(2,123) = 0.09, p = .913). In general, temporal order was remarkably well-preserved, with low temporal violation rates in all conditions ( 
Figure 4C-D)
. . For each event, we compute the average recall score of its neighbors (the previous and the next event), resulting in a "neighbor" recall vector. The neighbor encoding effect is computed as the correlation between the recall vector and the neighbor recall vector; in other words, can the remembered vs. forgotten status of a given event be predicted by the status of its neighboring events? B, Neighbor encoding effect in the Adventure story (left) and in the Romance story (right). C, Three example participants' recall chronology. D, Temporal violation rate in the Adventure story (left) and in the Romance story (right). Each dot represents the temporal violation rate in one participant's recall, i.e., the frequency with which each participant recalled events out of order.
Greater memory divergence was associated with weaker semantics influence. We next examined how memory divergence scores ( 
Figure 2
) were related to a) the impact of semantic centrality on recall 
(Figure 3)
 and b) the neighbor encoding effect 
(Figure 4)
. Each Free participant's semantic influence score was obtained by calculating the Pearson correlation between semantic centrality and memory performance (same as shown in 
Figure 3)
.
Memory divergence was negatively correlated with semantic influence scores in Free participants. In other words, the more a participant's recall deviated from other participants in the group, the weaker the effect of semantic centrality on their recall. This was true when including only the 18 Free participants who had yoked counterparts (Romance: r(18) = -.519, p = 0.024) as well as when using the full sample (Romance: r(100) = -.460, p < 0.001; 
Supplementary Figure S8A
). Choice divergence, however, was not significantly correlated with semantic network scores. Note that these comparisons could only be made for the Romance story, as the analyses of divergence depend on the shared story sections.
The neighbor encoding effect was also positively associated with memory divergence in Free participants (Romance: r(18) = 0.496, p = .036; r(100)= 0.304, p = .002; 
Supplementary Figure S8B)
. In other words, the more a participant's recall deviated from other participants in the group, the more that participant's neighboring events tended to have the same recall status (remembered or forgotten). The neighbor encoding effect was negatively correlated with semantic influence scores in Free participants, across both stories (Adventure: r(22) = -.348, p = .113. Romance: r(18) = -.324, p = .189; r(100)= -.347, p < .001; 
Supplementary Figure S8C
). However, when including both semantic influence and the neighbor encoding scores in a multiple linear regression predicting memory divergence, semantic influence score was a significant predictor (p < 0.001) while the neighbor encoding effect was not (p = 0.087).
Overall, the degree to which a participant's memory was idiosyncratic in terms of which events they recalled (memory divergence) was negatively correlated with impact of the story's semantic network on memory -in line with the idea that agency personalizes memory.


Discussion
In this study, we examine how agency modulates three fundamental factors that are known to shape episodic memory -temporal, semantic, and causal relations between events. Participants read one of two interactive choose-your-own-adventure narratives followed by free recall. We compared memory behavior across three conditions: Free, in which choices were always granted (full agency); Yoked, in which choices were sometimes granted (partial agency); and Passive, in which participants did not get to choose (no agency). Agency shaped episodic memory in at least three ways: (i) agency personalized memory such that participants in the Free condition were less likely to recall the same shared events as one another; (ii) agency weakened the capacity for generic semantic relations to predict memory while leaving the influence causal relations unaffected; and (iii) agency introduced dependencies between temporally adjacent events such that they were more likely to share the same mnemonic fate (i.e., both remembered or both forgotten). Overall, we propose that agentive control changes how basic determinants of episodic memory operate during naturalistic experience, potentially as a consequence of activating self-specific knowledge and past experiences in the service of making decisions.
Agency is known to benefit learning and memory 
[8]
[9]
[10]
[11]
[13]
[14]
[15]
 . Having the ability to chooseor sense that one could choose -results in better memory. This boost has been attributed to choice driving reward signals 
[44]
[45]
[46]
 and encouraging more elaborative self-related encoding . However, these accounts imply that if participants encounter the same sequence of events, with some requiring a choice, choice events will be systematically better remembered. Further downstream, this would result in individuals with agency showing more across-person similarity in the events that they successfully recall -agency would standardize memories. Here, each participant in the Free condition made choices to create their own unique narrative; Yoked and Passive participants then read these narratives. Crucially, the Romance story was designed such that 50% of events, distributed across the story, were read by all participants regardless of the agency condition they were assigned to or the choices they made. This feature allowed us to examine individual variability in terms of which events were recalled, with event content held constant across participants and levels of agency. As opposed to standardizing, we found that agency personalized memory for shared events: agency magnified individual variability, both for which events were later remembered and for which options were chosen. That is, participants in the Free condition tended to recall different events and make different choices from each other, while participants within the Yoked and Passive conditions were more similar to each other.
What factors drive the personalization in memory and choice observed in the Free condition? We propose that the need to make decisions about how the story would unfold causes participants to activate self-specific information 
51
 . For example, imagine the story entailed a choice about where the protagonist was to eat dinner (e.g., Italian vs. Lebanese restaurant). If the participant happened to have spent the summer in Italy, that person's choice and subsequent interpretation of the Italian restaurant events -a busy patio, surprisingly excellent wine, a distracted waiter -could mingle with features from their own personal experiences visiting Italy. As a result, the features of the story that stand out to the participant may become more idiosyncratic. Not all decisions, however, require such self-specific knowledge; for example, in bandit-style tasks where participants make choices that maximize their rewards, only learned information about the value of stimuli is needed. In our study, the use of narratives -complex events that resemble real-life situations -was likely important for eliciting the personalizing effect of agency. This has broad implications for how human memory operates in daily life, as the amount of control that a person has over their environment varies greatly in natural settings (e.g., being a driver vs. a passenger in a car; creating a meal vs. following a recipe; choosing which topics to study vs. following a predetermined lesson plan). Our findings suggest that the effects of agentive control on memory may be better understood as changing precisely what is remembered across individuals, as opposed to a general enhancement of learning.
Agency reduced semantic influence on memory, while leaving causal influence unaffected. Specifically, semantic centrality (i.e., the degree to which an event has strong or numerous semantic similarities to other events in the narrative) predicted which events would be recalled in all conditions, but the prediction was weakest when participants were able to control the story (Free condition). We propose that this result reflects a change in how individuals organize concepts -a warping of their semantic space -when they have agency over current events. Vector representations of events semantics were calculated using sentence embeddings 
40
 , and these were necessarily generic; such neural network language models have no ability to capture idiosyncrasies of an individual's own interpretation of a text. If having agency activated self-specific knowledge, one consequence could be that individuals' interpretations of, or associated thoughts with, each story event may have diverged from the generic semantic representation. Consider our previous example about the Italian restaurant. This participant's mental representation of the word "spaghetti" -perhaps associated with a delicious meal from their trip as well as a feeling of embarrassment from the moment they realized they had lost their wallet after attempting pay the bill -may diverge from the normative associations learned by a language model. For this reason, we suggest that our finding that agency enhances the idiosyncrasy of, or personalizes, memory is meaningfully related to the observation that agency reduced semantic narrative network effects on recall. Indeed, in an individual differences analysis, the degree to which a person's memory was idiosyncratic (i.e., memory divergence score) was negatively related to semantic influence on memory for that person (r = -0.519). Future studies may further test this idea by probing how agency reshapes how we organize concepts; for example, by directly questioning individuals about perceived semantic similarity between events or topics related to a laboratory experience presented with and without agency.
Why was causal influence on memory unaffected by agency? That is, causal centrality (the degree to which an event has strong or numerous causal connections to other events in the narrative) predicted which events would be recalled in all conditions, and the strength of this prediction was not modulated by whether participants were able to control the story. This may seem surprising, as making choices is conceptually linked to causality 
[52]
[53]
[54]
[55]
 . One might have reasonably expected that because Free condition participants were able to effectively "cause" future events via their choices, these cause-effect links might be added to the causal narrative network and interfere with the ability of "standard" causal centrality to predict memory. Or, perhaps Free condition participants would have a heightened awareness of causal connections in the narrative, which could change the way that these causal connections shaped memory. Nonetheless, our results are not compatible with these views. Instead, our findings point to a potential separation between 1) the causality inherent in making decisions and 2) the causal relations between events that are extracted in the course of narrative comprehension. The distinction between the two, and their possible interplay, is an interesting topic for future research 
56
 . A parsimonious interpretation of the current data may be that causal connections in a narrative play an essential role in comprehension and memory, even in the absence of choose-your-own-adventure-style agency 
57,58 26-28,31,59
 . The influence of causal associations on memory for narratives, then, may be relatively impervious to the kinds of manipulations of agency used in this study.
How did agency alter the role of temporal order in memory? This question should be split into two parts: the effects of agency on temporal relations at encoding and at recall. First, did agency change the way that temporal relations between events at encoding influenced whether an event would be later remembered? Indeed, we found moderate evidence that agency introduced temporal dependencies in memory. Specifically, agency enhanced the tendency for events which were adjacent during encoding to share the same mnemonic fate, either both recalled, or both forgotten. This "neighbor encoding effect" was positive in all three conditions for both stories, and highest for the Free condition in one story. Our finding adds to recent work showing that agency can change memory for the temporal properties of events at encoding. For example, Houser et al. 
20
 report an association between participants being able to choose the order of studied events in a text-based room exploration game and more accurate temporal order memory for the game experience. Second, did agency change temporal properties of events at recall? Free recall studies using sequences of unrelated memoranda have established the "temporal contiguity effect": items are likely to be recalled in a similar order to that in which they were presented 
17
 . In this study, we calculated the temporal violation rate as the frequency with which each participant recalled events out of order. No differences between agency conditions were observed. However, it is important to note that most narratives are linear chains of causally connected events, thus confounding temporal and causal relations. Under these conditions (and true in our study), interpretation of narrated recall through the lens of temporal contiguity is problematic; temporal contiguity is typically high, but it may be driven by a combination of causal and temporal structure 
60
 . Antony et al. 
29
 solved this problem by employing a narrative in which temporal order, story chronology, and causal linkage were separable. They found that causal relations were the dominant factor in determining the order of recalled events. These observations suggest that, while both random-item lists and narratives tend to be recalled in the order of original presentation, temporal order drives the former while causal relations drive the latter phenomenon. In sum, our study revealed moderate evidence that agency changed the way that temporal relations between events at encoding influenced later memory (i.e., agency increased neighbor encoding effect), but no evidence that temporal order during recall is affected by agency (i.e., agency did not affect temporal violation rate).
In summary, we studied the impact of agency on memory through the lens of temporal, semantic, and causal relations between events. Agency enhanced the distinctiveness of memories, driving individuals apart in terms of which events they recalled. This personalizing effect on memory was related to a decreased emphasis on semantic relations between story events in predicting subsequent recall, which we interpret as a warping of individuals' conceptual space towards their personal experience and away from normative semantic relations. At the same time, agency did not modulate the ability of causal relations between events in predicting recall, and agency increased the likelihood of neighboring events during encoding sharing the same mnemonic status at later recall. Our findings highlight agency as an important determinant of memory for naturalistic events, best understood as changing precisely what is remembered across individuals, as opposed to enhancing learning overall. 


Methods


Participants


Stimuli.
The Adventure story was a slightly modified version of an interactive story titled "Before Alice: Xenization", authored by Moola Hoola 
(Figure 1A)
. The story takes place in a universe inspired by Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, in which the protagonist, Alice, wakes up in a magical world and over the course of the story discovers that she is the Princess of Hearts. We chose the Adventure story because it is an engaging genre that most participants can relate to and enjoy. There were 8-24 choice events, depending on the choices made by each participant; each choice event had 2-4 options. Participants generated 22 unique Adventure story-paths via their choices. These story-paths varied in length (400-1000 words) and number of events (22-59 events). The Romance story was titled "The Monthiversary" and was written by Ria Gualano and refined for experiment purposes via discussion among the study authors. This genre was selected to provide a contrasting narrative style, promoting generalizability of the results across different types of stories. The story follows the actions of a woman recovering from a recently ended relationship and potentially finding new romance. It was designed such that half of its events were identical ("shared sections") across all story-paths, while the other half were split into 3 possible storylines ( 
Figure 1B
). There were 7 stretches of shared sections distributed across the story. The number of choice events was predetermined at 29 per story-path, 15 of which were in the shared sections, regardless of what choices the participants made. Each choice event had 2 options. Participants generated 100 unique Romance story-paths via their choices. These story-paths had varied text length (4800-5200 words) and number of events (128-135 events). All revisions to the story were made prior to the start of data collection.


Experimental procedures.
In the main experiment, participants read the story one sentence at a time in a self-paced manner, pressing the 'Enter' key to proceed to the next sentence. Periodically they encountered a choice event, and available options were presented below. In the Adventure story, 2 to 4 options were offered; Free participants used their mouse to drag the options on the screen to rank their preferences from most to least preferred (top to bottom), then clicked a 'Next' button to continue. Yoked participants experienced the same procedures, except that their story-path was preassigned to follow one of the 22 Free story-paths; consequently, they had some of their choices granted, while others were denied, depending on whether their choice coincided with the pre-assigned one. Passive participants experienced the same procedures but saw only one option at each choice event; their story-path was also pre-assigned to follow one of the 22 Free story-paths. Each Free story-path was followed by 2-3 Yoked and 2-3 Passive participants. In the Romance story, Free participants generated 100 story-paths based on their choices, and 18 Free participants' story-paths were selected for Yoked and Passive participants to follow (see 'Behavioral data preparation' for details). The procedures for the Romance story were identical to those for the Adventure story except for the following: 1) each choice event offered only 2 options; 2) Free and Yoked participants clicked on their preferred option, rather than dragging; 2) Passive participants saw both options (rather than only one) with an arrow pointing to the pre-assigned option, on which they were required to click in order to continue. Each Free story-path was followed by 3-4 Yoked and 2-3 Passive participants. See Data Availability for demonstrations of the experiment.
Before the experiment, participants completed a short practice story to familiarize them with the interactive paradigm. After the experiment, participants completed several trait surveys before continuing to the free recall task. They were then instructed to type their recall of the story in as much detail as possible. The instructions emphasized the importance of recall completeness over accurate sequencing of events. Participants typed in a one-line window in which they could see approximately the last 10 words, and could only edit and view text within that window. The goal of design was to allow typed recall to somewhat approximate spoken recall, where participants cannot erase what they have already said aloud. For the Romance story only, a multiple-choice recognition test was administered after free recall. The Romance story experiment required more time to complete (1.5-2.5hrs) compared to the Adventure story (20-50mins), due to the longer narrative and the additional recognition memory test. To ensure data quality, incentives were offered for high-quality recall and recognition responses for the Romance story. Beyond the base payment, participants were informed (veridically) that an additional bonus would be awarded to those scoring in the top 40% for recall, and another bonus for top performance in the recognition test ($2 for the top 40% recall, and $2 for the top 40% recognition).


Behavioral data collection and preparation.
The Romance story was read by 100 participants in the Free condition, resulting in 100 unique story-paths, of which 18 were chosen based on their maximum narrative divergence. Narrative diversity was calculated as follows. The story was structured so that half of its content was shared across all storypaths, while the remainder branched into three distinct storylines, culminating in two possible endings. Participants in the same storyline encountered similar overall narratives, though their choices caused minor divergences in many places. The similarity between two Free participants' story-paths increased with the similarity of their choices. We calculated the similarity of choices between each pair of Free participants within the same storyline, then selected the three story-paths with the lowest similarity in choices for each story version, resulting in the 18 selected story-paths (3 story-paths × 3 storylines × 2 endings) which would be followed by the Yoked and Passive conditions. When appropriate, statistical comparisons across conditions utilized these 18 selected Free participants' story-paths, which ensured that story content was held constant.


Event segmentation
In order to calculate recall performance, each story needed to be segmented into discrete events. A team of experienced raters identified event boundaries by marking transitions in scenes, topics, locations, times, actions, emotions, or other significant shifts, discussing markings with each other until consensus was reached (see Data Availability for instructions). Choice options were treated as separate events due to their distinct presentation (different font, color, background, and interaction mode) and their natural demarcation from the narrative flow. Following event segmentation, the Adventure story contained 169 events in total, with the 22 Free participants experiencing between 22 and 59 events. The Romance story contained 342 events in total, with the 100 Free participants experiencing between 128 and 135 events.


Matching recall to story-paths
Post-experiment, participants' written recall was corrected for spelling and grammatical errors with minimal changes by experienced in-lab staff. Recalls were then segmented based on both punctuation and topic shifts, corresponding to sentences or parts of sentences. Each recall segment was assigned to the events in the unique storypath it referred to, with segments potentially aligning with none, one, or multiple events. Hence, the recall score for each event was determined as 0 (not recalled) or 1 (recalled).


Causality Ratings for the main experiment
For the Adventure story, experienced raters analyzed the causal relationships between events for each of the 22 story-paths. The raters read through a story-path (one rater per story-path) and identified pairs of events with a strong causal relationship, where one event directly caused another. They were cautioned against listing event pairs based merely on their chronological order (e.g., "you broke your leg" not because "you woke up in the morning", but because "someone pushed you down the stairs"), and encouraged to keep criteria consistent throughout their ratings. The Romance story, with its 100 storypaths, was rated in the same manner by an average of 3 raters (range: 1-6) per path. The finished causal ratings were lists of event pairs, from which we constructed an event x event causal matrix for each story-path, representing its causal network. These causal matrices denoted event pairs with causal connections as 1, and all others as 0. When multiple raters rated a story-path, the average matrix was computed. See Supplement S1 and 
Supplementary Figure S1
 for information about a novel GPT-based method that we developed for identifying causal relations in narratives.
Inter-participant memory similarity and choice similarity. The Romance story, by design, had half of its events shared across all participants ("shared story sections"), regardless of condition ( 
Figure 1A
). While participants made many choices during these shared story sections, unbeknownst to them, all choice options led to the same outcomes. This allowed us to examine inter-participant variability in terms of memory (which events were recalled) and choice behavior (which options were selected) when all events were perfectly matched across participants, i.e., all participants read these events, and the events were composed of identical text.


Variability in memory for events.
A recall score (0 = forgotten, 1 = recalled; see Methods for details) for each of the 64 events in the shared story sections was extracted for each participant, composing a vector of recall performance ( 
Figure 2B
). Inter-participant memory similarity was computed as the Pearson correlation between each pair of participants' recall performance vectors 
(Figure 2A-B)
.
Variability in choices made. The option that was selected (1 or 2) at each of the 15 choice-points in the shared story sections was extracted for each Free and Yoked participant (Passive participants made no choices), composing a vector of choice selections. Inter-participant choice similarity was computed as the Pearson correlation between each pair of participants' choice selection vectors.


Memory divergence score.
Each Free participant's memory divergence score was calculated as one minus the Pearson correlation between their recall performance vector and the group averaged recall performance vector, i.e., the more different their memory performance vector was from the group average, the higher their memory divergence score. Similarly, we calculated each Free participant's choice divergence score as one minus the Pearson correlation between their choice selection vector and the group averaged choice selection vector.


Semantic and causal centrality calculations.
Following the methods of Lee & Chen , for semantic narrative network analysis, each event was converted into an embedding vector using the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE 40 ). Semantic centrality, a measure of how strongly interconnected a given event was with other events in the narrative via shared meaning, was calculated for each event by averaging its embedding cosine similarity with all other events in the story path. The effect of semantic centrality on memory was computed as the Pearson correlation between semantic centrality and recall (an event-by-event vector of remembered=1, forgotten=0) for each participant.
For causal narrative network analysis, independent human raters judged which pairs of events were causally linked in a given story path (Adventure: 1 rater per path; Romance: average of 3 raters per path). Causal centrality, a measure of an event's causal connectedness to other events within a narrative, was calculated for each event by averaging across its causal connections with all other events in the story path. The effect of causal centrality on memory was computed as the Pearson correlation between causal centrality and event-by-event recall for each participant.
Neighbor encoding effect. We examined whether recall performance for a given event could be predicted by whether its neighboring events at encoding were recalled, which we term the "neighbor encoding effect". First, for each participant and for each event, we calculated the average of the recall scores for the immediately previous and next events at encoding (the neighbors); for the first and last event, there were neighbors on only one side, and thus these entries consisted merely of recall performance for the next and previous event, respectively. This procedure generated a vector of neighbor recall performance for each participant. We then calculated the neighbor encoding effect as the correlation between the neighbor recall performance vector and the original recall performance vector for each participant.
The neighbor encoding effect is distinct from the concept of temporal order memory, which refers to the tendency for recall to preserve the original order of events in time. Temporal order memory is commonly characterized by the sequential retrieval of items in the order they were experienced. In contrast, the neighbor encoding effect does not incorporate any information about the temporal order in which events are recalled. Instead, it focuses solely on how the encoding of events adjacent to a target event contributes to the recall performance of that event, regardless of their order during retrieval.
In the current study, temporal order memory was measured using the temporal violation rate. For each participant, recall was divided into segments, and we counted the number of times a segment referred to an event that occurred earlier in the story than events in the preceding segment. This count was then normalized by dividing by the total number of recall segments for each participant. Unlike the common temporal order memory measure of lag-conditional response probability (lag-CRP), the temporal violation rate better suits our human recall data. Lag-CRP measures the likelihood of recalling items based on their temporal proximity to the previous recall and assumes a strictly sequential recall process, but in our study, each recall segment can refer to multiple events that may or may not be sequential. This disrupts the assumptions of lag-CRP, making it unsuitable for our analysis. The temporal violation rate, by contrast, captures temporal order memory more effectively by accounting for the flexibility inherent in human recall.

Author contributions


Citation diversity statement
Recent work in several fields of science has identified a bias in citation practices such that papers from women and other minority scholars are under-cited relative to the number of such papers in the field 
61,
62
 . Here we sought to proactively consider choosing references that reflect the diversity of the field in thought, form of contribution, gender, race, ethnicity, and other factors. First, we obtained the predicted gender of the first and last author of each reference by using databases that store the probability of a first name being carried by a woman 
63
 . By this measure and excluding self-citations to the first and last authors of our current paper), our references contain 13.33% woman(first)/woman(last), 13.33% man/woman, 5.63% woman/man, and 67.7% man/man. This method is limited in that a) names, pronouns, and social media profiles used to construct the databases may not, in every case, be indicative of gender identity and b) it cannot account for intersex, non-binary, or transgender people. Second, we obtained predicted racial/ethnic category of the first and last author of each reference by databases that store the probability of a first and last name being carried by an author of color 
64,
65
 . By this measure (and excluding self-citations), our references contain 2.8% author of color (first)/author of color(last), 13.70% white author/author of color, 12.96% author of color/white author, and 70.55% white author/white author. This method is limited in that a) names and Florida Voter Data to make the predictions may not be indicative of racial/ethnic identity, and b) it cannot account for Indigenous and mixed-race authors, or those who may face differential biases due to the ambiguous racialization or ethnicization of their names. We look forward to future work that could help us to better understand how to support equitable practices in science.
