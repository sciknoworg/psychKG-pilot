You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

INTRODUCTION
The valuation of food is central in our daily decision-making about what to eat.
Dysfunctional food valuation is often associated with the development of obesity and eating-disorders 
(Foerde et al., 2015;
Yokum et al., 2011;
Carnell et al., 2012)
. Human neuroimaging studies have begun to uncover the neural basis of food valuation 
(Giuliani et al., 2018;
Rangel, 2013)
 by combining functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (fMRI) with careful assessment of subjective values for food items 
(Fig. 1a
).
Accumulating evidence suggests that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex 
(vmPFC)
 encodes subjective value signals for various types of potential outcomes including food rewards ( 
Fig. 1b)
 
(Bartra et al., 2013;
Clithero and Rangel, 2014;
Chikazoe et al., 2014;
Chib et al., 2009;
Gross et al., 2014;
Lebreton et al., 2009)
.
How is that the value signal for a food reward is constructed in the human brain?
Previous studies suggest that individuals compute the value of a food item by integrating information about multiple attributes from biologically relevant intrinsic factors (e.g., macronutrients, tastes, and flavours) to higher-order extrinsic factors (e.g., labels, brands, prices, and packaging designs) (e.g., 
Satterthwaite and Fellows, 2018;
Steptow et al., 1995)
. For example, food valuation has been found to be driven by the caloric content tracked in the vmPFC 
(Tang et al., 2014)
. Moreover, one study found that the subjective value of a food reward can be predicted by a linear combination of the constituent nutritive attributes 
(Suzuki et al., 2017)
. Neuroimaging data in this study supported the possibility that information on the nutritive attributes of food is represented in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and then integrated in the vmPFC to compute an overall subject value 
(Suzuki et al., 2017)
. Interestingly, a subsequent study demonstrated supra-additive effects of fats and carbohydrates to food valuations beyond the linear combination 
(DiFeliceantonio et al., 2018)
, providing a potential account for overconsumption of high-fat/-carbohydrate food products (e.g., French fries).
Another line of study has attempted to characterise the neural encoding of quality, intensity, and preference for certain tastes and flavours 
(Small et al., 2007)
. One study demonstrated that pleasantness, or quality, of taste is represented in the lOFC, while intensity is represented in the insular cortex and amygdala 
(Small et al., 2003)
. By combining careful experimental designs with multivariate analyses on neuroimaging data, recent studies have elaborated how taste and flavour information is processed in the brain (e.g., 
Avery et al., 2020;
Howard et al. 2015;
Chikazoe et al., 2019)
. 
Chikazoe et al. showed taste qualities (sweet, salty, bitter, and sour)
 are represented in the insular cortex, which supports the notion that the insular is the primary gustatory cortex in humans 
(Small, 2010)
. Howard et al. revealed by the careful manipulation of flavours of odour stimuli, that the lOFC encodes flavour-specific values, while the vmPFC encodes subjective values independent of the flavour. Although the extent to which taste and flavour contribute to the computation of subjective values beyond the nutritive and caloric contents remains elusive (de Araujo et al., 2019), these findings together suggest that the lOFC plays a pivotal role in representing multiple types of information about intrinsic factors of food (e.g., macronutrients, tastes and flavours) which are then integrated in the vmPFC to compute an overall subjective value.
Despite the advancement in our understanding of the influences of intrinsic factors, much less is known about the effects of higher-order extrinsic factors on food valuation in the brain. Increasing evidence in consumer psychology and food science suggests that food valuation can be influenced by various factors outside of the food itself, such as labels, brands, prices, social information, and packaging designs (e.g., 
Higgs, 2015;
Motoki et al., 2018
Motoki et al., , 2020
Okamoto and Dan, 2013;
Piqueras-Fiszman and Spence 2015)
. In this mini review, we discuss our current knowledge about how extrinsic factors affect food valuation in the brain, while maintaining a focus on human neuroimaging (fMRI) studies. Although previous papers have discussed related issues 
(Okamoto and Dan, 2013;
Plassmann et al., 2012;
Stasi et al., 2018)
, the current review provides a new perspective by emphasising how information about food-extrinsic factors gets integrated in the brain to compute an overall subjective value.

EXTRINSIC FACTORS OF FOOD VALUATION


LABELS
In our everyday dietary choices, we often acquire a significant amount of information from the label attached to the food product (e.g., 
Motoki et al., 2020;
 Piqueras-Fiszman and Spence 2015). 
Enax et al. (2015)
 compared two different ways of presenting the nutritional information in a food label. In the control condition, nutritional information was provided by a purely information-based textual label.
Whereas, in the main condition, the same information was provided by a label with colour codes: green and red signalling healthy and unhealthy foods, respectively. The behavioural data showed that the labelling method significantly affected participants' willingness to pay (WTP) for food items. Nutritional labels with colour codes increased WTP for healthy foods compared with the purely information-based labels. The neuroimaging data revealed that, consistent with the previous findings 
(Plassmann et al., 2007)
, WTP for each food item was significantly correlated with neural activity in the vmPFC, regardless of the type of nutritional label. Furthermore, the red signals, indicating unhealthiness, were found to increase neural activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which has been implicated in self-control 
(Hare et al., 2009)
, and modulate its functional connectivity with the vmPFC. These results are consistent with the notion that top-down self-control signals in the dlPFC modulate the food value signals represented in the vmPFC in order to enable an overall decision.
Top-down modulation of the valuation region has been demonstrated to be more prominent in obese female participants, compared to the healthy controls . Ng and colleagues scanned obese and normal females with fMRI while the participants were anticipating receiving a milkshake. Critically, in the experiment, identical milkshakes were delivered with a label indicating it was either "high-fat" or "low-fat". Relative to female participants with normal weight, obese participants showed greater activation in the vmPFC in response to receiving the high-fat labelled milkshake (vs. low-fat labelled one), which could contribute to excessive consumption of high-fat foods.
Grabenhorst and colleagues examined the effects of labels including tasterelated ("rich and delicious taste") descriptions on food valuation by using umami-taste 6 stimuli 
(Grabenhorst et al., 2008)
. They found that pleasantness ratings from tasting the stimuli were increased by the taste-related labels, while intensity ratings were not.
Consistent with the behavioural results, the neural representation of the pleasantness in the vmPFC was enhanced by the taste-related labels, while the representation of the taste intensity in the insular cortex was intact. The same research group also investigated how inclusion of health-related properties (e.g. "high in calories") as well as taste-related properties (e.g., "sweet and juicy") on labels influenced food valuation and choice 
(Grabenhorst et al. 2013)
. The taste-related labels were found to enhance neural representation of taste pleasantness in the amygdala, a core region in the emotional brain system 
(Pessoa, 2017)
. Similarly, the health-related labels also enhanced activity in the amygdala, and amygdala activity predicted the participant's behavioural shift towards heathier choices. These findings together suggest that food value signals represented in the vmPFC are modulated by top-down information about taste and healthiness represented in the amygdala, and further highlight a role of emotion in food choices guided by the labels.
In today's society, many people are conscious about whether their food is produced in an ethical and sustainable way. One study showed a positive effect of an "organic" label on food valuation 
(Linder et al., 2010)
. The authors found that participants' WTP was significantly higher for food items possessing an organic label rather than those without. Furthermore, the presentation of organically labelled foods increased the neural activity in the ventral striatum, and the increased striatal activity accounted for the individual differences in concern for natural food gradients and daily organic food buying behaviour. Another study examined the effect of "fair-trade" labels highlighting ethical sustainability of the food product 
(Enax et al., 2015)
. In the neuroimaging experiment, participants were asked to report their WTP for food items presented with or without a fair-trade label. The behavioural and neuroimaging data revealed that the presence of the label increased WTP, while also increasing neural activity in brain regions such as ventral striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, and superior frontal gyrus. The presentation of the label was also found to modulate functional connectivity between these regions and the vmPFC, which signalled WTP. These results suggest that the fair-trade label influenced valuation of food in the vmPFC through the functional connectivity with the regions that track the label information. 7


PRICE
Our daily purchasing behaviour is guided not only by preference for an item, but also by the price (e.g., 
Jaeger, 2006)
. Underpriced goods are generally preferred, while overpriced goods are avoided. 
Hare et al. (2008)
 demonstrated in their neuroimaging experiment that both the WTP and the price of food determined participants' purchasing decisions. Furthermore, the decision value of a food (defined as the WTP minus the price) was found to be encoded in the lOFC, while WTP was encoded in the vmPFC. Another study 
(Knutson et al., 2007)
 suggests that, in purchasing various goods including food, the brain computes the decision value in the vmPFC, while the ventral striatum tracks WTP and the insular cortex tracks price.
In some cases, a high-priced item may be overvalued based on the belief that expensiveness implies enhanced quality. That is, price information can reinforce the preference (i.e., WTP) for the item. For example, an expensive wine sometimes sells better than a comparable low-priced alternative. Plassman et al. 
2008
addressed this issue with a focus on the experienced pleasantness from consuming a wine. In their neuroimaging experiment, participants were asked to sample different wines and report their experienced pleasantness. The critical manipulation was that, unknown to the participants, the identical wines were administered with different instructions about their retail price (i.e., a high price in half of the cases and a low price in the other cases). They found that price information about the wine was capable of manipulating participants' experienced pleasantness. That is, expectation of higher priced wine increased subjective reports of flavour pleasantness. Moreover, the change in the pleasantness reports were reflected in the neural activity of the vmPFC.
A follow-up study formally tested the tripartite relationship among price, pleasantness, and neural activity 
(Schmidt et al. 2017)
. The results of a multilevel mediation analysis revealed that the effect of price information on experienced pleasantness of wine tasting was mediated by neural activity in the brain valuation system including the vmPFC, ventral striatum, and anterior prefrontal cortex.


BRAND
Brand images can also influence our food choices. One study tested the effect of brand images by examining behavioural and neural responses to soft drink 8 taste tests 
(McClure et al. 2004)
. In the experiment, the authors recruited participants who expressed either a preference for Coke or Pepsi. Within the experiment, participants were asked to make a choice between the two types of soda based on blind-tasting. The data analysis showed that participants' choice pattern was not significantly correlated with their self-reported preference, implying that our daily food choice is predominated by brand images rather than experienced tastes. Furthermore, the preference that was estimated from the choice data, but not the self-report, was found to be represented in the vmPFC. Moreover, they showed that disclosure of the brand information, Coke but not Pepsi, increased participants' preference for Coke and neural activity in dlPFC and hippocampus. A follow-up study 
(Koenigs and Tranel, 2008)
 examined the effect of the Coke brand cue in patients with lesions in the vmPFC.
The authors demonstrated that the Coke label did not alter the patients' preference, suggesting a causal role of vmPFC in processing brand information for food valuation.
Another study 
(Kühn and Gallinat 2013)
 prepared an artificial beverage that consisted of equal parts of Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, and River Cola. The artificial beverage was delivered to participants with different brand name cues: Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, River Cola, and T Cola.The participants exhibited a preference for drinks associated with the famous brands (i.e., Coca and Pepsi Cola) over the others (i.e., River and T Cola) despite the chemical composition being identical. Furthermore, neural activity in the vmPFC was more responsive to the pleasantness rating from consuming the beverage when the cue signalled famous brands compared to the others. These two studies (McClure et al. 2004; Kühn and Gallinat 2013) together suggest that brand images, possibly encoded in the dlPFC and the hippocampus, modulate value signals in the vmPFC.


SOCIAL INFORMATION
Social information, such as the opinions of others, influences our judgment, preferences, and decision-making including food choice (e.g., 
Higgs, 2015;
Suzuki et al., 2016;
Klucharev et al., 2009;
Izuma, 2013)
. 
Nook and Zaki (2015)
 investigated the social influence on the food valuation. They conducted a neuroimaging experiment in which participants (i) first rated how much they wanted to eat a series of foods; (ii) observed peer ratings for the foods; and (iii) again rated each of the food. As expected, the behavioural data showed a social conformity effect: that is, participants' ratings about the foods were conformed to the peers' ratings. At the neural level, agreement between the participants' and the peers' ratings, as compared to disagreement, provoked neural activity in ventral striatum, and the strength of the striatal activity predicted the individual differences in the degree of social conformity. Furthermore, the anterior prefrontal cortex was found to track information about the healthiness of the foods in the initial rating, but tracked popularity (i.e., information about peer ratings) in the second rating.


PACKAGING DESIGN
Packaging design can also affect our flavour expectation and preference for food (e.g., 
Basso et al., 2014;
Spence et al., 2019;
Tijssen et al., 2019)
. One study 
(Van der Laan et al., 2012)
 asked participants to choose between two options of the same snack contained within different packaging designs. The neuroimaging data showed that several brain regions, including the striatum, encoded outcomes of the package-based choices. Reimann et al., (2010) investigated how aesthetic packages and well-known brands influence our purchasing behaviour. Comparing the two packages (i.e., aesthetic and standardized) and the two brands (i.e., well-known and unknown) conditions, they found that food items in aesthetics packages were more likely to be chosen despite higher prices, when compared to well-known brands in standardized packages. The preference for aesthetic packages were reflected in the neural activity of the vmPFC, striatum, and middle to posterior cingulate cortex.


DISCUSSION
Consumer psychology and food science has a long history of demonstrating that our preference for a food reward is modulated by higher-order extrinsic factors (e.g., labels, brand images, prices, social information, and packaging designs) (e.g., 
Higgs, 2015;
Okamoto and Dan, 2013;
Piqueras-Fiszman and Spence 2015)
.
In this mini review, we have discussed recent advancements in decision neuroscience in our understanding of how extrinsic factors affect food value computation in the brain.
Accumulating evidence from human neuroimaging studies has consistently demonstrated that, while vmPFC encodes overall value signals by integrating information about the extrinsic factors of foods (e.g., 
Enax et al. 2015;
Schmidt et al. 2017)
, the various extrinsic factors are encoded in diverse brain regions such as the dlPFC 
(Enax et al. 2015;
McClure et al. 2004)
, the amygdala 
(Grabenhorst et al. 2013)
, the ventral striatum 
(Linder et al., 2010;
Nook and Zaki, 2015;
Schmidt et al. 2017;
Van der Laan et al., 2012)
, and the hippocampus 
(McClure et al. 2004
) (see 
Fig. 2
). These regions cover a wide range of brain functions: cognitive control (dlPFC), emotion (amygdala), reward processing (ventral striatum), and memory (hippocampus).
Interestingly, the involvement of these diverse brain regions contrasts the food value computation based on intrinsic factors, in which information about macronutrients, tastes, and flavours appear to be integrated in the lOFC and sent to the vmPFC where the overall subjective value is computed (e.g., 
Suzuki et al., 2017)
.
The findings discussed in this review are broadly consistent with the notion that extrinsic factors of food reward modulate the value signal in the vmPFC through functional connectivity with multiple brain regions that track information about each extrinsic factor. However, more evidence is needed to deepen the understanding of how the multiple types of information become integrated within the brain to compute an overall food value (see 
Suzuki et al., 2015;
and Suzuki and O'Doherty, 2020
 for similar issues in social decision-making). For example, to elucidate the integration process, it would be helpful to examine the nature of functional and anatomical connectivity among the brain regions engaged in the food valuation (e.g., vmPFC and dlPFC).
Although several studies to date have aimed to address the issue by employing psychophysiological interaction analysis 
(Friston et al., 1997)
, the regression-based connectivity analysis cannot test for the directionality of the connections. Future studies could provide a more comprehensive view by combining various approaches that allow examination of the causal and anatomical interactions among brain regions, such as dynamic causal modelling of the neuroimaging data (e.g., 
Stephan et al., 2010;
Hare et al., 2011)
, transcranial magnetic stimulation of the neural activity (e.g., 
Polania et al., 2018;
Hill et al., 2017)
, and diffusion tensor imaging (e.g., 
Assaf and Pasternak, 2008)
.  
Becker et al., 1964)
. In this task, participants report their "willingness to pay" (i.e. subjective value) for food items. On each trial, they make a bid for one item in the context of auction. Importantly, the auction mechanism is carefully designed so that the optimal strategy for the participants is to always bid the number closest to their true subjective value for obtaining that item. The food image is adopted from
