You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

INTRODUCTION
Counterfactual learning is a crucial and potent aspect of human cognition, enabling individuals to learn not only from their actual experiences but also from hypothetical scenarios that could have occurred if different decisions had been made. In laboratory tasks, counterfactual feedback has been found to enhance learning performance substantially 
[1]
[2]
[3]
 . People may learn from the counterfactual information itself or from the experience of receiving it. For example, fictive information about unmade investments can influence future financial decisions 
4
 , and the anticipation of future regrets can shape gambling attitudes 
5,
6
 . Research has shown that the brain computes fictive prediction errors for counterfactual outcomes alongside prediction errors for experienced outcomes 
[7]
[8]
[9]
 .
These two types of prediction errors, integral to the learning process, are sign-dependent and exhibit opposite patterns, and have been found to align with a confirmation bias hypothesis 
[10]
[11]
[12]
 . Although the temporality of brain activity underlying counterfactual learning has been explored 
13
 , little is known about the temporal dynamics of attention allocation towards counterfactual information during the counterfactual learning process. How are the outcomes of unchosen actions taken into account by humans, and how does this depend on the outcomes of the chosen ones? Understanding these dynamics is crucial for providing deeper insights into how to present feedback in an optimal manner to capture peoples attention effectively.
Over the last two decades, robust empirical evidence has emphasized the impact of attention allocation on value-based decision making 
[14]
[15]
[16]
[17]
[18]
[19]
[20]
[21]
[22]
 and reinforcement learning (RL) 
[23]
[24]
[25]
[26]
[27]
 . In RL tasks, humans allocate more attention to options with higher estimated values and uncertainties, directly influencing their decisions 
26
 . They also focus on the relevant dimensions of presented stimuli 
23,
24
 and on the relevant stimuli when surrounded by irrelevant ones 
25
 . At the outcome stage, attention has been found to be preferentially directed towards outcomes that generate the greatest surprise, measured as unsigned prediction errors 
26
 and to the momentarily relevant dimensions 
23,
24
 . Subjects in these studies focus on information relevant to the task at hand and particularly on the feedback of their chosen option. However, how would subjects allocate their attention if they were given counterfactual feedback? This information would be relevant to the task while not resulting from a decision made by the subject.
In the present study, we used a 2-arm bandit task with complete information 
10
 , where participants received feedback on each trial about both the outcome of the chosen option and the outcome of the unchosen one. The latter represents the counterfactual feed-back of their decision, or what they would have received if they had selected a different option. Subjects performed the task while wearing an eye-tracking device, allowing us to record their gaze and pupil size throughout the experiment. To our knowledge, this is the first study analysing the dynamics of attention allocation during counterfactual learning.
First, we replicated recent behavioral and computational findings showing that subjects update their expectations differently depending on both the type of information received (factual vs. counterfactual) and the sign of the prediction errors (positive vs. negative). This pattern is interpreted as a confirmation bias in reinforcement learning 
10,
12,
28
 . We then show that fixation at the feedback stage follow a specific pattern with a first fixation on the factual outcome and the second one on the counterfactual outcome. Interestingly, only the fixation on the counterfactual outcome depended on the values of the feedback. Both the factual and counterfactual outcomes' values impacted the attention allocation towards the counterfactual feedback, and this in an opposite direction, supporting the confirmation bias hypothesis. We also show that a similar interactions between the two outcomes impacted pupil size during the feedback process.Consistent with a recent study, we found that the value effect on pupil size did not reflect pure surprise 
29
 , but instead was sign-and choice-dependent.


RESULTS


Behavioural task and physiological recordings
Subjects performed a 2-arm bandit task with full information replicated from 
10
 (see 
Figure 1)
. In this task, subjects must learn through trial and error which of the two options presented on the computer screen is more rewarding. The time course of the trial is shown in 
Figure 1
.A. After making a decision, subjects are presented with the outcome for both the chosen and the unchosen options (i.e. 1 or −1). In some conditions, one option is better than the other and leads more often to a positive outcome; in other conditions, the options are equally rewarding, or the most rewarding option becomes the least rewarding after half of the trials.
While performing the task, subjects wore an eye-tracking device that recorded both their pupil size and gaze.

Subjects are biased towards confirmatory information
We modelled subjects' behaviour in the task with a reinforcement learning model able to account for confirmatory biases in valuebased decisions 
10
 . The model compounds two learning rates, one for confirmatory prediction errors 
(PEs)
 
Figure 2A
 bar and scatter plots).
Additionally, we found that subjects exhibited typical behavioural signature of confirmation bias in reinforcement learning 
10
 which include persevering behaviours after an environmental change ( 
Figure 2B
, middle panel) and a very high preferred response rate in environments with no best options ( 
Figure 2B,
 
Figure 2B
, middle panel). The second signature refers to the preferential selection of a unique option when both are equally rewarding. This tendency is present in every subjects but is accentuated in the most heavily biased ones (low=0.59ś0.10, high=0.74ś0.17, t34=-3.26ś0.14, p<0.01, two-sample two-sided ttest, 
Figure 2B
, right panel). Note that in conditions with a best response, the two groups have similar performance (low=0.86ś0.12, high=0.89ś0.10, t34=-0.82ś0.11, p=0.41, two-sample twosided ttest, 
Figure 2B
, left panel). 


Temporality of counterfactual feedback processing
While subjects performed the task, they wore an eye-tracking device that recorded their gaze and pupil size. Focusing on their gaze first, we analyzed the targets of their attention allocation around the decision onset and the feedback presentation ( 
Figure 1A)
.
Replicating previous results 14, 
21
 , we found that subjects looked preferentially at the option to be chosen in the moment preceding their choice (Pchosen=0.75ś0.12, t35=12.68ś0.12, p<0.001, one-sample two-sided ttest, 
Figure 3A)
. Regarding the feedback onset ( 
Figure 3B
), we found that subjects first attended to the factual outcome for about 375ms before attending to the counterfactual outcome for an average of 550ms. These phases were followed by a new fixation on the factual outcome until the end of the feedback presentation (i.e. 1.5s). Interestingly, we found that the timing of this fixation pattern was modulated by both the factual and the counterfactual outcomes' value. While the initial fixation on the factual outcome was not affected by either outcomes' value, the subsequent fixation on the counterfactual outcome was. The factual outcome value was positively linked with a decrease in the time spent exploring the counterfactual outcome ( 
Figure 3C
, upper left panel), while the opposite was true for the value of the counterfactual outcome ( 
Figure 3C, upper right panel)
. In other words, subjects receiving a positive outcome from their decisions tended to decrease their attention allocation to the counterfactual outcome, and the same was observed when subjects were facing a negative counterfactual outcome.
To further analyse this effect, we derived a general linear model (GLM1) with the gaze side (chosen vs. unchosen options) as the explained variable. We used as predictors factual and counterfactual outcomes as well as a third variable encoding the similarity between both outcomes ( 
Figure 3C
, lower left panel). We fitted the model at each time point (every 50ms) of our signal from 0.5s before the outcomes' delivery to 2.5s after the delivery. Confirming our descriptive results, we found significant effects of the factual and counterfactual outcomes on the gaze side at the moment of the counterfactual outcome exploration. These effects are in opposite directions with positive factual outcomes driving the gaze away from the counterfactual feedback and positive counterfactual outcome driving the gaze towards it. In other words, subjects tended to ignore counterfactual option's outcome after being rewarded, and even more so if this counterfactual outcome was negative. On the contrary, subjects tended to explore more the counterfactual outcome following a negative factual outcome, even more so when this counterfactual outcome was positive. Additionally, we observed a positive effect of outcome similarity on attention to the chosen outcome. Specifically, when participants were presented with a counterfactual outcome similar to the factual one, they tended to pay less attention to it, regardless of whether the outcome was positive or negative.
This pattern of attention allocation modulated by outcome values aligns with the confirmation bias hypothesis in reinforcement learning. Indeed, both factual and counterfactual outcomes that confirm subjects' choices (i.e., positive factual outcomes and negative counterfactual outcomes) tend to reduce the attention given to the potential outcomes that could have resulted from alternative decisions. 
Figure 3C
, lower right panel illustrates this, showing that the attention directed toward counterfactual outcomes decreases as the confirmatory nature of the outcome combination increases. In other words, the more confirmatory the outcome combination, the less attention is paid to what might have been.
Interestingly, the difference in attention towards the factual outcome between the most confirmatory and most disconfirmatory situations was directly linked to how strongly subjects relied on confirmatory feedback. We found a positive correlation between the peak difference in attention defined as the average difference in attention towards the factual outcome between the most confirmatory and disconfirmatory situations, from 1 second to 1.5 seconds after outcome presentation and the confirmatory learning rate αc (rho=0.47, p<0.01). Notably, this difference was not correlated with the other model parameters, such as the softmax temperature (rho=-0.21, p=0.21) or the disconfirmatory learning rate α d (rho=0.28, p=0.09), underscoring the specific link between attention and confirmatory feedback in the learning process. This specific link also remains significant when all model parameters are included as explanatory variables in a single GLM, with the peak difference in attention as the dependent variable (Supplementary 
Table 1
).


Pupil size does not encode counterfactual outcomes alone
Both factual and counterfactual outcome values influenced attention allocation during feedback presentation. However, only factual outcome value had a direct impact on pupil size. First, we observed a biphasic pupil size response both around the decision ( 
Figure 4A
) and around the outcome delivery ( 
Figure 4B)
, characterized by early dilation followed by late constriction, consistent with recent findings ( 29 ). Notably, this response was directly modulated by factual outcome value ( 
Figure 4C, upper left panel)
,
while counterfactual outcome value did not produce a significant effect ( 
Figure 4C, upper right panel)
. Negative factual outcomes were associated with reduced late constriction ( 
Figure 4C, upper left panel)
, whereas counterfactual outcomes had no significant overall impact on pupil size. To further validate these observations, we developed a new general linear model (GLM2), with normalized pupil size as the dependent variable. We used as predictors factual and counterfactual outcomes as well as a third variable encoding the similarity between both outcomes. The model was applied at each time point of the pupil size signal (every 50 ms). tual outcome value on pupil size, while counterfactual outcome value had no significant direct effect. We also observed a strong negative effect of outcome similarity on pupil size. Specifically, when participants were presented with a counterfactual outcome similar to the factual one, their pupil size was smaller compared to when the outcomes were dissimilar, regardless of whether the outcomes were positive or negative.
To further investigate the role of counterfactual outcome values in modulating pupil size, we extended our analysis to explore inter-  action effectsspecifically, the effect of similaritybetween factual and counterfactual outcomes. Different combinations of these outcomes elicited distinct pupil responses ( 
Figure 4C, lower right panel)
. As expected, combinations involving a positive factual outcome resulted in smaller pupil sizes compared to those involving a negative factual outcome. However, the pupil response also varied based on whether the counterfactual outcome was identical to or different from the factual one. In particular, when the counterfactual outcome was identical to the factual one, pupil size tended to decrease, regardless of the valence of the outcomes.
In contrast to the attention results, we did not observe any significant correlations between the peak difference in pupil dilation defined as the average difference in pupil size between the most confirmatory and disconfirmatory situations, from 1 second to 1.5 seconds after outcome presentation and any of the confirmation model parameters. Specifically, there were no correlations with the softmax temperature (rho=-0.13, p=0.44), the confirmarory learning rate αc (rho=-0.02, p=0.92), or disconfirmatory learning rate α d (rho=-0.02, p=0.89).


DISCUSSION
By combining a reinforcement learning task and eye-tracking, we demonstrated that attention allocation towards counterfactual options depends on both the perceived value of these options and the perceived value of the chosen option. In other words, subjects tend to attend less to alternatives after experiencing a positive outcome and when the outcomes from the alternatives themselves were negative. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at analyzing attentional allocation towards counterfactual events within a reinforcement learning task.
First we replicated recent behavioural and computational findings 
[10]
[11]
[12]
 , demonstrating that subjects learning in a bandit task, exhibited a confirmation bias while updating the different options' value. In other words, they tended to consider more confirmatory outcomes (i.e. positive factual and negative counterfactual outcomes) than disconfirmatory outcomes (i.e. negative factual and positive counterfactual outcomes) when updating their expectations. Using a variant of the Q-learning model, we found that their learning rate for confirmatory prediction errors was significantly greater than their learning rate for disconfirmatory prediction errors.
Additionally, we found that subjects exhibited the two key behavioural signatures of confirmatory reinforcement learning 
10
 . Indeed, the stronger their confirmation bias the slower they were to adapt to a change in the environment contingencies. Moreover, a higher confirmation bias was also associated with a higher preferred response rate in the symmetric conditions. Most heavily biased subjects were then more prone both to stick with previously learned options in changing environment and to focus on a unique option in environments with equally valued option.
We then analysed how subjects allocated their attention at the outcome stage using gaze tracking. We identified a general pattern where participants first fixated on the chosen option, even after outcome revelation, followed by a fixation on the alternative outcomes, and sometimes a return to the chosen option. Subjects then explored first the factual outcomes and only after the counterfactual ones. Specifically, this pattern was modulated by the value of both the factual and counterfactual outcomes. Indeed, while the fixation on the factual outcomes was unaltered by the latter, the fixation on the counterfactual outcome depended on both the values of both the factual and the counterfactual outcomes, and this in an opposite direction. A positive factual outcome tended to diminish the time spent observing the counterfactual outcome, while a positive counterfactual outcome tended to increase this time.
Interestingly, the similarity between the factual and counterfactual outcomes also influenced attention allocation towards decision feedback. Specifically, when the counterfactual outcome mirrored the factual one, participants allocated less attention to the counterfactual outcome. Conversely, when the outcomes differed, attention to the counterfactual outcome increased. This suggests that, beyond outcome valence, outcome similarity negatively impacts the exploration of alternatives. When the outcomes do not indicate any valuable information for future decision-making (e.g. a difference between the two outcomes of a binary decision), individuals are less likely to invest time in exploring alternative scenarios. Recent studies 
23,
24
 have shown that, in reinforcement learning tasks involving multi-dimensional stimuli, participants focused on the dimensions that were momentarily relevant to the task.
Similarly, in our study, participants tended to pay more attention to alternatives when their outcomes differed from those of chosen options, making them relevant for future decisions in a binary choice task.
The observed attention allocation pattern suggests a link between attention to alternatives and the extent to which outcomes confirm the choices made, aligning with the confirmation bias hypothesis in reinforcement learning 
[10]
[11]
[12]
 . This hypothesis posits that humans tend to focus more on information that confirms their recent choice, namely positive outcomes for the chosen option and negative outcomes for the unchosen option. Our gaze analysis indicates that attention allocated to alternatives is inversely related to the degree of outcome confirmation. When all available information supports one's decision, minimal attention is directed toward exploring what could have been. This is of prime importance, as it suggests that the selective attention characteristic of confirmation bias 
30
 can be observed even when individuals are confronted with neutral stimuli with which they have no prior history of interaction. Previous studies 
[10]
[11]
[12]
 have suggested that disconfirmatory information is less likely to be considered in the updating of future expectations in reinforcement learning task. Our study takes this a step further, indicating that alternatives tend to be simply ignored when current outcomes appear to confirm one's decision, and that the degree of this selective ignorance seems to be directly linked to how much emphasis is placed on newly observed confirmatory information.
Regarding pupil size, we observed that it was directly influenced by the value of the factual outcome after it was delivered. Pupil size is closely linked to changes in central arousal states and is commonly used as a marker for perceived task difficulty, cognitive load, neural gain , and an indicator of surprise 
[32]
[33]
[34]
 . In our study, a negative factual outcome was associated with pupil dilation one second after outcome delivery. This effect was further modulated by the counterfactual outcome, depending on whether it was similar or dissimilar to the factual one. Specifically, a dissimilar counterfactual outcome tended to increase pupil dilation, while a similar one tended to decrease it. These findings suggest that the combination of a negative factual outcome and a positive counterfactual outcome representing a disconfirmatory scenario elicited the highest level of pupil dilation. For a subject biased toward confirmatory information, this scenario is particularly surprising, as the chosen option was unfavorable while the dismissed option was favorable. This also aligns with recent research showing that feedback on the most erroneous decisions leads to the greatest pupil dilation in perceptual choice tasks 
35,
36
 . In our reinforcement learning task with full information, the presence of the counterfactual outcome introduces additional layers of perceived successes and errors. The disconfirmatory scenario (i.e., a negative factual outcome paired with a positive counterfactual outcome) represents the highest level of perceived error in relation to the most recent decision, which is in turn likely to induce the greatest level of surprise in participants trying to learn the task.
Counterfactual information in reinforcement learning task allow better performance by mitigating the need for exploration. Interestingly, this information is no treated equally as the factual information. At the computational level, confirmation bias implies an opposite valence-dependent treatment of outcomes between factual and counterfactual ones. We tend to consider more positive experienced outcomes and negative foregone ones and vice versa. Moreover the allocation of attention towards counterfactual information is directly affected by both received information and the counterfactual information itself. We are less likely to pay attention to alternatives when we already received satisfaction from our own decision and this particularly if they appear similar. Finally, counterfactual information impact the individual arousal level by increasing or decreasing the level of perceived error of the recently made decision, the most disconfirmatory combination eliciting the most pupil dilation.


METHODS


Subjects
40 subjects (20 males and 20 females) have been recruited through LMU's mailing lists and recruiting platforms, and tested one at a time in our experimental laboratory. The inclusion criteria were: vaccination against Covid-19, normal vision (i.e. no glasses, no contact lenses, no eye irritations), no neurological disorders, no physical discomfort. The exclusion criteria were: a performance in the task not significantly higher than chance level, a task not fully completed, data recording failure or any kind of data loss. Subjects perform the task while wearing an eye-tracking device recording both their gaze and pupils size, further details are given below in the Methods subsection 4.4 Pupillometry. No subjects has been excluded based on performance. However, 3 subjects have been excluded due to storage failure and 1 for excessive noise in the gaze data recording. 36 subjects have been used for the analyses presented in this paper.


Behavioural task
The behavioural task is a 2-arm bandit task adapted from 
10
 where a detailed description can be found, and built in PsychoPy 37 .
It compounds four different conditions (i.e. with probabilities of getting the positive reward of .75/.25, .75/.25, .50/.50 and .87/.13) 
(Fig.1 B)
 and two sessions of 96 trials (24 per condition). Probabilities are stable across the experiment except for condition 4 (.87/. 
13)
 where probabilities reverse for the second half of the trials in each session.
Each trial follows the same time course 
(Fig.1 A)
. First, subjects are presented a 2-second fixation screen where the fixation cross onset is set at 1.2 ś 0.5 second. Then, a decision screen displays the two options of the current condition to the subjects, who have to select one of them. The decision screen is displayed until subjects select an option. A third screen, lasting 1.5 seconds, indicates to the subjects their selection. Finally, rewards obtained for both the chosen and the unchosen options are displayed for 1.5 seconds.


Computational modeling
We modelled subjects' behaviour using a reinforcement learning model first described in 
10
 . The model is a variant of a Q-Learning 
38
 allowing unequal treatment of confirmatory and disconfirmatory information through two different learning rates, one for each type of information (i.e. confirmatory and disconfirmatory). In our task, count as confirmatory information, positive feedback for the chosen option and negative feedback for the unchosen option. Similarly, count as disconfirmatory information, negative feedback for the chosen option and positive feedback for the unchosen option. The Q-value of the chosen option Q ch is updated such that:
Q t+1 ch = Q t ch +        αc * P E t ch , if P E t ch > 0 α d * P E t ch , if P E t ch < 0
while the unchosen option Qun is updated such that:
Q t+1 un = Q t un +        α d * P E t un , if P E t un > 0 αc * P E t un , if P E t un < 0
where αc is the learning rate for confirmatory information, α d is the learning rate for disconfirmatory information and PE the prediction error associated to related option. The decision is made through a softmax policy. The probability of choosing option 1 over option 2 at time t is computed as:
P t 1 = e Q t 1 /β e Q t 1 /β + e Q t 2 /β
Where β is the softmax temperature. The probability of choosing option 2 is computed equivalently. The model is fitted by negative log-likelihood minimisation using the fmincon function in Matlab.


Pupillometry
Pupil diameter was recorded using a Pupil Core headset 
39
 , through the binocular 200Hz eye cameras and the high-speed world camera. As with the visual stimulus on the monitor and the user input (participants key presses), pupil data recording (via the Pupil Capture software 
[1]
) were also administered through our experiment scripts, designed and written in Python using the PsychoPy software 
37
 . The Pupil Capture software was configured to run the real-time pupil detection and eye video recording at 120Hz.
After the recording session, pupil data preprocessing steps included the rejection of physiologically invalid data (pupil size out of the range of 1 to 9 millimeters), the rejection of blinks (flagged by the software), the rejection of data points recorded with low technical confidence (also flagged by the software), the rejection of data points preceding or following physiologically impossible dilation speed, merging the data from both eyes into one time series and smoothing the merged time series using a 4th-order low-pass filter with the cutoff frequency of 4Hz. Following the preprocessing steps, data was epoched using trial triggers, interpolated in a backward method, Z-scored in each block, resampled with a frequency of 20Hz and baseline-corrected subtractively.


Gaze analysis
Gaze data was similarly recorded using the Pupil Core headset synchronised with our Python experiment. Gaze position was rep-

Negative x-values indicate positions left of the center and positive x-values indicate positions right of the center. Similarly, negative y-values indicate positions below the center and positive y-values indicate positions above the center. Similarly to pupil data, gaze data was epoched using trial triggers and resampled with a frequency of 20Hz.


and the second one for disconfirmatory prediction errors (See Methods for more details). Positive PEs for the chosen option and negative PEs for the unchosen option are viewed as confirmatory. Conversely, negative PEs for the chosen option and positive PEs for the unchosen option are viewed as disconfirmatory. In line with previous studies, we found that subjects placed more emphasis on confirmatory PEs compared to disconfirmatory ones, as computationally represented by a higher learning rate for confirmatory PEs (αc=0.54ś0.26, and α d =0.19ś0.17, t35=11.35ś0.19, p<0.001, one-sample two-sided ttest,
