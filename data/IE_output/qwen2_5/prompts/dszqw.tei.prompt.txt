Abstract
Various formal and informal models of eyewitness memory have been proposed.
While serving to guide both the construct and analytical frameworks of research within the field, these models have yet to be critically tested through a process of empirical falsification. This study addresses this gap by critically testing four hypotheses: the hypotheses that eyewitness memory possesses both (1) random-scale and (2) monotoniclikelihood representation; the hypothesis that eyewitness memory data is (3) accurately predicted by high-threshold (HT) models; and the hypothesis that a mathematical model of eyewitness identification provides a (4) good representation of the psychological constructs of eyewitness memory and decision making. After investigating the 
Block-
Marschak inequalities test for random-scale and monotonic-likelihood representation and developing a new critical test for the falsification of the high threshold (HT) models, two experiments were conducted online with a total of 5,056 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Experiment 1 collected k-AFC probabilities for lineup sizes ∈ 2, … ,7 . Experiment 2 collected identification and ranking probabilities from a simultaneous 8-item lineup using a 3 (strong, weak, very weak memory) x 2 (low vs high expectation) x 2 (target-present vs target-absent) between-subject experimental design.
Eyewitness identification outcomes were shown to have both random-scale and monotonic likelihood representation, thus allowing for development of a mathematical model. The 2HT models of eyewitness memory were falsified and superseded by an alternative surviving model-signal detection theory (SDT). Finally, the predictive ability of the unequal-variance (UV) SDT model of simultaneous lineup identification (assuming a MAX decision rule) was confirmed, as was the independence of the model's parameters and its generalizability across task structures. It was concluded that the UV-SDT class of models provide an evidence-based account of eyewitness identification behavior, support the measurement of empirical eyewitness identification data, and have facilitated a shift towards the building of stronger scientific evidence.
Letting go of the Grail: Falsifying the theory of "true" eyewitness identifications Early discussions within both the judiciary and academia (see 
Sporer, 2008)
, coupled with later evidence collected by psychological researchers (for brief reviews see Police 
Executive Research Forum, 2013;
Yates, 2017)
, have led to the gradual introduction of new eyewitness identification procedures and processes which aim to improve the probative value of eyewitness identification evidence 
(Devlin Committee, 1976;
Higgs, 2011;
Newirth, 2016)
. At the forefront of these improvements has been the development and implementation of novel identification tasks, including the introduction of the lineup task 
(British Home Department, 1929)
, the inclusion of unbiased identification instructions 
(Malpass & Devine, 1981)
, and the development and implementation of the sequential lineup 
(Lindsay & Wells, 1985)
, each of which aim to increase the diagnosticity of eyewitness identification evidence 1 by mitigating false identification risk.
However, the introduction of such measures compels us to ask the question "at what cost?" ; a question that seems to remain open for debate within the literature.
The earliest development in eyewitness identification processes involved the embedding of a suspect amongst five or more innocent persons, or fillers, commonly referred to as a lineup identification task. By increasing the eyewitness's choice-set, the lineup task introduces the possibility that an eyewitness will make a known, rather than an unknown, identification error 2 and thus be eliminated as reliable witness. The lineup's structure effectively reduces the risk of false identification by spreading such errors across the fillers within the lineup. This provides a level of protection to an innocent suspect. However, what if the suspect is instead guilty? By adding fillers to the choice-set, does this not simply increase the risk of erroneous filler selection and thus reduce the chance of making a correct identification? According to the theory of filler siphoning 
(Wells, 1993
(Wells, , 2001
, because the processes governing target detection are independent to those governing guessing behavior, the presence of fillers does not significantly hinder the eyewitness's ability to detect a guilty suspect amongst them. Thus, filler siphoning provides an explanation for the superiority of lineups over showups 
(Yarmey & Yarmey, 1996)
, and by inference predicts a positive relationship between lineup size and probative value. In other words, the addition of a filler to a lineup will result in an increase in diagnosticity without incurring a corresponding increase to the rate of the missed identifications. However, this is not necessarily a view shared by all researchers (for example see 
Yang, Smalarz, Moody, Cabell, & Copp, 2019)
.
The second major modification to eyewitness identification procedures was the introduction of the unbiased lineup instruction. By providing additional information to eyewitnesses that "the lineup may or may not include the culprit", eyewitnesses are provided with the explicit option to reject a lineup. Under the theory of absolute and relative judgements 
(Lindsay & Wells, 1985;
Wells, 1984)
, unbiased lineups allow eyewitnesses to shift away from making a high-risk relative judgement, in which the most familiar lineup member is identified, and towards the more accurate absolute judgement, in which the most familiar lineup member is selected if, and only if, they adequately match the eyewitness's memory of the culprit. As a result, the risk that an eyewitness will automatically identify an innocent suspect, simply because they are the lineup member who looks most like the culprit, is mitigated. However, while unbiased instructions increase the diagnosticity of suspect identifications, the absolute judgement model predicts they will also come at a cost of missed identifications 
(Yang et al., 2019)
.
Tempering this account, 
Wells, Steblay, and Dysart's (2012)
 theory of partial memory suggests instead that such costs weigh more heavily on accurate guesses than on "true" identifications, which are made only by eyewitness who accurately detect a guilty suspect. If proven, this dichotomous view of hit types-detections and random guessesshifts the focus of performance improvement towards the preservation of good identifications (detections), and elimination of bad identifications (random guesses), thus making the issue of "cost" a moot point.
A third major modification occurred more recently with a considerable number of jurisdictions in the United States and Canada introducing sequential lineups in the hope that this new format would better eliminate non-credible eyewitnesses and thus improve the probative value of identification evidence brought before courts 
(Lindsay, 1999)
.
However, since the widespread adoption of sequential lineups, there has been no true consensus regarding its superiority to traditional simultaneous presentations. For example, while there is some evidence that simultaneous lineups produce identifications with greater diagnosticity ratios 
(Lindsay & Wells, 1985;
Steblay, Dysart, & Wells, 2011)
, other forms of analysis, such as ROC curve analysis 
(Mickes, 2015)
 and signal detection theory (SDT) modelling suggest they either reduce the eyewitness's overall ability to make a correct identification 
(Amendola & Wixted, 2015a;
Wixted, Gronlund, & Mickes, 2014)
 or provide no benefit at all to overall decision accuracy 
(Kaesler, Dunn, Ransom, & Semmler, 2020)
. So, while the simultaneous presentation might increase the probability that an identified suspect is guilty, it may be doing so at the cost of incorrectly identifying an innocent one.
Despite these significant efforts towards maximizing the probative value of eyewitness identifications without enduring the cost of increased missed identifications, little research effort has been given towards gaining a better understanding of the processes that underpin eyewitness identification decisions. However, this does not mean that formalized models of eyewitness memory cannot be developed and applied successfully. Nor does it mean we must discard existing verbal models and theories. In fact, these may be utilized in the consideration of the development of formal model structures (e.g., 
Clark, 2003)
. For example, relative judgement theory suggests that eyewitnesses have access to continuously graded information, reflecting a signal detection theory (SDT) representation of eyewitness memory on which all current mathematical models of eyewitness memory are grounded. However, in contradiction to this proposition of continuous information, filler siphoning and partial memory theories each suggest that eyewitnesses only have access to a small number of discrete states of knowledge, i.e., accurate detection of guilty and innocent lineup members, and nondetection. They thus reflect instead a high-threshold (HT) representation of eyewitness memory. As a result of this contradiction, eyewitness researchers remain at a crossroads regarding our understanding of the nature of both identification accuracy and identification errors. Do they emanate from the employment of some continuously graded stochastic process 3 whereby the elimination of error becomes impossible? Or are they produced via a discrete-state process under which identification accuracy could be virtually guaranteed, if only eyewitnesses did not insist on identifying suspects by guessing?
Such questions may only be satisfactorily answered by exploring the underlying structure of eyewitness memory and decision making. We therefore seek to identify the most appropriate theoretical and analytical frameworks required to support such explorations. This requires a dedicated scientific program of study that seeks to identify and describe potential models of eyewitness memory, critical test their predictions, and validate their suitability in representing the psychological constructs underlying eyewitness memory and identification decision making, namely the eyewitness's ability to discriminate between guilty and innocent lineup members-discriminability-and their propensity to identify someone from the lineup, or not-decision bias.


The Current Study
Our study has three distinct aims. Firstly, we aim to provide support for the mathematical modeling of eyewitness memory by critically testing the assumptions that underlie them-stochastic process and monotonic likelihood representation. By surviving these critical tests, we may gain confidence in our assessment of the appropriateness of mathematical models of eyewitness identification decision making. Secondly, we aim to critically test the two competing classes of mathematical models-HT and SDT modelssuch that only one model class might survive and thus succeeds the other. In achieving this, the surviving model will inform our answer to questions regarding the existence of "true" identifications. For example, if the HT model class is falsified, then we must concede that there are no "true" identifications and that a reduction in false identification rates cannot be without cost of increased missed identifications. Whereas, if the SDT model class is falsified, then support is provided for either the elimination of guessing behavior amongst eyewitnesses, or the development of tests which might more accurately diagnose a "true" identification. Finally, we aim to verify the surviving model class by testing its ability to predict empirical data, by assessing the linkage between these models' parameters and key psychological constructs (e.g., discriminability and decision bias), as well their generalizability across various task structures.


Critical tests of stochastic process and monotonic likelihood representation.
A full exploration of critical tests of stochastic processes was initiated by 
(Block & Marschak, 1959)
, who demonstrated that forced-choice probabilities based on a stochastic process representation must satisfy a specific set of inequalities (see Appendix:A critical test for random scale representation hypothesis). However, it was not until a proof of the converse-that choice probabilities which satisfy the Block-Marschak inequalities (BMIs) must have a random utility (i.e., stochastic) representation 
(Falmagne, 1978)
-that this set of choice probabilities could be used as a test of random-scale representation. 
Kellen, Winiger, Dunn, & Singmann (2021)
 further transitioned to the context of a k-alternative forced choice (k-AFC) task by using the resulting system of BMIs to critically test recognition memory for words. By aggregating choice data from 110 participants, which produced approximately 1,000 observations for each of seven k-AFC condition groups, where k  {2,…,8} these researchers found that the resulting data provided near-perfect fits to data predicted by the BMI constraints. Furthermore, the data continued to conform to the BMIs constrained such that only monotonically decreasing likelihood solutions were included. For a detailed explanation of the BMI test, please refer to Appendix: A critical test for the monotonic likelihood hypothesis.


Critical test of high-threshold representation.
A critical test of discrete state representation was initially developed by 
Kellen and Klauer (2014)
, who showed that certain classes of discrete state models-highthreshold (HT) models-may be distinguished from all other models in terms of first-and second -conditional choice probabilities 
4
  c was correlated with 1 c in that they were both larger for participants in the strong condition than for those in the weak condition. Similar results
were also found by 
McAdoo and Gronlund (2016)
, who extended the experiment to the recognition of faces.
However, a shortcoming of this proposed test is the inherent assumption that memory strength only affects the probability of target detection. Yet, it is conceivable that when strengthening the representation of a target in memory, this may conjointly increase the chance that one or more fillers are also detected, thus increasing the probability of the rejection of target-absent lineups-a theoretical process called differentiation 
(Criss, 2006
) that aligns well with the theory of partial memory. For example, partial memory of the culprit, such as face shape, could lead to the elimination of all lineup members with non-matching face shapes. In this case, the probability of detection for both the target and each filler is affected. As such, it is desirable to develop an alternative test that relaxes the 2 c test's assumption of fixed rates of filler detection. In doing so, it is important to move beyond first and second choices and instead consider the full range of conditional ranking probabilities, that is, 1 , n c c  , also known as hazard distributions. The hazards predicted by HT and SDT models of eyewitness identification at three different memory strengths (no memory, weak memory, and strong memory) are illustrated in 
Figure 1
, below. The results show that the two model-classes predict opposing patterns of hazard rates as discriminability increases. For example, the hazard function predicted by the HT model class becomes more concave for x>1 as memory increases, while that predicted by the SDT model becomes more convex. For formal descriptions of these predictions, please refer to the Appendix: A critical test for the monotonic likelihood hypothesis. SDT model only predicts monotonically increasing hazard rates for all ranks >1 for small rank 1 hazard values (e.g., in the case where the eyewitness has no memory of the perpetrator). However, as the rank 1 value increases, the SDT's predicted hazard rates for ranks >1 become non-monotonic.


Verification of the surviving model
The nature of theories of eyewitness memory requires that any formal model of eyewitness identification decision making includes parameters that independently represent eyewitness discriminability (i.e., the ability of the eyewitness to discriminate between their memory of a previously seen perpetrator, guilty suspects, and innocent lineup members) and decision bias (towards either identifying someone or rejecting the lineup). Thus, models of eyewitness identification that survive the critical testing of their assumptions and predictions should be further assessed to ensure both the predictive strength of the model and the psychological plausibility of their parameters. These tests require fitting the model as well as a set of constrained versions of that model (each of which constrain one or more parameters) against empirical eyewitness identification outcomes using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods. Finally, the independence of the model's discriminability parameter, which is inherently linked to the latent variable of familiarity, will be assessed by comparing parameter values across two different task structures-ranking and identification-while keeping all other variables constant (e.g., encoding conditions, stimuli, lineup presentation, and prior expectation). If the discriminability parameter is shown to be indifferent to task structure, we may conclude that the latent variable is indeed independent and the model both generalizable and robust.


Method
The design of this study required the collection of eyewitness identification data from three distinct tasks-the k-AFC task, the simultaneous lineup task, and the ranking task.
To maximize the number of observations collected, a program of two separate experiments was designed such that data for each required task was collected only once.
The first experiment primarily collected the k-AFC probabilities from a series lineup sizes k  {2,…,7}. The second experiment collected lineup identification data, confidence ratings, justification statements (required for another study), and ranking probabilities from an 8-item simultaneous lineup. This experiment manipulated target presence and attempted to manipulate both discriminability and decision bias (via memory strength and target-present base-rate information manipulations, respectively).

Participants
The participants in this study were recruited online through Amazon Mechanical Turk (www.mturk.com) and paid $1.70 on completion of the assigned experimental task(s). Eligibility requirements for inclusion to the experiment were age ≥18 years, normal vision or corrected to normal vision, and English-language proficiency.
Participants self-selected their participation in one of three experiments, although they were not aware of the structure of these experiments. No participant was allowed to enter or complete more than one experiment. On entering the experimental task, each participant was randomly assigned to a manipulation group. They were then screened for videos of male actors were also randomly selected from the database. These were presented sequentially in pairs during the distraction phase of each experiment. The selection (without replacement) of paired videos from the pool was also randomized.


General procedure
During the study phase of each experiment, participants were asked to watch the encoding video closely and without interruption. Following this, they performed a The aim of Experiment 1 was to collect k-AFC probabilities for k  {2,…,7}. 5 On entering the experiment, participants were randomly allocated to one of the six k-item lineup size manipulation groups, with final group sizes of 
335, 353, 336, 328, 338, and 336
, respectively. All participants first viewed the target video and then completed a visual search distractor task. Participants in manipulation groups 1, 2, …, 6 were then presented with a 2-, 3-, …, or 7-item target-present lineup, respectively. They then completed a forced-choice task by selecting "the photograph that most resembles" the person in the video.


Experiment 2: Identification and ranking tasks
The aim of Experiment 2 was to collect within-subject data for the 8-item simultaneous lineup identification and ranking tasks. The experiment used a 3 (strong, weak, very weak memory) x 2 (low vs high expectation) x 2 (target-present vs targetabsent) between-subject experimental design. The data was collected in two stages. Stage one (Experiment 2a) focused on collecting data for the "strong" and "weak" memory groups. Stage two (Experiment 2b) focused on collecting data for the "very weak" memory group. This data was collected at a later date after preliminary results indicated that the effect of the memory strength manipulation applied in experiment 2a required further strengthening.
The overall base rates for each memory manipulation were evenly distributed (strong = .35; weak = .32; and very weak = .33), as was the base rate for the target expectation (high = .5; low = .5). However, to maximize analytical power for the critical testing, which required target present data only, more samples from target present lineups were collected, with a base rate of .68.
All participants first viewed the target video and then completed either a short or long similarity rating distractor task, depending on whether they were allocated to the strong or weak memory manipulation group, respectively. The short similarity rating task required participants to view two videos, each of which had been randomly selected from the distractor video pool. After watching both videos, participants were then asked to consider the "faces of the two actors you have just seen" and provide a rating on a scale of 0 to 100 indicating "…how similar you think the two faces were." The long distractor task was expected to further weaken the participant's memory strength by requiring participants to complete a series of three short distractor tasks, thus viewing a total of six male faces. Expectation was manipulated by either informing participants that the target has an eight in ten (80%) chance of appearing within the lineups (high expectation), or a three in ten (30%) chance (low expectation).
The test phase required participants to complete a series of tasks, including: (1) a traditional simultaneous identification task, (2) a decision justification description, (3) a post-identification confidence rating, and (4) a ranking task.


Identification task.
All participants were presented with either a target-present, or a target-absent, 1 x 8 item simultaneous lineup. In the target-present lineup, the target was placed among seven fillers that were drawn, at random, from a pool of eight similar faces. Participants were asked to "click on the picture of the thief to identify them", and if they could not see the thief, to "click on the silhouette image." They were again permitted to change their selection before submitting their final answer.


Justification of choice
To record participants' own thoughts about their identification choice, participants were asked to "briefly describe how you made your decision and what information you used to do so." This data was collected for a future metacognitive study.
Post-identification confidence rating.
Participants then rated their level of confidence in their identification decision using a 0-100 percentage scale.
Forced choice ranking task.
Participants were again shown the lineup presented to them in the identification task and were asked to indicate "which of the lineup members is the person you saw in the original video," and if they couldn't see the person, they selected "the photograph that you think most resembles the person you saw." Once the participant had confirmed their first choice, their selected item disappeared from the lineup. To collect second, third, and subsequent choices from the remaining lineup items, participants were asked to continue to select "the best resembling person from the remaining lineup members." Each selection was removed from the lineup before the participant selected their next best choice. The task proceeded until only one face remained.


Analysis, Results and Discussion
The analytical results and discussion addressing each of the study's three aimscritical testing of stochastic processes and monotonic likelihood representation; critical testing of high-threshold representation; and verification of the surviving model-are presented below.


Random-scale and monotonic-likelihood representation
To  
2021
, we adopted a frequentist model-fitting solution using a semi-parametric bootstrap procedure in which model fits were generated from 10,000 bootstrap samples of the empirical data. Each model fit was constrained by the requirement that its expected choice probabilities fulfilled the BMIs. Model predictions fit the observed data (G 2 = 3.14, p= .544). When monotonic-likelihood constraints were tested together with the BMIs, the fit of the resulting model was maintained (G 2 =3.14, p= .596; see 
Figure 2
).
Our results suggest that forced-choice eyewitness memory is consistent with the BMIs and are therefore consistent with a random scale representation. The data is also consistent under monotonic constraints, which further suggests that the distribution of latent strength values for previously seen targets are, on average, greater than the combined distribution of values for fillers. While it remains possible that eyewitness memory has a non-random scale representation, this is very unlikely. Indeed, increasing the power of the test through the collection of further data is likely to reduce the noise observed in the target identification rates across lineups. Further, considering the effect of the fillers are likely to have on eyewitness decision making, the fact that our empirical data significantly conformed to the BMI and ML constraints allows us to further investigate and develop mathematical models of eyewitness memory with greater confidence.  


High-threshold representation
To test the assumption of high-threshold representation, target hazard rates were calculated from target-present lineup rankings of participants in each of the memory manipulation groups in Experiment 2 (see 
Table 2
) and are illustrated in   To determine if the observed data was generated by a non-HT ranking process a bootstrap hypothesis test was conducted. To achieve this, n = 1,000 target ranking data sets were independently generated from the multinomial distribution of the empirical target rankings. The closest fitting constrained hazard function (as predicted by high threshold theory) was then found for each simulated observed data set. A second (paired) set of predicted rankings was then generated. This was achieved by first deriving a multinomial distribution of predicted target rankings from the constrained hazard function generated by the fitting process, and then finding the closest fitting constrained hazard function. These hypothesized ranking distributions represent the underlying binomial distribution of target rankings under the hypothesis that their hazard rates are monotonically increasing for x ≥ 2. The probability that our fit values for the three memory groups were less than any value within their respective hypothesized distributions were: strong p = .043; weak p = .013; and very weak p = .383. We may therefore be confident in our conclusion that the study's observed target hazard for x = >1 becomes non-monotonic as memory strength increases, thus falsifying the high-threshold model of eyewitness identification processes and providing support for the SDT model's account.
This rejection of the 2HT model essentially means that false identifications do not exclusively occur through guessing behavior, nor are correct identifications simply a mixture of rare "true" identifications and "lucky/educated" accurate guesses. Instead, identification errors will occur because there exists inherent ambiguity within the information available to the eyewitness, and it is the strength of this ambiguity that dictates maximal decision accuracy. Thus, without changing discriminability parameters, the minimization of false identification errors will always come at the cost of missed identifications.


Verification of the SDT models
To investigate how well the SDT models predict eyewitness identification outcomes, the equal variant signal detection theory (EV-SDT) model and the unequalvariant signal detection theory (UV-SDT) models were tested by fit to the empirical data collected from the identification task in Experiment 2 under the assumption of a MAX decision rule 6 and tested by constraining the parameters. This allows us to connect the models with reality as we expect that discriminability will increase under strong memory conditions and criteria will change with the expectations that our participants had of target presence.
To reduce the effects of minor observation error, confidence ratings were blocked into five categories, such that across all the conditions approximately equal numbers appear in each category. The resulting categories, from the least confident (category 1) to the most confident (category 5) were: 0-38%, 39-58%, 59-69%, 70-79%, and 80-100%. Frequency counts for responses to target-present and target-absent arrays within each confidence rating category for each memory group are given in 
Table 3
 (below). Note. Filler (TP) = Filler identification from target present lineup; Filler (TA) = Filler identification from target absent lineup; Confidence: 1 = 80-100%; 2 = 70-79%; 3 = 59-69%; 4 = 39-58%; 5 = 0-38%. , , c c  = confidence criterion from low confidence to high confidence.


Testing by fit
The ROC-space illustrating the observed correct identification rate (CID)-false identification rate (FID) pairs for each confidence rating category and the theoretical ROC curve predicted by the closest fitting MAX UV-SDT model, for the strong and very weak memory manipulation groups are shown in 
Figure 4
 ) using a maximum likelihood method 
(Dunn, 2010)
. The model parameters and fits, assuming a MAX decision rule, for each of the four manipulation groups are reported in 
Table 4
. While both the EV-and UV-SDT models provided a good fit across all manipulation groups, the UV-SDT model provides additional information relating to relative distribution of latent familiarity values. This information may provide new opportunities to discover significant differences in performance between various lineup procedures, especially in their predicted outcomes for highly conservative identification decisions, i.e., identifications made with a high level of confidence. 


Testing by constraint
The independent effects of memory strength manipulation on eyewitness discriminability and expectation were tested independently on collapsed data. Parameters and of the UV-SDT model were first assessed by constraining them to be equivalent when fitting the UV-SDT to empirical ROC curves, while allowing the criterion 


Assessing independence of the latent variables
To assess the independence of the latent variable across experimental tasks the MAX UV-SDT model was directly fitted to the TP observations only. This allows for greater parity between the lineup ranking and TP identification task model parameters. The resulting models for each identification task's (i.e., the traditional identification, TP only identification, and TP ranking tasks) decision space were compared (see 
Figure 5
). While there were no significant differences in across the different task's model fits (M∆ = -0.14, 95% CI = [-0.34,0.06], t(7) = -1.79, p = .134), it was noted that there were significant differences in target  parameter values (M∆ = 0.24, 95% CI = [0.06,0.43], t(7) = 3.40, p = .019), with the variance of the distribution of target values being narrower within the UV-SDT model for identification tasks than for ranking tasks. These results indicate that the parameter remains independent and thus stable across different task structures.
However, this does extend to equivalence in discriminability within the decision space. For example, changes in relative variance , from narrow to wide, between the decision spaces of two differing tasks may result in greater levels of accuracy for highly conservative identification decisions at the expense of the accuracy of more liberal decisions. Note. Each figure depicts the decision space for each manipulation group. While the parameter remains constant across the two tasks, variance of the target distributions ( ) are smaller for the identification task, than for the ranking task.


General Discussion
By providing evidence that eyewitness identification processes are stochastic in nature, this study has confirmed the appropriate use of mathematical models of eyewitness memory, such as those applied by , 
Lee and Penrod (2019)
, and 
Dunn, Kaesler, and Semmler (2022)
, to the analysis of empirical outcomes. By doing so, we can confidently move towards a transformation of the eyewitness memory theory-set: from one containing primarily verbally described models of behavior, to one including mathematical representations. As a result, our study provides three important benefits. Firstly, by allowing for the inclusion of mathematical models within the eyewitness memory theoryset, the underlying assumptions of the theory become more salient, thus allowing for a greater level of scrutiny in relation to the theory's overall psychological plausibility. Secondly, mathematical models of eyewitness memory provide more precise predictions of identification behavior. This makes it possible to critically test a model's hypothesized predictions. Essentially, by becoming more susceptible to falsification, and yet surviving such tests, a theory-set containing good mathematical models of behavior may not only be considered a strong theory but may also be regarded as the best available conceptualization of truth 
(Bjork, 1973;
Clark, 2008;
Hintzman, 1991)
. Thirdly, mathematical models provide more appropriate analytical methodologies to the evaluation and comparison of diverse eyewitness task structures, including different lineup sizes, filler similarity ratings, and presentation styles. For example, empirical ROC curve analysis, while useful when "comparing apples with apples", cannot account for different lineup sizes. This is because the manipulation of filler numbers will have a negative impact on outcome accuracy (and thus the area under the ROC curve) without any real impact to eyewitness discriminability performance, as measured by the model's parameters. As such, even the use of pAUC measures do not circumvent this problem.
While the development and introduction of mathematical models of eyewitness identification decision processes and tasks has been an essential step towards a more scientific approach to the analysis of eyewitness identification data, the axioms and assumptions underpinning these models have, until now, remained untested. As such, a second aim of this work was to discover and apply a critical test to the HT model class of eyewitness identification, so that they may either be accepted as the sole representation of eyewitness memory or be falsified and rejected. We identified a critical test of HT representation-monotonic hazards for second and subsequent choices-which was subsequently proven by 
Chechile and Dunn (2021)
. When applied to the empirical ranking data collected in experiment 2, the HT model was shown to be false and was thus rejected.
By falsifying the high threshold account, the surviving SDT model not only supersedes it, but remains the only viable mathematical model of eyewitness memory.
The final aim of our study was to confirm the viability of this model by testing its predictive ability, the independence of its parameters and their linkage to psychological constructs of discriminability and identification decision bias, and its ability to be generalized across different task structures. By applying theoretical ROC curve analysis, we found the UV-SDT model both accurately predicted eyewitness identification outcomes and provided an additional parameter for exploration-relative variance . Furthermore, by constraining the UV-SDT model, we were also able to demonstrate that its parameters , align very well with the psychological constructs of eyewitness discriminability (as manipulated by memory strength). Following from these results is the disappointing reality that we must also reject the assumption that there exists a set of "true"
identifications. Instead, we are forced to accept the fact that eyewitness identifications will always include the risk of error. Indeed, no matter how convincing the eyewitness or strict the identification task, eyewitness identifications may never be considered infallible and thus should never be relied upon as the only source of evidence in a prosecution 
(Wells, 1984)
.
Lacking a source of "true" identifications, it is impossible to create any gain in identification accuracy without bearing a cost of increases to missed identifications.
Based on the evidence provided by this study, we are confident that SDT models of eyewitness memory provide precise, accurate predictions of eyewitness identification decision behavior, using a set of parameters that link to the psychological constructs underlying that behavior, namely discriminability and decision bias. However, it must be remembered that mathematical models of human behavior, such as the SDT models of eyewitness memory are more than mere measurement devices. While it is obvious that they provide an analytical framework within which to interpret empirical observations, mathematical models also provide a conceptual framework within which researchers might ask novel questions about the cognitive processes involved in eyewitness identification decision making. But most of all, together with existing verbal models they form a unified theoretical framework of eyewitness memory, describing the relationships between lineup stimuli, presentation formats, performance expectations, the impact of a-priori information, post-identification confidence mapping, and eyewitness identification accuracy. As a result, eyewitness researchers need no longer work within a field devoid of a strong, unified theory.
Indeed, great opportunities abound, not only for the advancement in our understanding of eyewitness identification decision making, but also in the advancement of procuring eyewitness identifications of consistently high probative value to support courts in their administration of justice.
identical 'filler' distributions. This very much simplifies any mathematical model representing eyewitness memory, as well as the testing of the core assumptions that underlie them.
In addition to the equivalence constraint, there exists a number of core assumptions, or axioms, underpinning random-scale distributions, each of which impose a different level of constraint on the outcome space-above-chance target selection, regularity, and the Block-Marschak inequalities-and are discussed in turn below.


Above-chance target selection
The first core assumption of random-scale representation is the axiom of above-chance target selection, which states that, given that an eyewitness has only has memory of the perpetrator, when forced to choose someone from a target-present lineup (i.e., a lineup that includes the perpetrator), it is expected that the eyewitness will prefer the target, and will thus select the target at a rate greater than chance. The assumption of above-chance target selection states that, given a target-present lineup L, the probability that an eyewitness correctly selects the target t from a lineup L, denoted
  L P t , is   1 , L P t L 
where |L| is the cardinality (i.e., lineup size) of L. For example, if we present an eyewitness with a 6-item target-present lineup. If forced to choose someone, the probability that the eyewitness will correctly select the target will be   


Regularity
The second, and stronger axiom is that of regularity. This simply postulates that the rate at which an eyewitness will correctly select a previously seen perpetrator from a lineup will decrease as the size of the lineup increases. For example, if an eyewitness was presented with the lineup 6 L  , then as per the assumption of above-chance selection, the expected rate of choosing the target is   6 1 . 6 P t  However, if the eyewitness was instead presented with the same lineup from which one of the fillers has been removed, then the new expected rate of target selection will increase to become   5 1 . 5 P t  Thus, the axiom of regularity asserts that
        1 1 0 L L L L P t P t P t P t     
is true.
As per the case with above-chance target selection, we may strengthen this test of randomscale representation by assessing each subset dyad within the family  
, L i F
, such that, and Unfortunately, while this is a stronger than the one provided by the axiom of above-chance target selection, it is not a strict one.
in our example case of 6 L  ,                


Block-Marschak inequalities
A full exploration of critical tests of random-scale representation was initiated by 
(Block & Marschak, 1959)
, who demonstrated that forced-choice probabilities based on a random-scale representation must satisfy a set of inequalities. However, it was not until a proof for the converse-choice probabilities which satisfy the Block-Marschak inequalities (BMIs) are based on a random utility representation 
(Falmagne, 1978)
-that this set of choice probabilities could be used to test the assumption of random-scale representation. This work was further transitioned to the context of a k  alternative forced choice (k-AFC) task by 
Kellen, Winiger, Dunn, and Singmann (2021)
, who used the resulting system of BMIs to critically test recognition memory for words. By aggregating choice data from 110 participants, which produced approximately 1, 000 observations for each of seven k-AFC condition groups, where k  {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} these researchers found that the resulting data provided near-perfect fits to data predicted by the BMI constraints. 
  , i D S L k   F such that, for each subset i S , there exists a BMI defined by     : 1 0 , i i S D D D S P t     ‚ S
where :   That is a total of fifteen different inequalities which the observed data is expected to meet if it is to be considered to have random-scale representation, and results in a strong test of random scale representation.


A critical test for the monotonic likelihood hypothesis
Imagine now that the eyewitness is instead required to rank all lineup members from the most likely to be the target to the least likely. The regularity assumption will also translate to subsequent target ranking probabilities, in that the target is expected to be ranked in the first position at a greater rate than they are ranked second. Likewise, the target is also expected to be ranked second more often than they are expected to be ranked third, and so on.
Thus, if presented with a lineup L, the probability that the target will be ranked in position i,
denoted as   L i R
t , where i exists within the set {1, 2, … , |L|}. The subsequent target ranking probabilities will be ordered as follows:
      1 2 L L L L R t R t R t  
and are thus expected to be monotonically decreasing.
Such ranking probabilities are simple to calculate if we define accurate ranking choices as those in which the target is ranked first and all the fillers within the lineup being ranked in the second, third,  , and last positions, and then assume a binomial distribution.
Let f be the probability of accurately ranking a filler in a position below that given to the target and i be the ranking position of the target. The probability that the target is ranked i among |L| alternatives, denoted L i R , is the probability that L i  fillers are accurately ranked below i and i -1 fillers are erroneously ranked higher than i. Therefore.,
      1 1 1 1 . 1 i L L i L R t f f i            
To demonstrate how this binomial distribution may be expressed in terms of forcedchoice probabilities, we first consider the probability that an eyewitness selects the target from a 6 -item target-present lineup. This is equivalent to ranking the target first:
            6 6 1 1 1 6 1 0 5 5 6 1 1 1 1 5 1 0 . P t R t f f f f f                      
Following from this, we note the following relationship between the probability target selection in a forced choice task and the probability of accurately ranking all fillers within a lineup in positions below the target:
  1 L L P t f  
Thus, the probability a target is ranked second may be expressed in forced-choice probabilities in the following way: Interestingly, this directly corresponds to one of the BMI dyads, scaled by the number of ways in which fillers may be placed in ranks above the target, which in this case is five.
                 

Subsequently, the probability that the target is ranked third, given by allowing for a further constraint on forced-choice data, such that only monotonically decreasing likelihood solutions will be accorded.


Predicted hazards functions 9
Given that the ranking probability distribution is a discrete distribution
R(x)  {1, …, k},
where k is the lineup size, its hazard function is a discrete distribution defined by ℎ ∑

distractor task. The details of this task are described in each experiment, below. Once the distractor task was completed, the participants entered the testing phase of the experiment. During this phase, each participant was presented with either a target-present or target-absent lineup. The target-present lineups consisted of the target and k -1 fillers randomly drawn from the pool of eight fillers, while the target-absent lineup simply consisted of all eight fillers. All photographic lineups were presented horizontally across the screen in a single row (1 x k). To control for position effects, the position of each lineup photograph was randomized. Details regarding experimental manipulations and procedures are provided within the each of the experimental procedure descriptions below. Experiment 1: k-Alternative forced-choice task


test the assumptions of random-scale representation and monotonic likelihood, data collected in from Experiment 1 (k-AFC probabilities, where k  {2,…,7}) was combined with Rank 1 probabilities (which are mathematically equivalent to 8-AFC probabilities, see Appendix: Signal detection theory model prediction) collected from the strong memory/target-present group in Experiment 2a. The resulting rates of target selections are presented in Table 1. The forced-choice accuracy for all lineup sizes was well above chance with performance decreasing as the lineup size increased, indicating positive memory for the target. The assumption of regularity, in which the rate of correct identification of the target decreases as the size of the lineup increases, also appears to have held. Following Kellen, Winiger, Dunn, and Singmann

Each confidence category is separated by a lower decision criterion c, such that the five categories are bounded by five decision criteria. For example, category 1 is bound on the left by criterion 1 c and on the right by criterion 2 c , category 2 is bound on the left by 2 c and on the right by 3 c , et cetera, with category 5 only having the upper bound 5 c .

Within the space, CID-FID confidence rating pairs falling closer to the origin represent decisions made at higher levels of confidence, and curves falling further above the chance line represent decisions made with higher levels of sensitivity. The 2  goodness-of-fit between the predicted and observed data were subsequently minimized through the adjustment of seven model parameters (

freely. The resulting constrained model was found to be a poor fit to identification data collapsed by memory ( 2  (5) = 26.88, p ≤ .001), but a good fit to identification data collapsed by expectation (thus confirming the link between the UV-SDT model's and parameters and the psychological construct of discriminability, as influenced by memory strength. To test if there was any independent effect of prior expectation ( 2  (5) = 7.40, p = .192) of a target present lineup on criterion placement, the model parameters were equivalent, while allowing parameters and to vary freely. Again, the constrained model fit poorly to identification data collapsed by expectation ( (2) = 28.21, p ≤ .001). However, there was also a poor fit with the identification data collapsed by memory ( 2  (2) = 18.91, p ≤ .001). So, while there was no effect found between the eyewitness's expectation of target presence and the discriminability parameters, the strength of the eyewitness's memory seems to have had a significant effect on both discriminability and decision criterion parameters. For example, eyewitnesses with stronger memories had both a larger parameter value and larger corresponding values for each of the i c parameters.

provides a relatively weak test of random-scale representation. This is simply because the constraint it imposes leaves a relatively large outcome space within which the constraint is predicted. It is possible to strengthen the test by assessing a family of target-present lineup subsets of L that contain at least one filler, denoted   , target-selection rates from five target-present lineups of ascending sizes-i.e., from 2-to 6-item lineups sizes-may be tested against the assumption of above-chance selection, such that this does improve things this test of random-scale representation remains a weak one.

While participation was not geographically restricted, almost all participants were found to be residing within the United StatesMaterials All materials used within this study were sourced from the [masked information]. This database consists of portrait photographs and accompanying short videos of 99 male and 92 female actors, each of whom were students at the University [masked information]. All portraits were photographed from a set distance and under the same lighting, with each actor wearing identical clothing. While different portrait angles are included, e.g., profile and three-quarter views, only those photographs depicting full-face views with neutral expressions were included in the item selection process. A pool of nine photographs of female actors were selected from the database based on their shared distinguishing features, including gender, hair length and color, age, racial background, and eyewear. Of these, one was selected specifically as the guilty suspect, or target. These images are available within the supplementary materials.Each video within the database (duration approximately 10s) was recorded using a simulated CCTV camera mounted on the ceiling of an office. The video begins by showing, from behind, an actor working at a computer. The actor then rises, turns, and walks towards the camera. While passing under the camera, they briefly look up towards the camera and their face is shown from an above-right angle for approximately 3 seconds. A single video of the selected target was selected for presentation to participants during the encoding phase of each experiment conducted in this study. A pool of six

The reason the BMIs require data that has been collected from lineups of differing cardinalities (i.e., number of lineup members) is because the BMI test considers regularity beyond simple probability dyads. Instead, BMI also includes the comparison of ordinal probability triads, tetrads, pentads, … etc. by considering all the target-present subsets


Of course, for random-scale representation to hold across the whole data set, it is required that all the BMIs for all S L  that include the target and at least one filler, are held true. Thus, there exists a set of inequalities which arrange choice-probabilities such that they 'cancel each other out'. Expanding this to all triads across the lineup, the set of BMIs include Subsequently, if we then consider all tetrads, the expected inequalities are:

Diagnosticity is described as the likelihood that the suspect is guilty, given that they were identified by the eyewitness.2 Because we do not know the true nature of the suspect's guilt or innocence, their identification may be either correct or incorrect, and thus its accuracy is also unknown. However, since fillers are always known to be innocent, their identification is also known to be in error.


In this case, a stochastic (random) process is a mathematical model which assumes the presence of random error through the inclusion of one, or more, randomly distributed variables.

Note that k-item ranking tasks produce 'first ranked' items which are considered mathematically equivalent to a k-AFC choice. Thus, 8-AFC data was proxied by firstranked data collected during the Experiment 2a ranking task, with the aim to minimize both participant burden and experimental costs.


In an eyewitness identification model, the MAX decision rule states that the lineup member generating the maximum value of familiarity will be identified iff that value exceeds the critical value set by the eyewitness (i.e., the eyewitness's decision criterion).

Appendix


A critical test for random scale representation hypothesis
When an eyewitness performs an identification task, they are presented with a set of images, or a lineup, depicting one or more persons who fit the description of a previously seen perpetrator. It is postulated that eyewitness then collects evidence-information from each member of the lineup, generating unique subjective values of evidence for each image using a random process. The stronger the relative value generated by an image, the more likely it emanated from a guilty suspect, and the more likely the eyewitness will correctly identify them. Under this assumption of a random-scale representation of the lineup member's subjective values, decision accuracy will depend on (1) the relative strengths of these values,
(2) the number of images presented within the lineup, and (3) the eyewitness's bias towards identifying someone, or not.
Axiomatic testing for random-scale and monotonic likelihood representation of eyewitness identification data requires the collection of forced-choice probabilities from a series of target-present lineups. These forced-choice lineup identification tasks may be defined by the joint distribution of subjective values of familiarity, as generated by each individual lineup member. However, because this definition is impractical for use in general eyewitness identification studies, where only target discriminability is of interest, it is assumed that, because fillers are innocent and have never been seen by the eyewitness, they will be equally unfamiliar. That is all fillers within a lineup are assumed to be identically distributed and thus exchangeable. 7 This means that when an eyewitness generates a latentvalue for each filler {y1, … , yn-1} within a lineup of size n , it is assumed they will do so from 7 Exchangeability of fillers may be observed in lineups for whose functional size is calculated to equal its physical size. This is a general expectation for all well-constructed lineups consisting of fillers who each match the eyewitness's description of the culprit.

 
According to the definition of the BMI for random-scale representation to hold, the following inequality must be met:


High-threshold model prediction
Under the high-threshold models of eyewitness memory, a guilty suspect (the target)
will always be assigned to rank 1 if it is detected by the eyewitness. If it is not detected, then it will be randomly assigned a rank between 1 and m + 1, where m is the number of nonrejected fillers, that is, with equal probability. Because the ranking task does not allow for target rejections, 1 may be viewed as the effective lineup size , and hence
where p(x) is the probability that the target is assigned rank x given that it is not detected.
To calculate p(x), it is necessary to first calculate the set of effective lineup size probabilities s(a) for each a  {x, …, k}, where k is the total number of lineup members (see Error! Reference source not found. on page Error! Bookmark not defined.). It then follows that, for each a  {x, …, k}, the probability the target will be selected from the remaining available lineup members is s(a)/a, and thus


.


Signal detection theory model prediction
In contrast, signal detection theory (SDT) models suggest that the target will only be assigned rank x  {1, …, k} if its perceived strength of familiarity is weaker than k -1 fillers and stronger than the remaining k -x fillers. Let • be the standard normal cumulative density functions (respectively) of subjective non-target stimulus values , and • be the normal probability distribution of subjective target stimulus values. Considering all possible combinations of filler strengths, the probability that the target is assigned to rank x  {1, …, k} is
