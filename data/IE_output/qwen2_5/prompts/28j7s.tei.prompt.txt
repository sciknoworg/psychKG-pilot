You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Despite the remarkable capacity of visual long-term memory 
(Brady et al., 2008)
, not every piece of visual information is remembered equally well. As a result, some of the previously encoded pieces of information are recognized confidently with fine-grained details while other pieces are not. The confident recognition that accompanies retrieval of additional contextual information present at the time of encoding (i.e., source memory) is known as a recollection-based recognition 
(Yonelinas et al., 2022)
, and its selective deficit has been associated not only with memory disorders 
(Addante et al., 2012;
Hertel & Milan, 1994;
Koen & Yonelinas, 2014;
Libby et al., 2013)
 but also with healthy aging 
(Howard et al., 2006;
Koen & Yonelinas, 2016)
.
Numerous studies have proposed that the late posterior positivity (or the LPP) is an electrophysiological marker of recollection-based recognition 
(Friedman & Johnson, 2000;
Rugg & Curran, 2007)
. The LPP is a sustained posterior positive deflection that typically peaks around 600-800ms after the onset of a recognized stimulus. Its amplitude is larger when an item is successfully recognized with high confidence compared to its amplitude when a memory-test item is not recognized as confidently. Furthermore, its amplitude also scales with the successful retrieval of each piece of source detail 
(Vilberg & Rugg, 2007;
Wilding, 2000)
.
Although its sensitivity to memory confidence and the source memory makes the LPP a seemingly good candidate to index recollection-based memory, it may not represent episodic memory per se. Instead, it may reflect the decision-making process in which the memory signal, or the lack thereof, is evaluated to produce the intended button-press response in the recognitionmemory task 
(Finnigan et al., 2002;
Sun et al., 2024)
. This hypothesis is consistent with recent characterizations of another ERP component with a similar topographical distribution, called the centro-parietal positivity (CPP) 
(O'Connell et al., 2012;
O'Connell et al., 2018)
. The CPP is a posterior positive deflection that often peaks around 300-400ms after the onset of a stimulus on which participants have to make a perceptual judgment. Its amplitude scales with the strength of the perceptual signal accumulated to a decision threshold, such that a salient signal results in a quicker rise than a weaker sensory signal. Interestingly, the amplitude threshold reached at the time of the decision covaries negatively with the decision time 
(Kelly & O'Connell, 2013;
Yau et al., 2021)
. This tradeoff between the decision speed and the amplitude threshold is thought to reflect the collapsing decision boundary when participants make uncertain decisions to avoid further elongation of their decision time 
(Churchland et al., 2008;
Cisek et al., 2009)
. Importantly, however, these CPP dynamics have only been characterized using perceptual decision-making tasks. Although the classic theorization of this evidence accumulation process was intended to account for memory-based decisions 
(Ratcliff, 1978)
, no study to date has examined whether the LPP dynamics trace the evidence accumulation processes for memorybased decisions.
To test the hypothesis that decision-making may underlie the electrophysiological activity we have attributed to recollection, it is critical to characterize the LPP dynamics as a function of subjective confidence with and without the memory signals. However, past studies primarily focused on characterizing the confidence-related LPP variability in the presence of memory signals (e.g., high confidence hits vs. low-confidence hits) and paid little attention to the variability in the absence of memory signals (e.g., high confidence correct rejection vs. low confidence correct rejection). To address this, we accumulated two EEG datasets (n = 59 and 45) in which young adults performed the same object recognition task ( 
Figure 1A
) after a variety of object encoding tasks. Importantly, in the recognition task, participants reported success of memory retrieval (i.e., "I was shown this object during the encoding task") or failure (i.e., "I was not shown this object during the encoding task") along with their decision confidence using 6point likert scale ("Definitely old," "Probably old," "Maybe old," "Maybe new," "Probably new," "Definitely new"). These data allowed us to dissociate the contribution of recollectionbased memory from the accumulation of decision evidence toward recognition judgment as follows. If the LPP represents the recollection-based memory itself, then the LPP should be more positive when participants recognize the test item with high confidence ("Def Old") than when they indicate low confidence or fail to recognize the test item. Alternatively, if the LPP represents the evidence accumulation for memory-based decisions, then the LPP amplitude should scale with the decision confidence, irrespective of the presence of recollection-based memory. Furthermore, the amplitude of the LPP should reach a peak around the time of mnemonic decisions, whose amplitude covaries with the decision confidence. To preview the results, we found that the LPP dynamics are sensitive to both the presence of recollection-based memory and the evidence accumulation process for recognition decisions. More precisely, timelocking to the stimulus onset, the early LPP amplitude (i.e., 600-800ms after the test onset) was reliably larger when participants reported the presence of memory with high subjective confidence than when they reported the absence of memory with high subjective confidence. In addition, when time-locking to the response, the LPP amplitudes peaked at the time of recognition, whose amplitude scaled with the subjective confidence irrespective of the presence or absence of memory signal.


Methods


Participants
At the beginning of the experiment, all participants (n = 104, 36 males, 68 females across both datasets) signed the informed consent document approved by Ethics Review Board of the University of Toronto. All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal color vision and no history of neurological disorder.


Procedure


Figure 1. Recognition memory task and behavioral results
Panel A shows a canonical recognition memory task used in our experiments. Panel B shows the behavioral results for Datasets 1 and 2. After completing an encoding task that differed across experiments (see Appendix), participants completed an object recognition memory task ( 
Fig 1A)
. Each trial started with a presentation of a central fixation dot, and the computer waited for participants to press a spacebar to indicate their readiness to see a test image. 700ms after the spacebar press, a picture of a realworld object was presented (6.73⁰ × 6.73⁰) at the center of the screen, and participants reported whether or not they have seen the picture during the encoding task by selecting one of the six options with a key press; "Definitely Old", "Probably Old", "Maybe Old", "Maybe New", "Probably New", "Definitely New". For 30 participants in Dataset 1, the six responses were mapped to "1","2","3", "8", "9", and "0" on the top row of the keyboard, respectively, and they were reversed for the remaining 29 participants. The former mapping was used for all 45 participants in Dataset 2.
After providing the response, participants were instructed to blink their eyes before initiating the next trial. provide online and offline reference. One additional electrode was placed right below the right eye to monitor eye blinks, and two additional electrodes were placed ~1ch from the left and the right canthi to monitor horizontal eye movements. The EEG was recorded with the right mastoid as the online reference, and it was subsequently re-referenced offline to the average of the right and left mastoids. The re-reference signals were then bandpass filtered with the passband of 0-30Hz. Next, the filtered EEG signals were segmented into event-related epochs around the event of interest, namely, the target onset (-200 to 1000ms after the onset) and the response (-600 to 200ms after the response). The event-related epochs accompanied by horizontal eye movements (> 30µV mean threshold across observers) or eye blinks (> 75µV mean threshold across observers) were rejected before further analyses. Subjects with more than 30% of any epochs rejected due to artifacts were excluded from the analyses. Resulting EEG signals were then transformed to current source density (CSD) using the CSD toolbox 
(Kayser & Tenke, 2006)
 to reduce the impact of volume conduction and reveal the evidence-accumulator-like characteristics of the ERP homologue in perceptual decision making tasks (the Centro-Parietal Positivity (CPP), 
Kelly & O'Connell, 2013;
O'Connell et al., 2012;
Twomey et al., 2015)
.


EEG analyses


Measurement of the LPP dynamics
To identify the LPP, we first examined the topographical representation of the CSD amplitudes at the time of the response. As predicted, LPP amplitudes peaked around the parietal channels surrounding Pz 
(Figure 2A
). Therefore, we quantified the LPP amplitude by averaging the CSD amplitudes observed at Pz, P3, P4, POz, PO3, and PO4. The averaged LPP amplitude was baseline-corrected by the mean amplitude observed in the pre-target window 
(-200-0ms
 before target onset). The test-locked LPP was then quantified as the mean CSD amplitudes of the averaged posterior channel 600 -1000 ms after the test onset. The response-locked LPP was the CSD amplitude of the averaged posterior channel at the time of the response. The test-locked and response-locked LPPs were then subjected to 2 (Picture: Old and New) x 3 (Confidence: High ("Definitely"), Medium ("Probably"), and Low ("Maybe") ) repeated measures ANOVA for Old and New responses separately to separately characterize the effect of decision confidence when a memory signal exists (i.e., Old responses) and it does not (i.e., New responses).


Controlling for the effect of the decision RT on the LPP dynamics
To statistically remove the effect of decision RT, we first regressed out the trial-by-trial variation in the decision RT from the EEG signals for each individual. The residual amplitudes were averaged in the same way as the raw amplitudes to produce the baseline-corrected LPP residual amplitudes. To elucidate the temporal dynamics of its sensitivity to recognition memory, we then computed the mean residual LPP amplitudes for early (500-700ms) and late (700-900ms) windows and conducted repeated measures ANOVA with a within-subject factor of Memory Strength ("Definitely New", "Probably New", "Maybe New", "Maybe Old", "Probably Old", and "Definitely Old") separately for each time window.


Examining the unique contribution of the recollection and decision confidence on the residual LPP
To test whether the trial-by-trial variations in the residual LPP amplitude can be accounted for by the presence or absence of recollection and the decision confidence, we then built a multiple regression model for each participant with two predictor variables (Recollection and Confidence) where Recollection was coded as [1 0 0 0 0] and Confidence was coded as [3 2 1 1 2 3] for "Definitely Old", "Probably Old", "Maybe Old", "Maybe New", "Probably New", and "Definitely New" responses.


Results


LPP tracks mnemonic decision dynamics.
After ensuring that behavioral performance was neither at ceiling nor floor ( 
Figure 1B
), we examined the LPP dynamics. As can be seen in 
Figures 2A and C
 and New responses (i.e., memory signal absent) separately. When a memory signal was present (i.e., Old responses), the ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of Confidence (F(1,637, 63.862) = 6.059, p = .006, hp 2 = 0.134, BF10 = 2.325 x10 in Dataset 1; F(2,70) = 6.087, p = .004, hp 2 = 0.148, BF10 = 2.173 x 10 in Dataset 2). Neither the main effect of Picture (F(1,39) = 3.231, p = .08, hp 2 = 0.077, BF01 = 3.438 in Dataset 1; F(1,35) = 0.476, p = .495, hp 2 = 0.013, BF01 = 6.374 in Dataset 2) nor the interaction between Picture and Confidence was significant (F(2,78) = 1.790, p = .174, hp 2 = 0.044, BF01 = 2.196 in Dataset 1; F(2,70) = 2.627, p = .079, hp 2 = 0.07, BF10 = 1.437 in Dataset 2). Interestingly, the same pattern was observed when participants judged pictures as new ( 
Figure 2B and 3B)
. That is, the main effect of Confidence (F(2,102) = 6.244, p = .003, hp 2 = 0.109, BF10 = 1.367x10 2 in Dataset 1; F(2,80) = 4.204, p = .018, hp 2 = 0.095, BF10 = 4.714 in Dataset 2) revealed that LPP amplitude also increased as participants strengthened their decision confidence for new judgments. Although there was a small but significant main effect of Picture (F(1,51) = 4.205, p = .045, hp 2 = 0.076, BF01 = 2.490) in 
Figure 2
. The LPP dynamics for Datasets 1 (n = 59) and 2 (n = 45).
Panels A and C shows the test-locked LPP (left) and response-locked LPP (right) for Datasets 1 and 2, respectively. The gray boxes highlight the measurement windows. The error margins represent within-subject standard errors of the mean. Panels B and D show the LPP threshold amplitudes' correlations with the decision confidence for Datasets 1 and 2, respectively. The topographical map shows the scalp distribution of the correlation.
Dataset 1 such that LPP amplitude for new responses was higher for old pictures than new pictures, this effect is sufficiently small such that the Bayes Factor analysis favored the evidence for a null result over the evidence in favor of an effect. Furthermore, this effect was not statistically reliable in Dataset 2 (F(1,40) = 0.705, p = .406, hp 2 = 0.017, BF01 = 5.309). The interaction between Picture and Confidence was not significant (in both datasets F(2,102) = 0.371, p = .691, hp 2 = 0.007, BF01 = 1.287x10 in Dataset 1; F(2,80) = 1.443, p = .242, hp 2 = 0.035, BF01 = 4.444 in Dataset 2). These results are incompatible with the hypothesis that LPP is selectively sensitive to recollection-based memory retrieval, and instead, it supports the idea that LPP is driven by the decision confidence, just like the CPP.
If the dynamics of the LPP are also the same as the CPP, then we should see it peak at the time of the behavioral response and its amplitude should be related to how confident people are about their decision. As can be seen in 
Figures 2A and 2C
, the LPP peaked at the time of response. The bootstrapping analysis confirmed this observation by demonstrating that the 95% confidence intervals for the LPP peak included the time of response for all response types across two datasets (see Appendix) except for one response type (i.e., "Probably Old" response for New pictures in Dataset 2; see Appendix for more details), which is to be expected given the number of comparisons (24 comparisons) with the alpha level of 0.05. This result suggests that the LPP amplitude builds up to a threshold that it reaches when the memory decision is made.
Furthermore, the peak LPP amplitude was strongly correlated with the decision confidence (r = -0.879, p < 0.001 in Dataset 1, 
Figure 2B
; r = 0.842, p < 0.001 in Dataset 2, 
Figure 2D
). These results strongly support the hypothesis that the LPP tracks the dynamics of mnemonic decision, much like the CPP does during perceptual decision making.


LPP is sensitive to recollection-based retrieval and decision confidence even after controlling for decision speed variability.
Given that RT systematically varied with memory strength and decision confidence ( 
Figure 1B)
, it is possible that LPP simply tracks the decision speed but neither the memory strength nor the decision confidence, per se. To assess this possibility, we regressed out the trialby-trial variability due to RTs from the LPP amplitudes for each individual. As shown in 
Figures   3A and 3D
 .003 x 10 9 in Dataset 1; F(5,215) = 4.982, p < .001, hp 2 = 0.104, BF10 = 5.217 x 10 2 in Dataset 2). Importantly, however, this main effect was driven by highest confidence judgments (i.e., "Definitely Old" and "Definitely New") showing higher residual amplitudes than all the other judgments regardless of the presence of memory signal (t 
58
 
Figure 3B
; t(43) = 3.437, p < 0.001, Cohen's D = 0.512 in Dataset 2, 
Figure 3E
).
Furthermore, to examine the unique contributions of Recollection and Confidence in explaining the residual LPP amplitudes, we compared the mean adjusted R-squared of this Rec +
Conf model with two simpler models with only one of the predictor variables. The results showed that the adjusted R-squared of the Rec + Conf model were statistically higher than the Conf-only model for the early time window (500-700ms after stimulus onset; t(58) = 3.885, p < 0.01, Cohen's D = 0.506 in Dataset 1, 
Figure 3C
; t(43) = 2.045, p = 0.047, Cohen's D = 0.308 in Dataset 2, 
Figure 3F
). For later time window, the Rec + Conf model explained significantly more variance in the residual amplitudes than both of the simpler models (700-900ms after stimulus onset; t(58) > 2.386, p < 0.02, Cohen's D > 0.311 in Dataset 1, 
Figure 3C
; t(43) > 2.610, p < 0.02, Cohen's D > 0.393 in Dataset 2, 
Figure 3F
). Taken together, these results confirm that the LPP amplitudes are sensitive to both recollection and decision confidence even after controlling for the variability in decision speed.


Discussion
Much like perceptual decisions, mnemonic decisions are theorized to require evidence accumulation toward a decision threshold 
(Ratcliff, 1978)
, and our study provides a novel electrophysiological test of this foundational idea. Specifically, we assessed whether the LPP measured during recognition-memory tests might actually be tracking decision-making dynamics such as evidence accumulation during memory search 
(Ratcliff, 1978;
Wagner et al., 2005)
, rather than recollection, per se.. Consistent with the idea that the LPP tracks decision-making, its amplitude reached its peak at the time when the recognition decision was made. This finding is closely in line with a recent demonstration that the LPP for a verbal recognition memory task is response-locked 
(Sun et al., 2024)
. Notably, its peak amplitude scaled with the decision confidence irrespective of the presence or absence of an episodic memory available to retrieve, even after controlling for decision speed.
Our findings have theoretically important implications. First, they challenge the classic interpretation of the LPP as a process-pure marker of recollection-based memory retrieval. Past studies have utilized the LPP as a neural index to identify recollection-specific memory effects in various populations 
(Tarantini et al., 2021;
Taylor & Olichney, 2007;
Wolk et al., 2013)
. For example, Taratini and colleagues (2021) used the LPP as an electrophysiological marker of recollection and demonstrated that 9% of subjective memory complaints in healthy older adults were accounted for by the LPP. 
Wolk and colleagues (2007)
 found a reduced LPP amplitude for the older adults with mild cognitive impairment compared to those without cognitive impairment and linked it to the deficits in recollection-based memory. Given that the LPP amplitudes scale with the evidence accumulation for mnemonic decisions even in the absence of memory signals, future studies need to re-evaluate whether the previously documented LPP differences truly reflect the differences in recollection-based memories.
Second, our findings confirm the biological plausibility of a highly influential computational model of mnemonic decision-making 
(Ratcliff, 1978)
. However, it is not yet clear how episodic memory signals some of which are captured by the early LPP is translated into decision evidence traced by the rise-to-threshold-like LPP dynamics. Moreover, how the LPP accumulates decision evidence when memory signal is absent (i.e., Correct Rejection and Miss)
is of particular interest. Future studies should investigate this translation to provide a picture of memory-based decision-making with sufficient clarity to drive computational modeling.
Lastly, the topographical similarity between the CPP and the LPP is striking and it suggests that the human brain may have a domain-general evidence accumulator for both perceptual and mnemonic decisions. A critical investigation to test this conjecture is to explain the discrepancy in their timing. Unlike the stimulus-locked LPP which typically takes approximately 600-800ms after the stimulus onset, the stimulus-locked CPP can peak 300-500ms
after the stimulus onset 
(Spieser et al., 2018;
Twomey et al., 2015)
. While the CPP peak latency can be delayed by compromising the strength of sensory signals 
(Kelly & O'Connell, 2013;
Kohl et al., 2020)
, it is not clear whether the signal strength rather than the quality of signals (i.e., sensory vs. mnemonic) is sufficient to explain the latency difference between CPP and LPP.
Focusing on this in future work will help answer whether human mind in equipped with a domain-general evidence accumulator and explain why our mind have difficulty in making multiple decisions simultaneously

Descriptions of encoding tasks for all experiments


Encoding tasks
In all encoding tasks, participants were asked to try their best to maintain central fixation without blinking their eyes during each trial. Participants were free to blink their eyes during inter-trial intervals (ITIs). Experiments 1-3 and 4-6 were combined to produce Dataset 1 and Dataset 2, respectively.


Experiment 1 (n = 21)
Each trial started with a presentation of a central fixation dot (0.26⁰ × 0.26⁰). 500 ms afterwards, an array of pictures of real-world objects was presented for 500ms, which was then followed by 500-ms-long blank retention interval. The retention interval was followed by a 1000ms-long ITI, during which participants were allowed to make eye blinks.
The arrays contained either one or three pictures, thus creating set size 1 or 3 arrays. The spatial layout of the array was determined by randomly choosing corresponding number of locations from 6 equidistant locations on an imaginary circle. There were two types of set size 3 arrays. The same object (SO) arrays were composed of three identical copies of a picture. On the other hand, the different object (DO) arrays were composed of three different pictures. Thus, there were three types of arrays, namely, set size 1 (SS1), set size 3 SO (SS3 SO), and set size 3 DO (SS3 DO) arrays.
Each picture was only presented in a fixed array type. In other words, if a picture was presented once in a SS1 array, then the picture could only appear in a SS1 array. On the other hand, if a picture was presented once in a SS3 SO array, then it could only appear in a SS3 SO array. 75 pictures assigned to SS1 arrays were presented in 3 trials throughout the encoding task In total, participants encoded 300 SS1 arrays, 300 SS3 SO arrays and 300 SS3 DO arrays in 9 encoding blocks.


Experiment 2 (n = 17)
Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 1 except for the spatial layout of the encoding arrays. For SS1 arrays, the picture was presented at the center of the screen. For SS3 arrays, one picture was presented at the center of the screen and the other two pictures flanked the centrally presented picture bilaterally. In total, participants encoded 160 SS1 arrays, 160 SS3 SO arrays, 160 SS3 DO arrays, 160 SS6 SO arrays, and 160 SS6 DO arrays in 10 encoding blocks.


Experiment 4 (n = 21)
Experiment 4 was a lateralized version of Experiment 1. After the presentation of the central fixation dot, an arrow cue was presented for 250ms to direct participants' covert, not overt, attention to either the left or right half of the screen with equal probabilities. 500ms after the cue offset, an array of pictures was presented on the cued side for 500ms and participants were instructed to remember the pictures on the cued side of the screen while maintaining central fixation. To balance the visual display, the same number of masks were presented on the uncued side of the screen. In total, 6 masks were used and each mask was created by overlaying 6 objects that were never presented in any part of the experiment.


Experiment 5 (n = 11)
Each trial started with a presentation of a black central fixation dot. 500ms afterwards, a single picture of a real world object was presented for 250ms, and participants were instructed to remember it (Baseline condition). In two thirds of the trials, a black central fixation dot remained on the computer screen for 1750ms. In the remaining third of the trials, the central fixation dot turned green 750ms after the picture offset, and this instructed participants to try extra hard to remember the picture that they just saw (Upregulation condition). Subsequently, a 1000ms-long ITI followed during which participants were allowed to make eyeblinks. In total, participants completed 10 blocks of 60 trials, in which they encoded 400 and 200 pictures in Baseline and Upregulation conditions, respectively.
Experiment 6 (n = 13)
Participants completed six blocks in each of which they encoded 100 pictures in the Baseline condition of Experiment 5 except that the black central fixation dot remained on the screen for 750ms. Subsequently, participants completed two additional blocks in which they reencoded a random subset of 200 pictures.
2 Permutation-based bootstrapping analysis of LPP600 peak latency
To examine whether the response-locked LPP600 peaked at the time of the response, we conducted the permutation-based bootstrapping analysis. More precisely, for each iteration of permutation, we randomly sampled 20 participants to compute the averaged LPP600 waveforms for each of the 12 Picture (Old picture or New picture) x Decision ("Definitely old", "Probably old', "Maybe old", "Maybe new", "Probably New", "Definitely New") conditions.
"Def.
Old" 'Prob.
Old" Subsequently, we compute the latency at which the LPP600 became most positive (i.e., LPP600 peak latency) within the -200 to 200ms time window around the response onset. This procedure was repeated 10000 times to derive the distribution of the LPP600 peak latency for each Picture
x Decision condition. To test whether the peak latency systematically deviated from the response onset, we tested whether 95% CI systematically deviated from 0ms. As can be seen in 
Table 1
, the 95% confidence interval of the peak latency included 0ms for all Picture x Decision conditions except for one condition in Dataset 2 (New picture x "Probably Old"), which is statistically expected given the number of comparisons conducted here (i.e., 24 comparisons).
> 2.815, pholm < 0.042, Cohen's D > 0.370 in Dataset 1; t(43) > 2.876, pholm < 0.053, Cohen's D > 0.434 in Dataset 2). Furthermore, the residual LPP amplitude in this time window was not statistically different between "Definitely Old" and "Definitely New" responses (t(58) = 0.632, pholm = 1.000, Cohen's D = 0.083 in Dataset 1; t(43) = 0.997, pholm = 1.000, Cohen's D = 0.150 in Dataset 2).

CPP dynamics after controlling for decision RTsPanels A and D show the residual LPP600 amplitude for Old (Left) and New (Right) responses after regressing out the decision RTs for Datasets 1 and 2, respectively. The error margins represent within-subject standard errors of the mean. Panels B and E show the time course of the mean correlation coefficients for Recollection and Confidence for the full model of the residual LPP600 amplitude for Datasets 1 and 2, respectively. Panels E and F show the time course of the adjusted R-squared for the Recollection-only, Confidence-only, and full models for Datasets 1 and 2, respectively.To validate these observations further, we built individual-specific multiple linear regression models with Recollection and Confidence as predictor variables (Rec + Conf model) to account for the residual LPP amplitudes after controlling for decision RTs. As predicted, the mean correlation coefficient for Recollection was reliably positive in 500-700ms window (t(58)= 8.420, p < 0.001, Cohen's D = 1.096 in Dataset 1,Figure 3B; t(43) = 6.429, p < 0.001, Cohen's D = 0.958 in Dataset 2,Figure 3E), and the mean correlation coefficient for Decision Confidence became reliably positive in 700-900ms window (t(58) = 5.100, p < 0.001, Cohen's D = 0.664 in Dataset 1,


, the test-locked LPP increased its amplitude as participants' confidence increased regarding the judged picture. That is, our findings show that the amplitude of the LPP showed a large change based on subjects'
confidence in their behavioral response regardless of whether there exists a memory to retrieve or not. To provide statistical support for this observation, we performed a 2 (Picture: Old and New) x 3 (Confidence: High, Medium, and Low) repeated measures ANOVA on the test-locked LPP amplitudes (600-1000ms after the test onset) for Old responses (i.e., memory signal present)


(SS1 rep pictures) whereas remaining 75 pictures were presented only once (SS1 no-rep pictures). Similarly, 75 pictures assigned to set size 3 SO arrays were presented in 3 trials
throughout the encoding task (SS3 SO rep pictures) whereas remaining 75 pictures were
presented only once (SS3 SO no-rep pictures). For set size 3 DO arrays, 225 pictures were
presented in 3 trials (SS3 DO rep pictures) and 225 pictures were presented only once (SS3 DO
no-rep pictures).


Experiment 3 was similar to Experiment 1 except that we added set size 6 SO and DO arrays. Participants saw 40 SS1 no-rep pictures, 40 SS1 rep pictures, 40 SS3 SO no-rep pictures, 40 SS3 SO rep pictures, 120 SS3 DO no-rep pictures, 120 SS3 DO rep pictures, 40 SS6 SO norep pictures, 40 SS6 SO rep pictures, 240 SS6 DO no-rep pictures, and 240 SS6 DO rep pictures.
