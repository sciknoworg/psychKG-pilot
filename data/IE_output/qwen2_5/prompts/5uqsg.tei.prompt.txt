You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (LPC) are facing difficult decisions regarding treatment. They need to choose from a range of treatment options (e.g., surgery, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, or active surveillance) 1 , which have equivalent survival outcomes but differ in the risk of adverse outcomes 
2,
3
 . This scenario calls for shared decision making (SDM), a three-step process by which clinician and patient (i) discuss treatment options, (ii) compare risks and benefits, and (iii) make sure that the final decision is preference-based 
4,
5
 . SDM may involve decision aids (DAs), which are tools (e.g., booklets or websites) that provide balanced information about options and the associated risks and benefits, and help patients to clarify values and preferences and how to communicate these with their clinician 
6
 . Today, there are hundreds of patient DAs in various health domains, ranging from cancer to heart disease 
7
 . Even though DAs have potential 
7
 , systematic reviews have shown variability in the effects of DAs for LPC treatment on decisional outcomes (including decisional conflict and knowledge) and treatment choice 
[8]
[9]
[10]
 .
An explanation for the inconsistent effects may be that DAs have been developed and implemented without taking into account the communicative process in which SDM occurs 
11
 . Classic models of this process assume that communication requires a sender and a receiver who are exchanging information through a certain channel 
12
 . In addition, this communication process can involve aspects such as feedback (i.e., the receiver's response to a message) or noise (i.e., anything not intended by the sender). Seen from this perspective, SDM is a similar two-way communicative process in which both clinician and patient convey and receive messages through available channels in order to reach a decision regarding treatment 
13
 . Indeed, communication models of SDM also acknowledge the role of DAs in this communication process 
14
 . Therefore, it is important to look into communicative aspects (CAs) of DAs that could potentially influence elements of the communication process between clinician and patient.
These CAs include, first of all, the channels through which DAs communicate to patients, which can either be unimodal (e.g., using text or pictures alone) or multimodal (e.g., using text with pictures or audiovisual information) 
[15]
[16]
[17]
 . The latter is particularly important for complex topics such as explaining surgical procedures or statistical information 
18,
19
 . Another aspect is that DAs can signal information based on interactions with the patient, for instance, by clarifying values or preferences, or by providing personalized information for a specific receiver based on input of that receiver 
20,
21
 .
Moreover, information provided by DAs may also be less suitable or accessible because of various forms of noise such as complex language use (e.g., jargon), or biased presentations of risks and benefits of treatments 
22
 . Despite the importance of communication characteristics of DAs, no research exists that has systematically reviewed such patient tools for LPC treatment from a communication point of view.
When reviewing the quality of DAs, researchers often make use of a standardized quality checklist developed by the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration 
6,
23
 . Nevertheless, even though the IPDAS checklist is seen as the golden standard for developing and evaluating DAs 
24
 , it is also important to consider other aspects of the communication process that are not covered by the IPDAS. Until now, only one systematic review by Adsul and colleagues has reviewed the quality of DAs for LPC treatment by using additional items related to implementation (e.g., health literacy) 
25
 .
Although their results lead to a global understanding of the variability in characteristics and quality of DAs, more in-depth analyses of some CAs are still required to get a more complete understanding of DAs as a communicative tool in the context of SDM.
The objectives of this review are to (1) systematically identify currently available DAs for LPC treatment through both academic and online sources, (2) review these tools for IPDAS criteria and, crucially, (3) assess them on a range of aspects deemed to be important for the communication process. By doing so, this review will both update and extend previous work 
25
 , and will also take a closer look at various CAs of DAs.


Materials and Methods
This systematic review was reported in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines 26 .


Data sources and search strategy
A systematic search of published literature and online sources was performed in order to identify and obtain DAs for LPC treatment. To identify DAs through published literature, we searched the following databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and PsycINFO. Databases were searched from 1990 to 2018. Reference lists and author names were searched to identify additional publications that met the eligibility criteria. The search strategy was developed in collaboration with an experienced research librarian, and included a combination of keywords, synonyms, and MeSH headings relating to the concepts of LPC, DAs, SDM, and treatments (Appendix A). To identify DAs through online sources, we searched two international web repositories: The Ottowa Decision Aid Library Inventory and The International Database for Support in Medical Choices (Med-Decs).
An additional Internet search using Google TM was conducted in both Dutch and English for which the first 100 hits were analyzed.


Study and decision aid eligibility
Studies were included if the research was reported in a scientific journal (peer-reviewed), published between 1990 and 2018, and written in English or Dutch. Study types eligible for inclusion were (protocols of) randomized controlled trials or (quasi) experimental studies that addressed the impact of DAs as intervention on a variety of decisional outcomes or treatment choice. In addition, studies that described the developmental and/or evaluation of DAs (e.g., developmental studies, evaluation/usability testing studies, and observational studies) were also included. Target audiences of studies included newly diagnosed patients with LPC facing treatment decision making, as well as patients with early-stage or low/intermediate-risk prostate cancer. DAs developed for men with advanced prostate cancer or Prostate-Specific Antigen screening were excluded. DA formats included paper-based (e.g., hardcopy booklets, or pamphlets), web-based (e.g., Internet websites), computer-based (e.g., computer programs, CD-ROMs) or videobased (e.g., video-tape or DVD). However, DAs in the format of phone calls, online support groups, interviews, nomograms or audiotapes were excluded, since such formats could not be analyzed. Finally, only DAs that were (publicly) accessible, referred to at least two treatments, and were written in English or Dutch were included.


Study and decision aid selection
A first reviewer (RV) screened all retrieved articles for relevance based on title and abstract for initial eligibility, after which a second reviewer (GG) screened a package of 10% of the articles that consisted of a mix of included/excluded studies judged by the first reviewer (RV). The overall kappa score for inter-rate agreement was strong (κ = .90) 
27
 .
Afterwards, disagreements were resolved through discussion or adjudication by a third person. Subsequently, two reviewers (RV, ME) independently evaluated the articles that passed the previous screening phase based on the eligibility criteria using a pre-defined criteria form (κ = .96), and disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus between the two reviewers. Once a study had been included, one reviewer (RV) contacted the study authors for obtaining permission to request and review a copy of the DA (or to get full access to the DA).


Assessment of decision aids
The assessment of the identified DAs consisted of two parts. DAs were first reviewed for the IPDAS criteria, after which they were critically analyzed on a range of CAs. For both checklists, we carried out extensive pilot testing and discussions in order to make sure that every reviewer interpreted the items in the same way. Six teams of two coders each were responsible for reviewing one sixth of the DAs. Thus, each DA was independently assessed by two coders. Inter-rate agreements (κ) achieved by the teams ranged from .80 to .82 for the IPDAS checklist, and from .81 to .93 for the assessment of CAs. and 'no' (coded as 1 and 0 respectively). For each DA, the number of IPDAS items met was converted to percentages of the total number of items.


Communicative aspects.
Given that there was no validated CA checklist available for DAs, we developed a new checklist. We first selected aspects from the communication model by Shannon and Weaver 12 in order to determine the following seven CAs: (i) information presentation (derived from channel), (ii) personalization (derived from message), (iii) interaction (derived from interaction), (iv) information control (derived from feedback), (v) accessibility (derived from noise), (vi) suitability (derived from noise), and (vii) source of information (derived from source of information). We then generated a list of 76 items, which were partly derived from an existing checklist 
25
 , and were supplemented with items from reviews about (communicative) features of DAs 
28,
29
 and from the Suitability Assessment of Materials checklist 
30
 . These items were subsequently divided into the seven CAs (Appendix C).
Information presentation contained items that focused on the channels used to communicate different types of information (e.g., verbal descriptors, numbers, or visual aids), but also on how treatment comparison was realized. Personalization comprised items related to how the information was tailored towards the patient (e.g., tailoring outcome probabilities or content). Interaction contained items that concerned how the interaction between the DA and the patient was established (e.g., interaction methods used to clarify personal values and preferences), for which a distinction was made between passive (e.g., methods that did not require active participation) and active (e.g., exercises that did require active participation) interaction methods. Items relating to information control dealt with how the patient had control over access to information (e.g., option to only view information of interest), but also how feedback was established (e.g., summary of a patient's preferences). Accessibility involved items that focused on how accessible the DA was (e.g., whether the DA required login information), and suitability focused on how suitable the content of the DA was (e.g., presence of irrelevant illustrations). Finally, source of information yielded items that concerned whether and how the source of probability information was given (e.g., information about patients involved in the reported trials).
Response options for each item were 'yes' and 'no' (coded as 1 and 0 respectively; seven items needed to be recoded). Since six items were only applicable to web-based DA, the total number of items for paper-based DAs was 70, and for web-based 76. For each DA, the number of CA items was converted to percentages of the total number of items. Note that a higher CA score does not necessarily indicate a higher quality DA; it merely suggests that more items from the CA checklist were taken into account. Nine DAs were obtained through online sources, and ten DAs through published literature and had 1 or 2 associated studies

 , of which 7 were randomized controlled trials, 6 evaluation and/or usability studies, 2 protocols of randomized controlled trials, and 1 cross-sectional study. Methods and narrative descriptions of each study are shown in 
Table 2
.    Patients were given a DA and were interviewed before and after the decision-making consultation.


Results


Search results and general characteristics
The use of a DA led to more active involvement in treatment decision making and more information exchange between clinician and patient. Also, the DA had a positive impact on the decision making process, and improved the quality of the consultation. Note. DA = Decision aid; LPC = Localized prostate cancer; N.A. = Not applicable; RCT = Randomized controlled trial.

Information presentation
All 19 DAs used absolute verbal expressions, of which 15 (79%) also used relative verbal expressions; 18 (95%) also used numerical information to convey probabilities, of which natural frequencies were most common (16; 84%) followed by absolute risks (13; 68%), percentages (10; 53%), and relative risks and number needed to treat (both 1; 5%). A minority (6; 32%) used visual aids, of which icon arrays were most frequently used (5; 


Personalization
The majority of the DAs (17; 89%) were tailored toward the specific stage of the prostate cancer. Tailoring towards the type of treatment, specific populations, or other prostate cancer-related factors (e.g., PSA value) only occurred in 3 (16%), 1 (5%), and 3 DAs (16%) respectively. Seven of the aids allowed (37%) patients to tailor the content of the DA. However, none of the DAs allowed patients to view probabilities based on their own situation, or to tailor information to patients' own preference for the mode of information presentation.


Interaction
Of 


Information control
Eleven DAs (58%) allowed patients to only receive information that they wanted to read.
All except for 1 DA (95%) provided a step-by-step way to move through the DA, and 16
(84%) provided patients the opportunity to read more about a specific topic of interest.
The majority (16; 84%) included the option to search for keywords by means of the "ctrlf" function or a search bar.


Accessibility and suitability
In terms of accessibility, a total of 15 DAs (79%) were freely available on the web, and 5 


Source of information
Of the 19 DAs, most included probabilities for treatment side effects and/or quality of life (15; 79%) followed by mortality rate (12; 63%) incidence rate (9; 47%) treatment after active surveillance (6; 32%) survival rate (5; 26%) progression of cancer (4; 21%) and co-morbidity (1; 5%). Only 6 DAs (32%) reported the original source of the data, of which half provided detailed information about the patients included in the data(sets) and the period of data collection.


Discussion
In this systematic review, we identified 19 DAs for LPC treatment decision making, and reviewed them for IPDAS criteria and their usage of various CAs. Consistent with previous reviews 
[8]
[9]
[10]
25
 , adherence to the IPDAS checklist varied substantially across DAs. Many did not adhere to good practice guidance on the presentation of outcome probabilities associated with treatment options, and also lacked substantial information regarding the development process and readability levels of the aids. More importantly, a novel finding of this review was that the use of CAs also varied substantially across DAs. Here, we will discuss some major CA shortcomings found in the DAs, andbased on insights from communication researchprovide recommendations and best practices for clinicians who are involved in the development or use of DA in their clinical practice (for an overview, see 
Table 3
).
First of all, only a minority of the DAs used visual aids or other graphical methods to convey statistical information. However, given that this kind of information is often difficult to process and understand for many patients 
18
 , various guidelines and best practices have been developed over the years how to communicate this through multiple channels 
47,
48
 . Moreover, content-related information (e.g., LPC, procedures of treatments) was most of the time explained unimodally rather than multimodally.
However, there is substantial evidence that the latter form often leads to better information recall 
[15]
[16]
[17]
 , especially for people with lower health numeracy and health literacy skills 
49
 .
Therefore, future DA developments should consider the possible communication channels (and their combination) through which different pieces of information can be explained to patients.
Another finding was that all DAs were generic and lacked personalization, particularly in terms of outcome probabilities (e.g., option to view statistics based on each patient's medical history) and mode of delivery (e.g., option to adjust the presentation modality). However, insights from health communication research suggest that individualized information is more likely to be considered as personally relevant (and hence, to be read) compared to generic and static information 
20,
21
 This in-depth processing of information can lead to higher levels of engagement, which potentially encourages patients to actively participate in SDM 
50
 . Recent technological developments in data science and artificial intelligence offer promise for the generation of individualized risks and benefits of treatment options, and future studies should determine whether this personalized approach of DAs would also lead to improvements in LPC patients' understanding of risks 
51,
52
 . This review further reveals some other communicative issues that could potentially hinder the successful implementation of the DAs in clinical practice. For instance, the majority of the aids did not specify the original source of statistical information, or did not mention anything about the characteristics of the patients involved in the clinical trials.
However, this information could be helpful to patients to better understand how to apply the probabilities to their own situation 
54
 . Furthermore, not all DAs were up-to-date and freely available to patients, some required login information to get full access, and most were quite lengthy in terms of size, which limits their potential usage. Therefore, we recommend clinicians who make use of DAs in their daily clinical practice to be aware of the suitability and accessibility of their tools for their patients. In addition, clinicians who  


Information presentation
Probability information was often communicated verbally (e.g., high chance of..") or numerically (e.g., "10% chance of..) but less visually (e.g., icon arrays).
Consider the possible communication channels through which different pieces of information can be explained to patients.


Personalization
Probability information of side effects of associated treatment options were generic and based on average statistics.
Make use of recent developments in artificial intelligence for determining individualized outcome probabilities based on patient data.
The mode of delivery was typically fixed (e.g., only text) and could not be personalized based on patients' preferences.
Consider the individual differences in information processing by patients, and how to personalize the mode of delivery of the DAs.


Interaction
Most side-by-side displays of the pros and cons of treatment options were biased and unbalanced.
Take the potential influence of several cognitive biases in DAs into account, and its influence on treatment decision making.
Interaction methods that elicit patients' values and preferences of treatment options were rarely used.
Provide (active) interactive exercises that help patients clarify their values and preferences.


Suitability of information
Some were quite lengthy and most were fixed in terms of size and format.
Develop multiple formats of the DA (paper-based versus web-based), or providing variation in terms of size (short versus elaborated DAs).


Accessibility of information
Few were up-to-date and/or freely available to patients, some required login information to get full access.
Consider how DAs can be dynamically updated based on new evidence and patient data in order to facilitate maintenance and implementation of the tools.


Source of information
Original sources of probability information were most of the time unknown.
Provide reliable sources of information to help patients better understand how to apply the probabilities to their own situation.


Conclusions
The integration of DAs for LPC into daily clinical practice is becoming an important intervention to support patient participation in SDM

1 IPDAS. The IPDAS instrument 23 consisted of 36 items divided into eight dimensions (Appendix B): information about options, outcome probabilities, clarifying values, decision guidance, development process, using evidence, disclosure and transparency, and plain language. Since not all DAs had associated studies, we decided to exclude the items related to the evaluation dimension. Response options for each criteria item were 'yes'


Figure 1

illustrates the flow chart of this systematic review. A search through databases resulted in 8501 records, and an additional 2 records through other sources. After removing 2025 duplicates, 6478 unique records were identified. Titles and abstracts were screened to identify 103 potentially eligible records. Initially, full text review of these records resulted in 25 articles that met eligibility criteria, including 17 unique DAs through published literature. However, given that full access to the DAs was required for inclusion in this review, we eventually included 16 articles including 10 unique and accessible DAs. An additional search through online sources resulted in another 18 DAs, leading to a total of 28 potential eligible DAs. After removing 9 duplicates, a total of 19 DAs was included in this review. General characteristics of the included DAs are shown in Table 1. Ten aids originated from the United States, eight from Europe, and one from Canada. Thirteen aids were written in English, and six in Dutch. Twelve of the DAs were web-based, and seven were paper-based. Year of publication/last update ranged from 2007 to 2018, and almost all DAs contained the most common contemporary treatment options for LPC (active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, and brachytherapy).

B. The percentage of IPDAS criteria met by the DAs ranged from 36% to 84% (M = 59%, SD = 12%). Ten of the 19 DAs included comparisons between positive and negative features of treatment options (53%), and 5 (26%) showed both features with equal detail. Regarding probabilities, ten DAs (53%) did not define the reference class, 11 (58%) did not mention the specified time period, and 15 (79%) did not provide balanced information about outcome probabilities. Only 2 DAs (11%) mentioned the readability levels of their aid, and most had low scores on items related to the development process (5 out of 6

26%), followed by pie and bar charts (2 and 1 respectively; 11% and 5%). The majority of the included DAs described uncertainties around probability information (15; 79%), of which all used verbal descriptions, 11 numerical ranges (73%), whilst only 1 communicated this visually (7%). Of the 16 DAs that explained disease-related factors, 25%) used text-only, whilst the majority used both text and illustrations (75%). All DAs communicated the procedures of treatments verbally, of which 7 (37%) added illustrations and 3 (16%) included video clips. Furthermore, only 2 DAs (11%) presented the information in a balanced and unbiased way, 10 (53%) used roughly the same amount of text for each option, and 7 (37%) used language that was biased in favor of a specific treatment. Finally, of the 16 aids that contained positive features of treatment options, 38%) provided an equal number of those features across options; whereas all aids contained negative features of options, of which 4 (21%) had an equal number of those features across options.


the 16 DAs that helped patients to consider personal values and preferences, all passively asked patients to think about their personal values, and 10 (63%) used interactive methods such as weighting exercises (7; 44%) and/or sliders to assign values to preferences (4; 25%). Treatment comparison was realized by 13 aids (68%). Of these, cross-tables including positive and negative features of treatments were a principle feature (11; 84%), along with verbal comparisons (9; 69%). Only 5 (39%) incorporated interactive methods such as rating or ranking exercises, and 1 (8%) provided the patient with the most suitable option on the basis of values and preferences. Finally, feedback was given in various ways. Eight DAs (42%) showed the progress of the aid, 7 (37%) provided a summary of the values and preferences, and 11 (58%) had the opportunity to print the DA as a single document. In addition, 8 DAs (42%) provided space for note taking, and 3 (16%) included a short knowledge test.


Furthermore, only a
small number of DAs contained interactive methods to assess patients' values and preferences, or to compare pros and cons of the available options. This aspects of interaction is particularly important for preference-sensitive decisions such as for LPC, in which there is typically no single best option. The majority of the aids incorporated interaction methods such as a side-by-side table of the positive and negative features of options. Interestingly, our analyses also demonstrated that many of these tables included biases such as an unequal number of positive and negative features of treatments, or a dissimilar amount of text for each option. Such (cognitive) biases could unintentionally influence patients' decision making 53 . It is important that such potential biases are taken into consideration during the development and use of DAs.


are involved in the development of DAs might consider how such tools can be dynamically updated based on new evidence and patient data in order to facilitate maintenance and implementation of the tools. Here, again, recent technological advances may be helpful. Finally, an interesting question is whether DAs with high scores on CAs also lead to improved quality of decision making or other outcome measures of SDM. This could not be investigated in the current review, since we could not link the outcome measures of the reported trials with our assessment measures. Rather, our main focus was on conducting a systematic description of the use of CAs and IPDAS criteria by currently available DAs for LPC treatment, in order to determine its shortcomings. Nevertheless, this is an important issue, and future studies are needed in order to determine whether improved communicative characteristics of DAs in (prostate) cancer care will lead to improvements in SDM outcomes such as decisional conflict, decisional regret, knowledge, or preparation for decision making.


Using insights from communication research and relying on technological advances in artificial intelligence research, we argue that patient DAs for LPC treatment could be further improved by taking CAs such as personalization of treatment information, interaction, and the possible channels to communicate information into account. Such improvements are not only limited to the domain of prostate cancer care, but are also useful to many other decisions in health care that do not have a single best option. We therefore believe that our findings have implications for both clinicians who are making use of DAs in daily clinical practice, as well as for clinicians who are involved in the development of such decision support tools.
