You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

T he dynamics of human beliefs and radicalization of opinions have emerged as defining factors in our society's trajectory, as witnessed across a myriad of political, religious, moral, and racial divides

. Evidence of this pervasive polarization is abundant. For instance, we see political polarization in the United States, where Democrats and Republicans hold increasingly disparate views on topics such as gun control, climate change, and healthcare 
(8,
16)
. Racial divides are also starkly apparent 
(17)
, resulting in differing views on police brutality 
(18)
 and immigration policy 
(19)
. In the context of religion, we observe polarization in the form of divergent beliefs on topics such as abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, and the role of religion in public life 
(15)
. Ethical polarization is also evident in ongoing debates on euthanasia, capital punishment, and animal rights 
(20)
.
Yet, polarization is not confined to these broad social issues since it extends into more specific realms such as differing views on vaccines, where pro-vaccine advocates and vaccine skeptics are at odds 
(4,
6)
. Opinions on technological issues involving artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and data privacy are further examples 
(21,
22)
. We also observe polarization in our responses to major global challenges, such as climate change 
(2,
3,
16)
, where supporters and skeptics hold divergent views. Polarization further manifests itself in societal attitudes towards economic disparities, income inequality, and social safety nets 
(23)
.
These divisions have spawned numerous problems ranging from unrest at the societal level to conflicts within smaller groups with opposing beliefs. People with conflicting beliefs are often regarded as adversaries, leading to divisive and destructive practices such as information warfare, cyber-attacks, derogatory comments in social media, and the spreading of fake news 
(24)
. While the damage inflicted to the information ecosystem by such actions is often unappreciated and underestimated, its impact on societal cohesion is profound and far-reaching.
This polarized landscape is significantly influenced by confirmation bias, a psychological phenomenon where individuals interpret or seek information that confirms their preexisting beliefs while overlooking contradictory evidence 
(25)
. Such a bias shapes the behavior of social network users, leading them to select and propagate claims aligned with their beliefs, fueling group polarization and entrenchment of beliefs as well as reinforcing and perpetuating societal divides. Of particular interest is the backfire effect-a manifestation of confirmation


Significance Statement
This work presents a unique intersection of physics, psychology, and philosophy, using the principles of quantum mechanics to model the dynamics of human belief systems and opinion formation. The proposed quantum model has significant implications not only for understanding social and political polarization, but also for making sense of complex decision-making processes. Importantly, our findings also support the quantum mind hypothesis, suggesting that cognitive processes might share certain characteristics with quantum-physical systems. Thus, the proposed model may serve as a launching pad for future interdisciplinary research, fostering a deeper understanding of how a human mind operates and how opinions evolve, polarize, and radicalize in the increasingly interconnected world.  
(15)
. In each of these studies, groups exhibited the backfire effect after being subjected to an opposing view. Note: Each of the horizontal axes should be read independently. Results from the cited papers are normalized to be presented on a scale from -1 to 1. The figure demonstrates the direction and magnitude of the backfire effect for one or more groups in each study, showcasing that Republicans, people highly concerned with vaccination side effects, climate change deniers, and religious people are more likely to become more conservative, more likely to refuse vaccination, more likely to deny climate change, and more likely to object to the abortion rights, respectively, after being subjected to opposing views. At the same time, Democrats and non-religious people exhibit a much lower backfire effect in magnitude than their Republican and religious counterparts, respectively. The counterpart views are not available for all studies.
bias, referring the tendency of people to give more credence to evidence that supports their preexisting beliefs 
(8)
.
To further understand the complex dynamics of the backfire effect, our work advances a model derived from the principles of quantum mechanics 
(26)
. This approach provides a unique perspective for comprehending and quantifying opinion radicalization, elucidating the evolution of individual beliefs when exposed to counter-attitudinal information and revealing its contribution to societal polarization.
Examining societal opinion dynamics through the lens of this quantum-inspired model bears considerable implications. This model reproduces the asymmetric behavior of opinion radicalization commonly observed when individuals confront opposing views. Such a radicalization, augmented by the backfire effect, is prominently manifested in political domains. For instance, in the political arena of the United States, exposure to counter-attitudinal information typically results in an entrenchment of beliefs among both Democrats and Republicans. However, Republicans have been observed to radicalize to a higher degree than Democrats in response to conflicting perspectives 
(8)
.
It is noteworthy that the applications of the model are not limited to politics since the phenomenon of radicalization applies to other societal issues such as climate change, gun control, and vaccinations, often leading to an intensification of individuals' initial beliefs when they are presented with contrasting evidence or viewpoints. Our model elucidates this counter-intuitive dynamics, thus offering a new perspective on the complex landscape of human beliefs and opinions. 
Figure 1
 provides empirical evidence of the "double-sided" polarization behavior triggered by the backfire effect, observed in the domains of politics 
(8)
 and abortion 
(15)
. Conversely, in 
Fig. 1
 the domains of climate change (2) and vaccination (6) are marked by a seemingly "one-sided" view. This discrepancy arises due to missing data for these areas as studies focusing on climate change and vaccinations typically present scientifically accurate information in experimental treatments without offering opposing viewpoints.
The apparent limitation of the available motivational data should not be perceived as a detriment to our investigation since our model can predict radicalization trends in contexts where data on opposing views are unavailable or scarce. Thus, by elucidating such trends, we aspire to contribute to an interdisciplinary understanding of opinion dynamics, with the potential of informing interventions that could mitigate polarization and foster more productive and respectful societal dialogues.
Furthermore, the proposed model reveals the fundamental origin of advantages over classical models in understanding the radicalization of opinions, thereby providing a robust framework that can predict opinion changes with superior accuracy and reliability. This model also contributes to the growing body of research exploring the plausibility of the "quantum mind" hypothesis, which posits that the principles of quantum mechanics could underlie cognitive processes 
(27)
. In particular, through its successful simulation of experimental data on opinion dynamics, the model provides further arguments supporting the potential of this hypothesis.
The examples of the backfire effect in 
Fig. 1
 provide evidence of the scale and gravity of polarization across multiple dimensions of our society. Yet, understanding these dynamics is only the first step. The ultimate goal is to leverage these insights and devise strategies to alleviate the destructive effects of radicalization and polarization. By offering a comprehensive and robust framework to interpret these dynamics, the proposed quantum-mechanical model stands to make a contribution to these efforts.

Quantized Energy Level Model of the System of Human
Beliefs. The application of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics in the fields of behavioral science, economics and decision-making has opened up novel opportunities for unifying and formalizing previously heuristically formulated psychological, cognitive and finance-related concepts and ideas 
(28)
. In particular, an analogy between mental states and quantum states has been used to explain cognitive dissonance 
(29)
. A similar approach has been adopted in models of confirmation bias (30, 31), two-stage gambling (28), Prisoner's Dilemma game 
(28)
, conjunction fallacy 
(28,
31)
 and Ellsberg paradox 
(28)
. However, although there exist classical models of confirmation bias 
(30,
31)
, opinion formation and polarization 
(32)
(33)
(34)
(35)
(36)
(37)
, and backfire effect 
(38,
39)
, the principles of quantum mechanics have not been applied to these psychological phenomena yet.
We propose a quantum-mechanical model of human system of beliefs (see the inset in 
Fig. 2
) and demonstrate its application to opinion radicalization and backfire effect. It is well-known that quantum-mechanical system can have only certain energies levels compared with a continuum of energy states of a classical system 
(26)
. Therefore, we represent the system of human beliefs as a set of discrete energy levels. Furthermore, in 
Fig. 2
 we draw a parallel between the social circles and atomic orbitals used in quantum mechanics to describe the location and wave properties of an electron in an atom 
(40)
. The electrons occupy atomic orbitals that have discrete energy levels 
(40)
. When atoms interact, their atomic orbitals overlap and energy levels hybridize 
(40)
. We adopt this physical property to model the influence of social circles on the system of beliefs of an individual.
The proposed model stands on solid psychological, philosophical, mathematical and physical ground. Firstly, it is consistent with both notion of discrete mental states 
(41)
(42)
(43)
(44)
 and understanding of information as energy states of a physical system 
(45)
(46)
(47)
. Secondly, the model captures psychological 
(48)
 and mathematical (34, 49) complexity of a system of human beliefs. Thirdly, the model aligns with the famous philosophical maxim pronounced by Ortega y Gasset: "Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia" ("I am me and my circumstance") [see 
(50)
, p. 322; a link between Ortega y Gasset's circumstance and quantum aspects of cognition has also been established 
(51)
]. In the model, the circumstance is represented by interactions between atoms and its influence results in a change of the energy level structure. Finally, any outcome produced by the model originates from a rigorous solution of the fundamental Schrödinger equation 
(26)
.
To establish a physico-mathematical connection between the energy levels and a system of human beliefs, we employ a harmonic quantum oscillator model represented by an electron trapped in a one-dimensional rectangular well, where the energy states are quantized as En ∝ (n/L) 2 , being n = 1, 2, . . . the number of the energy state and L the width of the well (26) (for simplicity, it is assumed that the well has an infinite depth). Noting that potential wells of different width L have different allowable energy levels En, we arrange two or more potential wells into a chain to represent interactions of an individual with social neighbors 
(Fig. 3)
.
We also use the fact that electrons can change energy levels by emitting or absorbing a photon and note that crystalline solids can have energy bands that consist of many closely located discrete energy levels 
(40)
. In the latter case, although electrons are restricted to the band energies, they can assume a continuum of energy values inside a band.
Given this, we postulate that in our model a rather regular and sparse energy level pattern corresponds to a polarized (biased) set of beliefs, but the beliefs of an idealized unbiased person or a group of individuals are represented by a continuum of energy values. Of course, other scenarios are also possible, including the case of several continuum state bands separated by large energy gaps that would correspond to division of opinions into sub-groups 
(52)
.
All model assumptions have a strict physical meaning. If a person holds deeply polarized beliefs, a significant amount of information would be needed to ameliorate the situation (53), for example, by means of metacognitive training 
(54)
. Since information has been associated with energy 
(45-47, 55, 56)
, the quantum-mechanical model captures this scenario as a large energy needed for an electron to transition from one energy level to another. However, a set of densely packed Opinion polarization in social networks. We first use our model to capture the phenomenon of opinion polarization in a social network. When two individuals do not interact and are not influenced by the news media, the systems of their beliefs, represented by the energy levels, remain unchanged because the corresponding wave functions-probability waves that govern the motion of the electron and are described by the Schrödinger equation 
26
-do not overlap. However, as a result of information exchange between these individuals, the potential wells move closer one to another and the wave functions overlap, thereby forcing the energy levels to adjust and split such that they remain unique 
(40)
.
Furthermore, similarly to interactions between atoms, when a large number N of identical potential wells are arranged into a chain, which corresponds to the interaction between N individuals, each discrete energy level splits into N levels. The energy of transition between the so-formed adjacent levels becomes negligibly small so that they can be considered as a continuum, i.e. as an energy band 
(40)
. However, much larger energy is required to transition between the bands, which in the framework of our model means a polarization of opinion. 
Fig. 3
 shows a result of simulation of this scenario, where we form a social network of like-minded individuals, i.e. individuals whose systems of beliefs are represent by the same discrete energy level systems. We take into account a large number of members of the social group and represent them as a periodically arranged sequence (one-dimensional lattice) of identical potential wells 
(Fig. 3a)
.
In the calculation, we define the period of repetition of the potential wells as a and apply Floquet periodic boundary conditions used in solid state physics to approximate a large system using a small part called the unit cell 
(40)
. We consider a reciprocal lattice that represents the Fourier transform of the periodic lattice of potential wells in the physical space (the x-coordinate in 
Fig. 3a
) and that exists in the reciprocal space of wavevector k. According to the convention adopted in the field of solid state physics, we plot an energy dispersion diagram as a function of the normalized wavevector ka/π in the range of values corresponding to the first Brillouin zone that defines the unit cell in the reciprocal space 
(40)
.
The main panel of 
Fig. 3b
 shows the calculated energy dispersion diagram (the solid curves) alongside the energy levels of a standalone single potential well (the dashed lines). The former represent the group opinion formed in a social network of like-minded individuals but the latter corresponds to the opinion of one individual considered separately from social neighbors. The right inset to 
Fig. 3b
 shows the discrete energy levels corresponding to the group (the solid lines) and the isolated individual (the dashed lines). In this calculation, the depth and width of the wells are 0.1 eV and 1 nm 
(40)
.
We can see that, in the group, the original energy levels corresponding to the individuals split and self-arrange, forming several allowed energy bands separated by band gaps (regions of forbidden energies). The formation of energy bands

. Example of opinion polarization. (a) Like-minded individuals are exposed to an opposing opinion, represented by a one-dimensional lattice of identical potential wells with a "defect" lattice node given by an irregular well. A super cell approach described in the main text is employed in the calculation. (b) Main panel: Energy dispersion diagram corresponding to the group opinion before the exposure to an opposing opinion (the solid curves) and after it (the dotted curves). The respective energy level structures are shown in the left inset. Note that the exposure to the opposing opinion results in addition of new discrete energy levels and splitting of the existing ones, which can be seen both in the right and central insets and which is interpreted as opinion polarization. The degree of opinion polarization can be estimated computing the energy difference between the lowest and highest energy levels, as shown in the central inset.
corresponds to the polarization of opinions: the opinions of the group participants is more likely to remain withing the energy bands but changes of opinion are less likely because a high energy is required for an interband transition.
Opinion radicalization. Now we showcase the ability of the model to capture the backfire effect and opinion radicalization in social networks. As an example, we refer to a study demonstrating that exposure to opposing views on social media can radicalize political views 
(8)
. In the cited paper, members of the Republican and Democratic parties received financial compensation to follow officials and opinion leaders with opposing political views. As a result of the experiment, compared with the control group, both Republican and Democrat participants developed more radicalized views with respect to their respective traditional party positions 
(8)
. Interestingly, the degree of opinion radicalization was different among the two groups: the Republican participants showed substantially more conservative views but the Democrat participants exhibited just a slight but statistically significant increase in liberal attitudes 
(Fig. 1, top panel)
.
The corresponding model situation is presented in 
Fig. 4a
, where persons with the same systems of beliefs, represented by regular potential wells, are exposed to an opposing opinion expressed by a person represented by an irregular potential well. Unlike the regular potential wells that are 0.1 eV deep and 1 nm wide, the irregular well is 0.07 eV deep and 2 nm wide. Subsequently, the allowed energy levels of an individual irregular well taken alone are significantly shifted with respect to those of an individual regular well. To account for the presence of the irregular well in an otherwise periodic sequence of identical regular wells, we employ a super cell computational approach that is often used to model a crystallographic defect-an interruption of the regular patterns of arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids 
(40)
.
In the main panel of 
Fig. 4b
, the solid lines denote the energy dispersion diagram corresponding to a polarized opinion in a group of like-minded individuals, which corresponds to the control group (i.e. the irregular well is replaced by a regular one). The dotted lines plot the energy dispersion in the case of exposure to an opposing opinion. The corresponding energy bands are shown in the inset. For the sake of presentation, we limit the energy range of interest to 0 . . . 0.1 eV. We also note that the introduction of a super cell consisting of N cell potential wells effectively folds the Brillouin zone, modifying the energy dispersion curves and requiring an adjustment of the wavevector normalization as kaN cell /π compared with 
Fig. 3b
.
We can see that the exposure to an opposing opinion changes the energy level structure because a defect in an otherwise perfectly periodic lattice of potential wells produces a series of sparse energy levels. As we stipulated that a sparse energy level pattern corresponds to a polarized set of beliefs, we conclude that our model reproduces the backfire effect.
According to 
Fig. 1
, the radicalization also occurs in a reverse scenario illustrated in 
Fig. 5a
, where the majority opinion is represented by the potential well considered in 
Fig. 4a
 as irregular. We simulate this scenario by a super cell consisting of 0.07 eV deep and 2 nm wide potential wells containing a 0.1 eV deep and 1 nm wide irregular well 
(Fig. 5a)
.  
Fig. 4a. (a)
 Like-minded individuals are exposed to an opposing opinion, represented by a one-dimensional lattice of identical potential wells with a "defect" lattice node. Unlike in 
Fig. 4a
, the irregular well is deep and narrow but the majority opinion wells are shallow and wide. (b) Main panel: Energy dispersion diagram corresponding to the group opinion before the exposure to an opposing opinion (the solid curves) and after it (the dotted curves). The respective energy level structures are shown in the left inset. Even though the exposure to the opposing opinion results in addition of new discrete energy levels and splitting of the existing ones as in 
Fig. 4b
, these processes are less pronounced thereby indicating a lower degree of opinion polarization with respect to the scenario modeled in 
Fig. 4
.
The corresponding result is presented in 
Fig. 5b
, where we also observe that the exposure to an opposite view leads to the formation of sparse discrete energy levels, i.e. to a radicalization of the group opinion. We can also see that the sparse energy levels in 
Fig. 5b
 are quantitatively different from those in 
Fig. 4b, which
 indicates that the levels of opinion radicalization corresponding to the results presented in these figures are also different.
To provide a measure of radicalization, we calculate the energy difference between the highest and lowest energy states of the top energy bands in the insets to 
Fig. 4b and Fig. 5b
. Comparing the ratios of these energies corresponding to the group opinion and radicalized opinion (see the solid and dotted lines in 
Fig. 4b and Fig. 5b
), we reveal that the opinion radicalization in 
Fig. 4
 is an order of magnitude stronger than in 
Fig. 5
. This result is consistent with the ratio of the experimental values in 
(8)
 
(Fig. 1, top panel)
.
Similar results hold for a wide range of realistic physical parameters and profiles of potential wells. The model can also be extended to two and three spatial dimensions, being able, in general, to represent interactions in an N -dimensional space 
(26)
. It is also noteworthy that a potential well profile capturing an intricate system of beliefs can be arbitrary complex depending on objectives of the model. For example, one can use a machine learning techniques to synthesize a profile that encodes human emotions and brain activity using the well-known algorithms 
(57)
.


Discussion
Physical aspects. While the ability of quantum-mechanical models of psychological effects and decision-making processes to outperform their classical counterparts has been demonstrated in many works 
(28,
43,
58)
, the exact origin of advantages of quantum approaches remains disputed. To address this challenge in the context of our model, consider the interaction between two individuals-Alice and Bob-in the context of a classical model that considers the nodes of a network as opinions that can assume one of the two allowable states ξ ′ and ξ ′′ (34). These dynamical states can be represented by two identical physical particles defined at any time by the position and momentum ξA ≡ (rA, pA) and ξB ≡ (rB, pB) 
(26)
 Assuming that Alice's opinion is in a certain state ξ ′ and that of Bob is in the state ξ ′′ , we can write that H(ξ ′ , ξ ′′ ) =Ĥ(ξ ′′ , ξ ′ ). This result implies that in a classical model the common opinion state of a group consisting of two individuals is known to within the permutation of the individuals. This ambiguity does not represent any difficulty in modeling opinion polarization. However, it does not enable us to differentiate the impact of Bob's views on Alice's opinion and vice versa at a fundamental level due to the symmetry of H, thus implying that qualitative agreement with the result from (8) cannot be achieved.
The treatment of this scenario using methods of quantum mechanics leads to a different outcome. Indeed, assuming that the states of Alice and Bob are ψ ′ (r) and ψ ′′ (r), which represent wave packets associated with the particles, it can be shown 
(26)
 that the observation of the interaction between Alice and Bob does not permit to decide whether the group opinion is in the state ψ(rA, rB) ≡ ψ ′ (rA)ψ ′′ (rB) or ψ(rA, rB) ≡ ψ ′′ (rA)ψ ′ (rB). This situation is called exchange degeneracy and it originates from the fact that the functions ψ andψ are both eigenfunctions corresponding to a set values produced by the measurement. Subsequently, any linear combination αψ + βψ with |α| 2 + |β| 2 = 1 can be the outcome of measurement. As a result, it is unknown which linear combination represents the state of the system.
Quantum mechanics removes the exchange degeneracy introducing a symmetrization postulate that fixes the coefficients α and β of the linear combination of the states ψ and ψ 
(26)
. As a result, the states of a system of N interacting identical particles are necessarily either all symmetrical or all antisymmetrical with respect to N permutations. Since the proposed model uses the properties of electrons, the corresponding state are antisymmetrical and they are governed by the Pauli exclusion principle stating that no two electrons can occupy the same individual quantum state.
This result is important for capturing the asymmetry of the backfire effect. In particular, since in 
Fig. 1
 data are not available for the pro-vaccine groups and climate change believers, one might first fit the model parameters for reproducing the degree of radicalization of vaccine skeptics and then use the so-calibrated model to estimate the degree of polarization of vaccine supporters. A similar procedure can be applied to climate change believers data.
Psychological aspects. The implications of the proposed model for psychology and decision-making are profound due to the ability of quantum physics to describe certain aspects of human cognition and behavior that classical models have struggled to represent effectively. The principle of superposition, for instance, captures the idea that our minds can hold conflicting ideas or attitudes at the same time 
(27,
28)
. This phenomenon is often observed in human cognition, with people simultaneously maintaining disparate views until a decision point forces them to "collapse" into one position or another.
Moreover, the ability of the proposed model to leverage the laws of quantum physics presents unique advantages for understanding how polarized opinions form and evolve within social groups. The interactions of individuals, viewed as interacting particles, provide a powerful metaphor for the complex and dynamic nature of human opinions and beliefs. These interactions can lead to changes in "energy", which is a metaphor used by us for the degree of radicalization or polarization within a group.
Crucially, this quantum-mechanical approach allows for a differentiation of the impact of one individual's views on another, which is a functionality that is difficult to implement in classical models due to exchange degeneracy. This novel perspective offers potential pathways for designing more effective interventions to mitigate extreme polarization and radicalization using the concept of quantized energy levels.
Finally, incorporating quantum mechanics into models of psychological phenomena could allow for significant advancements in the study of human cognition and decision-making processes. Much like the quantum leap in computational power provided by quantum computers compared with classical digital computers (59), quantum-enhanced models could help overcome certain fundamental limitations in understanding human behavior and decision-making.


Conclusion
This paper demonstrates the potential of a quantummechanical model to illustrate, interpret, and explain the dynamics of opinion polarization and radicalization in social networks. We have shown that the structure of energy levels of a quantum system, specifically of a chain of potential wells, can effectively model social dynamics such as interactions between individuals and groups.
Our results indicate that the phenomenon of opinion polarization can be represented by the formation of continuous energy bands and interband gaps when like-minded individuals interact within a social network. These energy bands represent the polarized groups, with transitions between them requiring significant energy. The alignment of this model with the established social psychology theories is a promising indication of its predictive capacity.
Moreover, we extended this model to capture the effects of exposing like-minded groups to opposing views, demonstrating that this situation can lead to the creation of new, sparse energy levels, symbolizing the radicalization of the group's opinion. This is interpreted as the backfire effect, a behavior observed in real-world scenarios and supported by empirical studies. We also showcased how variations in potential well profiles can influence the degree of opinion radicalization, corroborating with the observation that different groups might react differently to the exposure to opposing views.
Utilizing a novel approach of conceptualizing social interactions, this model provides a theoretical basis for understanding and predicting social dynamics in intricate scenarios. Although this work primarily employs a one-dimensional model, it opens the door to future research extending the model to higher spatial dimensions and considering more complex potential well profiles. In conjunction with the ability of machine learning techniques to synthesize profiles that capture intricate systems of human beliefs, emotions, and brain activity, this property may allow us to further refine the model and better represent and anticipate the multifaceted reality of social network interactions.


Materials and Methods
The model proposed in this paper is based the Schrödinger equation that defines eigenfunctions corresponding to eigenvalues E of the Hamiltonian operatorĤ as 
(26)
:
Hψ(r) ≡ − ℏ 2 2m ∆ + V (r) ψ(r) = Eψ(r) ,
[1]
where ℏ is Plank's constant, ∆ is the Laplacian operator, m is the mass of the electron and V (r) is the scalar potential. We numerically solve Eq. 1 in a one-dimensional space given by the coordinate x using a finite difference method that represents V (x) as a vector of Nx equally spaced points with a step hx 
(60)
. Using a second-order central finite-difference scheme, we obtain
ψ ′′ (x i ) ≈ 1 h 2 x [ψ(x i−1 ) − 2ψ(x i ) + ψ(x i+1 )] .
[2]
The substitution of Eq. 2 to Eq. 1 gives rise to a finite-difference version of the Schrödinger equation written in a matrix form. We employ Floquet periodic boundary conditions ψ(x 0 ) = ψ(x N x ) exp(−jka) and ψ(x N x+1 ) = ψ(x 1 ) exp(jka), where j is the unit imaginary number, k denotes the wavevector and a is the period of repetition of the profile of V (x) (for an isolated potential well ψ(x 0 ) = ψ(x N x+1 ) = 0). The resulting matrix equation is solved using a standard procedure eigs of MATLAB software to find the eigenvalues E for each discrete value of the wavevector k corresponding to the first Brillouin zone. The energy level diagrams plotted as the insets in 
Fig. 3b, Fig. 4b
 and 
Fig. 5b
 are obtained integrating the values of E for all values of k taken into account in the calculation.

(b) Energy dispersion diagram of the lattice of potential wells (the solid curves in the main panel) and the corresponding energy level structure (the solid lines in the inset). The dashed lines denote the energy levels of a standalone potential well corresponding to an isolated individual. Note that in the group the energy levels split and aggregate, forming bands of continuous energy states, compared with the purely discrete energy levels of the standalone individual. While transitions inside an energy band are readily possible, high energy is required to transition between the bands. This physical property is interpreted as opinion polarization. energy levels would represent "open-mindedness" because a continuous distribution of energy levels is characterized by a low transition energy, which means that the individual is receptive to new information, ideas and opinions.
