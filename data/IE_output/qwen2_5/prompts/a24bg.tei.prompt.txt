You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Competitive decision-making refers to an environment where more than one agent competes for a limited reward. Since reward allocation is determined by every decision from every decision-maker, agents within this context are encouraged to predict others' decisions. In response to the introduction of an opponent, our decisionmaking strategies change relative to when we make decisions by ourselves 
(Baek et al., 2013;
Belot et al., 2013;
Cook et al., 2012)
. For example, predictable behaviours such as choosing a response option more than others (item-bias) are significantly reduced when playing against an opponent relative to attempting to generate random sequences alone 
(Baek et al., 2013)
. In such competitive environments, preventing opponent exploitation by engaging in unpredictable (or random) behaviour becomes the key to optimal play 
(Von Neumann & Morgenstern, 1994
; see also Nash Equilibrium and mixed-strategy; 
Nash, 1950;
Baek et al., 2010)
. Here, all available response options are chosen with equal probability at every trial, independently from any previous decisions or outcomes. Mixed-strategy prevents opponent exploitation (ie, loss minimization) due to the equiprobable distribution of decisions across a series of trials while ensuring rewards to the expected level, at least in the long run (eg, 50% wins in binary response games).
One of the reasons why humans have difficulty performing the mixed strategy is due to misconceptions about and misperceptions of random events. Common misconceptions of random events are that 1) irregular sequences imply more randomness, 2) equiprobable outcomes should occur equally in the short run, and 3) more alternation imply more randomness (see 
Hahn and Warren, 2009)
. 
Hahn and Warren (2009)
 argued that these misconceptions are due to our limited workingmemory capacity and represent how humans heuristically process the probabilities RESPONSE AVAILABILITY ON DECISION-MAKING 5 inherent within our environment. Additionally, humans can also misperceive random events as products of skill instead of products of chance, and build incorrect expectations accordingly. For example, Gambler's Fallacy refers to the belief that a frequently repeating outcome (eg, Heads-Heads-Heads-Heads in the case of a coin toss) increases the likelihood of the opposite outcome (eg, Tails) on the next trial 
(De Laplace, 1796)
. In contrast, Hot Hand Fallacy refers to the opposing belief that a frequently repeating outcome (eg, Basket-Basket-Basket-Basket in the case of free throws in Basketball) increases the likelihood of the same outcome (eg, Basket) on the next trial 
(Gilovich et al., 1985)
. These are described as fallacies as these are faulty beliefs applied to statistically independent rather than interdependent events, where the nature of the fallacy appears to be influenced by the focus of attention during the perception of the event: if participants focus on the outcome of the event more alternations are expected (Gambler's Fallacy), whereas if participants focus on the agent of the event more repetitions are expected (Hot Hand Fallacy; 
Ayton & Fischer, 2004;
Roney & Trick, 2009)
.
Due to the misconceptions, misperceptions and performative difficulties of generating random sequences, humans instead rely more on the heuristic tendency to produce decisions that are heavily influenced by immediately preceding actions 
(West & Lebiere, 2001
). 
West & Lebiere (2001)
 developed neural-network models to play the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors (hereafter, RPS) based on the past one (n-1), two (n-1 and n-2), or three (n-1, n-2 and n-3) trials. They reported that the performance of human participants was closer to the model that based the current decision on the behaviour and outcomes of the past two (n-2) trials. The nature of these interactions between previous outcomes and current actions reflects the operation of basic tenets RESPONSE AVAILABILITY ON DECISION-MAKING 6 from reinforcement learning 
(Sutton & Barto, 1998)
. According to reinforcement learning, learning occurs when there is a discrepancy between the expected and experienced outcomes (prediction error; 
Alós-Ferrer & Ritschel, 2018)
. Applied to competitive decision-making, changes in behaviour are required when the experienced outcome (eg, loss) is different from the expected outcome (eg, win), hence lose-shift. However, behavioural modification is not required if the experienced outcome is the same as the expected outcome, hence win-stay. Win-stay and lose-shift are observed across species in both animals and humans 
(Alós-Ferrer & Ritschel, 2018
; 
Barraclough et al., 2004;
Dyson & Asad, 2021;
Lee et al., 2005)
 and are heuristic in nature as they are easily accessible without prior training 
(Stöttinger et al., 2014)
. 
Stöttinger et al. (2014)
 asked participants to play the game of RPS against computerized opponents during training and testing sessions. The computerized opponent was designed to be exploitable where the optimal counter strategies were either win-stay & lose-shift, or downgrade (shifting to the response that would have been beaten by the player's previous response; see 
also Dyson, 2019)
. In conditions where the opponent strategy changed between training and testing sessions, the participants whose optimal strategy was to downgrade during the training session could easily adapt to win-stay & lose-shift strategies during the testing session. This was in contrast to participants who had to move from win-stay & lose-shift during the training session to downgrade strategy during the testing session. While these data suggest that win-stay & lose-shift strategies are more easily accessible than other strategies, they remain sub-optimal in a competitive environment since they are predictable behaviours, potentially exploitable, and represent reliable deviations from the Nash equilibrium of mixed-strategy.
Reinforcement learning and the heuristic strategies of win-stay and lose-shift emphasize how the previous outcome valence (eg, win or loss) heavily influences our next decisions. However, the effects of win-stay and lose-shift are differentially impacted by opponency association 
(Srihaput et al., 2020)
, outcome magnitude 
(Forder & Dyson, 2016;
Kubanek et al., 2015)
 and cognitive load 
(Ivan et al., 2018)
.
In terms of opponency association, 
Srihaput et al. (2020)
 examined the degree to which participants would win-stay and lose-shift when the opponent from the previous trial was either repeated or replaced. The idea here was that replacing an opponent between trials should weaken the influence between the outcome of the previous trial and the action of the current trial. Specifically, participants reduced the degree of winstay in response to the replaced opponent, but their degree of lose-shift was not affected. Similarly, the degree of win-stay increased in response to a larger outcome magnitude, but the degree of lose-shift was independent of outcome magnitude 
(Forder & Dyson, 2016;
Kubanek et al., 2015)
. Finally, increased cognitive load in adult participants (ages 18-26) induced increased tendency to shift following a loss, similar to the level of young children (age 5-9) without cognitive load, suggesting that lose-shift is suppressed by executive functions and represents reflective behaviour 
(Ivan et al., 2018)
. These results suggest that our behavioural responses following a positive outcome (eg, win) tends to be modulated by contextual factors, whereas responses following a negative outcome (eg, loss) tend to be inflexible.


Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we studied the prevalence and flexibility of win-stay and lose-shift behaviour as a function of the number of response options available to the individual within simple game spaces. We considered a within-participant parametric investigation on the number of response options within game spaces necessary since 1) different numbers of response options are often confounded with a different number of discrete outcomes 
(Dahal et al., 2022;
Mookherjee & Sopher, 1994;
Zhou, 2016)
, 2) the number of response options may affect the degree of prediction error 
(Calderon et al., 2021;
De Loof et al., 2018)
, and 3) having too many response options may eventually exceed human decision-making and/or working memory abilities 
(Inbar et al., 2011;
Ivan et al., 2018)
.
First, it is necessary to identify additional differences across paradigms other than the number of responses, such as the number of outcomes. As an example of a binary response decision-making game (Matching Pennies), players choose a side of a coin, and the winner of the trial is determined if the two choices match or mismatch 
(eg, Mookherjee & Sopher, 1994)
. Matching Pennies thus provides binary outcomes where a player either wins or loses each trial from a binary response option (Heads or Tails). In contrast, in the game Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS), players choose from three response options where one item beats an item (eg, Rock beats Scissors), gets beaten by another item (eg, Rock is beaten by Paper), and draws to the same item (eg, Rock draws with Rock; Zhou, 2016). Therefore, RPS not only introduces more response options but also a new outcome: draw. This makes it potentially difficult to separate the effect of the number of response options from the effect of the number of outcomes, particularly given that the seemingly objective neutral outcome of draw tends to be subjectively interpreted in a negative fashion 
(Dahal et al., 2022;
West & Lebiere, 2001)
. Second, the number of response options also affects prediction error 
(Calderon et al., 2021;
De Loof et al., 2018)
. De Loof et al. (2018) manipulated different numbers of word options (2~4) available when participants were asked to guess the correct translation of a cue word. Here, the different numbers of word options reflected different degrees of prediction error: more word options decreased the probability of correct guessing (eg, 2 options = 50% relative to 4 options = 25%), thereby making prediction error more likely. The number of response options impacted subsequent performance since participants performed better in a later recognition test on the words they previously experienced larger prediction errors (ie, guessing correctly from more word options). Third, taken to its limit, increasing the number of response options might ultimately induce cognitive overload. For example, 
Inbar et al. (2011)
 observed individuals reporting making hasty decisions with more regret when having to choose from a large option pool (24-45 options) compared to a small option pool (4-8 options).
In the following Experiment 1, we analysed shift behaviours as a function of the number of response options, by asking participants to play four competitive zerosum games with 2, 3, 5, or 6 responses. A computerized opponent was designed to play mixed-strategy in order to evaluate how the deviations from mixed-strategy in the form of win-stay & lose-shift were modulated by the complexity of the game space 
(Dyson, 2021;
Srihaput et al., 2021)
. In terms of outcome valence, we hypothesized to observe increased shift behaviour post-loss compared to post-win 
(Dyson, Steward et al., 2020;
Sundvall, 2019)
. However, a number of competing hypotheses suggested themselves regarding the impact of the number of response options on shift behaviour. If increased response options would affect prediction error, win-shift behaviour would decrease as the number of response options increased 
(Calderon et al., 2021;
De Loof et al., 2018)
. If increased response options would affect cognitive load, lose-shift behaviour would increase as the number of response options increased RESPONSE AVAILABILITY ON 
DECISION-MAKING 10 (Ivan et al., 2018)
. If increased response options would affect exploration, both winshift and lose-shift would increase as the number of response options increased 
(Brown et al., 2022)
.


Method


Participants
105 students from the University of Alberta participated in the study. The study was approved by Research Ethics Board 2 at the University of Alberta (Pro00112362). All participants provided written informed consent and were rewarded for participation via course credit. 10 participants exhibiting a strong item bias (ie, choosing one item 90% or higher over other items in a condition) were excluded. Hence, the data from 95 participants (range 17-25 years; M = 19 years; 45 female, 47 male, 3 other) were analysed in the study.


Design
Participants completed 480 trials (120 trials × 4 conditions) in a counterbalanced order, playing one version of a two-response game (Matching Pennies), a three-response game (RPS), a five-response game (Elemental), and asixresponse game (Dice Dual; see 
Figure 1
). The BIS-BAS scale 
(Carver & White, 1994
) was administered after completing the four conditions, the data for which will not be discussed here. Stimulus presentation and response recording were coordinated via Presentation ® software (Version 18.0, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Berkeley, CA, www.neurobs.com).


Figure 1
Screen Schematics for the  At each trial in Matching Pennies, both participants and a computerized opponent picked one of two coin sides (Heads, Tails). In one version of the game, matching the coins resulted in a participant win (and computer loss), whereas in a second version, mismatching the coins resulted in a participant win (and computer loss). These two versions of Matching Pennies were counterbalanced across participants. Across the 120 trials, the computerized opponent played according to mixed-strategy, choosing Heads and Tails 60 times in random order. This ensured a long-run win-rate of approximately 50%. For each trial, two sides of a Canadian penny were presented centre screen as a prompt for participants to respond (Heads
[K], Tails [L])
. Both the opponent's and participant's choices were then presented on the left and right, respectively, for 1000 ms. A blank screen was displayed for 500 ms, followed by the outcome of the trial for 1000 ms (either "WIN (+1)" in green font or "LOSE (-1)" in red font). The current score and trial number were updated and displayed for 500 ms before the next trial began.


Three-responses game (RPS)
In the game of RPS, both participants and a computerized opponent picked one of three response options (Rock, Paper, Scissors). Each trial was resolved according to the standard rules of the game: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock, and, matching responses resulted in a draw. Across the 120 trials of RPS, the computerized opponent again played according to mixed-strategy, choosing the 3 responses 40 times in random order. This ensured a long-run win-rate of approximately 33%. For each trial, a fixation cross was displayed as a prompt for participants to respond (Rock [J], Paper 
[K]
, Scissors 
[L]
). Images of the opponent's choice (blue glove on the left) and the participant's choice (white glove on the right)
were then displayed for 1000 ms (after 
Forder & Dyson, 2016)
. As in Matching Pennies, a blank screen was then displayed for 500ms, followed by the outcome of the trial for 1000 ms. The current score and trial number were updated and displayed for 500 ms before the next trial began.


Five-responses game (Elemental)
In the game of Elemental, both participants and a computerized opponent picked one of five response options (Wood, Earth, Water, Fire, and Metal). These options shared non-transitive dominance relations similar to RPS: Wood beats Earth, Earth beats Water, Water beats Fire, Fire beats Metal, and Metal beats Wood, and, matching responses resulted in a draw. Across the 120 trials of Elemental, the computerized opponent selected these 5 responses 24 times each in a random order, yielding a long-run win-rate of 20%. An image to remind which items would beat other items was displayed top-left, in addition to a central response selection prompt
(Wood [G], Earth [H], Water [J], Fire [K], Metal [L])
. As in all previous games, the opponent's choice (left) and the participant's choice (right) were displayed for 1000 ms. After a blank screen (500 ms), the outcome of the trial was displayed (1000 ms), the current score and trial number were updated (500 ms), and the next trial began.


Six-responses game (Dice Dual)
Finally, for Dice Dual, six response options were available for both participant and a computerized opponent, representing the faces of a 6-sided die (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
In one version of the game, an even sum of the two selected die resulted in a participant win (and computer loss), whereas in a second version, an odd sum of the two selected die resulted in a participant win (and computer loss). These two versions of Dice Dual were counterbalanced across participants. Across 120 trials, the computerized opponent chose each of the 6 responses 20 times in random order, predicting in a long-run win-rate of 50%. For each trial, images of six-sided black dice representing each response were displayed to prompt participants to respond 
(1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
6)
. Both the opponent's choice (white die) and the participant's choice (black die) were then displayed simultaneously on the left and right, respectively, for 1000 ms. All other procedural details of Dice Dual were identical to all other games described.

Results


Win-rates
Expected win-rates for the 2-response (50%), 3-response (33%), 5-response (20%), and 6-response (50%; see 
Table 1
) games were compared to observed values via one-sampled t-tests. Across 2-response (49.60%; t[94] = -0.90, p = .369), 3response (33.09%; t[94] = -0.63, p = .533), 5-response (19.64%; t[94] = -0.99, p = .324), and, 6-response (49.43%; t[94] = -1.17, p = .244) games, all comparisons were non-significant. This is consistent with the computerized opponent playing mixed-strategy.


Item-based shift rate
Item-based shift rate was the degree to which participants chose a response not identical to the response made in the previous trial. First, the observed item-based shift rates were compared to those values expected based on participants playing mixed-strategy (see 
Table 2
). Against an expected value of 50% for the 2-response paradigm, shift behaviour was significantly lower following wins (p < .001) but as expected following losses (p = .511). This is indicative of a win-stay bias since the observed value for shift behaviour was significantly lower than the expected value.
Against an expected value of 66.66% for the 3-response paradigm, observed performance was equivalent to following wins (p = .163) but larger than expected following loss (p = .011; hence, a reliable lose-shift bias only). Against an expected value of 80% for the 5-response paradigm, observed performance was equivalent following wins (p = .301) and following loss (p = .147). Against an expected value of 83.33% for the 6-response paradigm, observed performance was both smaller than expected following both wins and losses (both p < .001).
Second, and as a complimentary analysis, a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted comparing item-based shift rates against the withinparticipant factors of response options (2, 3, 5, 6) and outcome valence (win, loss; see 
Table 3
). The main effects of response options (p < .001) and outcome valence (p < .001) interacted with each other (p = .021). Post-hoc analyses using Tukey's HSD (p < .05) showed that item-based shift rate significantly increased following losses relative to wins, although this was not significant for 5-response and 6-response games (Tukey's HSD; p = .157 and p = .970, respectively). Furthermore, the itembased shift rate significantly increased as the number of response options increased from 2-to 3-to 5-responses, but both post-win and post-loss 6-response shift rates were equivalent to 3-response post-loss shift rates (Tukey's HSD; p = .993 and p = .999, respectively). In sum, data from 2-and 3-response games showed significant increases in shift rate as response options increased, and significant increases in shift rate post-loss relative to post-win. Our 5-response game showed a continued increase in shift rate overall, but the difference between post-loss and post-win behaviour was not found. Our 6-response game did not show overall increased shift rate nor increased shift rate post-loss (see 
Figure 2a
).    Note. Bold terms indicate statistical significance (p < .05).


Item-based shift correlations
To further test whether games varying in their number of responses generated similar or different patterns of data, both individual post-win and post-loss item-based shift correlations were compared across 2-, 3-, 5-and 6-response games (see 
Figure   3
). Win-shift rates across 2-, 3-, and 6-response games were positively correlated with each other (rs = 0.268 ~ 0.352, ps < .05), with the exception of the 5-response game.
Win-shift during the 5-response was not correlated with the 2-response (r = .138, p = .182) nor the 6-response game (r = .158, p = .127). Lose-shift rates across 2-, 3-, and 6-response games were positively correlated with each other (rs = 0.255 ~ 0.589, ps < RESPONSE AVAILABILITY ON DECISION-MAKING


20
.05), with the exception of the correlation between 5-and 2-response games (r = .132, p = .204).


Item-based response time
Finally, average median RTs 
(Table 1)
 were analysed by a two-way repeatedmeasures ANOVA with response options (2, 3, 5, 6) and outcome valence (post-win, post-loss) as within-participant factors ( 
Table 3
). The main effects of response options (p < .001) and outcome valence (p < .001) were observed, while the interaction effect was not statistically significant (p = .161). Median RT during the 5-response game (717 ms) was significantly slower (Tukey's HSD, p < .05) compared to other response games (2-response: 408 ms, 3-response: 465 ms, 6-response: 472 ms), whereas median RT after wins was significantly slower compared to that after losses (542 ms versus 490 ms; see 
Figure 2b
).

Discussion
In Experiment 1, we asked participants to play zero-sum games with different numbers of response options 
(2
 Second, the 2-response game was unique in expressing a reliable win-stay bias but not a lose-shift bias against mixed-strategy expected value. This provides one example where binary response paradigms may not be representative of non-binary response paradigms, whereby lose-shift heuristics are more reliable than win-stay heuristics in the latter case. For example, in the non-binary case of RPS, the data showed a lose-shift bias which appears to be a more consistent behavioural signature based on previous studies 
(Budescu & Rapoport, 1994;
Forder & Dyson, 2016;
Dyson et al., 2016;
Dyson, Musgrave et al., 2020;
Dyson, 2021;
Dyson, 2023;
Rapoport & Budescu, 1992;
Sundvall, 2019)
. This is an important caveat when anticipating and interpreting the data from 2-response, 2-outcome paradigms like Matching Pennies (see also 
Sundvall, 2019;
Dyson, Musgrave et al., 2020
, for similar data). Third, the traditional increase in item-based shift rates following losses (post-loss) relative to wins (post-win) was only significantly observed across the 2-and 3-response games, but not across the 5-and 6-response games. This was similarly reflected in reaction time measures, with all paradigms producing a post-win slowing effect where average median RTs post-win were significantly larger than those post-loss (see 
Dyson, 2024)
.
Fourth, shift rates were also sensitive to the number of response options available, significantly increasing as the number of response options increased from 2-, 3-and 5-response games. However, shift rates during the 6-response game were equivalent to that generated by the 3-response game (RPS). Thus, the 6-response paradigm did not act in accordance with the data pattern predicted based on the 2-, 3-and 5response paradigms. Fifth, at an individual level, we observed positive correlations among the shift rate across the 2-, 3-, and 6-response games, with the exception of the 5-response game. The lack of significant correlations with the 5-response game may be due to the significant slowing of RT during the 5-response game.
The data from Experiment 1 suggest that the selection of an experimental paradigm appears to be a critical factor in generating specific decision-making profiles: each response paradigm generated its own behavioural idiosyncrasies. The 2response paradigm (Matching Pennies) was unique with respect to the generation of win-stay but not lose-shift. The 3-response paradigm (RPS) reliably produced loseshift biases and post-win slowing, but contained 3 (rather than 2) outcomes. The 5-response paradigm (Elemental) failed to correlate with any of the other paradigms significantly, and was marked by significantly delayed decision-making times.
Finally, our novel 6-response paradigm (Dice Dual) did not produce the increase in item-based shift behaviour predicted by the increase in responses across the 2-, 3-and 5-response paradigms, nor did a significant difference between win-shift and lose-shift rates. Some of the possible reasons for these idiosyncrasies related to higher responseoption paradigms (5-and 6-response) will now be explored.
The 5-response game (Elemental) was a complex adaptation of the 3-response game (RPS) with two additional response options 
(Gu, 2013)
. We argue that the unique results observed from this game are not due to the presence of the draw outcomes nor the low baseline win-rate but rather due to the number of response options. Specifically, the unique draw outcome in the 5-response game does not sufficiently explain the absence of a significant difference between win-shift and loseshift rates since the increased lose-shift rate was observed during the 3-response game (RPS), which also had a draw outcome. Moreover, the long-range expected rates of win, draw and loss against unexploitable opponents (20%, 60%, and 20%, respectively) in Elemental-and in particular, the low win rate-also fail to adequately account for non-significant win-shift and lose-shift differences. This is because the absence of a significant difference between win-shift and lose-shift rates was also observed in the 6-response game, which had a much higher win-rate of 50%. In further support of the claim that win-rate did not impact decision-making behaviour, supplementary correlational analyses between win rates and win-shift rate revealed no significant correlations during the 5-response game (r = .163, p = .141) or the 6response game (r = .103, p = .328). The correlations between loss rate and lose-shift RESPONSE AVAILABILITY ON DECISION-MAKING 25 rate revealed the same results (5-response: r = -.093, p = .403; 6-response: r = .158, p = .133). Additionally, the increased lose-shift rate was not observed during the 6response game, which was a binary outcome game. Hence, the different win/loss rates or the number of outcomes do not explain the absence of predictable shift behaviours.
Therefore, we are left with the conclusion that an increased number of responses (specifically, 5 or 6) removes the sensitivity of outcome on shift behaviour, and specifically, the increase in lose-shift relative to win-shift behaviours. This interpretation aligns with the results of increased shift rate as the number of response options increased, reflecting promoted exploration 
(Gaffan & Davies, 1981;
Brown et al., 2022)
.
More specifically, the absence of a significant difference between win-shift and lose-shift rates might be due to the increased random explorative behaviour as a function of the increased number of response options 
(Brown et al., 2022)
. Random exploration refers to an explorative behaviour that is encouraged by decision noise or by chance, in contrast to directed exploration, which refers to an explorative behaviour that is encouraged by information bonus (see 
Wilson et al., 2014)
. In 
Brown et al. (2022)
, participants were asked to play 4-response and 8-response multiarmed bandit tasks where each response option was assigned with different reward pools. The participants had to sample each response option to decide the most rewarding response option. 
Brown et al. (2022)
 identified three forms of behaviour:
exploitation, as choosing the previously sampled option that always rewarded; directed exploration, as choosing the previously unsampled option; and random exploration, as choosing the previously sampled option but that was not always rewarded. Compared to the 4-response task, the participants exhibited increased random exploration when playing the 8-response task. Therefore, our data align with the data of 
Brown et al. (2022)
 in that an increased number of response options in a decision-making paradigm will promote the degree of random exploration exhibited.
Being able to generate more random exploration by using 5-or 6-responses, however, comes with other forms of paradigm differences. For example, the 5-response paradigm failed to significant correlate with any of the other paradigms and generated significantly slower RT. These results suggest that our 5-response game may not be an ideal task to generalize to other competitive decision-making tasks.
In summary, Experiment 1 revealed a significantly higher tendency for loseshift behaviour compared to win-shift behaviour against an unexploitable opponent with mixed-strategy across the 2-and 3-response games. This distinction became weaker when the number of response options increased above three responses, as the difference between win-shift and lose-shift rates was not statistically significant. This might be due to increased random exploration caused by the number of response options rather than the baseline win-rate or the number of outcomes. Individual consistencies in shift rates were observed across the 2-, 3-, and 6-response games.
However, the 5-response game appeared not to be an ideal task to be generalized as the game generated unique forms of behavioural responses, including the absence of individual consistency in the shift behaviour and significantly slower median RT. The following Experiment 2 will attempt to replicate random explorative behaviour in function of the number of response options by manipulating the computerized opponent to be exploitable, and therefore, encouraging exploitation over exploration.


Experiment 2
In Experiment 1, we observed potentially sub-optimal heuristic strategies of win-stay and lose-shift against an unexploitable opponent when the game provided 2or 3-response options, respectively. However, these heuristic strategies were weakened when the number of response options rose to 5-or 6-response options. The lack of significant difference in shift rates could not be explained by the different win rates or the number of outcomes. Rather, the increased number of response options might have encouraged random explorative behaviours, irrespective of outcome valence, prohibiting outcome-based heuristic strategies

Method
Eighty-one students from the University of Alberta participated in the study.
This study was approved by Research Ethics Board 2 at the University of Alberta (Pro00112362). 12 participants were excluded due to a strong item bias similar to BIS-BAS scale was conducted at the end of the experiment, similar to Experiment 1.


Results


Win-rates
Expected win rates for the 2-response (50%), 3-response (33%), 5-response (20%), and 6-response (50%) games were again compared to observed values via onesampled 2.24, p = .028; see 
Table 1
) with participants acquiring 1% win-rate more than expected value. In Experiment 2, there was little evidence that participants successfully exploited their computerized opponent.


Item-based shift rate
As in Experiment 1, observed shift rates were compared against shift rates expected as a function of playing mixed-strategy. All response games showed a significant win-stay heuristic (operationalized as win-shift percentages being significantly below chance). In contrast, only the 3-response paradigm showed a reliable lose-shift heuristic (see 
Table 2
). Both 2-and 5-response paradigms were at the expected value, whereas the 6-response paradigm produced lose-shift rates significantly below the expected value, thereby replicating Experiment 1 (see 
Table   1
).
As a complementary response, a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was again conducted comparing item-based shift against the within-participant factors of response options (2, 3, 5, 6) and outcome valence (win, loss; see 
Table 3
). The analysis revealed significant main effects of response option (p < .001) and outcome valence (p < .001), but the interaction was not statistically significant (p = .317). As in Experiment 1, shift rates were significantly increased post-loss relative to post-win (68.77% versus 59.97%). Similar to Experiment 1, shift rates significantly increased across 2-to 3-to 5-response games (45.99%, 66.16%, 75.66%; all Tukey's HSD, p < .05). However, shift rate in the 6-response game (69.65%) was significantly lower than 5-response shift rates, and statistically equivalent to shift rates in the 3-response game.


Item-based shift correlations
Correlations among shift rates across 2, 3, 5, and 6-response games against the exploitable opponent are displayed in 
Figure 4
. The shift rates across 2, 3, 5, and 6response games were all positively correlated against each other after both wins (rs = 0.287 ~ 0.486, p < .05) and losses (rs = 0.289 ~ 0.494, p < .05).


Item-based response time
Similar to Experiment 1, average median RT 
(Table 1)
 was analysed by a twoway repeated-measures ANOVA with response options (2, 3, 5, 6) and outcome valence (win vs. loss) as within-participant factors 
(Table 3)
. The main effects of response options (p = .003) and outcome valence (p = .008) were observed, while the interaction was not statistically significant (p = .687). As in Experiment 1, the median RT following wins was slower than following losses (542 ms versus 490 ms). Similar to Experiment 1, median RT during the 5-response game (592 ms) was significantly slower compared to the 2-response (416 ms) and 6-response games (457 ms), but this was not significantly different for the 3-response game (526 ms).

Discussion
In Experiment 2, we asked participants to play four competitive zero-sum games with different numbers of response options (2, 3, 5, or 6) against an exploitable opponency. The participants failed to exploit the 2-, 3-, and 6-response games, while performing beyond the chance level (20%) during the 5-response game by 1%. These results do not replicate that of previous studies where participants successfully exploited an opponent with item-bias strategies 
(Dyson, 2021;
Dyson & Asad, 2021)
.
Increasing the degree of item-bias, or adopting different strategies such as repetition Given the general lack of exploitative behaviour in Experiment 2, we may expect the results to largely replicate the data from Experiment 1, where the computerized opponents were deliberately (as opposed to accidentally) unexploitable.
Indeed, a number of findings were reproduced from Experiment 1. In particular, the 2response paradigm reliably generated evidence of a group bias for win-stay but not lose-shift behaviour, whereas the 3-response paradigm reliably generated evidence of a group bias for lose-shift (and win-stay) behaviour. Also, participants significantly shifted more post-loss compared to post-win, and the shift rate increased in the function of the number of response options with the exception of the 6-response game with its shift rate lower than the 5-response, and higher than the 2-response. Analyses on average median RT revealed post-win slowing in all games, while the median RT during the 5-response game was once again significantly slower than that across the 2-, and 6-response games. Unlike Experiment 1, however, the median RT during the 5-response game was not significantly different from the 3-response game. Perhaps as a result of this non-significant reduction in RT for the 5-response paradigm between  
(Dyson, 2021;
Dyson, 2024;
Eben et al., 2020;
Verbruggen et al., 2023)
. Our results aligned with the previous literature since the participants failed to reliably exploit the opponent in Experiment 2.
Third, the shift rate increased as the number of response options increased.
These results replicated Experiment 1 and aligned with the previous data examining random exploration 
(Brown et al., 2022)
. The overall shift rate during the 6-response game, however, was significantly lower than the 5-response game and the expected value, suggesting that the random exploration was only promoted up to 5 responses.
This potential 'limit' of random exploration beyond 6 or more responses was also replicated in Experiment 1, suggesting that the way the participants played the novel  
Barraclough et al., 2004;
Dyson & Asad, 2021;
Lee et al., 2005)
.
Indeed, participants shifted more following a loss, exhibiting lose-shift bias over the expected value of 50% (t[69] = 3.24, p = .002). Unlike between-category shift, withincategory shift does not represent functionally significant changes in responses but rather aligns more with purely explorative behaviour. Here, participants selected a different token of the same category type (odd to odd, or, even to even). This change does not impact the outcome of the trial according to the rule set provided. In contrast to the between-category shift promoted following losses, the within-category shift was dominant following wins compared to losses. Previous literature on rodents in a radial maze reported increased win-shift beyond chance level when more options were provided than the training session, interpreting win-shift representing exploratory behaviour 
(Gaffan & Davies, 1981)
. 
Gaffan & Davies (1981)
 also reported more loseshift compared to win-shift suggesting two types of shift behaviours: the shift behaviour reflecting explorative behaviour (ie, win-shift beyond chance level) or that reflecting associative learning (ie, more lose-shift compared to win-shift). Our withincategory shift behaviour is similar to the increased win-shift behaviour, while our between-category shift is more similar to the increased lose-shift in the study of 
Gaffan & Davies (1981)
. To clarify the degree to which these two forms of shift behaviour are modulated by outcome valence, Experiment 3 was run as a parametric manipulation of response option availability only using the Dice Dual paradigm. In this way, all other potential confounding parameters, such as the number of outcomes and baseline win-rate, were eliminated.


Experiment 3
In Experiment 1 and 2, we investigated the effect of the number of response options on decision-making using existing zero-sum games 
(Matching Pennies, Rock, Paper, Scissors, and Elemental)
 in addition to the novel game, Dice Dual. We observed shift rate increased as the number of response options increased, suggesting greater response availability promotes random exploration. However, the shift rate decreased as the number of response options increased from a 5-to a 6-response game. The idea that 6-responses (and up) may represent the limit on increasing random exploration required further study since the paradigm rests upon 2 categories of responding (odd / even). Therefore, while 6 responses are available to all participants, it is not clear whether participants are using all possible responses. For example, participants could sufficiently engage with the Dice Dual paradigm by using two responses: one token of the odd type and one token of the even type. However, it was apparent that participants were using more than two responses in the Dice Dual paradigm as a result of observing within-category shifts across trials. Specifically, the between-category shift rate (where participants moved between even and odd numbers) was higher following losses compared to a win, whereas the withincategory shift rate (where participants moved within even and odd numbers) was higher following wins. One of the key differences between the two types of shift behaviour is that between-category shift is rule-relevant shift behaviour: changing the odd/even category of a response which would affect outcome valence. Withincategory shift, on the other hand, is a rule-irrelevant shift as the odd/even category of a response remains unchanged. Lastly, the 3-and 5-response games in Experiments 1 and 2 introduced the third outcome of draw, which is still under debate regarding its 'neutrality' (see 
Dahal et al., 2022;
West & Lebiere, 2001)
. The introduction of the third outcome makes it difficult to compare the behavioural performance among the games in addition to the unique behavioural performance during the 5-response game in Experiment 1. To address these concerns, Experiment 3 parametrically manipulated the number of response options now within an unexploitable 6-response game context. Comparing both between-category and within-category shift behaviour as a result of the availability of 2-, 4-and 6-response options will serve as a conservative test of the impact of response options, given that all other parameters will be identical.
We tested the variability of response option effects by also parametrically varying the number of opponent responses (similarly 2-, 4-and 6-responses).


Method
Seventy-two individuals (range 17-28 years; M = 20 years; 36 female, 22 male, 14 prefer not to disclose) from the University of Alberta participated in the study. 52 individuals were right-handed. This study was approved by Research Ethics Board 2 at the University of Alberta (Pro00116715). The design and procedure were similar to Experiment 1 in that participants played against an unexploitable computerized opponent using mixed-strategy, but in Experiment 3, only variants of the Dice Dual game were used. Participants played 9 blocks (48 trials each) of the game, created by the combinations of different numbers of response options for the player (2, 4, or 6 responses) and opponent (2, 4, or 6 responses). When 2-response options were available, these were 3 or 4; when 4-response options were available, these were 2, 3, 4, 5; and 6-response options represented the full set of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ( 
Figure 5
). The order of the 9 blocks was counterbalanced so that the number of player responses changed every block, while the number of opponent responses changed every first, fourth, and seventh block.

Results


Win-rates
Win-rates 
(Table 4)
 were compared across the number of player responses (2, 4, 6) and the number of opponent responses (2, 4, 6) using a two-way repeatedmeasures ANOVA (see 
Table 5
). There was no main effect of player response (p = .220), opponent response (p = .521), nor interaction (p = .621). The average winrate across all 9 conditions (49.72%) was statistically equivalent to 50% (t(71) = -0.97, p = .333). Both observations were consistent with the inability of participants to exploit an opponent using the mixed-strategy, as per Experiment 1.   
(Table 6)
 were analysed via a three-way repeated-measures ANOVA using outcome (win vs. loss), player response (2, 4, 6) and opponent response (2, 4, 6) as within-participant factors (see 
Table 5
). interacted with one another (p < .001). As shown in 
Figure 7a
, shift rates significantly increased post-loss relative to post-win (70.27% versus 57.35%, respectively), and as the number of player responses increased (48.01%, 69.12%, 74.29%, respectively).
The interaction arose due to the non-significance between lose-shift rates for 4-player response and 6-player response conditions (75.15% versus 78.56%; Tukey's HSD, p = .075). The data from Experiment 3 align with observations from both Experiments 1 and 2 in that item-based shift rates generally increase a) post-loss as opposed to postwin and b) as the number of response options increases. Since win rates for all versions of Dice Dual approximated 50%, we can be more confident in attributing increases in the item-based shift to response increases in Experiment 3.
Experiment 3 also generated novel data in terms of behavioural changes as a function of the number of responses the opponent used (2, 4 or 6). This resulted in an interaction between player × opponent response (p = .042), in addition to a three-way interaction (p = .006). In particular, the item-based shift rate was only impacted by the opponent response in the 4-response player condition, and, only between opponent 4response and opponent 6-response (72.74% vs. 65.88%; Tukey's HSD, p < .05; see 
Figure 7b
). Under these specific conditions, increasing opponent responses decreased item-based shift rates (contra increased item-based shift rates for increasing player responses). There is no clear explanation for this finding. The three-way interaction ( 
Figure 6
) further showed that the effects of opponent response were more pronounced following wins (left-hand panel) relative to losses (right-hand panel).
Increased behavioural variation following wins relative to losses is a common feature of the literature

Item-based response time
Average median RT 
(Table 6
) was analysed by a three-way repeated-measures ANOVA similar in structure to item-based shift rates (see 
Table 5
). A main effect of outcome valence (p = .003) replicated a central finding from Experiments 1 and 2 of slowing responding post-win relative to post-loss (591 ms versus 543 ms, respectively; see 
Figure 8a
). Once again, post-win slowing tends to result from an unexploitable opponent (cf. Experiments 1 and 3) or an exploitable opponent that a player fails to exploit (cf. Experiment 2; 
Dyson et al., 2018)
. A main effect of player response (p < .001) also interacted with opponent response (p < .001; see 
Figure 8b
).
Here, overall reaction times when the player had 2 responses (502 ms; Tukey's HSD, p < .05) was faster relative to the player having 4-(595 ms) or 6-(603 ms) responses, with no significant difference between 4-and 6-responses (Tukey's HSD, p > .05).
The interaction arose as a result of a significant slowing in when both player and opponent had 4-responses (677 ms), relative to player 4-response and opponent 6response (520 ms; Tukey's HSD, p < .05; see 
Figure 8b
). While we have no obvious explanation for this interaction, these data align with a similar effect in item-based shift rate. Thus, responses are both slower and more likely to shift during 4-response player and 4-response opponent interactions, relative to 4-response player and 6response opponent interactions.
The design of Experiment 3 further allowed us to explore two additional forms of shift behaviours. Dice Dual (6-response) is structurally isomorphic to Matching Pennines (2-response) since only the categorical relationship between responses is relevant to winning or losing: in Dice Dual, it is the category of the sum as odd or even that determines the outcome, independently of the values selected by player and opponent. Therefore, between-category shift refers to choosing a different item that also belongs to a different category from the previous trial (eg, 2 to 3, or, 5 to 4). We argue that the between-category shift rate represents a change in the participant's mental model related to the defining rule of the game. This is in contrast to withincategory shift, which refers to the choice of a different item that is from the same category as the previous trial (eg, 2 to 4 or 1 to 3). We argue that this behaviour does not represent a change in the participant's mental model related to the defining rule of the game and hence represents more explorative behaviour. Note, then, that in the 2response player version of Dice Dual, within-category shifts do not exist, and that item-based shift rates are numerically identical to between-category shift rates.

Between-category shift rates
For between-category shift rates 
(Table 6
), a three-way repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted with player responses (2, 4, 6), opponent responses 
(2,
4,
6)
 and outcome valence (win, loss), as within-participant factors (see 
Table 5
). The main effects of player (p < .001), opponent (p = .017) and outcome valence (p < .001) were subsumed in two interactions: outcome valence × player response (p < .001) and a three-way interaction (p = .003). Firstly, between-category shift rates were generally higher following losses (57.38%) relative to wins (44.01%), similar to the item-based shift rates in Experiment 3, and the shift rates in Experiments 1 and 2.  
Figure 9a
). These data provide evidence of behavioural flexibility post-win relative to behavioural inflexibility post-loss. These data also confirm the positive relationship between the number of response options available to the player and the degree to which rule-relevant (between-category) shift behaviour manifests.
Given the complexity of the three-way interaction (containing 18 cells), we analyzed player response × opponent response for post-win and post-loss behaviour separately (see 
Figure 6
, middle panel). For post-loss data, there were no main effects of player response (F[2,142] = 0.11, MSE = 162, p = .893, ƞp 2 = .002), opponent response (F[2,142] = 2.10, MSE = 260, p = .126, ƞp 2 = .029), or, interaction 
(F[4,284]
 = 2.11, MSE = 162, p = .080, ƞp 2 = .003). Once again, post-loss behaviour was defined by inflexibility. In contrast, for post-win data, there were main effects of player response options for the opponent produced less rather than more shift behaviour.


Within-category shift rates
As a novel aspect of Experiment 3 design, within-category shifts were identified as the choice of a different item from the same category as the previous trial (eg, 2 to 4, or 1 to 3). We argue that this behaviour does not represent a change in the participant's mental model related to the defining rule of the game, but rather more explorative behaviour. Within-category shift rates 
(Table 6)
 were entered into a similar three-way repeated-measures ANOVA (see 
Table 5
), apart from the reduction in the number of conditions for player response from three levels (2, 4, 6) to two levels (4, 6). 
Figure 6
 (right panel) displayed within-category shift rates in functions of player response, opponent response options and outcome valence. Only a main effect of player response (p < .001) and an interaction between player response × opponent response (p = .010) were observed. Here, the largest response combination (6-response player and 6-response opponent) generated the highest within-category shift rate relative to all 4-response player rates (Tukey's HSD, p < .05; see 
Figure 9b
).
Critically, we observed that in contrast to between-category shift rates, withincategory shift rates did not modulate as a function of outcome.

Discussion
In Experiment 3, we asked participants to play Dice Dual with the numbers of response options varying from 2, 4, to 6 responses for both human player and computerized opponent. Due to the isomorphic structure of the game, similar to the 2response game, Matching Pennies, Dice Dual allowed investigation of the effect of the number of response options while maintaining the number of outcomes 
(win, lose)
 and the long-run distribution of these outcomes (ie, 50% wins and 50% losses). We analyzed item-based shift behaviour in order to replicate the results from Experiment novel measures expected to reflect rule-relevant and rule-irrelevant behaviours, respectively.
Regarding item-based shift behaviour, we replicated the results from Experiment 1; the participants shifted more following loss compared to following wins, and as the number of response options increased. Increased lose-shift behaviour was consistently observed across Experiments 1-3, suggesting predictable behaviours following losses 
(Budescu & Rapoport, 1994;
Forder & Dyson, 2016;
Dyson et al., 2016;
Dyson, Musgrave et al., 2020;
Dyson, 2021;
Dyson, 2023;
Rapoport & Budescu, 1992;
Sundvall, 2019)
. Increased shift behaviour in the function of the number of response options was also replicated, similar to Experiment 1. The interaction between the number of player response options and outcome valence revealed that win-shift increased linearly as the number of response options increased while lose-shift only increased from binary (2-response) to non-binary responses (4-, 6-response). These results suggest that, when controlling the number of outcomes, shift behaviour following a win was flexibly modulated by the number of responses, while shift behaviour following a loss remained inflexible. As such, the number of response outcomes may be added to other aspects of the decision-making environments, such as outcome magnitude 
(Forder & Dyson, 2016;
Kubanek et al., 2015)
 or opponent strategy 
(Gruber & Thapa, 2016;
Srihaput et al., 2020)
, which also impact behavioural responses following a win relative to a loss. Uniquely, the design of Dice Dual allowed separating traditionally used item-based shift behaviour into rule-relevant between-category shift and rule-irrelevant within-category shift,
emphasizing that a simple shift behaviour could represent rule-relevant shift or random exploration.
We defined between-category shift as choosing a different item that belongs to a different category from the decision made in the previous trial (eg, 2 to 3 or 5 to 4).
Recall that the outcome valence of Dice Dual is determined based on whether the sum of the choices is even or odd. Therefore, the odd/even category of the responses determines outcome valence, allowing for multiple, yet rule-wise identical responses.
For example, 1, 3, and 5 are identical responses when determining outcome since all three responses are odd. Therefore, we argue that between-category shift represents rule-relevant shift behaviour that affects the outcome of a trial, reflecting changes in an individual's mental model of the game. First, the participants shifted significantly more between categories following losses compared to wins, which replicated the results of increased lose-shift in Experiments 1, 2, and 3 on item-based shift. Second, we observed clear asymmetrical effects of the number of response options on between-category shift behaviour. Specifically, win-shift increased in function of the number of response options, while lose-shift was not affected by the number of response options. These results align with the previous results suggesting flexible responses following positive outcomes, compared to inflexible responses following negative outcomes 
(Dixon et al., 2013;
Eben et al., 2020;
Forder & Dyson, 2016;
Gruber & Thapa, 2016;
Ivan et al., 2018;
Kubanek et al., 2015)
. For example, 
Kubanek et al. (2015)
 reported an increased win-stay rate in function of outcome magnitude while the lose-shift rate was independent of outcome magnitude. Similarly, the post-win slowing likelihood was increased in response to a larger outcome magnitude, whereas post-loss speeding was not affected 
(Eben et al., 2020)
. 
Ivan et al. (2018)
 suggested that lose-shift is an intuitive and inflexible strategy as the adult participants exhibited increased lose-shift behaviour in response to increased cognitive load, similar to that observed from young children (ages 5-9) without the additional cognitive load. Our results, along with the previous literature, emphasized flexible behavioural response following positive outcomes, where win-shift behaviour increased as the number of response options increased. In contrast, our responses following negative outcomes tended to be inflexible, independent of the number of response options. Between-category lose-shift was not affected by response
availability. Yet, the item-based lose-shift rate increased from binary to non-binary responses, meaning there is a portion of item-based lose-shift not explained by between-category shifts. This would naturally be represented by within-category shifts.
In contrast to the between-category shift, the within-category shift does not represent changes in the mental model related to the defining rule of the game since shifting from dice-1 to dice-3 does not change the category of the response (ie, they are the same odd responses). As such, we argue that within-category shift represents explorative behaviour. We observed that the within-category shift was modulated by the number of responses similar to the between-category shift: the within-category shift rate increased as the number of response options increased, with the highest shift rate when both the player and opponent had the highest number of response options (ie, 6 responses). However, the within-category shift was not modulated by outcome valence, unlike between-category shift behaviour. Therefore, in returning to our itembased shift analysis in Experiment 3, we observed that both win-shift and lose-shift rates increased in function of the number of response options. When parsing this behaviour out into between-category and within-category shift behaviour, the loseshift rate was not modulated by the number of response options for between-category shift. Therefore, these results suggest that the increased item-based lose-shift was due to the increase in explorative behaviour in the form of within-category shift. This explorative behaviour was independent of outcome valence while modulated by the number of response options, similar to the findings of 
Brown et al. (2022)
, which reported increased random exploration in function of the number of response options.
In Experiment 3, we investigated the effect of the number of response options on shift behaviour while controlling the number of outcomes and long-range win-rate.
As in Experiments 1 and 2, we observed that item-based shift behaviour was modulated by the number of response options, increasing with more response options in response to both positive and negative outcomes. However, only between-category win-shift behaviour was modulated by the number of response options, while between-category lose-shift was not, reflecting flexible behavioural response following positive outcomes in comparison to the inflexible behaviour following negative outcomes. Rather, the modulation of item-based lose-shift in function of the number of response options was due to within-category shift behaviour, which was modulated by the number of response options, while being independent of outcome valence, and represented random explorative behaviour.


General Discussion
We investigated the effect of the number of response options on shift behaviour. In Experiment 1, the participants played 2-, 3-, 5-, and 6-response games against a computerized opponent playing mixed-strategy (ie, unexploitable). We observed increased shift rates modulated by the number of response options. Loseshift was significantly higher than win-shift across the 2-and 3-response games but not across the 5-and 6-response games, suggesting a high number of response options promote outcome-independent shift behaviour. We had three potential hypotheses on the effect of the number of response options on shift behaviour. If more response options would increase prediction error, thereby reinforcing stay behaviour, the winshift would decrease as the number of response options increased 
(Calderon et al., 2021;
De Loof et al., 2018)
. Instead, we observed increased win-shift. If more response options would induce cognitive load, the lose-shift would increase as the number of response options increased 
(Ivan et al., 2018)
. We observed an increased lose-shift in the function of the number of response options, but so was the win-shift.
Lastly, if more response options would promote random exploration, both win-shift and lose-shift would increase as the number of response options increased 
(Brown et al., 2022)
. Our results aligned with the hypothesis that more response options would promote random exploration. Based on these results, we argued that the lack of significant differences between win-shift and lose-shift across the 5-, and 6-response games were due to outcome-independent random exploration.
In Experiment 2, the participants played the same four zero-sum games used in Experiment 1 but against a computerized opponent that played item-bias strategies (ie, exploitable). Because exploitation was encouraged while exploration was discouraged, we hypothesized that the number of response options would modulate both win-shift and lose-shift, with lose-shift occurring significantly more than winshift across all four games. We observed the modulation of the number of response options on shift behaviour and a significantly higher lose-shift rate compared to the win-shift rate. These results support the initial hypothesis that the absence of a significant difference between win-shift and lose-shift across the 5-and 6-response games in Experiment 1 was due to promoted exploration. However, both Experiments 1 and 2 had limitations due to the confounding variables of the number of outcomes, variation in long-range win rates across the different paradigms, and, the exploitable opponent of Experiment 2 being largely unexploited. Collectively, this made it difficult to isolate the effect of the number of response options. Furthermore, we identified that shift behaviour could represent intentional (ie, rule-relevant) shift behaviour or random (ie, rule-irrelevant) shift behaviour, requiring more careful game design to isolate random explorative behaviours.
In Experiment 3, the participants played Dice Dual with varying numbers of response options (2, 4, 6 responses). The unique and structurally isomorphic designs of Dice Dual to Matching Pennies allowed providing for different numbers of response options while fixing the number of outcomes to two outcomes (ie, one positive and one negative outcomes). Additionally, item-based shift behaviour could be separated into between-category and within-category shift behaviours. Analyses on item-based shift behaviour replicated the results in Experiments 1 and 2, with both win-shift and lose-shift modulated by the number of response options. However, the lose-shift was non-linearly modulated as the shift rate increased from binary to nonbinary responses. On between-category shift, we observed asymmetrical effects of the number of response options as win-shift was modulated by the number of response options while lose-shift was independent of the number of response options. These results align with previous literature on flexible responses following positive outcomes and inflexible responses following negative outcomes 
(Dixon et al., 2013;
Eben et al., 2020;
Forder & Dyson, 2016;
Gruber & Thapa, 2016;
Ivan et al., 2018;
Kubanek et al., 2015)
.
When analysing within-category shift behaviour, we observed outcomeindependent modulation of the number of response options on shift behaviour, with the shift rate increasing the most when both player and opponent had the maximum number of response options. These results on within-category shift explained the nonlinear increase in item-based lose-shift since there could be no within-category shift in the 2-response game. The results on betweenand within-category shift rates aligned with the absence of a significant difference between win-shift and lose-shift in Experiment 1. In Experiment 1, we observed a significantly higher lose-shift rate compared to win-shift across 2-and 3-response games, but not across 5-and 6response games. Considering how the between-category win-shift increased in the function of the number of response options and how the within-category shift increased in the function of the number of response options independently of outcome valence, the win-shift in Experiment 1 might have increased more due to an increment in both rule-relevant and rule-irrelevant shift behaviours, making the difference between win-shift and lose-shift not significant.
In these respects, a shift behaviour could represent one of two types: rulerelevant shift behaviour or rule-irrelevant explorative shift behaviour, similar to how exploration is further categorized into task-relevant directed exploration or taskirrelevant random exploration 
(Sadeghiyeh et al., 2020;
Wilson et al., 2014)
. The majority of decision-making tasks used in previous literature, however, had limits in their design to sensitively quantify different types of shift behaviour. Our study has the following limitations. First, our argument on the withincategory shift in Experiment 3 representing explorative behaviour requires further testing. Traditionally, explorative and exploitative behaviours have been studied using a decision-making task with varying degrees of outcome magnitude 
(Barnes et al., 2021;
Berger-Tal et al., 2014;
Lee et al., 2011;
Wilson et al., 2014;
Wilson et al., 2021)
. Varying outcome magnitudes allow calculating the expected value of each response option, categorizing whether a decision was made for the highest expected value (ie, exploitation) or not (ie, exploration). The games used in our study, in contrast, used fixed magnitudes (ie, +1 for win, -1 for loss). Therefore, further study is required to introduce varying degrees of outcome magnitudes into the game design in order to compare the explorative and exploitative behaviours to previous literature.
Second, further study measuring neurophysiological activity could provide additional information on how a different number of response options affects decision-making.
Previous literature suggested that mediofrontal theta activity at 200-250 ms postfeedback, P3, and choice-locked N2 be associated with explorative and exploitative behaviours 
(Cavanagh et al., 2012;
Hassal et al., 2013;
Hassal et al., 2019)
. These neurophysiological measures could assist in categorizing shift behaviours made during a game.
In conclusion, the number of response options is a factor that must be taken into consideration when designing a task. Our results suggest that more response options promote random explorative behaviour and that a simple item-based shift behaviour could contain different characteristics based on its rule-relevancy. Similar to how exploration was later categorized into directed and random exploration 
(Wilson et al., 2014)
, a shift behaviour could be categorized into rule-relevant shift behaviour (ie, directed) or rule-irrelevant shift behaviour (ie, random). Outcome valence had asymmetrical effects on the former, with flexible responses following positive outcomes and inflexible responses following negative outcomes, while the latter was independent of outcome valence. Our novel game design also emphasized how traditional binary response games have limitations on clarifying these various shift behaviours due to providing limited options for players to shift into.


Constraints on Generality
All experiments described in this study were conducted with undergraduate students at research university located in Canada. We expect the results to be replicable with different young adult populations within Canada. However, our findings may not be generalizable to especially young or old samples as different behavioural signatures in forms of increased lose-shift behaviour from young children 
(Ivan et al., 2018)
 and age-related exploitation biases (see Spreng & Turner, 2021 for review) are observed.

3, 5, 6) against a computerized opponent playing mixed-strategy. The aim was to assess how the number of response options impacted classic metrics of decision-making performance and the degree to which specific paradigms generalized to others. First, all selected paradigms achieved the expected win-rates anticipated from a computerized opponent playing according to mixedstrategy. Analyses on average median RT revealed significantly slower RT post-win compared to post-loss in all four paradigms. Post-win slowing
(Chu et al., 2018;
Dixon et al., 2013;
Dyson, 2024
) reflects a flexible cognitive state following a positive outcome and is a reliable feature of other competitive decision-making paradigms, when the number of wins is equivalent to the number of losses
(Dixon et al., 2013;
Dyson, Sundvall, et al., 2018;
Eben et al., 2020)
, such as in the case of an unexploitable computer opponent in Experiment 1. Post-win slowing was independent of the number of response options, reflecting that the flexible cognitive state in response to a positive outcome remained stable irrespective of the number of response options.


Experiment 1 .
1
The data from 69 participants (range 17-32 years; M = 19 years; 39 female, 30 male) were analysed in the study. The participants completed 480 trials in a counterbalanced order, similar to Experiment 1, with 2-, 3-, 5-and 6-response games. The difference in methodology was in the strategy of the opponency. The computerized opponent was programmed to play one response option more than others, exhibiting an item-bias. The item-bias ratio was set to be 25%, meaning that the opponent played one item 25% more compared to other response(s). Thus, the computerized opponent played Tails 75 times (Heads 45 times) during the 2-response game, played Paper 60 times (Rocks and Papers 30 times each) during the 3-response game, played Fire 48 times (other options 18 times each) during the 5-response game, and played dice-3 45 times (other options 15 times each) during the 6-response game.


(
eg, Heads-Heads-Heads-Heads), alternation (Heads-Tails-Heads-Tails; Zhang et al., 2023), or cyclic strategies (eg, Rock-Paper-Scissors-Rock, or Rock-Scissors-Paper-Rock; Dyson, Steward et al., 2020; Sundvall & Dyson, 2022) could be used in future studies as a more reliable way to increase participant win rates during exploitable opponency.


Figure 6(left panel) displayed item-based shift rates in functions of player response, opponent response options and outcome valence. The main effects of player response (p < .001) and outcome (p < .001)


For example, binary response zero-sum games like Matching Pennies or the 2-response version of Dice Dual are incapable of categorizing the shift behaviour into rule-relevant or ruleirrelevant shift since the games only provide one response option to shift into. Non-binary response games such as Rock, Paper, Scissors or Elemental are also incapable of categorization since any shift behaviour could be rule-relevant. The non-binary response version of Dice Dual, on the other hand, is capable of the categorization as players are provided with a choice to intentionally change the response category. Our results highlight the limits of traditional decision-making tasks and emphasize the necessity of careful task design to sensitively investigate behavioural responses in a decision-making environment.

). The previous results from Experiment 1 suggested that more response options assist players in being more unpredictable by increased random exploration. The use of an exploitable opponent could test whether the results from Experiment 1 were limited to an unexploitable opponent, as exploitable opponents discourage exploration
(Wilson et al., 2021)
. Opponent exploitation was introduced in Experiment 2 via an item-bias manipulation, where an opponent chooses one response option more than the other -response games), but against an exploitable computerized opponent. This manipulation was an attempt to discourage exploration, allowing us to investigate whether the increased random explorative behaviours as a function of the number of response options observed in Experiment 1 would replicate under a different competitive decision-making environment. We hypothesized that the participants would exhibit significantly increased lose-shift behaviour compared to win-shift due to the exploitable opponent
(Dyson, 2021;
Dyson & Asad, 2021)
, irrespective of the number of response options due to the relatively discouraged exploration in cost of exploitation
reinforcement learning heuristics (win-stay) when opponents could be exploited. In
Experiment 2, we asked participants to play the same games as Experiment 1 (2-, 3-,
5-, and 6
responses (Dyson, 2021; Dyson & Asad, 2021). For example, Dyson (2021) asked participants to play RPS against a computerized opponent that played mixed-strategy (ie, unexploitable) or item-bias (ie, exploitable). Participants exhibited increased lose- shift only against the unexploitable opponent while exhibiting increased win-stay and lose-shift rates against the exploitable opponent. In these respects, explorative behaviour, such as increased win-shift, was abandoned in favour of traditional


Moreover, tendencies towards win-stay in Experiment 2 are predicted in response to an exploitable opponent operating according to item-bias (although win rates do not indicate robust exploitation). These results highlight that the nature of the paradigm used to investigate decision-making will determine the types of biases to be observed.More broadly, the win-stay & lose-shift biases are not synchronous sets of behaviours but rather asynchronous, contingent on the response complexity of the environment and nature of opponency.
Second, post-win slowing was observed independently of the number of
Experiment 1 (post-win: 766 ms; post-loss: 669 ms) and Experiment 2 (post-win: 669 response options, similar to Experiment 1. Previous literature observed post-win
ms; post-loss: 555 ms; F[1,162] = 1.23, p = .269, η 2 = 0.01), positive correlations in slowing against an unexploitable opponency, whereas post-loss slowing was observed
the win-shift and lose-shift rates were now observed across all four paradigms. Once against an exploitable opponency
again, we may draw a number of interim conclusions.
First, we observed significantly higher lose-shift rates compared to win-shift irrespective of the number of response options and win rates. However, a significant difference between win-shift and lose-shift rates does not necessarily equate to win- stay & lose-shift biases per se, as the difference could be due to the deviation of only win-stay or lose-shift behaviour from expected value. Our analyses comparing the shift rates against the expected values revealed a win-stay bias (ie, low win-shift rate) during the 2-, 3-, and 5-response games, and a lose-shift bias (ie, high lose-shift rate) during the 3-response game. The 6-response game exhibited a stay bias irrespective of outcome valence, replicating Experiment 1. These results also replicated previous literature reporting win-stay bias, but not lose-shift bias, in Matching Pennines (Dyson, Musgrave et al., 2020) and win-stay & lose-shift biases against an exploitable opponent in Rock, Paper, Scissors (Dyson 2021; Dyson & Asad, 2021).


Dice Dual was at least different from other zero-sum games. Specifically, in Dice Dual, shift behaviour could be categorized into two categories: between-category shift and within-category shift, where the former represents rule-relevant shift behaviour (changing the odd/even category of the response from the previous trial).
across Experiment 1 and 2, we observed significant three-way interaction (F[1,162] =
17.55, p < .001, η 2 = .10) and a two-way interaction effect (F[1,162] = 103.04, p <
.001, η 2 = .39) between the shift types (main effect: F[1,162] = 990.99, p < .001, η 2 =
.86) and outcome valence (main effect: F[1,162] = 9.81, p = .002, η 2 = .06). The two-
way interaction effect revealed that between-category shift rate following a loss
(56.48%) was higher than a win (47.35%), while within-category shift rate was higher
following a win (20.99%) compared to a loss (15.67%). The three-way interaction
Within-
category shift, on the other hand, represents rule-irrelevant shift behaviour that
provides no functional impact on the game (maintaining the odd/even category from
the previous trial but changing the token such as 1 to 3, or, 4 to 2). In a supplementary
analysis comparing the two types of shift behaviour in response to wins and losses
was due to the within-category shift rate difference between wins and losses being only significant in Experiment 1 (post-win: 22.43%; post-loss: 13.01%) but not in Experiment 2 (post-win: 19.54%; post-loss: 18.33%). Shift behaviours in traditional zero-sum games such as Matching Pennies or Rock, Paper, Scissors imply functionally significant changes from the previous decision. For example, changing a response from head to tail, or Rock to Scissors would reflect abandoning the current response and adopting a new strategy. In the context of the 6-response Dice Dual paradigm, the between-category shift also represents functionally significant changes in the odd/even category that ultimately determine outcome valence. According to reinforcement learning, this shift in strategy would be more likely to occur following a negative outcome (Alós-Ferrer & Ritschel, 2018;
