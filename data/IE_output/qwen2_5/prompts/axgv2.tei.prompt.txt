You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

General Audience Summary
A well-informed decision requires some form of information retrieval. Cognitive psychologists traditionally emphasize two types of explicit memory information retrieval: episodic memory, the recall of specific, autobiographical episodes; and semantic memory, the recall of general facts. But how is this information used to inform a decision? Narrative models of decision making propose that individuals evaluate choice information in terms of fit with real world knowledge. This can be thought of as an assessment of realism. Here, we examined the separate effects of explicit memory and perceived realism on complex choice. In the current study, jury eligible subjects (N = 83) read mock cases consisting of crime accusations with varying levels of evidence. For each case, subjects were asked to rate the strength of their episodic memories (personal experience related to the case), the strength of their semantic memories for similar events (knowledge about the type of case), whether the case seemed realistic (perceived realism), and the strength of the case against the accused. Subjects also gave judgments of guilty/not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Mixed effects modeling suggested that both explicit memory and perceived realism influenced case strength ratings and judgments of guilt. Variance partitioning and structural equation modeling indicated that the two largest contributors to juror decisions were a combined factor reflecting perceived realism and both forms of explicit memory and, separately, an independent contribution of perceived realism. Overall, these findings support an independent role for perceived realism in juror decision making that is separate from episodic memory and semantic memory, as would occur if low perceived realism reflects a mismatch between memory and case evidence. We discuss the nature of this matching process, such as the ease of mental simulation (e.g., whether it is easy to imagine the crime actually occurring).

A distinct role for perceived realism in juror decision making
In complex decision-making, such as faced by jurors, the human brain responds to and accumulates information to make sense of the evidence 
(Shiller, 2017;
Castrellon et al., 2022)
. In particular, specific past experiences (i.e. episodic memory) or general facts (i.e. semantic memory) may be retrieved to influence choice. These types of retrieved information are termed explicit memory 
(Squire & Dede, 2015;
Tulving, 1972;
Moscovitch et al., 2016;
Rubin, 2022;
Yee & Thompson-Schill, 2014;
Binder & Desai, 2011;
Renoult et al., 2019;
Kumar, 2021
) and these forms of explicit memory have been shown to affect decisions in simple economic tasks 
(Murty et al., 2016;
Del Missier et al., 2013;
St-Amand et al., 2018)
. These forms of explicit memory may be particularly important in complex-decision making, where the relevant evaluative dimensions are undefined or unknown; in such cases, decision-makers assess the match of the presented information to explicit memory 
(Pennington & Hastie, 1986)
. We refer to this match assessment as perceived realism. Although prior work has considered the role of explicit memory or perceived realism in isolation, none has considered how these processes interact when making complex decisions. Here, we examine how explicit memory and perceived realism relate to each other in juror decision-making.
Prior work indicates that explicit memory plays an important role in both value-based choice and decisions made under risk and uncertainty 
(St-Amand et al., 2018;
Murty et al., 2016;
Drost, 2013;
Del Missier et al., 2013)
. For instance, episodic memory for prior rewards underlies choices between lotteries 
(Murty et al., 2016)
 and semantic memory has been related to consistency in risk perception and resistance to sunk cost fallacy 
(Del Missier et al., 2013)
. It is important to note that these explicit memory effects were found with relatively simple decisions in which the relevant dimensions along which choices should be evaluated were well defined, and probabilities of outcomes could be calculated.
In contrast to simple decisions, complex decisions entail radical uncertainty, where the attributes that should be combined to reach a decision are not clearly defined and probabilities of outcomes cannot be calculated 
(Kay & King, 2020;
Tuckett & Nikolic, 2017)
. Under these circumstances, decision makers might adopt a more intuitive narrative process for choice evaluation 
(Johnson et al., 2023)
. For instance, according to the story model of juror decision making 
(Pennington & Hastie, 1986;
1992)
, verdict selection is influenced by aspects of narrative quality such as cohesion of a story and how well it matches choice options.
An important aspect of narrative quality that may influence decisions is the perceived realism of the presented information. According to 
Cho and colleagues (2012)
, perceived realism is a multidimensional construct that consists of five attributes: plausibility (i.e. the likelihood that an event could occur in the real world), typicality (i.e. how common the event is perceived to be), factuality (i.e. extent to which an event resembles a real life occurrence), narrative consistency (i.e. internal coherence of a story), and perceptual quality (i.e. extent to which characteristics of a narrative are seen as compelling). Notably, perceived realism may rely on explicit memory. For example, the typicality of narratives is said to be based on an individual's past and current experiences 
(Hall, 2003)
. 
Winterbottom et al. (2008)
 reviewed the literature on narrative decision making and concluded that perceived realism of events is an important component of the process. For example, specific dimensions of perceived realism, such as narrative consistency and perceptual quality, have been shown to positively predict the persuasive potential of advertisements and public service announcements 
(Cho et al., 2012)
. Greater perceived realism of narrative information has been shown to predict the credibility of messages and influence health related intentions 
(Greene & Brinn, 2003;
Winterbottom et al., 2008)
. Moreover, perceived realism in juror decision making can be influenced by the media, as seen in the CSI effect 
(Maeder & Corbett, 2015;
Ewanation et al., 2017)
. The CSI effect is the finding that individuals who watch popular crime drama television programming like CSI are more likely to convict defendants in cases with incriminating DNA and fingerprint evidence relative to eyewitness testimony because those are the types of evidence that play a central role on CSI 
(Ewanation et al., 2017)
.
Although prior studies indicate that perceived realism plays a role in decision making, it is not clear from these studies how perceived realism interacts with explicit memory. For example, does perceived realism emerge from a comparison between the presented information and explicit memories of past experiences and general knowledge? If so, we predict there will be a common factor reflecting memory and perceived realism as well as an independent contribution of perceived realism. More specifically, a case will be rated as strong when the juror retrieves a great deal of information about the case (i.e., high memory retrieval), with the retrieved information matching the details of the case (i.e., high perceived realism). Thus, memory retrieval and perceived realism will combine into a common factor influencing decisions. However, if some cases give rise to high memory retrieval but the case is a poor match to that retrieved information (e.g., the juror knows something about the kind of case, but the specifics of the case do not match what they know), this should give rise to an independent contribution of perceived realisma contribution reflecting this mismatch. In brief, a case is judged to be strong when there is strong memory retrieval that matches the case (high perceived realism), whereas a weak case can occur either because of poor memory (there is no retrieved information to guide the matching process) or because there is strong memory retrieval, but a mismatch to the case (low perceived realism).


The Current Study


6
We investigated the relationship between the effects of episodic memory, semantic memory, and perceived realism in the evaluation of criminal cases. Specifically, we used variance partitioning and structural equation modeling to determine how subjects' ratings of episodic memory, semantic memory, and perceived realism relate to each other in a juror decision making context and how they relate to subjects' perceived strength of the case against accused parties. Furthermore, we considered how these factors predict the binary decision required of jurors: the likelihood of finding accused parties guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
If decisions of guilt and case strength are based on perceived realism and if perceived realism is determined by comparing case evidence to explicit memory, we predict that all three measures (episodic memory, semantic memory, and perceived realism) will positively covary as they relate to case strength and judgments of guilt (good memory that matches the case, giving rise to perceived realism). In addition, if perceived realism arises from a matching process, then perceived realism may also exhibit a role that is distinct from explicit memory (e.g., in some situations, explicit memory may be high, but perhaps the case is not a good match to explicit memory, resulting in low perceived realism and low rating of case strength). Thus, perceived realism should emerge as the most important factor underlying case strength in a manner that is both clustered with and separate from explicit memory strength.


Method


Participants
A total of 85 subjects were recruited through Prolific, an online platform for conducting survey-based research. We calculated a target sample size of 85 based on an expected small correlational coefficient (r = .30) with a Type I error rate of 5% and Type II error rate of 20%. Two participants were excluded due to missing data, leaving a total sample size of 83 subjects 7 (52 women, 28 men, 3 other) ranging in age from 18-66 years (M= 37.06, SD = 12.81). To obtain a sample that was representative of potential jurors in the American legal system, the characteristics of the subject pool were limited to English speaking United States citizens aged 18 years or older. Participants were compensated at a rate of $8.00 an hour in proportion to the time they spent to complete the task.


Design
The task was based on Pearson and colleagues' (2018) original juror decision making paradigm. Subjects were presented with a series of 31 cases with each case presented on a separate webpage. Each case consisted of a crime scenario followed by evidence created through a random variation of factors. The crime scenario described the accusation of a particular crime in a brief paragraph, varying in type (e.g. from DUI to murder) and severity according to the North Carolina Criminal Code 
(Pearson et al., 2018)
. Evidence appeared below the crime scenario in a bullet point format and consisted of four main categories: physical, documentary, eyewitness testimony, and character (i.e. a brief statement that characterizes the accused party).
Physical, documentary, and eyewitness testimony each contained one of four possible evidence valences (i.e. inculpatory, exculpatory, ambiguous, or absent). Character evidence contained one of three possible valences (i.e. good, bad, or absent). For each case, evidence was presented under the credible condition, meaning that at least one piece of evidence across the physical, documentary, and eyewitness testimony categories was assigned to be inculpatory and the number of exculpatory pieces of evidence were less than the amount of inculpatory and ambiguous pieces of evidence. Within these constraints, all valences for each evidence category were assigned randomly. After each case presentation, subjects were asked to provide ratings for case strength, episodic memory, semantic memory, and perceived realism and, finally, they were asked to indicate if they found the accused party to be guilty or not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. An illustration of the task design can be seen in 
Figure 1
.
Because the goal of this study was to identify the factors influencing juror decision making, case strength rating (a continuous measure) and the decision to find an accused party guilty or not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (a binary measure) were specified as outcome variables. The predictor variables were measured continuously and included ratings for episodic memory, semantic memory, and perceived realism. The data was analyzed using linear mixed effects modeling, structural equation modeling, and multilevel logistic regression. Variance partitioning was applied to a linear mixed effect model of case strength to determine the common and independent effects of each predictor variable on an outcome measure.


Measures
After each case presentation, subjects rated their responses to a series of questions on a sliding scale ranging from "very weak" to "very strong" as well as one question where they indicated a single response out of two possible choices. Ratings on the sliding scale were measured continuously with the endpoints ranging from 0 to 100 points. Subjects were specifically asked to rate the strength of the case, the strength of their memories for similar cases and their perceived realism of the case. Subjects rated their ability to remember events similar to the presented case (i.e. episodic memory), how knowledgeable they were concerning similar cases (i.e. semantic memory), and how realistic they believed the case to be (i.e. perceived realism). Subjects were also asked to indicate if they found the accused party to be guilty or not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
Upon completion of the juror task, subjects' demographic information was obtained via a Qualtrics survey. The Qualtrics survey asked questions pertaining to subjects' age, sex, gender, political affiliation, marital status, employment status, and education level. This demographic survey also asked whether the subject themselves or an immediate family member had been accused of a crime and how much experience they had with the American criminal justice system. All code and materials for the task is available at https://github.com/alro-CU/juror_prolific_task.

Procedures
Subjects on the Prolific website were redirected to a web server that hosted the task. The website first displayed an informed consent form. Subjects who chose to participate were then directed to the task instructions and completed a decision-making task that took roughly 30-45 minutes. After completing the task, participants' web browsers redirected them to a separate survey website (i.e. Qualtrics) to fill out demographic information. Upon successful completion of the task and demographic survey, subjects were compensated through the Prolific system.


Statistical Analyses
All data analyses were conducted using R version 4.3.1 for MacOS (https://mac.rproject.org/). Ratings for episodic memory, semantic memory, perceived realism, and case strength were z-scored using the grand mean of each response type across all subjects. All data is publicly available at https://github.com/alro-CU/Juror-Task-Memory.
To determine the relationships between episodic memory, semantic memory, perceived realism, and case strength ratings, a series of pairwise simple regressions were conducted to calculate beta coefficients between all measures using the lme4 package in R (https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html). Pairwise regression was calculated using linear mixed effects modeling, where subjects and crime scenarios were modeled as random effects.
The beta coefficients of each regression and the random effects were estimated using Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (ReML). Linear mixed effects modeling was also used to estimate the fixed effects of episodic memory, semantic memory, and perceived realism on case strength ratings. Of note, memory and perceived realism were observed rather than manipulated, but treating these measures as fixed effects allowed us to identify the manner in which variation in these cognitive processes may have caused differences in the case strength decision process.
Subjects and crime scenarios were modeled as random effects. Both fixed effects and random effects were estimated with the lme4 package in R (https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) by using Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (ReML).
Multilevel logistic regressions were used to estimate the fixed effects of episodic memory, semantic memory, perceived realism, and case strength ratings on voting guilty. Similar to the linear mixed effects model of case strength, subjects and crime scenarios were both modeled as random effects. Both fixed effects and random effects were estimated with the rstanarm package in R using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Estimation (https://mcstan.org/rstanarm/).
Variance partitioning of all linear mixed effects models and multilevel logistic regressions were conducted using the PartR2 package in R 
(Stoffel et al., 2021)
. This method of variance decomposition calculates semi partial R2, which was used to determine the variance that is unique attributable to perceived realism or a form of explicit memory, as well as variance that is shared amongst combinations of the three predictors.
Structural equation modeling was conducted using version 0.6-17 of the lavaan package in RStudio (https://lavaan.ugent.be/). Models were identified using the unit variance identification method by fixing factor variance to one. To address non-independence of data, all observations were clustered within subjects using the cluster argument of lavaan's sem function.
Maximum likelihood estimation alongside lavaan's default optimization method (i.e. NLMINB) was used to estimate factor loadings, variances, covariances, and path coefficients.
Due to the non-normality of the data, correction methods were applied during the estimation process. Overall model fit was obtained with a Yuan-Bentler correction to provide robust standard errors and scaled test statistics. Additionally, model comparisons were calculated using a chi square difference test with Satorra Bentler scaled test statistics.
To assess model fit, we used 
Hu and Bentler's (1999)
 established cutoff values for evaluating fit indices. Acceptable fit was quantified by a CFI ≥ 0.95 and RMSEA values ranging from 0.05-0.08.

Structural Equation Model of common memory factor and perceived realism's effects on case strength
If decisions of case strength arise from a comparison process between the details of a case and retrieved information related to the case, with a match giving rise to perceived realism and high case strength, this predicts there should be both a common memory / perceived realism factor (i.e., situations of strong memory retrieval that match the details of the case) as well as a direct influence of perceived realism, as would arise from situations of good memory retrieval that mismatch the details case (low perceived realism and low case strength). For instance, if a mock-juror believes that DNA evidence is crucial for the type of case that has been presented (i.e., the CSI effect), but the case does not include DNA evidence, this mismatch will give rise to low realism and low case strength ratings. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test this prediction. Here, factor loadings for episodic memory, semantic memory, and perceived realism onto a common latent variable were estimated while clustering observations by subject. Path coefficients regressing case strength onto the common latent variable as well as perceived realism alone were estimated. Overall model fit was good, χ2(1) = 3.34, p = 0.068, CFI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.05. Factor loadings and path coefficients for this model can be seen in 
Figure 3
.
The factor analysis with perceived realism as a separate direct factor was based on the prediction that realism reflects a matching process between memory and the details of the case.
A crucial aspect of testing this prediction is to compare this account to alternative accounts of the data. Thus, two additional factor analyses were conducted reflecting alternative hypotheses in which either episodic memory or semantic memory gave rise to an independent factor, rather than perceived realism. One alternative model estimated path coefficients regressing case strength onto the common latent factor and episodic memory ratings alone while clustering observations by subject. Analogously, the other alternative model estimated path coefficients regressing case strength onto the common latent factor and semantic memory ratings alone while clustering by subject. Overall fit for the model including a direct path from episodic memory to case strength was poor, χ2(1) = 31.67, p < 0.05, CFI = 0.89, RMSEA = 0.11. Similarly, overall fit for the model including a direct path from semantic memory to case strength was also poor, χ2(1) = 20.46, p < 0.05, CFI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.09. Factor loadings and path coefficients for both models can be seen in Supplementary Materials. Notably, overall fit for the model predicting case strength with a common memory factor and perceived realism separate from the common factor (AIC= 26,574; BIC = 26650) was significantly better than a model of case strength being predicted solely by a common memory factor (AIC = 26,723, BIC = 26,793) as demonstrated results from a Satorra Bentler chi-square difference test, ∆χ 2 (1) = 23.85, p < 0.001.
Factor loadings and path coefficients for a model that predicts case strength with a common memory factor alone can be seen in Supplementary Materials.  
Fig. 3
. Confirmatory factor analysis results for a model in which case strength ratings were predicted from a latent general memory variable comprised of episodic memory, semantic memory, and perceived realism ratings as well as a direct influence of perceived realism, independent of the general memory factor. Additional confirmatory factor analyses determined that the model shown here provided a better account of the data than a model including only the general memory factor or alternative models with a general memory factor combined with a direct path from either episodic memory or semantic memory. This best-fitting model is expected if perceived realism reflects a matching process between memory retrieval and the details of the case, with a good match supporting the common general memory factor whereas a mismatch between memory and the case would lead to low realism and low case strength ratings. All factor loadings and path coefficients are presented at the standardized level.


Common Memory Component and Distinct Role of Perceived Realism Predicts Case Strength


Multilevel Logistic Regression Modeling of Judgments of Guilt
To determine if the effects of explicit memory and perceived realism on case strength extend to the binary guilty / not-guilty decision, a multilevel logistic regression of explicit memory and perceived realism on voting guilty was conducted. Only episodic memory and perceived realism significantly predicted judgements of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt when controlling for the other predictors. More specifically, when controlling for the effects of semantic memory and perceived realism, the odds of voting guilty were predicted to increase by a factor of 1.41 for increasing strength of episodic memory ratings, p < 0.001, whereas, when controlling for the effects of episodic memory and semantic memory, the odds of voting guilty were predicted to increase by a factor of 1.68 for increasing strength of perceived realism ratings, p < 0.001. The full results of this model can be found in 
Table 3

Discussion
We found support for the hypothesis that when confronted with a complex decision, such as the decision faced by jurors, individuals assess the match / fit between retrieved information and the evidence at hand, with a match giving rise to perceived realism and a positive evaluation of the evidence. As predicted by this account as applied to the reported mock juror task: 1) perceived realism was the most important factor predicting case strength ratings and judgments of guilt; 2) high memory ratings and high perceived realism clustered together in a common latent variable predicting case strength ratings; and 3) perceived realism exhibited a separate influence on case strength ratings that was independent of memory ratings. The common latent variable was predicted to arise from situations in which mock-jurors have prior knowledge about the type of presented case and that prior knowledge matches the details of the presented case.
This match gives rise to high plausibility / perceived-realism and thus high ratings of case strength. The independent factor of perceived realism was predicted to arise from situations in which mock-jurors have prior knowledge about the type of presented case, but that prior knowledge mismatches the details of the presented case. This mismatch gives rise to low perceived realism and thus low ratings of case strength despite high memory ratings.
Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that this explanation of the results was preferred over one in which there was only a common latent variable or ones in which there was a separate independent influence of either episodic memory or semantic memory. Next, we consider this memory match explanation of perceived realism in greater detail.


What is the common memory component?
A common component of memory across episodic memory, semantic memory, and perceived realism is consistent with a general need to retrieve relevant information before making a decision. The influence of information retrieval on decision making has been explored in various economic tasks 
(Murty et al., 2016;
Del Missier et al., 2013)
. While the role of information retrieval in judging perceived realism has not been formally studied, it is difficult to imagine a mechanism by which realism is assessed without retrieving relevant information such as past experiences and general knowledge. In terms of the hypothesized memory matching process that might underlie perceived realism, memory retrieval is a prerequisite. In the absence of memory retrieval, perceived realism will necessarily be low. Thus, memory and perceived realism should positively covary in explaining case strength.


Decision making once information has been retrieved
An assessment of realism could allow decision makers to choose between competing options by evaluating the persuasiveness of a given choice. This role of perceived realism in the decision process aligns with previous work exploring its effects on narrative persuasion 
(Cho et al., 2012;
Winterbottom et al., 2008
 What is the independent component of perceived realism?
The proposed role of perceived realism is similar to the role of simulation in the Conviction Narrative Theory of Decision 
Making (Tucket et al., 2017)
. In the Conviction Narrative Theory, simulation serves to fill in undefined parameters 
(Johnson et al., 2023)
.
Simulating retrieved information to make decisions is also consistent with Schacter and Addis'
(2007) constructive episodic simulation hypothesis. This framework proposes that subjects recall personal experiences and factual knowledge to imagine possible events and make predictions about future outcomes or consider scenarios that could have occurred in the past. 
(Schacter et al., 2017;
Devitt et al., 2017;
De Brigard et al., 2013;
Patel et al., 2022
).
In the current task, the independent effect of perceived realism on choice may reflect subjects projecting recalled information into a simulation of a case and then making decisions based on attributes of the simulation. The attributes of the simulation that may influence choice could be how well the imagined scenario fits with the subjects' real-world knowledge 
(Pennington & Hastie, 1986;
1992)
 or the ease of imagining the given scenario 
(Kahneman & Miller, 1986)
. More specifically, if the mock-juror has a great deal of real-world knowledge about the type of presented case and yet finds it difficult to mentally simulate the specifics of the presented case, they will rate the case as having low perceived realism, giving low judgments of case strength and a lowered odds of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. These instances of good memory retrieval and yet a mismatch between memory and the details of the case may underlie the independent component of perceived realism.


Conclusion
Using a mock-juror decision making task, the current study finds support for the hypothesis that when faced with a complex decision, individuals retrieve information from memory and assess realism by matching the evidence to the retrieved information. As predicted by this account, there was a shared contribution of explicit memory and perceived realism, as well as a direct influence of perceived realism that was independent of explicit memory. The common factor of explicit memory and perceived realism might reflect situations in which memory retrieval matches the specifics of the case whereas the independent influence of perceived realism might reflect situations in which the mock-juror has good knowledge about the type of case, yet finds it difficult to mentally simulate the details of the case as actually occurring (i.e., a poor match between the case and memory). By measuring both memory influences and perceived realism, and by comparing different statistical models of the results, this study has identified perceived realism as a key process that may underlie the holistic evaluations that are commonly deployed in everyday complex decisions.
Figure 3.


To characterize the causal role that explicit memory and perceived realism may have played to influence case strength decision making, linear mixed effects modeling was used, with explicit memory and perceived realism as fixed effects, and case strength rating as the dependent variable. Both forms of explicit memory and perceived realism significantly predicted case strength when controlling for the effects of each other: Episodic memory, β = 0.17, CI = [0.11 -0.23], p < 0.001, semantic memory, β = 0.07, CI = [0.01 -0.13], p < 0.05, and perceived realism, β = 0.26, CI = [0.21 -0.31], p < 0.001. Estimates of the fixed effects and random effects of the model can be seen inTable 1.Variance partitioning of the linear mixed effects model determined the proportion of variance of case strength that was shared amongst combinations of predictors and uniquely attributable to each predictor. The results of variance partitioning indicated that the two largest contributors to case strength include a unique effect of perceived realism (i.e. 5.21% of total R 2 )

). In narrative persuasion, a narrative is proposed and subsequently evaluated by comparison with retrieved information. During this comparison, it is possible that a decision maker assesses perceived realism by first attempting to simulate the proposed narrative. One way this could occur is through a holistic comparison of that simulated narrative to their explicit memories. The outcome of this process would give rise to the common memory component when comparison provides a match (e.g., when it is easy to mentally simulate the details of case as actually occurring considering what is known about that kind of case).
