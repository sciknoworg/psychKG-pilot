You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Facial appearance is often used to verify an individual's identity. In a one-to-one matching task, the observer must determine whether two simultaneously presented images show the same person or two different people (e.g., comparing an individual to their photo ID). Despite having both images available for inspection, matching unfamiliar faces -those the observer has not seen before -is a surprisingly difficult task 
(Bruce et al., 1999;
Kemp et al., 1997)
. Average accuracy on standardised unfamiliar face matching tests is often between 60-80% 
(Burton et al., 2010;
Dowsett & Burton, 2015;
, including among professionals who perform the task regularly 
(White et al., 2014;
Wirth & Carbon, 2017
). Yet, individual differences in face matching ability mean that some observers achieve perfect accuracy while others struggle to exceed chance performance 
(Bobak et al., 2016;
Burton et al., 2010)
. Due to the importance of accurate identity verification for national security and law enforcement, there have been many attempts to improve the unfamiliar face matching abilities of individuals through various training programs; however, these programs have often been unsuccessful 
(Towler et al., 2019;
Towler et al., 2014)
, or have led to only modest improvements 
(Carragher et al., 2022;
Towler, Keshwa, et al., 2021)
.
While the benefits of training have been limited , one line of research that has consistently improved face matching performance involves combined decision-making. 
Dowsett and Burton (2015)
 first reported that participants achieved higher accuracy when completing a face matching task as a collaborative social pair than they did completing the same task alone. Although the authors hypothesised that this improvement came from discussions held between the paired participants, 
Jeckeln et al. (2018)
 showed that similar sized performance improvements occurred regardless of whether participants operated in real social pairs or non-social pairs, in which judgments from two non-interacting individuals were combined statistically. This "pairs advantage" is not limited to human-human interactions, since "fusing" decisions from humans and facial recognition algorithms can also lead to better performance than either achieves alone 
(O'Toole et al., 2007;
Phillips et al., 2018)
.
The pairs training effect 
(Dowsett & Burton, 2015;
Jeckeln et al., 2018;
Ritchie et al., 2022)
 is conceptually similar to the Wisdom of the Crowd Effect (WoCE), whereby averaging the independent responses of many individuals tends to produce an overall judgement that is more accurate than that of most individuals in the crowd 
(Galton, 1907)
.
Since 
Galton (1907)
 first demonstrated the effect in a weight estimation task, the WoCE has been found in many domains 
(Davis-Stober et al., 2014;
Herzog & Hertwig, 2014;
Larrick et al., 2012;
Surowiecki, 2005)
, including identity verification 
(Balsdon et al., 2018;
Davis et al., 2019;
White et al., 2013;
White et al., 2015)
. 
White and colleagues (2013)
 first demonstrated the benefit of the WoCE for unfamiliar face matching, showing that aggregating the identification decisions of 20 individuals led to accuracy increases of approximately 20% when compared to their average performance as individuals. Crucially, this performance increase far exceeds the improvements achieved by training individuals to become better at the task 
(Towler et al., 2019;
, suggesting that the WoCE is a promising route to improving unfamiliar face matching performance 
(Balsdon et al., 2018;
Davis et al., 2019;
White et al., 2015)
.
Although unfamiliar face matching is challenging under ideal conditions (e.g., 
Burton et al., 2010)
, the task is even harder when one or both faces are obstructed. For example, the medical face masks many people now wear in public over their nose, mouth, and chin (YouGov, 2020) impair accuracy in both face recognition 
(Freud et al., 2020;
Thorley et al., 2022)
 and matching tasks 
Estudillo et al., 2021;
Noyes et al., 2021)
. The decrease in matching accuracy can be substantial 
(Noyes et al., 2021)
, with  showing declines of 13-16% when one, or both, faces in the pair were wearing masks. With a rise in the number of individuals reportedly committing crimes while wearing face masks 
(Ward, 2020)
, developing methods to improve masked face matching performance will be vital in law enforcement and security contexts. Although a brief training course 
(Towler, Keshwa, et al., 2021)
 has been shown to improve masked face matching accuracy by 4.9% 
(Carragher et al., 2022)
, this improvement would not ameliorate the entire impairment caused by face masks . Across two experiments, we investigate whether the WoCE 
(Galton, 1907;
Jeckeln et al., 2018;
White et al., 2013)
 can be leveraged to improve accuracy when matching unfamiliar masked faces.


Experiment 1
We begin by reanalysing data from , to examine whether we can replicate the WoCE in an unfamiliar face matching task 
(Jeckeln et al., 2018;
White et al., 2013)
, and to investigate whether such an effect persists for masked faces. We predicted that while the WoCE would improve face matching performance for both masked and unmasked faces, the effect would be smaller for masked faces -consistent with previous research suggesting that the WoCE is smaller in harder tasks (see 
White et al., 2013)
.


Method


Procedure
We summarise the method of Carragher and Hancock (2020) relevant to the current study here. All participants completed the short version of the Glasgow Face Matching Test (GFMT: 
Burton et al., 2010)
, which consists of 40 pairs of unfamiliar faces (20 identity matches, 20 mismatches). Participants were randomly allocated to one of three mask conditions for the duration of the experiment (control, mixed, masked). Participants in the "control" condition completed the original GFMT (i.e., both faces were unmasked). For participants in the "mixed" condition, the lower half of one face in each pair was covered by a surgical face mask that was superimposed over the original image using photo-editing software. In the "masked" condition, both faces in each pair were shown wearing masks.
Participants responded whether the faces showed the "same" or "different" people, with the image pair remaining onscreen until response.


Ethics
Experiment 1 is a re-analysis of data from . All participants had given their informed consent prior to data collection, including for their data to be used in future research. This research was approved by the General University Ethics Panel at the University of Stirling, conforming to the standards of the British Psychological Society.


Participants
Carragher and Hancock's (2020) participants lived in the UK and were recruited through the research participation website Prolific (https://www.prolific.co/). The final sample consisted of 138 participants: 53 in the control condition (Mage = 31.6, SD = 8.7), 43 in the mixed condition (Mage = 33.2, SD = 11.7), and 42 in the masked condition (Mage = 30.0, SD = 8.9).


Current Analysis
Whole Crowd. To investigate the conventional WoCE, we computed the majority decision of all participants in a mask condition for each face pair. Pairs answered correctly by the majority of individuals were coded as being correctly resolved by the whole crowd.
Crowd Size. To examine how the WoCE develops with crowd size, we generated 500 crowds from random combinations of participants for each crowd size between 2 and 40 members (inclusive). Every crowd created was unique. As above, trials where the average accuracy of the constituent crowd members was above 50% were classified as being correctly resolved by the crowd. When the average accuracy of even-numbered crowds was exactly 50% (3.43% of all crowd trials), we programmed a coin-flip to randomly decide whether the trial would resolve correctly (49.87%) or incorrectly (50.13%). Below, we report the average performance of the 500 crowds for each crowd size.
Measures. We only report our analysis of overall accuracy in the main text. Further analysis using signal detection measures of Area Under the Curve (AUC) and sensitivity 
d¢
is available in the supplementary materials . The results of these analysis are highly consistent with those reported for overall accuracy, and the conclusions presented here remain unchanged. We do, however, report criterion in the main text as a descriptive measure of response bias . Positive criterion values indicate a conservative bias toward responding "different", whereas negative criterion signals a liberal response bias of responding "same".


Results


The Wisdom of the Whole Crowd
One sample t-tests revealed that the decisions of the whole crowd were more accurate than the average performance of the individuals in each mask condition, with very large effect sizes (see 
Table 1
). Thus, the WoCE can improve masked face matching performance.
To directly compare the WoCE between mask conditions, we calculated the percentage change from each individual's performance to that of the Wisdom of the Whole Crowd [((WoWC -Individual Performance)/Individual Performance)*100]. An ANOVA revealed that the WoWC did not differ between the three mask conditions, F(2, 135) = 0.41, p = .668, ηp 2 = .01.


Table 1
One sample t-tests comparing overall accuracy [mean (SD)] for average individual performance in each mask condition (control, mixed, masked) to the level of performance achieved by the whole "crowd", in Experiments ("Expt.") 1 and 2. As "crowd" is a single measurement, there is no variance to report. The 95%CI surround the mean difference between Individual and Crowd conditions.  


Crowd Size
We conducted a series of independent samples t-tests to investigate whether doubling crowd size (1 vs 2 up to 16 vs 32) continually increased performance 
(White et al., 2013
).
The Bonferroni corrected significance level for the five paired comparisons in each mask condition is p < .010. The full inferential statistics for these comparisons are reported in the supplementary materials (see 
Table S1
).
An identical pattern of results was observed in each mask condition. The difference between average individual performance (crowd size 1) and crowd size 2 was not significant 1 . Accuracy increased significantly from crowd size 2 to 4, as it did with each subsequent doubling of crowd size, with all p's < .001. Finally, three one sample t-tests confirmed that the whole crowd in each mask condition (see 
Table 1
) outperformed crowds of 32 -albeit with smaller effect sizes, as most of the improvement had already occurred. 


Characterising Crowd Performance
Offsetting the Mask Impairment. Compared to the control condition, average individual accuracy was 16% lower in the mixed condition, and 13% lower in the masked condition. A crowd required 17 members to overcome this deficit in the mixed condition, while the masked condition did so with 7 crowd members (see 
Figure 1a
). 
Figure 1c
 suggests that adding members to small crowds leads to rapid performance gains, which plateau as the crowd becomes larger 
(White et al., 2013)
. To determine the crowd size at which the majority of the WoWC had already been realised, we calculated the cumulative performance gain at each crowd size as a percentage of the gain in overall accuracy made by the whole crowd (see 
Table 1
). More than 50% of the eventual WoWC in the control condition had already occurred by crowd size 4, while the mixed and masked conditions both passed the same threshold with a crowd of 5


Diminishing Returns. Visual inspection of
(see 
Figure 1c
). Thus, even though performance continued to improve up until crowds exceeded 40 members, most of the eventual increase had already occurred by crowd size 5.


Criterion.
The control condition initially showed a slight bias toward responding "same", which quickly disappeared as they achieved ceiling performance (see 
Figure 1e
). In contrast, individuals in the mixed and masked conditions initially showed a bias to respond "different", which increased with crowd size.


Discussion
The WoCE can improve masked face matching performance, such that the impairment caused by masks can be eliminated entirely. In contrast to our predictions, the size of the WoCE did not differ between mask conditions. However, the improvement possible for the control condition was limited by ceiling performance, complicating our interpretation of this hypothesis. A second limitation to these results is that participants made binary "same" or "different" identification decisions. Consequently, even-numbered crowds often produced a split decision (accuracy of exactly 50%), which we resolved by coin-flip.
This resolution strategy prevented even-numbered crowds from improving on the performance of the preceding odd-numbered crowd. We address both limitations in Experiment 2.


Experiment 2
We sought to replicate the results of Experiment 1 in a pre-registered experiment, using a harder face matching task  to reduce ceiling effects, and a six-point response scale to reduce instances of split decisions in even-numbered crowds. Our hypotheses were unchanged.


Method Participants
We received consent from 164 individuals recruited via Prolific who reported living in the USA. Following our pre-registered exclusion criteria, all data were removed from individuals who did not finish the task (n = 4), attempted the task more than once (n = 1), or who failed the attention check (n = 1). We deviated from our pre-registered criteria by excluding data from participants with an AUC value £ 0.45 (n = 2), rather than AUC £ 0. All participants gave informed consent prior to data collection. On average, the experiment took 6.5 minutes to complete (SD = 3.8), and participants were reimbursed £0.90 (approx. $1.11USD) for their time.


Design


Face Matching Task. Participants completed the short version of the Kent Face
Matching Test (KFMT) which consists of 40 trials, including 20 identity matches . The standardised individual accuracy data reported by  suggest that the KFMT (66%) is harder than the GFMT (81%) used in Experiment 1 
(Burton et al., 2010)
.
Face Masks. Unlike the surgical masks that were superimposed over the stimuli in Experiment 1, we used custom written code 
(Anwar & Raychowdhury, 2020)
 to fit a plain blue colour patch over the faces (see 
Figure 2
). These plain colour patches covered the same facial features as a worn mask but achieved a personalised fit to each face image (see also 
Carragher et al., 2022)
. The mask was always fitted to the larger image in each KFMT pair . 
Figure 2
. A pair of faces that is representative of a match trial in the "mixed" mask condition of Experiment 2. The individual shown here has consented to the publication of these images, which were not used in the experiment.
Mask Conditions. Only the "control" and "mixed" mask conditions were retained for the current experiment. We omitted the "masked" condition (both faces wearing masks), since this situation might be less likely to arise in applied contexts, whereas the mixed condition represents a scenario of trying to match a masked person to their mask-free photo ID document (or alternatively, matching an unmasked individual to a masked face captured on CCTV). Compared to control, the mixed condition also resulted in a larger performance impairment than the masked condition .


Procedure
The trial procedure remained the same; with the single exception being that participants gave a 6AFC response to each trial 
(Carragher et al., 2022)
, which conveyed their identification decision ("same", "different") and level of confidence ("definitely", "probably", "guess").


Analysis
The 6AFC responses were recoded as numerical values, with 1-3 corresponding to "different" (definitely, probably, guess), and 4-6 corresponding to "same" (guess, probably, definitely). The original 1-6 response values allowed us to analyse these data using AUC as the dependant variable (see supplementary materials). To calculate overall accuracy, a correct response was deemed to occur when the final averaged decision value for a trial pair was the appropriate side of 3.5.
As in Experiment 1, we calculated the performance of the whole crowd by averaging across all individual responses to each trial. We then calculated the performance of the whole crowd as we did for each individual participant. To investigate the effect of crowd size, we followed the procedure outlined in Experiment 1 to create 500 random crowds for each crowd size between 2 and 70 (inclusive).
Split Decisions. The 6AFC response scale reduced the frequency of split decisions in even-numbered groups (1.04% of all crowd trials). A programmed coin-flip decided whether crowd decisions of exactly 3.5 would receive a "same" (50.18%) or "different" response (49.82%).


Results


Wisdom of the Whole Crowd
One sample t-tests showed that decisions made by the whole crowd were significantly more accurate than average individual performance in each mask condition (see 
Table 1
). The size of the WoCE did not differ between the control (M = 16.86%, SD = 18.10) and mixed conditions (M = 13.88%, SD = 17.54), t(154) = 1.04, 95%CI 
[-2.66, 8.62]
, p = .298, d = 0.17.
Both findings replicate the results of Experiment 1.


Crowd Size
Like Experiment 1, we conducted a series of sequential independent samples t-tests to investigate how the WoCE develops as crowd size doubles (1 vs 2 up to 32 vs 64). The Bonferroni corrected significance level for the six comparisons in each mask condition is p < .008. The full inferential statistics are reported in the supplementary materials (see 
Table S4
).
For both conditions, overall accuracy did not improve significantly in crowds of 2 (but did for the control condition when measuring AUC, see supplementary materials). In the control condition, accuracy improved with each doubling of crowd size from 2-4 through 16-32. Changes beyond crowd size 32 were non-significant. The pattern of improvement was less consistent in the mixed condition. Accuracy improved as crowd size doubled from 2-4, 4-8, and 16-32, but not between crowds 8-16 or 32-64. There was, however, a very slight improvement from the crowds of 64 to the entire crowd of 80.


Characterising Performance
Offsetting the Mask Impairment. Average individual accuracy in the mixed condition (M = 58.41%) represented an 11.0% decrease in performance compared to the control condition (M = 65.63%). Unlike Experiment 1, the WoCE did not entirely offset this deficit at any level of crowd size, with the highest average accuracy of 65.04% achieved by crowds of 39 (see 
Figure 1b)
. Although this level of accuracy does not surpass that achieved by individuals for unmasked faces, it would result in the same number of KFMT trials being resolved correctly (26/40). As noted in the supplementary materials, the mixed condition overcomes the mask impairment at crowd size 11 when performance is measured by AUC.
Diminishing Returns. The control condition achieved 50% of WoCE for total crowd performance (n = 76) at crowd size 5, while the mixed condition (n = 80) achieved this level at crowd size 6 (see 
Figure 1d
).
Criterion. Individuals in both conditions initially showed a bias to respond "different", which increased with crowd size (see 
Figure 1f
).


Discussion
These results replicate those of Experiment 1. The WoCE led to large increases in face matching performance for both conditions. Despite avoiding a ceiling effect in the control condition, the size of the WoCE did not differ between the control and mixed conditions. While we created a crowd of 80 members, most of this eventual WoCE for the mixed condition had already occurred in crowds of 6, while 90% of the eventual improvement was present in crowds of 23. These data are consistent with 
White et al. (2013)
 who reported that performance improvements were minor once crowds exceeded 10 observers. Our data support this conclusion, suggesting that there may be little benefit to creating such large crowds in the context of face matching tasks.
Curiously, 
Figure 1d
 shows that the WoCE peaks around crowd sizes 40-50 and then drops slightly as crowd size continues to increase. While our investigation of this finding goes beyond the scope of this paper, our preliminary simulations show that this pattern is related to the 6AFC confidence response scale. When averaging three decisions, one confidently correct response (e.g., responding "definitely same" on a match trial = 6) outweighs two incorrect responses with low confidence ("guess different" = 3). However, most responses are relatively low confidence, meaning the average response of the whole crowd for face pairs often sits near the decision threshold of 3.5. Creating mid-sized crowds (40-50) requires that just over half the participants are sampled. Because our data include more confidently correct responses than confidently incorrect responses (19.9% vs 8.7%), there are more 'lucky' crowds in this mid-range, which contain enough confidently correct responses to pull the crowd's average response to the correct side of threshold. However, creating larger crowds requires most, and eventually all, participants to be sampled, including those who are confidently incorrect, resulting in the slight decrease in accuracy seen among larger crowds. Notably, no such decrease is seen when performance is measured by AUC, since AUC does not have a fixed decision threshold (see supplementary materials).


General Discussion
Face masks significantly impair our ability to both recognise 
(Freud et al., 2020;
Thorley et al., 2022)
 and match faces 
Noyes et al., 2021)
, creating a challenge for law enforcement to accurately identify masked offenders 
(Ward, 2020)
. Across two experiments, we have shown that the WoCE can substantially improve identification accuracy for unfamiliar masked faces in a one-to-one matching task. We believe this is the first method shown to entirely overcome the impairment masks cause to identification accuracy among human observers.
Previous research reported that a brief training course improved an individual's masked face matching accuracy by an average of 4.9% 
(Carragher et al., 2022)
, which is consistent with the improvement seen among the more successful approaches to training face matching ability 
(Towler et al., 2019;
Towler, Keshwa, et al., 2021)
. However, since this training course instructed participants to compare the ears and any facial markings (e.g., moles or scars) on the faces 
(Towler, Keshwa, et al., 2021)
, it would not benefit every face pair. Moreover, the reported improvement in performance would not offset the entire impairment caused by the face masks . Among the equivalent "mixed" mask condition in Experiment 1, we found the WoCE had already increased accuracy by 8.0% in crowds of 3, before eventually increasing accuracy by 22.8% among the whole crowd of 43. Even on the harder KFMT in Experiment 2, overall accuracy among the "mixed" condition had already increased by 4.9% in crowds of 5, and 11.3% in the whole crowd of 80. Compared to training individuals to become better at face matching, our data suggest that simply fusing the identification decisions of independent observers to produce the WoCE is a highly effective approach to improving masked face matching performance.
Based on 
White et al.'s (2013)
 observation that the WoCE was smaller for harder face matching tasks, we predicted that the WoCE would be smaller in the mixed and masked conditions than the control condition. This prediction was not supported in either experiment.
Yet, the WoCE does appear to have been smaller in Experiment 2 than Experiment 1, which is consistent with the KFMT being harder than the GFMT .
Therefore, the WoCE may be smaller for harder tasks 
(White et al., 2013)
 in the control condition, in which case there can be no bias. However, where performance is sub-optimal, the bias of a crowd will reflect that of the individual group members. The criterion among individuals in the mixed and masked conditions is initially positive (a bias toward responding "different"). Creating random crowds from these individuals only increases this bias. The same pattern of results is evident in Experiment 2. Therefore, even though overall accuracy improves in these conditions, further analysis reveals that there is more improvement for mismatch pairs than match pairs (see supplementary materials).
Since 
Galton (1907)
 first demonstrated that the wisdom of the crowd could be used to accurately guess the weight of a butchered ox, the effect has been observed in many domains 
(Davis-Stober et al., 2014;
Larrick et al., 2012;
Surowiecki, 2005)
, including unfamiliar face matching 
(Balsdon et al., 2018;
Davis et al., 2019;
White et al., 2013)
. We have shown that the WoCE 
(Galton, 1907)
 can also be leveraged to improve accuracy when attempting to match unfamiliar faces that are wearing masks. Our findings offer a promising solution to the challenging problem of masked face identification by humans. 


Overall Accuracy
Here we report the full inferential statistics for the independent samples t-tests that examine the effect of doubling crowd size on overall accuracy. Shown in 
Table S1
, we have reported Welch t-tests whenever the assumption of equal variance was violated.


Table S1
Independent samples t-tests comparing overall accuracy between crowds of doubling size in Experiment 1. The final comparison ("… vs all") reports a one sample t-test comparing the performance of crowds of 32 against the accuracy achieved by the whole crowd in that mask condition (see 
Table 1
). 


Sensitivity
Below we report a complete analysis of sensitivity (d´), a measure from Signal Detection Theory 
(Green & Swets, 1966)
, which shows how well participants can distinguish true match trials from mismatch trials . With an adjustment for extreme values , the maximum value of d´ in the short GFMT is 3.92, while chance performance is shown by d´ = 0. Our analysis of sensitivity follows the same structure as that for overall accuracy in the main text.


The Wisdom of the Whole Crowd
The sensitivity of the whole crowd was significantly greater than that of the average individual in each mask condition, with very large effect sizes (see 
Table S2
). An ANOVA revealed that the WoWC did not differ between the three mask conditions, F(2, 135) = 0.57, p = .565, ηp 2 = .01.


Table S2
One sample t-tests comparing the mean (SD) of sensitivity for the average performance of each mask condition (control, mixed, masked) to the level of performance achieved by the whole "crowd". Crowd is a single measurement and has no SD. The 95%CI surround the mean difference between Individual and Crowd conditions. 


Crowd Size
We conducted a series of sequential independent samples t-tests to investigate how the WoCE developed as crowd size doubled (1 vs 2 up to 16 vs 32). We adopted a Bonferroni corrected significance threshold of p < .010 when interpreting these results. The same pattern of the results was observed in each mask condition. The difference between average individual performance (crowd size 1) and crowd size 2 was not significant (see 
Figure S1
).
The difference between crowd sizes 2 and 4 was significant, as was each subsequent comparison (4 vs 8, 8 vs 16, 16 vs 32). Three one sample t-tests confirmed that the sensitivity continued to improve from crowd size 32 until the final crowd was formed (see 
Table S3
). 
Figure S1
. The average sensitivity (d´) achieved by each level of crowd size in Experiment 1, plotted separately for each masked condition 
(control, mixed, masked)
. The shaded area shows 1SD around the mean.


Table S3
Independent samples t-tests comparing sensitivity between crowds of doubling size in Experiment 1. The final comparison ("… vs all") reports a one sample t-test comparing the performance of crowds of 32 against the sensitivity achieved by the whole crowd in that mask condition (see 
Table S2
). 


Characterising Crowd Performance
Offsetting the Mask Impairment. Average individual performance in the mixed condition represents a 47% decrease in sensitivity compared to individual performance in the control condition, while the masked condition experienced a 39% decrease. The mixed condition eliminated this deficit at crowd size 32, while the masked condition did so with crowds of 7 people (see 
Figure S1
).
Diminishing Returns. More than 50% of the total crowd gain in sensitivity (n = 53) in the control condition had already occurred by crowd size 5, while the mixed (n = 43) and masked (n = 42) conditions both passed the same threshold with a crowd of 7 (see 
Figure S1
).


Additional Analysis
For brevity, we have chosen to present the data for match trial accuracy and mismatch trial accuracy only in figures that are accompanied by descriptive statistics. A full analysis of these measures is possible using the data files in our OSF repository.


Match Trial Accuracy
The control condition reached 100% accuracy on identity match trials through the WoCE, from an individual average of 83.4% -an increase of 19.9% (see 
Figure S2
). The  


Mismatch Trial Accuracy
The WoCE for the control condition reached 100% accuracy for mismatch trials, a 22.8% increase from the average individual accuracy of 81.4% (see 
Figure S3
). For the mixed condition, the WoCE reached 95% accuracy, increasing 26.9% from the average individual accuracy of 74.9%. Finally, the masked condition achieved an accuracy of 100% on mismatch trials via the WoCE, representing an increase of 27.3% from the average individual performance of 78.6%. 
Figure S3
. Average accuracy on identity mismatch trials at each level of crowd size in Experiment 1, plotted separately for the control, mixed and masked conditions. The shaded error bars show 1 standard deviation around the mean.


Discussion
Consistent with our interpretation of criterion in the main text 
(Figure 1e
), the mixed and masked conditions experienced greater increases in performance due to the WoCE for mismatch trials compared to match trials. We can see from 
Figures S2 and S3
 that despite the larger increases in mismatch trial accuracy among the mixed and masked conditions, the pattern of improvement in all three mask conditions is very similar to that reported for overall accuracy in the main text. That is, rapid improvements are made as individuals are added to small crowds, which dimmish as the crowd becomes larger.


Experiment 2
Deviation from pre-registered exclusion criteria
Our pre-registration stated that we would exclude participants with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) £ 0.48 (where 0.50 is equivalent to chance). However, we revised this exclusion criteria because the tail end of performance distribution in the mixed condition fell beyond this threshold (8 participants in the mixed condition recorded an AUC between 0.48 and 0.45). Since our intention was to use this criterion to exclude data from participants that might not have understood the task, rather than those who found the task difficult, the original criterion was not fit for purpose. Excluding these participants would artificially inflate the average performance of the mixed condition -ultimately reducing the performance impairment caused by masks, which is known to be substantial . A secondary data file with crowds created from individuals who met our original exclusion criteria is available in the OSF repository for transparency. As reported in the main text, we excluded data from participants with an AUC £ 0.45, which affected one participant in the control condition, and one participant in the mixed condition.


Overall Accuracy
Here we report the full inferential statistics for the independent samples t-tests in the main text that examine the effect of doubling crowd size on overall accuracy. Shown in 
Table   S4
, we have reported Welch t-tests whenever the assumption of equal variance was violated.

One sample t-tests comparing the mean (SD) individual AUC in each mask condition (control, mixed) to the level of performance achieved by the whole "crowd". Crowd is a single measurement and has no SD. The 95%CI surround the mean difference between Individual and Crowd conditions. 
Figure S4
. The average AUC achieved by each level of crowd size in Experiment 2, plotted separately for the control and mixed conditions. The shaded area shows 1SD around the mean.


Characterising Crowd Performance
Offsetting the Mask Impairment. Individual performance in the mixed condition represents a 12.8% decrease in AUC compared to individual performance in the control condition (see 
Figure S4
). Crowds of 11 were required for the mixed condition to achieve an AUC equivalent to that of the average individual in the control condition.
Diminishing Returns. The control condition achieved 50% of the eventual improvement in AUC by the entire crowd (n = 76) at crowd size 5, while the mixed condition (n = 80) crossed this threshold at crowd size 6 (see 
Figure S4
).


Match Trial Accuracy
The pattern of results for match trial accuracy in both conditions differs markedly from those in Experiment 1 (see 
Figure S5
). Here the average accuracy of the control condition begins at 60.8% (consistent with the original KFMT: , and ends at 60% in a crowd of 76 participants. Even more striking are the results for the mixed condition, where average individual accuracy begins at 54.9% and steadily decreases until reaching 45% among a crowd of 80 -a decrease of 18.1%. 
Figure S5
. Average accuracy on identity match trials at each level of crowd size in Experiment 2, plotted separately for the control and mixed conditions. The shaded error bars show 1 standard deviation around the mean.


Mismatch Trial Accuracy
The control condition achieved an accuracy of 90% for the entire crowd, which is an increase of 27.7% from the average of individual performance at 70.5% (see 
Figure S6)
.
Similarly, the mixed condition achieved an accuracy of 85% via the WoCE, which is an increase of 37.4% from the average individual performance of 61.9%. 
Figure S6
. Average accuracy on identity mismatch trials at each level of crowd size in Experiment 2, plotted separately for the control and mixed conditions. The shaded error bars show 1 standard deviation around the mean.


Discussion
Despite the change in overall accuracy (see main text) resembling that of Experiment 1, a separate examination of accuracy for match and mismatch trials reveals a different story.
Crowds in both conditions made significant gains in mismatch trial accuracy, as a result of the individual tendency to respond "different" across trials, which was exaggerated in crowds (see 
Figure 1f
). Conversely, there was no change in accuracy for match trials among the control condition, and a surprising decrease in accuracy for the mixed condition. These results further speak to the notion that the wisdom of the crowd is not a guaranteed route to achieve ceiling performance. Rather, the benefit of the effect appears to be dependent on the characteristics of the individual responses collected.

48 as initially intended (see supplementary materials). The final sample consisted of 76 participants in the control condition (Mage = 32.4, SD = 12.5) and 80 in the mixed condition (Mage = 34.2, SD = 13.6). Ethics This experiment received ethical approval from the Human Research Ethics Subcommittee in the School of Psychology at the University of Adelaide and conformed to the standards of the Australian National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research.


mixed condition reached 75% accuracy as an entire crowd, improving from individual accuracy of 63.6%, representing an increase of 17.9%. Finally, the WoCE in the masked condition reached 80% accuracy from an individual average of 64.8%, an increase of 23.5%.

, but it is possible that the initial differences between mask conditions are not large enough for this effect to emerge. Although the size of the WoCE did not differ between mask conditions, Figures 1c and 1d show that the control condition crowds often required fewer members to reach certain WoCE performance benchmarks compared to the mixed or masked conditions, hinting that there may be differences in the efficiency of crowds between mask conditions.While our data show that the WoCE is an effective route to improving masked face matching performance, we would caution readers against using these data to create definitive guidelines for implementing the WoCE in applied contexts. For example, the exact crowd size needed to offset the mask impairment varies between measures (see supplementary materials), and between tasks (GFMT, KFMT). But the consistent patterns across both experiments speak to three general conclusions we can draw regarding leveraging the WoCE for face matching tasks. First, the WoCE can be substantial even in tasks with relatively poor, but above chance, average individual performance. Second, although performance generally increases with crowd size, 90% of the improvement seen among very large crowds had occurred among crowds of 23 or fewer in every condition tested. Thus, it might not be necessary to recruit such large crowds in applied settings. Finally, the WoCE is not a guaranteed route to perfect performance, since the whole control condition crowd only achieved accuracy of 75% in Experiment 2. Therefore, the decisions of a crowd should not be
considered absolute truth.
A less intuitive observation from our data is that averaging decisions for a crowd does
not necessarily moderate the response biases present among individuals; rather, biases can
actually become exaggerated in crowds. In Experiment 1, crowd performance reaches 100%


Indeed, it is not possible for a crowd of 2 to improve on the performance of the constituent individuals when making binary identification decisions. We address this limitation in Experiment 2.








Table S4
Independent samples t-tests comparing overall accuracy between crowds of doubling size in Experiment 2. The final comparison ("… vs all") reports a one sample t-test comparing the performance of crowds of 64 against the accuracy achieved by the whole crowd in that mask condition (see 
Table 1
).

Area Under the Curve (AUC) Analysis
The 6AFC responses made in Experiment 2 allowed us to calculate a Receiver Operator Curve for each crowd, which gives rise to the performance measure of AUC. AUC is an alternative measure of sensitivity, which compares the number of correct and false matches as the threshold is lowered . Since AUC does not have a fixed threshold, it does not require split decisions to be resolved. Perfect performance corresponds to an AUC = 1.0, whereas chance performance is given by AUC = 0.5.


The Wisdom of the Whole Crowd
One sample t-tests showed that the AUC achieved by the whole crowd significantly exceeded that of the average individual in each mask condition (see 
Figure S4)
, with very large effect sizes (see 
Table S5
). As was the case for overall accuracy in the main text, the 


Crowd Size
Like Experiment 1, we conducted a series of independent samples t-tests to test the effect of doubling crowd size on AUC (1 vs 2 up to 32 vs 64). Among the control condition, doubling crowd size led to a significant increase in AUC in every comparison made (see 
Table S6
). AUC also increased from crowd size 64 to 76. Among the mixed condition, AUC did not increase from crowd size 1 to 2, but then increased significantly at each doubling of crowd size until 64. However, the change in AUC from crowd size 64 to 80 was not significant.


Table S6
Independent samples t-tests comparing AUC between crowds of doubling size in Experiment 2. The final comparison ("… vs all") reports a one sample t-test comparing the performance of crowds of 64 against the AUC achieved by the whole crowd in that mask condition (see 
Table S5
