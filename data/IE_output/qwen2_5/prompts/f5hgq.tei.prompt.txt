You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

 In a world facing profound challenges including rising intergenerational inequalities, employment insecurity, humanitarian crises and climate change 
(Broadbent et al., 2023;
Lawrence, 2024;
McGorry et al., 2024;
Ni et al., 2023;
Susteren et al., 2020)
, there is a growing need to expand therapeutic approaches beyond the traditional boundaries of psychology and psychiatry. Widespread societal issues impact mental health at both individual and societal levels 
(Green et al., 2023;
Hickman et al., 2021;
Marmot, 2015;
Wilkinson & Pickett, 2010)
, and call for approaches that address wellbeing in more holistic ways, including a focus on self, others and nature (e.g., 
Kemp & Edwards, 2022;
Lomas et al., 2024)
. Martial arts scholarship has framed the martial arts through the Foucauldian notion of "the care of the self" 
(Foucault, 2000
(Foucault, , 2005
, a philosophy and attitude toward self, others and the world that supports the development of happiness, purity, wisdom and perfection 
(Pedrini & Jennings, 2021)
. Similarly, developments in the discipline of psychology 
(Johnstone et al., 2018;
Kemp & Edwards, 2022;
Kern et al., 2020;
Lomas et al., 2020;
Isham et al., 2023)
 have begun to reframe the nature of psychological distress and illness through groups and systems in which individuals live, asking the question: 'what has happened to you?' and 'what are your strengths?', rather than 'what is wrong with you?'. In this paper we suggest that Wing Chun -a martial art now practised worldwide -might offer a valuable complement to conventional approaches to support holistic wellbeing that is aligned with such a vision.
Wing Chun developed in Southern China in the early 1700s by Ng Mui, a Shaolin Kung Fu practitioner and Buddhist nun. Influenced by her Buddhist practice, Wing Chun's principles draw on self-discipline, mindfulness, and adaptability, while its techniques are inspired by nature and the philosophical framework of Yin and Yang. In Wing Chun, the crane symbolises Yin qualities such as grace, receptivity, and adaptability, while the snake embodies Yang, including focus, speed, and assertiveness 
(Rawcliffe, 2003;
Xuan & Little, 2019)
. This harmony of passive and active forces reflects both Taoist and Buddhist influences, blending Wu Wei (effortless action) with the practice of mindfulness and non-attachment to cultivate resilience, presence, and balance, and is a key component of modern psychological conceptualisations of wellbeing 
Lomas et al., 2024;
Wong, 2019)
. Martial arts training provides a framework for cultivating the ethical values of Buddhist teachings, such as those of the Noble Eightfold Path 
(Priest, 2013;
Sri Dhammananda, 1987)
 underpinned by a focus on wisdom (Paññā), ethical conduct (Sīla) and mental discipline (Samādhi) including right intention, right action and right effort. As a martial art pioneered by a woman, Wing Chun uniquely emphasises the importance of qualities traditionally associated with the feminine, highlighting the necessity of balancing softness with strength 
(Xuan & Little, 2019)
. By fostering this balance, Wing Chun provides tools for resilience and adaptability that may help individuals navigate today's complex social and ecological landscapes, including neoliberal societies 
(Becker, Hartwich & Haslam, 2021)
 and the unfolding climate crisis 
(Ripple et al., 2024)
. Accordingly, this paper explores how foundational principles of Wing Chun, viewed through a psychological lens, might inform contemporary practices for holistic wellbeing through what has been described as 'inner development' 
(Bristow et al., 2022;
Wamsler et al., 2021)
, focused on developing certain skills and qualities to help progress the sustainable development goals.
The potential psychological benefits of traditional martial arts, including Wing Chun, are increasingly evident, although its potential is typically restricted to a focus on the individual. Scholars have reflected on how the martial arts might promote positive emotions, engagement (or psychological flow), social relationships, meaning and the sense of accomplishment 
(PERMA, Seligman, 2011;
Croom, 2014)
, highlighting the opportunity to promote psychological wellbeing. Supporting this proposal, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis on martial arts reported small to medium positive effects for mental health (d = 0.620, 95% CI = 0.006 to 1.23, I2 = 84.84%) and wellbeing (d = 0.346, 95% CI = 0.106 to 0.585, I2 = 59.51%) 
(Moore, Dudley, & Woodcock, 2020)
. Traditional practices including Wing Chun place emphasis on mental focus, emotional control, and self-regulation, which may enhance cognitive abilities such as inhibitory control and executive function 
(Pujari, 2024)
. Research based on data from over 500 participants highlights the positive influence of martial arts on behaviour patterns related to lifestyle, health, and wellbeing 
(Fuller & Lloyd, 2019)
. A six-year ethnographic study has also revealed how Wing Chun can evolve from a secular practice into one imbued with sacralised meanings for its practitioners. This transformation is characterised by the development of a 'Wing Chun habitus', where the practice becomes deeply ingrained in the lives of the students. As Wing Chun becomes a significant part of their identity and daily routine, practitioners report a newfound sense of purpose, community, and personal growth 
(Jennings, Brown, & Sparkes, 2010)
. In this way, Wing Chun may influence wellbeing beyond individual self-development and psychological wellbeing, extending to one's relationships with others and nature, especially when viewing Wing Chun through a more systemic lens.
Towards this end, we present a theoretical model and framework to guide understanding of potential links between the core principles of Wing Chun and relevant psychological constructs with implications for inner development, providing a foundation for future research. Our paper introduces the acronym SPEED, encompassing Simplicity, Practicality, Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Directness, reflecting core Wing Chun principles (e.g., 
Fung, 1997;
Xuan & Little, 2019)
. These principles are explored through a psychological lens including a focus on Radical non-attachment, Embodied empowerment, skillful Adaptation, self-Control, and psychological Hardiness (REACH), inspired by the Power Threat Meaning Framework 
(Johnstone et al., 2018)
. We suggest that these constructs may be viewed as psychological resources that can be cultivated through Wing Chun practice to mitigate the impact of power dynamics and foster meaning-making processes, ultimately supporting mental health and wellbeing. While we recognise that the teaching of Wing Chun emphasises additional concepts, such as centreline theory (which involves controlling the central axis to dominate an opponent's position) and triangulation (strategic positioning to optimise defence and attack) 
(Rawcliffe, 2003)
, our emphasis on SPEED stems from its applicability to the psychological domain that have wider implications for promoting wellbeing through a systemic lens, focused on the self, others and nature, consistent with emerging theory in wellbeing and third-wave positive psychology (e.g., 
Kemp & Edwards, 2022;
Lomas, 2020
Lomas, , 2024
.
Pre-print for PsyArXiv Here we link the principle of directness to the cultivation of psychological hardiness, which involves commitment, control and confidence in the face of adversity. Through concise and purposeful actions, practitioners develop self-efficacy, resilience and the courage to engage with challenges, embodying the qualities of fierce compassion.

Rethinking the Wing Chun principle of simplicity through the lens of radical nonattachment "Our life is frittered away by detail… Simplify, simplify!" -Henry David Thoreau 
1854
Here we explore the Wing Chun principle of simplicity through the lens of 'radical non-attachment', a Buddhist-inspired concept that has influenced modern psychological approaches, including compassion-focused (e.g., 
Gilbert & Gordon, 2023)
 and acceptance and commitment (e.g., 
Ong et al., 2024)
 frameworks. Recent research suggests that non-attachment might mediate the effect of mindfulness and self-compassion on wellbeing 
(Xie, 2023;
Yu et al., 2024)
. We use the word 'radical' here to emphasise nonattachment in a martial context, where it signifies a profound 'letting go' of thoughts, emotions, and physical reactions to achieve clarity and precision in action. 'Nonattachment' is defined as a 'flexible, balanced way of relating to … experiences without clinging to or suppressing them' helping to release the individual from unhelpful mental fixations 
(Sahdra et al., 2016)
. In Wing Chun, simplicity involves the elimination of unnecessary movement and responses, focusing only on what is essential to achieve the desired outcome.
A key element of training, Chi Sau (or 'sticking hands'), exemplifies the principle of simplicity and facilitates the development of radical nonattachment. Chi Sau is a form of sensitivity training that develops concentration, bodily awareness, and responsiveness to a partner's movements 
(Xuan & Little, 2019)
. This practice helps practitioners learn how to embrace simplicity by fostering a quick and instinctive responsiveness. By training to respond directly to an opponent's movements, practitioners cultivate the ability to act without unnecessary mental deliberation. In this way, Chi Sau anchors the mind to the present moment and nurtures a state of mental clarity and calmness, reflecting the principle of radical non-attachment that emerges through practice.
Radical non-attachment addresses 'dukkha', the Buddhist notion of suffering arising from attachment to desires and aversions 
(Bodhi, 1999;
Sri Dhammananda, 1987)
, by a sense of presence and engagement without distraction from extraneous thoughts or emotions. Radical non-attachment supports the experience of equanimity (a state of mental calmness), considered to be a foundational element for psychological wellbeing 
(Desbordes et al., 2015)
. Other work describes simplicity as a virtue linked to happiness 
(Martin, 2012)
, suggesting that the cultivation of simplicity in Wing Chun may offer psychological benefits beyond its martial applications. These ideas position simplicity as both a principle and a pathway to radical non-attachment ultimately supporting psychological wellbeing.
A practical example of how simplicity and radical nonattachment manifest in Wing Chun can be demonstrated through responsiveness to an opponent grabbing the practitioner's clothing.
If someone grabs the chest with both hands in an aggressive manner, the instinctive reaction might be to focus on their hands and attempt to remove them, engaging in a physical struggle. Psychologically, this mirrors the tendency to grapple with challenging internal experiences and clinging to unpleasant thoughts or feelings. Wing Chun teaches an alternative: using free hands to address the broader situation rather than fixating on the immediate problem. While the opponent's hands remain fixed, they pose no immediate threat, allowing a simple and direct response rather than an overcomplicated struggle. This martial principle reflects the psychological concept of stepping back from the instinctive drive to suppress or control unpleasant experiences, which research suggests can lead to increased distress 
(Gross & John, 2003)
. Instead, Wing Chun's approach encourages a mindset shift away from fixed patterns of response, and toward 'skillful adaptation', which we discuss further below.
Research indicates that mindfulness reduces reactivity to negative thought patterns and emotions, mitigating distress and promoting wellbeing 
(Kalill et al., 2013)
. As Low 
2011
observes, "detaching ourselves and not getting caught with the great number of things in our mind, we slow down, pay attention to our breathing, move slowly and deeply, and we reach new understandings about ourselves and the world around us." Similarly, 
Burch (2012)
 highlights the interplay between mindfulness and simplicity as a "co-evolving dialectic" that fosters clarity and insight. Meta-analysis has also shown that mindfulness-based programmes enhance compassion, a finding associated with a moderate effect size 
(Golden et al., 2021)
. The link between mindfulness, non-attachment and simplicity is also supported by research on voluntary simplicity and minimalism, a low consumption lifestyle associated with mindfulness 
(Lloyd & Pennington, 2020)
 and better mental health 
(Hook et al., 2023;
Isham & Jackson, 2022)
.
A martial approach to non-attachment aligns with frameworks that aim to ease psychological suffering by changing one's relationship with distressing thoughts and emotions. For example, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) encourages acceptance of distressing thoughts rather than attempting to control or eliminate them, thereby reducing attachment to them and alleviating distress 
(Hayes et al., 2006)
. Similarly, compassion-focused therapy (CFT) focuses on cultivating acceptance, tolerance, and compassion to support the experience of psychological wellbeing (e.g., 
Gilbert, 2022)
. Mindfulness and compassion are aspects developed during training in traditional martial arts (e.g., 
Hackney, 2011
Hackney, , 2013
Clapton & Hiskey, 2020
) (as well as ACT and CFT) and have been shown to facilitate prosocial behaviours (e.g. 
Condon, 2017;
Hadenbrack et al., 2020)
. These and other skills and qualities such as self-awareness, authenticity, humility, perseverance and courage are now being applied in order to help progress the sustainable development goals through the lens of 'inner development' 
(Ankrah et al., 2023;
Bristow et al., 2022;
Wamsler, 2018;
Wamsler et al., 2021
; see also https://idg.tools/).
We propose that the practice of Wing Chun fosters the development of radical nonattachment, which not only supports individual wellbeing but lays foundations for a socially engaged mindfulness. Critically, radical non-attachment overlaps with the development of other psychological skills relevant to holistic wellbeing, including embodied empowerment, a topic to which we turn to next.


Rethinking the principle of effectiveness through the lens of embodied empowerment
"Where there is power, there is resistance"
-Michel 
Foucault (1978)
 The principle of effectiveness in Wing Chun, as described by 
Fung (1997)
, emphasizes the 'minimum use of brute strength', leveraging natural body mechanics and redirecting an opponent's force rather than opposing it directly. This approach requires practitioners to cultivate an 'embodied self-reflexivity' 
(Pagis, 2009)
, which refers to an attuned, reflexive interaction between physiological and emotional states, within and between individuals. Through enhanced proprioceptive awareness, practitioners develop a process of 'bodily listening,' which involves an instinctive perceiving of others' intentions without conscious thought 
(Telles, 2022)
. This heightened bodily awareness enables practitioners to sense and respond intuitively to dynamic interactions, fostering a practical understanding of cause and effect through physical sensation. Critically, this enhanced mind-body connection (extending beyond the individual) contributes to what has been described as 'embodied empowerment', which has been explored in the context of gender violence and trauma as an opportunity for collective healing (e.g., 
Brigden & Hlavka, 2025)
. Scholars have even referred to the martial arts as a 'carnal sociality' and -interpreted through a Foucauldian lens of biopower -an 'embodied resistance' to 'hegemonic neoliberal ideas of how the body and mind should be treated and connected' 
(Sugden, 2022)
. These ideas reinforce how the martial arts facilitate a sense of agency that extends beyond the individual to the collective, fostering psychological (and psychophysiological) safety and resistance to oppressive structures through embodied empowerment.
The cultivation of this embodied empowerment is supported by focused, diaphragmatic breathing that is introduced in the first of the Wing Chun hand forms, Siu Nim Tao. Basic hand movements are paired with controlled breathing techniques, which involves inhaling through the nose and exhaling from the diaphragm 
(Rawcliffe, 2003)
. This practice of diaphragmatic breathing activates the vagus nerve (the primary nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system), serving as a bridge between mind and body that regulates essential functions and moderating stress responses 
(Wells et al., 2012;
Gerritsen & Band, 2018)
. Enhanced vagal function is measured by increased heart rate variability (HRV), a psychophysiological marker of wellbeing that has been associated with emotional regulation, social connectedness, and psychological flexibility 
(Geisler et al., 2010;
Kok et al., 2010;
Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010;
Wilkie et al., 2022)
. HRV has been shown to support the capacity for a "radically embodied compassion" 
(Bello et al., 2020;
Clapton & Hiskey, 2020
, a quality that is rooted in bodily awareness and emotional resilience.
The mind-body connection is a central concept in both the social sciences and Wing Chun practice. Research has shown that bodily awareness (a quality that involves attention to and awareness of internal bodily sensations) and mindfulness are independently linked to higher levels of subjective wellbeing 
(Brani et al., 2013)
. While bodily awareness focuses on 'somatic qualia,' or the raw sensations of the body, mindfulness encompasses cognitive qualities such as kindness and compassion. This mind-body awareness is cultivated through the practice of Chi Sau, fostering what is known as "ting jin" or listening energy, which is considered to be an essential skill for internal development (or neigong) 
(Ma & Jennings, 2021)
. Through the fluidity of Chi Sau, practitioners learn to sense and respond to subtle changes in pressure and direction, developing precision and calm under pressure. This heightened sensitivity supports martial capacities and the development of a phenomenological spirituality that involves a rich connectedness to the self, others and the world 
(Telles, 2022)
.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists explored an imagery-based approach to support the development of embodied experience in relational conflict, given the restrictions placed on training partners during the pandemic 
(Hiskey & Clapton, 2021)
. This approach involves a focus on conflict resolution through compassion while imagining, embodying and enacting how one might respond to different conflict events. The authors point out that such interventions 'embody the ideals of peaceful living, mindful responding and applying only reasonable force when threatened'. This approach helps practitioners to mentally rehearse grounded, skillful responses to interpersonal challenges and Wing Chun's focus on structural integrity (e.g., through the basic stance known as "Yee Jee Kim Yeung Ma") provides an embodied reference point for such mental training from which different routines to imagined encounters may be trained. By combining the skills honed through, for example, the Mook Yan Jong (wooden dummy) form with imagery training (e.g., by practicing the 'dummy form' in the air), practitioners imagine scenarios around which they respond with SPEED (i.e., Simplicity, Practicality, Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Directness).
In Wing Chun an imaginary vertical line through the body guides practitioners to align their structure optimally for both defence and response, allowing them to manage and redirect forces with minimal effort. By focusing on the centreline, practitioners develop an intuitive sense of balance, positioning, and calm responsiveness under pressure, gradually internalising movements that become instinctive and efficient. Heightened bodily awareness fosters a deeper mind-body connection, supporting a "care of the self", a practice that underpins individual as well as collective and even, ecological wellbeing 
(Pedrini & Jennings, 2021)
. The French philosopher, Michel Foucault, broke away from his earlier writings on how social institutions produce 'docile bodies' in order to maintain the social order, and introduced the notion of self-care and 'how individuals shape and transform themselves in order to reach a given state of … happiness and wellbeing… ' 
(Pedrini & Jennings, 2021, p.3)
. Intriguingly, the authors go on to describe how self-care can evolve into new social movements that critique and resist neoliberal governmentality and new forms of 'bio-power'. The authors specifically refer to opportunities to cultivate wellbeing at different levels of scale from the individual level through to social and ecological scales. For instance, self-cultivation refers to the lifelong development of mind-body relationships; shared cultivation refers to the transmission of certain abilities and cultural values across generations and lineages, binding people together and differentiating social groups; social cultivation refers to the processes of human transformation and transcendence arising in local communities; and ecological cultivation refers to dispositions, practices, and conditions that may 'sow the seeds of environmental awareness'.
Social institutions regulate and manage human life at individual and population levels; this idea relates to the Foucauldian concept of 'biopower' 
(Pedrini & Jennings, 2021)
. The idea that martial arts provide an opportunity for resistance of biopower through embodied empowerment is a common theme in martial arts studies. For instance, Jones and Mattingly (2016) describe how training in empowerment-based self-defense may be an effective intervention for the prevention of violence while also promoting feelings of self efficacy and confidence, and protecting the student from symptoms of traumatic stress. Other work (e.g., 
Sugden, 2022)
 builds on this idea, arguing that the martial arts provide a context through which "neoliberal norms, labels and expectations are rejected in favour of a new connection with the body and each other." In this way, Wing Chun cultivates a grounded presence and clarity that enhances empathy, social awareness and empowerment. Intriguingly, the climate-informed psychotherapist, Staunton (2024) has argued that losing an embodied relationship with ourselves and the world "contributes to our failure to grasp the reality of the interlocking crises we face," underscoring the broader impact of mind-body practices like Wing Chun and opportunities for inner development through such practice. According to this framework, power refers to the various ways in which external forces shape experiences, emotions and behaviours. Examples might include embodied power (i.e., the power inscribed in and expressed through the body; e.g., coercive control might contribute to somatic symptoms such as feeling numb), legal power (i.e., the ways in which laws, legal systems and institutional policies shape people's lives; e.g., strict immigration policies can exacerbate psychological distress), economic power (i.e., the ways in which financial and material resources shape experience of distress and agency; e.g., job precarity can lead to chronic activation of the body's threat system), relational power (i.e., the way power operates within interpersonal relationships and shape how people interact; e.g., power imbalances at work can lead to feelings of stress and exclusion) and ideological power (i.e., the ability of dominant narratives, belief systems and cultural values to shape how people understand their experiences and the world around them; e.g., neoliberal ideology emphasise personal responsibility over collective wellbeing). Importantly, for the purposes of the current paper, the PTMF also encourages asking the question 'what are your strengths?' and 'what access to power resources do you have?'. Training in Wing Chun provides an opportunity to develop embodied empowerment, a central power resource, through new connections to self, others and the world.
We now turn our attention to the principle of practicality and explore this principle through the lens of skilful adaptation, highlighting how the practice of Wing Chun may further enhance inner development for positive change and transformation at multiple levels of scale.


Rethinking the principle of practicality through the lens of skilful adaptation
"Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. … Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."
-Bruce Lee (n.d.)
Pre-print for PsyArXiv
This section explores the principle of practicality in Wing Chun through the lens of skillful adaptation. Wing Chun's practical approach to self-defence emphasises realistic, adaptable responses using natural body mechanics and flexible techniques 
(Fung, 1997;
Rawcliffe, 2003)
. The ability to adapt in real time is a practical skill grounded in a dynamic, interdependent decision-making process and cultivated through traditional martial arts 
(Kimmel & Rogler, 2019)
. Skillful adaptation is supported by psychological flexibility, which refers to the capacity to fully engage with the present moment, including any mental states it evokes (i.e. thoughts and emotions), enabling individuals to adapt their behavior in agreement with one's goals and values 
(Doorley et al., 2020;
Hayes, 2005;
Pellerin et al., 2022)
. Psychological flexibility is a resource that supports skillful adaptation in the context of stress and coping 
(Hobfoll, 2002)
 and is a key component of emotional resilience 
(Bryan et al, 2015)
 that represents a form of embodied 'power' and strength 
(Johnstone & Boyle, 2018
, Cowden-Falletta et al, 2022
.
Drills, forms, and exercises (e.g., Chi Sau practice) develop heightened bodily awareness, sensitivity, and a capacity for moment-to-moment adaptation 
(Clapton & Hiskey, 2020
. Practitioners focus on the most direct and efficient path in both attack and defence known as the centreline plane 
(Xuan & Little, 2019)
. When an action is blocked, embodied self-regulation supports reflexive responses like fan sau ('returning hand') to seek alternative paths of least resistance 
(Knight, 2012;
Xuan & Little, 2019)
. Each action informs the next and involves constant adaptation to and negotiation with the opponent's shifting behaviour and evolving dynamics 
(Kimmel & Rogler, 2019)
. Rigid, scripted actions can neglect emergent dynamics and hinder adaptation, while skillful adaptation supports fluid and flexible responsiveness to dynamic scenarios 
(Kimmel and Rogler, 2019)
. Wing Chun practice enhances cognitive and psychological flexibility, as practitioners learn to navigate dynamic exchanges through mind-body connection, fostering self-awareness and non-attachment with thoughts and emotions 
(Pakenham et al., 2020;
Ramaci et al., 2019;
Xuan & Little, 2019;
Pujari, 2023)
. Skilful adaptation mirrors the mental processes of balancing demands, reallocating resources, and shifting perspectives 
(Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010)
. Research also indicates that martial arts improve cognitive flexibility 
(Harwood-Gross et al., 2021;
Pujari, 2024)
, linking martial practice to enhanced executive functions. Despite conceptual differences 
(Whiting et al., 2015)
, both cognitive and psychological flexibility involve responsive behaviour to environmental changes and rapid attention shifts 
(Whiting et al., 2015;
Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010)
, encouraging continual adjustment to the unfolding dynamics of each encounter.
This adaptiveness translates into a broader psychological resilience through what has been described as 'somatic metamorphism' 
(Foster, 2015)
, referring to the development of interpersonal skills that are then applied more generally to daily life. The benefits of psychological flexibility for wellbeing are well-established 
(Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010;
Pellerin et al., 2022)
. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, psychological flexibility correlated with positive traits like wisdom, optimism, hope, peaceful disengagement, and self-efficacy 
(Pellerin et al., 2022)
. Lower psychological flexibility, by contrast, was linked to heightened levels of depression, anxiety, and stress 
(Wasowicz et al., 2021)
. This inflexibility is a transdiagnostic feature of various psychological disorders 
(Levin et al., 2014)
 for which targeted interventions show positive outcomes and greater psychological flexibility 
(Rutschman et al., 2024)
. Process-based treatments for example, aim to foster adaptive traits rather than focusing on diagnosis-specific symptoms 
(Ciarrochi et al., 2022;
Hayes et al., 2020)
, building capacity to regulate the emotions, equipping individuals to handle challenging emotions 
(Doorley et al., 2020;
Gross, 2015)
 and promoting holistic wellbeing . The ability to reframe negative experiences fosters resilience, reducing negative emotions and enhancing positive responses to adversity 
(Troy et al., 2018)
. While reappraisal is often less effective for controllable stressors, where direct action may be more adaptive 
(Pinna & Edwards, 2020)
, reframing one's perception of difficulties as opportunities for growth enhances emotional regulation. Heart rate variability underpins psychological flexibility and is a key mechanism for promoting individual wellbeing. However, HRV has also been shown to support meaningful behavioural changes that enhance connectedness to self, others and nature 
(Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010;
Gordon et al., 2024;
Pinna & Edwards, 2020;
Wilkie et al., 2022)
.
Psychological flexibility and skillful adaptation are rooted in Yin/Yang philosophy, balancing complementary qualities of softness (Yin) and hardness (Yang) 
(Xuan & Little, 2019;
Williams, 2015)
. Softness supports practitioners to draw power from flexible strength rather than brute force, enabling skillful adaptation in response to the demands of moment-to-moment experience 
(Kimmel & Rogler, 2019)
. This Yin/Yang integration aligns with 
Neff's (2021)
 integration of fierce and tender compassion in which tender compassion (Yin) reflects empathy and adaptability, while fierce compassion (Yang) involves assertiveness and boundary-setting. Wing Chun fosters this balance between acceptance and a readiness to act, supported by psychological flexibility 
(Marshall & Brockman, 2016)
. Intriguingly, recent work has highlighted a key role for harmony and balance within and across people, ecosystems and time in the promotion of what has been described as 'sustainable wellbeing', 'ecological wellbeing' or 'planetary wellbeing', a multi-levelled and systems informed conceptualisation of wellbeing to which 'people and societies can and should aspire' 
(Antó et al., 2021;
Lomas, Pawelski, & VanderWeele, 2024)
. This aspirational, higher-leveled conceptualization of wellbeing is consistent with a radically alternative worldview, aligning with the sciences of evolution, ecology, and environment, as well as the philosophical thinking of Taoism 
(Miller, 2009)
.
As practitioners refine reflexive responses, they learn to engage in continuous adaptation, fostering both tender and fierce compassion. In this way, Wing Chun cultivates emotion regulation, psychological resilience and holistic wellbeing. In the next section, we will explore the principle of economy of movement, examining how Wing Chun's emphasis on efficiency and precision builds self-control, which can further support wellbeing at multiple levels of scale.
Rethinking the principle of economy of movement (efficiency) through the lens of self-control This section explores the principle of economy of movement in Wing Chun through the lens of self-control, where minimising unnecessary motion is both efficient and effective 
(Fung, 1997)
. In psychology, self-control has traditionally been used to refer to the conscious regulation of behaviours and emotions and has been viewed as a limited resource 
(Baumeister, 2003;
Baumeister et al, 2024)
. By contrast, Wing Chun's approach cultivates a subtler, nonconscious and reflexive form of control that is achieved through sensitivity and responsiveness, and developed through practices such as Chi Sau 
(Battaglia, 2013;
Meridien Kung Fu, 2013)
, which is then translated beyond martial contexts through somatic metaphorism 
(Foster, 2015)
. Wing Chun's emphasis on a nonconscious and reflexive form of self-control supports energy conservation and efficiency, offering an alternative to traditional models.
Self-control and the related construct of self-regulation are personal strengths and resources that can be developed through Wing Chun, and that research shows are essential for self discipline across many different life contexts 
(Billore et al., 2023)
. Self-regulation in childhood, for example, has been linked to positive life outcomes, including academic achievement, mental health, and overall wellbeing 
(Robson et al., 2020)
. Conversely, a lack of self-control in difficult situations often reveals deeper psychological vulnerabilities, such as a propensity toward shame or emotional reactivity, which are linked to hostile responses 
(Jakupcak et al., 2005)
. Criticisms of martial arts have focused on potential promotion of antisocial behaviours, aggression, and violence 
(Endresen & Olweus, 2005
). Yet, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that martial arts can foster prosocial outcomes and holistic wellbeing. A meta-analysis of studies involving children and adolescents 
(Harwood et al., 2017)
 found martial arts to be an effective intervention for reducing aggression, violence, and other externalising behaviours. Research with adolescents further highlights a role for the martial arts in cultivating self-control, reducing bullying, and fostering moral and ethical development 
(Xu et al., 2022)
. Beyond these preventative outcomes, martial arts has been successfully integrated into psychosocial rehabilitation for individuals with severe psychiatric conditions, where it has improved cognitive and physical health, self-control, social interaction, and sense of accomplishment 
(Hasson-Ohayan et al., 2006)
. Martial arts-based interventions have also proven effective in correctional settings, facilitating reductions in aggression, improvements in emotional self-management, and enhanced self-regulation among incarcerated populations 
(Frigout et al., 2020)
.
Central to these outcomes is Wing Chun's explicit focus on cultivating a reflexive self-control through structured practices such as Chi Sau. Practitioners learn to synchronise bodily actions and situational awareness, developing an instinctive responsiveness that conserves both mental and physical energy, enhancing adaptability, reducing muscular tension, and promoting psychological flexibility. This form of self-control fostered by Wing Chun also contributes to the cultivation of broader character strengths and virtues, including temperance, courage, benevolence, wisdom, and social justice 
(Pujari, 2024;
Hackney, 2011
Hackney, , 2013
Clapton & Hiskey, 2023)
. Such virtues facilitate psychological wellbeing, underpin prosocial behaviours and contribute to societal harmony 
(Chinkov & Holt, 2015;
Twemlow et al., 2008)
. This disciplined mindset derived from prancing traditional martial arts supports informed decision-making over impulsive responses, equipping practitioners to prioritise long-term goals and sustaining wellbeing over time 
(Amaya, 2020;
de Ridder, 2024;
Lomas et al., 2024)
.
Intriguingly, the concept of reflexive self-control also aligns closely with the psychological construct of "flow," which refers to an intrinsically rewarding state of deep, effortless immersion in an activity 
(Csikszentmihalyi, 1990)
. This flow experience shares conceptual parallels with mushin or 'no mind', a concept derived from Buddhist and Taoist philosophies advocating action devoid of conscious deliberation 
(Loke, 2021)
. Wing Chun also embodies Taoist principles of wuwei (effortless action) and ziran (natural spontaneity), promoting fluid, instinctive responsiveness rather than conscious, rigid and pre-scripted movements 
(Kee et al., 2021;
Sukhoverkhov et al., 2021)
. Chi Sau practice exemplifies these principles through relaxed, efficient movements that redirect an opponent's energy with minimal effort 
(Prycker, 2011)
.
Engagement in psychological flow is widely recognised as integral to happiness and overall wellbeing, involving complete immersion and intrinsic motivation 
(Kee et al., 2022)
, fostering calmness and stability in stressful situations 
(Bartell, 2019)
. These benefits can extend beyond the training context, reflected in improved executive functions, emotional regulation, and general life satisfaction 
(Potoczny et al., 2022;
Pujari, 2024)
. Activities fostering flow states have been associated with heightened environmental awareness and increased pro-environmental behaviours 
(Isham & Jackson, 2022;
Brown, Jennings & Sparkes, 2014)
, further reinforcing opportunities to promote holistic wellbeing.
In the next section, we explore the principle of directness and its relationship with psychological hardiness, another quality that supports diverse positive psychological outcomes and opportunities for inner development.
Rethinking the principle of directness through the lens of psychological hardiness "...to venture beyond the known edges of our strength and transform assumed barriers into frontiers"
-Emilia Lahti 
2019
The Wing Chun principle of directness aligns closely with psychological hardiness, a construct introduced by 
Kobasa (1979)
 as a component of personality that moderates the effects of stress on health. Hardiness originally comprised three core dimensions, commitment, control, and challenge, and was later expanded to include confidence 
(Clough et al., 2002;
Clair-Thompson & London, 2024)
. Commitment reflects persistent engagement and dedication to goals, even amidst adversity, while challenge represents the capacity to reframe stressors as opportunities for growth. Control embodies both mastery over life circumstances and the effective regulation of emotions, nurturing a belief that outcomes depend on one's own actions. Confidence encapsulates self-assurance in abilities and interpersonal effectiveness, empowering individuals to face new or challenging situations decisively 
(Clair-Thompson & London, 2024)
. Collectively, these dimensions underpin psychological resilience, enabling individuals to proactively engage with stressors and transform them into growth opportunities 
(Maddi, 2004;
Maddi, 2013)
, underpinning improvements in psychological wellbeing.
Directness in Wing Chun is exemplified through precise, intentional movements executed along the shortest and most efficient path between the practitioner and their opponent 
(Fung, 1997;
Xuan & Little, 2019)
. Central to Wing Chun's effectiveness, directness integrates attack and defence into simultaneous, fluid actions 
(Rawcliffe, 2003;
Williams, 2015)
. For instance, when a practitioner simultaneously deflects an incoming strike and counters with their own strike, they exemplify directness, neutralising incoming threats while minimising unnecessary escalation. While such a counter strike may appear inherently aggressive, it embodies a nuanced form of compassion within martial arts: resolving conflict decisively to prevent prolonged confrontation and greater harm. Compassion in this context is not passive. It is a form of 'radically embodied compassion' 
(Clapton & Hiskey, 2020)
 and 'fierce compassion' 
(Neff, 2021)
, reflecting a commitment to protecting oneself and others with the least possible harm. Fierce compassion 
(Neff, 2021)
 is characterised by empowerment, bravery, and clarity. Empowerment provides confidence to act assertively, bravery offers courage to face adversity directly, and clarity ensures wisdom guides decisive action. This combination of tender and fierce compassion harmonises with Yin/Yang philosophy, balancing receptive, nurturing qualities (Yin) with assertive, protective energy (Yang). This idea is physically represented through the Wing Chun fundamental stance (Yee Gee Kim Yeung 
Ma)
, where a strong, stable lower body supports dynamic movement, while the upper body remains relaxed and responsive 
(Rawcliffe, 2003)
.
Psychological hardiness shares similarities with the Finnish cultural concept of Sisu, which refers to a resolute determination and the ability to draw strength from deep internal reserves when faced with adversity 
(Henttonen et al., 2022)
. Emphasis on perseverance despite significant psychological and physical challenges aligns with proactive and adaptive qualities emphasised by hardiness. Research by 
Henttonen et al. (2022)
 illustrates associations between Sisu and wellbeing, suggesting that hardiness may cultivate an embodied power (PTMF, Johnstone & Boyle, 2018) and mental fortitude, which will support psychological wellbeing. Wing Chun practices, such as sensitivity drills including Chi Sau, support the development of mental fortitude by helping practitioners to maintain focus and strategically respond to challenges. Such practices foster mental clarity, resilience, and adaptive control, core elements shared by hardiness and Sisu, giving rise to psychological hardiness captured in the 'Wing Chun Spirit' 
(Williams, 2015)
.
Evidence underscores the protective role of psychological hardiness in mental health. Individuals exhibiting higher levels of hardiness demonstrate reduced vulnerability to stress-related illness and emotional distress, perceiving and adapting to challenges more constructively 
(Predko et al., 2023;
Chuning et al., 2024)
. Psychological hardiness also enhances resilience, emotional regulation, and overall quality of life 
(Azadi et al., 2021;
Salehian & Sarvari, 2021)
. Psychological hardiness offers a broader integrative framework than similar constructs such as grit and resilience, emphasising adaptability, emotional regulation, and courage in regards to engaging with stress as an opportunity for growth 
(Maddi, 2006;
Georgoulas, 2022)
. In contrast to hardiness, grit focuses on perseverance towards long-term objectives despite setbacks 
(Duckworth et al., 2007)
, while resilience highlights equilibrium through positive adaptation to stress 
(Fletcher & Sarkar, 2013;
Georgoulas, 2022)
. Psychological hardiness combines these elements, and relates more to mental toughness, a factor shown to predict happiness and wellbeing 
(Clair-Thompson & London, 2024)
 and is enhanced in Wing Chun practitioners 
(Chen, 2013;
Gucciardi, 2017)
.
By integrating Wing Chun's principle of directness with psychological hardiness, this section sheds further light on how traditional martial arts might support inner development.


Final reflections
In a world characterised by escalating challenges, including intergenerational inequalities 
(Cheng et al., 2016)
, climate change 
(Abbass et al., 2022;
Hickman et al., 2021)
, and ongoing humanitarian crises 
(Kohrt et al., 2019)
, traditional psychological and psychiatric interventions often fall short in addressing the complexity of wellbeing. This paper has advocated for a more holistic approach, focused on the interconnectedness on how core Wing Chun principles (e.g., 
Fung, 1997;
Xuan & Little, 2019)
 may nurture psychological resources related to holistic wellbeing. Each principle within REACH functions synergistically, cultivating a resilient and adaptable mindset grounded in mindful awareness, psychological flexibility, and fierce compassion. Radical non-attachment, facilitated by the Wing Chun principle of simplicity, enables practitioners to remain mentally clear and emotionally balanced, cultivating a socially engaged mindfulness. Embodied empowerment, enhanced through the mindful practice of Wing Chun, strengthens bodily awareness and intuition, fostering responsive interactions that empower self-awareness and interpersonal sensitivity. Skillful adaptation, closely linked to the principle of practicality, promotes psychological flexibility and creativity, equipping practitioners to navigate complex social environments. Such adaptation supports emotional regulation, reducing the impact of psychological distress and enhancing coping capacities. Similarly, self-control, associated with economy of movement, promotes instinctive, fluid responsiveness under pressure, conserving energy and supporting sustained attention, critical to effective management of life's challenges. Psychological hardiness, exemplified by Wing Chun's principle of directness, anchors resilience by reframing obstacles as opportunities for growth. This proactive approach empowers practitioners to engage constructively with life's adversities, promoting courage, determination, and sustained wellbeing.
Crucially, Wing Chun's potential may extend beyond individual development to relational and ecological wellbeing, through what has been described as somatic metaphorism 
(Foster, 2015)
 fostering virtues such as compassion, wisdom, and ethical engagement. These qualities are essential in addressing the broader societal challenges, particularly the harmful impacts of power dynamics across personal, social, and ecological contexts 
(Becker et al., 2021;
Johnstone et al., 2018;
Morgan et al., 2022)
. In this way, our approach aligns with the Inner Development Goals initiative, which advocates for the cultivation of inner capacities as fundamental to achieving broader social and ecological change 
(Ankrah et al., 2023;
Wamsler, 2018;
Wamsler et al., 2021
; see also https://idg.tools/). Thus, Wing Chun practice can facilitate deeper understanding of how individuals and communities might mobilise psychological resources to mitigate power imbalances and create meaning even amid adversity alongside positive societal change. Future research is now needed to empirically explore the REACH framework and its impacts across diverse populations and contexts. Ultimately, Wing Chun provides an opportunity to support holistic wellbeing, offering transformative possibilities for individuals and communities to thrive amidst the complexities of the contemporary world.


Acknowledgement
We recognise the importance of acknowledging our own biases and positionality in relation to the practice of Wing Chun. Our backgrounds are diverse, with SM serving as an instructor (Sifu) in Wing Chun Kung Fu for over two decades, running his own club in Wales, United Kingdom, and under whose tutelage RW and AK have studied. SM studied under his Sifu Eric Li, who was a student of Ip Ching, the son of Ip Man, bringing a deeper understanding of the cultural nuances and traditional aspects of Wing Chun into South Wales. The Noble Eightfold Path serves as a guide for our martial arts training, providing the foundation on which the REACH model has been developed. RW is a consultant clinical psychologist with expertise in forensic mental health and a clinical interest in supporting the cultivation of compassion. AK is a Professor of Psychology, focused on the complex construct of wellbeing and has developed third-wave positive psychology interventions for undergraduate psychology students and people living with acquired brain injury. In this paper, we bring together our readings of the diverse Wing Chun literature with insights gained through authentic practice under our lineage, guided by Sifu Eric Li. We approach this integration with humility, recognising that our Western cultural backgrounds influence our interpretations.


Contributions
RW and AHK developed and co-wrote this paper, in partnership with Sifu Stuart Mackinnon who runs Swansea Wing Chun Kung Fu Society in Wales.
