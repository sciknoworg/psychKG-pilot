Introduction
A major goal of modern neuroscience is to understand the mechanisms underlying motivated behaviour, and their implementation in the brain. Disorders of motivation, such as apathy and impulsivity, offer a valuable opportunity to study such mechanisms when they become dysfunctional in clinical populations. The core defining features of these syndromes are the diminution of self-generated purposeful actions 1 (apathy) and the tendency to decide/act quickly with little deliberation or forethought 2 (impulsivity). These traits are observed across a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders 
[3]
[4]
[5]
 and, to a certain extent, in all individuals 
6
 . Although more precise definitions of these syndromes distinguish between various possible domains of expression 
[7]
[8]
[9]
[10]
 , it is broadly agreed that their genesis involves the disruption of key decision-making processes underlying motivated behaviour 
11
 . A perplexing finding across several recent reports is the positive correlation of apathy and impulsivity traits in both healthy individuals

 and patient

[15]
[16]
 groups. How can someone be both apathetic and impulsive?
Because they influence motivated behaviour in opposite directions (i.e., insufficient vs. excessive actions), apathy and impulsivity have often naturally been considered to be polar opposites. The best example of such framework is the motivational spectrum hypothesis, which posits that apathetic and impulsive behaviour may originate from opposite dysregulations of the same neural networks involved in motivated behaviour 
11,
[17]
[18]
[19]
[20]
[21]
 . According to this view, motivated behaviour results from multiple cognitive processes (e.g., information seeking, option generation, option selection, cost-benefit decisions, action initiation, learning from outcome) that can each be directionally regulated to meet the specific constraints of the task environment. Ventral striatal dopamine is proposed to be the biological substrate that calibrates an individual's behaviour along these multiple cognitive axes, with a net directional effect towards apathy or impulsivity depending on whether there is too little or too much dopamine 
11
 . Support for this model comes mostly from the literature on Parkinson's disease, which contains descriptions of patients behaving apathetically or impulsively depending on whether they are in a hypo-or hyper-dopaminergic state, respectively 
11,
[22]
[23]
[24]
[25]
[26]
 .
Implicit in the motivational spectrum hypothesis is the notion that, at any given time, an individual may behave either apathetically or impulsively, but crucially not both since these two states exist at opposite extremes of the same spectrum. A growing set of observations, however, appears to contradict this. Instances of co-occurrence of apathy and impulsivity have indeed been reported in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease 
14,
16,
25,
[27]
[28]
[29]
 , but also in frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes 
13,
15,
30
 , Alzheimer's disease 
31
 , attention deficit hyperactivity disorders 
32
 , and schizophrenia 
33
 . In fact, even in individuals free from any neuropsychiatric diagnosis, the pattern of responses on self-report questionnaires reveals a certain degree of co-variation between the severity of apathetic and impulsive traits, especially within the goal-directed behavioural dimension 
6,
12
 .
By challenging the motivational spectrum hypothesis, these observations open a range of new questions regarding the inter-relationship of apathy and impulsivity, the extent to which their respective mechanisms may overlap, and the ways in which they could be co-expressed. Can individuals act both impulsively and apathetically simultaneously, or do they instead fluctuate between these two behavioural states in response to environmental triggers (or lack thereof)? To our knowledge, the relationship between apathy and impulsivity has solely been explored in subjective self-report or clinician assessments (e.g. questionnaires or diagnostic criteria), and not in behavioural tasks. Even though both traits can be observed in isolation in dedicated tasks (e.g., apathy: Effort-Based Decision-Making task 
34
 , Option Generation task 
35
 ; impulsivity: Balloon Analogue Risk-Taking task 
36
 , Cued Go No-Go task 
37
 ), there is, to our knowledge, no experimental paradigm allowing for their potential co-expression.
In the present work, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the co-expression of apathy and impulsivity in healthy individuals within a single behavioural paradigm. To do so, we used a new version of the Traffic Light Task 
[38]
[39]
[40]
 (TLT)a task known to encourage impulsive behaviour -in order to incorporate potential opportunities for a co-expression with apathy.
In the TLT, it is financially advantageous to take risks and behave in an anticipatory manner 
38
 . On each trial, a light successively turns red, amber then green, and participants are instructed to make a response as quickly as possible after the onset of the green "go" signal. Responses recorded prior to green onset incur a small monetary penalty, while those recorded after green onset are remunerated according to a reward function that declines at a rapid rate, so that within a few tens of milliseconds the reward that can be obtained is very low. Due to sensorimotor delays, standard human reaction times are typically slower than this 
41
 so it is impossible to collect the highest reward by merely reacting to the "go" signal. Instead, and because the temporal sequence of lights on TLT trials is sufficiently predictable though not fixed, participants can decide to initiate their response during the amber foreperiod in order to generate a response closer to the exact green onset. But in so doing they take a risk that their movement will actually be initiated before the light turns green, and thereby incur a small penalty. On the TLT, such anticipatory responses are still nevertheless advantageous in the long run because small penalties are worth incurring if many of the responses actually fall shortly after green onset, when the reward to be obtained is large.
To meet our study goals, the TLT was modified in three ways. First, the magnitude and decay rate of the reward function were manipulated to create different task environments in which it was more or less advantageous to anticipate. This allowed us to measure participants' responsiveness to changes in the cost-benefit structure of the task environment, and determine whether such contextual adjustments could account for the apparent co-expression of apathy and impulsivity in self-report questionnaire data. For example, individuals who score high on both traits with standard assessments might in fact be particularly responsive to the environmental context, and thereby fluctuate to a greater extent between an apathetic and impulsive behavioural state in response to environmental triggers. Second, instead of an eye movement 
39,
40
 or a button press 38 , a hand-held dynamometer was used to record responses, such that they became physically effortful. This introduced an effort-based decision-making dimension to the task, a process known to be implicated robustly in apathy 
34,
[42]
[43]
[44]
[45]
 . Lastly, the subjective perception of fatigue, which is also known to be associated with apathy 
10,
[46]
[47]
[48]
[49]
 , offers an alternative route to explain an apparent co-expression between apathy and impulsivity. It might indeed be the case that impulsive individuals tend to build up more fatigue, which may secondarily promote apathy. To measure how fatigue developed in the TLT, subjective ratings of fatigue were collected at various times throughout the experiment.
Consistent with previous findings 
6
 , total apathy and impulsivity questionnaire scores were positively correlated in the healthy participants tested here (n = 60). Nevertheless, when partialed out, the two constructs showed unique associations with distinct features of the modified TLT. Impulsivity was associated with a rigid urge to respond early, which was insensitive to changes in specific task constraints. Apathy, on the other hand, was associated with a blunted effect of reward on the energization of response vigour and on the prevention of fatigue. Finally, we found no evidence of an apathy-impulsivity axis on the TLT since the two traits appear to operate along distinct decision process components. Taken together, our results explain the possible co-expression of apathy and impulsivity in self-report questionnaire data: the two traits are in fact related to distinct dimensions of decision-making, which accounts for why they can be expressed in parallel in the same individual. . Self-report measures of apathy and impulsivity are positively correlated. a. Pairwise correlation plot of the total scores of the four questionnaires. The strongest positive associations were observed between the two questionnaires assessing the same construct (Apathy: AES vs. AMI; Impulsivity: BIS-11 vs. UPPS-P; both p < 0.0001). In addition, significant cross-construct correlations were observed between the AES and impulsivity measures (BIS-11 & UPPS-P; both p < 0.004).
Pearson correlation coefficients are shown in the top left corner of each scatter plot (asterisks indicate significant relationships, p < 0.05). The sample distribution of each questionnaire total score is shown on top. b. PCAs were performed on apathy (AES & AMI total score) and impulsivity (BIS-11 & UPPS-P total scores) measures in order to capture, in a single score, most of the variance of the construct's questionnaires. These two scores were positively correlated (r (58) = 0.33, p = 0.0096).


Results


Self-report measures of apathy and impulsivity are positively correlated
On the day of the experimental session, participants (n = 60; 30 females; mean age: 24.97 years, s.d.: 4.85) filled out two validated self-report questionnaire measures of impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, BIS-11 
8
 Urgency, Premeditation (lack of), Perseverance (lack of), Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency, Impulsive Behavior Scale, UPPS-P 9 ) and two measures of apathy (Apathy Evaluation Scale, AES 
7
 ; Apathy Motivation Index 10 ). Consistent with previous observations in healthy individuals using these same measures 
6
 , positive correlations were observed within and across the two constructs assessed by these questionnaires 
(Fig. 1a)
. For each construct, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to derive a global index (PCA score) quantifying its severity across the two self-report questionnaires used to assess it (Apathy score: PCA of AES & AMI total scores; Impulsivity score: PCA of BIS-11 & UPPS-P total scores; see Methods). As expected, these two scores positively correlated with one another (r (58) = 0.33, p = 0.0096; 
Fig. 1b
) such that individuals who reported being overall more impulsive also reported being more apathetic. In order to identify behavioural markers uniquely associated with apathy and/or impulsivity, all subsequent questionnaire-based analyses systematically included both these PCA scores within the same regression model (partial regressions).


Experimental paradigm
The present study used a new version of an established measure of rapid decision-making for reward, the Traffic Light Task 
[38]
[39]
[40]
 (TLT). In our paradigm, a visual display successively turned red (800 ms), amber (700 ms on 15% of trials, 1000 ms on 70% of trials, 1300 ms on 15% of trials) then green (800 ms), and participants had to gently squeeze a hand-held dynamometer (above 15% of their Maximum Voluntary Contraction, MVC) after the green onset in order to receive time-sensitive monetary reward ( 
Fig. 2a)
. Anticipatory responses (i.e., supra-threshold squeezes recorded before the green onset) led to a small penalty (£0.05).
Conversely, responses recorded after the green onset were rewarded according to the following rapid exponential discounting function ( 
Fig. 2c
):
       R(RT ) = R 0 × e −λ ×RT if RT ≥ 0 R(RT ) = −0.05 if RT < 0 (1)
where R is the reward obtained as a function of the reaction time relative to the green onset, RT. Both the reward available 
(R 0 )
 and decay rate after green onset (λ ) were manipulated in a two-by-two design 
(Fig. 2b
).

Pressing the space bar initiated the sequence of red, amber, green background colours. The duration of the amber light was either 700 ms (15.38% of trials), 1000 ms (69.23% of trials) or 1300 ms (15.38% of trials). Participants won monetary reward by squeezing a hand-held dynamometer above 15% of the Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) as quickly as they could after the background turned green. b. Both the intercept (R 0 ) and decay rate (λ ) of the exponential reward function were experimentally manipulated in a two-by-two design (104 trials per condition in total, uniformly spread across eight experimental blocks). c. Visual representation of the reward function of the four experimental conditions.


Anticipation but not vigour leads to larger earning
Similar to previous versions of the task, it was functionally advantageous to respond early, as participants who made more penalised anticipatory responses nevertheless accumulated more reward overall (β = 0.73, 95%CI = [0.57, 0.90], t (57) = 8.70, p < 0.001, controlling for mean vigour; LMM S1; 
Table S1
 -Model 1; 
Fig. S1
). By contrast, and by design, the vigour of the response (i.e., maximum contraction generated during the response, expressed as a percentage of the MVC) showed no . The use of a hand-held dynamometer therefore introduced a physical effort dimension to the task that was not directly rewarded.


Impulsivity but not apathy is advantageous on the TLT
Given that our version of the TLT provided a task environment in which it was financially advantageous to respond early ( 
Fig. S1
), we hypothesised that individuals who are naturally more impulsive may have a functional advantage. That is, the questionnaire-derived impulsivity score might positively correlate with total earnings. Similarly, if apathy operates along the same decision-making axis but has an opposite influence (motivational spectrum hypothesis), then it may be negatively associated with earnings (i.e., more apathetic people might win less reward overall).
To test these hypotheses, a single linear mixed-effect model (LMM) was built with both questionnaire-derived scores as predictors of total earning (LMM S3), controlling for age (fixed effect) and gender (random effect). The results showed that individuals with higher impulsivity scores indeed accumulated more reward overall on the task (β = 0. 


Impulsivity is associated with a rigid all-encompassing urge to respond early
Next, we set out to characterise the specific means by which impulsivity conferred a functional advantage on the TLT. Were the most impulsive individuals merely faster to respond overall and/or did they strategically tailor their fast responses to the specific conditions that would yield highest reward? In order to answer this question, we first needed to establish which experimental factors influenced the speed of the response on our modified TLT. Five experimental factors were considered:
• the amber light duration of the current trial, a n ;
• the amber light duration of the previous trial, a n−1 ;
• task practice, captured as the block index;
• the reward available, R 0 (£0.20 or £1);
• the decay rate of reward, λ (fast or slow).
The main effect of these five factors was assessed using a single LMM with conditional average RT (relative to green onset)
as the dependent variable and participant as a random effect (LMM S4; 
Fig. 3
). Block index was log-transformed as this proved to yield a better fit to the data (∆BIC = −241.62).
The amber light duration of both the current and previous trials significantly influenced mean RT (Main effect of a n on  
Table S2
 -Model 1). Participants responded faster when the current amber light lasted longer than usual, and slower when it lasted shorter than usual 
(Fig. 3
). By contrast, they responded faster when the previous amber light lasted shorter than usual, and slower when the previous amber light lasted shorter than usual 
(Fig. 3
).
These two effects illustrate two sides of the same process: the fact that participants built an internal estimate of the duration of the amber light, which they used to anticipate the green light onset (sensitivity to a n ), and updated on a trial-by-trial basis (sensitivity to a n−1 ). These effects were also observed in previous versions of the task 
[38]
[39]
[40]
 , and are regarded as key features of the TLT.
Participants improved markedly (i.e., they learnt to respond earlier) with task practice. This was expressed as a negative  
Table   S2
 -Model 1; 
Fig. 3
). Follow-up pairwise t-test comparisons of block averaged RTs showed that performance reached an asymptotic level in the fifth block as blocks 1 to 4 significantly differed from all others (all p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected) but it was no longer the case from the fifth block onwards. This learning effect appeared to result from a shift in strategyfrom reaction to anticipation -rather than mere predictive learning based on the statistical properties of the task. The latterassessed with a separate "Predictive" control task interleaved between TLT blocks (see Methods) -behaved very differently, plateauing much earlier during the experimental session (see 
Supplementary Results; Fig. S3
).   
Table S2
 -Model 2). Coloured bars show significant effects (p < 0.05) and white bars non significant effects with 95% confidence interval. Five experimental factors influenced the speed of the response: duration of the amber light of the current (a n ) and previous (a n−1 ) trial, block index (log-transformed), magnitude (R 0 ) and decay rate (λ ) of the reward. Impulsivity had a significant negative main effect and interaction with a n . This behavioural signature reflects a rigid tendency to respond early, regardless of the experimental condition. b-c. For visualisation purposes, the average reaction time (pm s.e.m.) is plotted as a function of the five experimental factors of interest, with a group median split on the impulsivity score (b.) or apathy score (c.). Individual data are plotted as separate lines of the corresponding colour. Importantly, both the reward available (R 0 ) and the rate of its decay after green onset (λ ) influenced the average RT.  
Table S2
 -Model 1; 
Fig. 3f
). Thus, individuals were incentivised to respond earlier both to harvest larger amounts of reward, and to avoid losing too much of it. There was no significant interaction between the two factors (β = −0.01, 95%CI = [−0.02, 0.00], t (9294) = −1.68, p = 0.09; 
Table S2
 -Model 1).
Having established that the average speed of the response on the TLT was influenced by task statistics (a n , a n−1 ), learning (block), and cost-benefit environment (R 0 , λ ), the key question was to determine whether the functional advantage enjoyed by impulsive individuals involved any of these factors. To answer this, we added the apathy and impulsivity scores and their interactions with experimental factors to the LMM reported above, while controlling for age (fixed effect) and gender (random effect; LMM S5). This revealed that more impulsive individuals responded generally earlier, regardless of the specific task Taken together, these results are consistent with the functional advantage of impulsivity on the TLT deriving from an urge to respond earlier rather than any strategic adjustment to specific task constraints. Follow-up parcellation of this result into the individual sub-scales of the UPPS-P questionnaire revealed that it was driven significantly by positive urgency (Negative main effect of UPPS-P "Positive Urgency" on mean RT: β = −0.13, 95%CI = [−0.25, −0.01], t (9281) = −2.06, p = 0.039;

Table S3
).
Furthermore, Supplementary Results provide a computational parameterisation of this finding within a variant of a two-horse linear rise-to-threshold model 
[38]
[39]
[40]
 able to reproduce the full RT distribution (Figs. S4-S8). The main conclusion of this alternative analysis is that more impulsive individuals showed a greater baseline probability to activate the anticipatory process in the task. This is consistent with the results of the simpler analysis reported in the main text.


Apathetic individuals are less energized by reward
The use of a hand-held dynamometer in our modified TLT enabled us to measure not only the speed of the response but also its vigour (i.e. peak force exerted within each trial). This metric has been proposed to offer an indirect read-out of utility 
50
 , i.e., the subjective value individuals attribute to particular actions/stimuli. The force requirements to trigger a response were voluntarily chosen to be low (15% of the MVC) to avoid exhaustion, and leave room for potential overshoot. On average, participants overshot this threshold by 39.71% (s.d.: 19.30%).
The same analysis strategy as the previous section was adopted, with the difference that the LMM additionally controlled for mean RT to orthogonalise vigour and RT (LMM S6). Before investigating interactions with apathy and impulsivity, we first established which of the five experimental factors (a n , a n−1 , block index, R 0 , λ ) influenced the vigour of the response. The duration of amber light of the current but not previous trial had an influence on the vigour of the response (Main effect of a n on mean vigour: β = −0.10, 95%CI = [−0.12, −0.07], t (9293) = −7.48, p < 0.001; Main effect of a n−1 on mean vigour: β = 0.00, 95%CI = [−0.01, 0.01], t (9293) = −0.17, p = 0.87; 
Table S4
 -Model 1). Thus, the surprise induced by a exceptionally short amber light duration was reflected in a harder squeeze than usual, while the opposite was true for a longer amber foreperiod.
This surprise effect, however, led to no force adjustment from one trial to the next (no significant effect of a n−1 ). As the   
Table S4
 -Model 2). Coloured bars show significant effects (p < 0.05) and white bars non significant effects with 95% confidence interval. Three experimental factors influenced the speed of the response: duration of the amber light of the current trial (a n ), block index (log-transformed), and magnitude of the reward available (R 0 ). Apathy negatively interacted with the latter effect. b-c. For visualisation purposes, the average vigour (± s.e.m.) is plotted as a function of the three experimental factors of interest that significantly influenced it, with a group median split on the impulsivity score (b.) or apathy score (c.). Individual data are plotted as separate lines of the corresponding colour. The force requirement to trigger a response (15%MVC) is shown as a horizontal dotted black line. 95%CI = [−0.04, 0.00], t (9287) = −2.48, p = 0.013; 
Table S5
). No other interaction with experimental factors was significant for neither impulsivity nor apathy 
(Table S4
 -Model 2; 
Fig. 3a
).


Discussion
Although it may seem counter-intuitive, a growing evidence base suggests that apathy and impulsivity can co-occur in psychiatric and neurological patients 
13-16, 25, 28-30
 and in the general population 
6,
12
 . The present study aimed to use behavioural tools to uncover some of the mechanisms allowing for this co-occurrence to exist. Using a new version of the TLT 
[38]
[39]
[40]
 , we found that although apathy and impulsivity positively correlated in self-report questionnaires, these two motivational disorders were associated with unique, distinct behavioural signatures on the task. On the one hand, impulsivity was associated with an urge to respond faster, regardless of task constraints 
(Fig. 3)
. On the other hand, apathy was characterised by reduced response invigoration with higher reward 
(Fig. 4)
 as well as decoupling of reward and fatigue (the latter result is presented and discussed in 
Supplementary Information; Fig. S9
). Crucially, we found no instance in which apathy significantly influenced behaviour in the opposite direction as impulsivity. That is, there was no support for the motivational spectrum hypothesis 
11,
[17]
[18]
[19]
[20]
[21]
 .
The finding that impulsivity was associated with faster responding on the TLT is consistent with previous observations 
38
 , and with a broader literature that used various tasks 
51,
52
 (in particular go-no go or stop-signal tasks). Because it leads to larger reward on the TLT, this mode of responding had previously been assumed to capture a form of "functional" impulsivity, that is the tendency to act rapidly when this response style is optimal 
53
 . By manipulating the cost-benefit structure of the TLT (R 0 and λ ; 
Fig 2b)
, the present experiment tested directly whether people responded to task environment. The results revealed that the TLT was indeed able to capture a behavioural manifestation of "functional" impulsivity since participants were incentivised to respond earlier when greater reward was available and when it was set to decay faster after the green onset 
(Fig. 3
). This is in line with previous studies demonstrating a motivational role of both reward (R 0 ) and punishment (λ ) in motor decision-making 
[54]
[55]
[56]
[57]
 .
The cost-benefit structure of our TLT was such that it was actually always financially advantageous to anticipate the green onset, regardless of the current R 0 -λ combination. What varied across experimental conditions was the financial benefit associated with doing do. Thus, a truly rational agent performing this new version of the TLT should have invariantly aimed to respond at green onset with as little variance as possible since this strategy maximised return. The notion of Expected Value of Control 58-60 offers a theoretical framework for understanding why human participants may have deviated from this strategy to instead adjust their response speed to R 0 and λ . According to this framework, exerting control (to generate the response that harvests most reward) comes at a cost that is weighted against expected reward to determine the optimal amount of control to invest in the ongoing task. If accurately anticipating the green onset comes at an extra cost -potentially due to more precise temporal estimation and greater attentional resources -then it may become optimal to invest these additional resources only when the associated pay-off is high enough (large reward available and/or large cost of generating late responses). Within the two-horse linear rise-to-threshold model 
[38]
[39]
[40]
 developed in Supplementary Information 
(Figs. S4-S5
), R 0 and λ were indeed found to increase the accumulation rate of the anticipatory decision process, thereby allowing the model to generate responses that fell closer to the green onset and were less variable 
(Fig. S8
). Our results are therefore consistent with the idea that reward (R 0 ) and punishment (λ ) exerted their motivational influence on the TLT through the optimisation of the anticipatory process, which in itself may have come at an intrinsic cost. Apathy and impulsivity were not found to interact with this process in the current study.
Although all individuals strategically tailored their response speed to the cost-benefit structure, the psychometric trait measure of impulsivity derived from the BIS-11 and UPPS-P questionnaires was instead related to a rigid readiness to respond earlier on the TLT, irrespective of experimental condition 
(Fig. 3
). This can be seen as a form of "dysfunctional" impulsivity which incidentally happened to be beneficial on the TLT. Within the modeling framework developed in Supplementary Information, this behaviour was conceptualised as a bias towards engaging the anticipatory process in the task at baseline prior to any exposure. Consistent with this idea, the greatest contributor of the relationship between impulsivity score and RT on the TLT was "Positive Urgency", a subscale of the UPPS-P that has previously been linked to a difficulty inhibiting prepotent motor responses 
61,
62
 . We therefore propose that inhibitory control deficit may be a dimension of impulsivity that sits outside the dopamine-mediated motivational spectrum. In agreement with this interpretation is the report of inhibitory control deficits in both impulsive and apathetic patients with rather specific neuroanatomical 
13,
30,
63,
64
 (ventral prefrontal cortex) and neurochemical 
[65]
[66]
[67]
[68]
 (serotoninergic and noradrenergic deficiency) signatures.
The use of a hand-held dynamometer allowed us to measure response vigour in addition to speed in our version of the TLT. As expected 
50
 , this offered an indirect read out of wanting 69 as participants were found to squeeze harder when the reward available increased 
(Fig. 4
). It is worth noting the absence of effect of decay rate (λ ) on vigour, suggesting this behavioural metric was related to the reward available presented on the screen (R 0 ) as opposed to expected outcome.
Reward sensitivity is one of the pillar candidate mechanism of the motivational spectrum hypothesis 11 since it involves dopaminergic frontostriatal circuits that can be up-or down-regulated in disease and pharmacologically, and it shares conceptual links to both apathy and impulsivity depending on the direction of the impairment (too little: apathy; too much: impulsivity).
Although the role of altered reward sensitivity in the genesis of apathy is well established 
[42]
[43]
[44]
[70]
[71]
[72]
[73]
[74]
 , its contribution to impulsivity is more debated, with many authors arguing for a distinction between these two concepts -so called "reward (hyper)sensitivity" vs. "rash impulsiveness" 
[75]
[76]
[77]
 . The psychometric measure of impulsivity used in our study seemed to be more specific to rash impulsiveness given its relationship to RT on the TLT 
(Fig. 3
). On the other hand, the apathy score derived from the AES and AMI questionnaires was associated with blunted reward sensitivity on the TLT, i.e. lower invigoration of the manual response by monetary incentives. Thus, apathy seems to be more specifically a disorder of the valuation system, compared to impulsivity. Note that this finding does not invalidate the existence of a potential motivational spectrum for reward sensitivity. For example, it might be the case that reward hypersensitivity only leads to impulsive behaviour in the presence of a conjoint inhibitory control deficit 
77
 .
Overall, the findings presented here suggest that impulsivity may have a direct effect on action initiation/inhibition, whereas apathy appears to be more specifically related to the valuation system. These distinct mechanisms may contribute to the possible co-expression of both apathy and impulsivity.


Methods


Participants
Sixty young healthy adults (30 females, mean age: 24.97 years, s.d.: 4.85) took part in the study. They were recruited via the Oxford Psychology Research participant recruitment scheme website (https://opr.sona-systems.com) and online study advertisement. Volunteers who reported a personal history of neurological or psychiatric condition or undertaking psycho-active medication were excluded from participation. The study was approved by the University of Oxford ethics committee, and all participants provided written informed consent at the beginning of the experimental session. Data collection took place in person between October and February 2020.


External measures
Participants completed two well-established self-report questionnaire measures of apathy (Apathy Evaluation Scale, AES 7 ;
Apathy Motivation Index 10 ) and impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, BIS-11 
8
 ; Urgency, Premeditation (lack of), Perseverance (lack of), Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency, Impulsive Behavior Scale, UPPS-P 9 ). The use of two questionnaires per construct provided a more reliable measure of apathy and impulsivity (see 
Fig. 1
 for cross-questionnaire correlations).
Details about the four questionnaires are provided below:

Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC)
At the beginning of the experimental session, participants were asked to squeeze the hand-held dynamometer as hard as they possibly could on three consecutive occasions (5 seconds per squeeze). The strongest force recorded during this procedure was defined as the Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC), and used for task calibration purposes.


Modified Traffic Light Task
The Traffic Light Task (TLT) is a well-established test of rapid, opportunistic decision-making under temporal uncertainty in pursuit of risky, time-sensitive reward 
[38]
[39]
[40]
 . The current version of the task departed from the one used in previous studies in two important ways 
(Fig. 2)
. First, a hand-held dynamometer was used to record the response, as opposed to an eye movement 
39,
40
 or a button press 38 . This provided a measure of vigour as an indirect index of subjective utility 
50
 , as well as introduced a fatigue-inducing physical effort dimension to the task. Second, both the starting point (R 0 ) and decay constant (λ ) of the reward function (Eq. 2) were manipulated in a two-by-two design in order to investigate the influence of cost-benefit structure on performance.
At the beginning of each trial, participants were presented with a picture of a coin (20p or £1) and an animal (turtle or hare) that informed them of the cost-benefit features of the trial (R 0 -λ combination). They subsequently had to press the space bar with their non-dominant hand to self-initiate each trial. Upon release of the space key, the screen background turned red, then amber, then green. The red and green colours both stayed on the screen for 800 ms. The duration of the amber light, however, could take one of three values. It was 1000 ms in most cases (69.2% of all trials, i.e., 72 trials per condition in total), but departed from this time by ± 300 ms in the remaining cases (30.8% of all trials., i.e., 16 trials per condition and per deviation in total). Experimental blocks included 13 repetitions of each of the four possible R 0 -λ combinations (52 trials per block in total). Nine of these trials had the most common amber light duration (1000 ms), while two had a shorter one (700 ms), and two had a longer one (1300 ms). The order of trials was random such that rarer amber light durations occurred unexpectedly. Note, however, that rare trials (700 ms or 1300 ms amber duration) were always followed by a common trial (1000 ms amber light duration).
The task statistics allowed participants to form an internal representation of the most common amber light duration (see Predictive control task), and use this knowledge to anticipate the green onset if they wished. Thus, on a trial-by-trial basis, people had to rapidly decide whether to wait for the green light to appear before generating a (reactive) response, or whether to respond based on their knowledge of task statistics but risk incurring a penalty (anticipatory response).
Participants were instructed that they could win hypothetical money by "catching the animal" as quickly as they could once the screen turned green. To catch the animal, they had to squeeze the hand-held dynamometer with a force of at least 15% of their MVC. They were explicitly informed that stronger squeezes did not yield higher reward. A vertical progress bar provided visual feedback on the current (sub-threshold) force exerted. Upon crossing the response force threshold (15% MVC), an outline appeared around the picture of the animal to indicate that the response had been recorded. It was red if the response occurred before the green onset (penalised anticipatory response), and black otherwise (rewarded response). The trial outcome was subsequently presented for 2 seconds. Reward was calculated according to the following inverse exponential temporal discount function ( 
Fig. 2c)
:
       R(RT ) = R 0 × e −λ ×RT if RT ≥ 0 R(RT ) = −0.05 if RT < 0 (2)
where R 0 refers to the magnitude of the reward available (£1 or £0.20), λ refers to the rate of its decay after green onset (λ f ast = 0.0125 £.ms -1 and λ slow = 0.0033 £.ms 
-1
 , which correspond to a half-life of 55 ms and 208 ms, respectively), and RT refers to the time elapsed between the green onset and the crossing of the 15%MVC threshold. The outcome of each trial was added to the amount in the "bank", displayed at the top of the screen. In-between blocks, a score board showed to amount earned in each block, ranked from highest to lowest. To keep participants motivated, they were encouraged to beat their own score from one block to the next. The amount in the bank was reset to zero at the beginning of each task block.
Participants underwent eight blocks of 52 trials each (mean block duration 


Fatigue Ratings
Because of the physical effort component of this version of the TLT, participants were asked to rate their level of subjective fatigue throughout the experimental session. When doing so, a vertical visual analogue scale (VAS) appeared in the middle of the screen with the words "Not at all" and "Extremely" displayed at its lowest and highest extremes, and the question "How TIRED do you feel?" at the top 
(Fig. S2d)
. Individuals then placed a cursor at the level that best reflected their current fatigue by touching the screen, and pressed the space bar to validate their rating. The percentage corresponding to the level selected was displayed on the side of the cursor. Within a task, the initial position of the cursor was set to the value of the preceding rating.
The reactive control task included four fatigue ratings in total (one every 40 trials), the TLT task four fatigue ratings per block (one every 13 trials), and the temporal duration discrimination task four fatigue ratings in total (one every trials).
Analysis and discussion of fatigue data is provided in Supplementary Information.


Statistical analysis
Data handling and statistical analysis were done in MATLAB (The Math-Works Inc., version 2020a). On the TLT, were excluded from the analysis trials in which: (1) no response was recorded (0.88% of the data); (2) a response was recorded earlier than 1000 ms before the green onset (0.10% of the data); (3) a response was recorded later than 1000 ms after the green onset (0.10% of the data). The behavioural measure of interest were: (1) Earnings (i.e. the amount of reward obtained); 
(2)
 Anticipation (i.e. the percentage of trials in which participants responded before the green onset); (3) Reaction Time (RT) relative to the green onset; (4) Vigour (i.e. peak force exerted within a trial, expressed as a percentage of the MVC).
Statistical analysis used general linear mixed-effect models (LMM). When analysing the relationship between apathy and a behavioural variable, the other motivation disorder (impulsivity) was also included in the model (partial correlation). Similarly, when analysing the relationship between impulsivity and a behavioural variable, the model systematically controlled for apathy.
All statistical tests were two-sided. All LMM equations are provided in Supplementary Information.


Supplementary Methods


Reactive Control Task
Before undergoing the TLT, participants performed a short control task (mean duration: 5.77 min, s.d.: 0.49) aimed at measuring their responsiveness to unpredictable changes in screen background colour 
(Fig. S2a)
. A secondary objective of this task was to familiarise participants with the visual display and mode of responding of the TLT. The background was grey and turned green for 800 ms every 800 to 2800 ms according to a pseudo-uniform distribution. Participants were instructed to squeeze the hand-held dynamometer as quickly as they could in response to the green light. When reaching 15% of the MVC, the progress bar filled up, and a black outline appeared around a grey rectangle indicating that a response had been recorded. This short control task included three blocks of 40 trials each, separated by a fatigue rating.


Predictive Control Task
Anticipatory behaviour on the TLT may in part reflect statistical learning. That is, in order to respond at green onset, individuals need to build an accurate internal representation of the distribution of amber light durations. In order to track how this ability developed over the course of the TLT, a predictive response task was interleaved at the end of each TLT block 
(Fig. S2b
). In this short task (10 trials per block; mean block duration: 1.13 min, s.d.: 0.22), the background turned red for 800 ms, then amber, but did not turn green. Instead, participants were instructed to respond when they thought the background should turn green (i.e., after 1000 ms on average). On each trial, after the response was recorded, a visual representation of the most frequent timeline (red/amber/green: 800/1000/800 ms) was presented on the screen and participants had to report whether they thought they had responded too early, on time, or too late by positioning an arrow at the time of their response. This rating provided a measure of metacognitive accuracy, i.e., the precision of ones' perception of their own performance. No performance feedback was provided on the predictive control task.


Temporal Duration Discrimination Task
In order to investigate the extent to which performance on the TLT was influenced by inter-individual differences in time perception, participants performed a two-alternative forced choice temporal duration discrimination task at the end of the experimental session ( 
Fig. S2c; 64
 trials; mean duration: 7.38 min, s.d.: 0.51). The task was adapted from Bueti et al.
(2008) 
79
 , task B, and was similar to the one used by Burnett et al. (2012) 
38
 . The screen turned amber twice in a row with a grey interval of 800 ms in-between. On each trial, one of the two amber durations was 1000 ms (the "reference" duration), equivalent the mean and most frequent duration on the TLT 
(Fig. S2a)
. The other amber duration (the "test" duration) was either 700 ms (short amber light duration on the TLT), 850 ms, 1150 ms or 1300 ms (long amber light duration on the TLT). The order of reference and test durations was fully randomised across trials (16 repetitions per test duration).
Participants pressed the left or right arrow keys with the index and middle fingers of their dominant hand to indicate whether the first or second flash lasted longer. On half of the trials, the left arrow key corresponded to the first flash, while on the other half it corresponded to the second flash. The key-response matching was explicitly displayed on the screen, and reversed only once halfway through the task. No performance feedback was provided on the temporal duration discrimination task. Mean RT ∼ 1 + a + a n−1 + ln(Block) + R 0 + λ + Imp + a : Imp + a n−1 : Imp + ln(Block) : Imp + R 0 : Imp + λ : Imp + Ap + a : Ap + a n−1 : Ap + ln(Block) : Ap + R 0 : Ap + λ : Ap + Age + (1 + a + a n−1 + ln(Block) + R 0 + λ + Imp + a : Imp + a n−1 : Imp + ln(Block) : Imp + R 0 : Imp + λ : Imp + Ap + a : Ap + a n−1 : Ap + ln(Block) : Ap + R 0 : Ap + λ : Ap + Age | Gender)

For the following two analyses, fatigue ratings, vigour and reward obtained were block-averaged. Time-on-task corresponded to the cumulative time reached at the end of each of the eight experimental blocks (starting from zero at the beginning of the first block). Baseline fatigue was the average fatigue rating before the start of the TLT. 


Computational model of reaction time distributions
On the TLT, the distribution of reaction times (RT) relative to the green onset is characterised by the presence of two distinct peaks -corresponding to anticipatory/predictive and reactive responses -whose relative magnitude is influenced by the duration of the amber light 
[38]
[39]
[40]
 
(Figs. S6-S8
). Trials in which the amber light lasts longer than usual typically lead to more anticipatory (early) responses, while trials in which the amber light is shorter are characterised by predominantly reactive (late) responses. This data feature is well reproduced by a two-horse linear rise-to-threshold model in which processes compete (or "race") towards a threshold in order to generate a response 
[38]
[39]
[40]
 . According to this two-horse linear rise-to-threshold model, the probability that a response has occurred by time t following amber light onset (i.e., the cumulative probability distribution) is given by:
Pr(T ≤ t|n) = Ψ(t, µ A , σ 2 A ) + Ψ(t − a n , µ R , σ 2 R ) − Ψ(t, µ A , σ 2 A ) × Ψ(t − a n , µ R , σ 2 R ) (S10)
where Ψ is the cumulative recinormal distributions 
80
 , and a n is the amber light duration of the n-th trial (i.e., either 700, 1000, or 1300 ms). The cumulative recinormal distribution is defined for t > 0 as:
Ψ(t, µ, σ 2 ) = 1 − Φ 1/t − µ σ (S11)
where µ and σ 2 are the mean and variance of the standard cumulative normal distribution Φ. Thus, within the two-horse linear rise-to-threshold modeling framework, each process (anticipatory and reactive) is parameterised in terms of the mean and variance of its rate-of-rise. The anticipatory process is assumed to start rising (with mean rate-of-rise µ A and variance σ 2 A ) from amber onset onwards, thereby crossing the response threshold around the average green onset. The reactive process, on the other hand, is automatically triggered by the actual onset of the green light, and rises more sharply (with mean rate-of-rise µ R and variance σ 2 R ).
By design, this formulation (Eq. S10) is solely capable of capturing how the duration of the amber light of a given trial (a n )
impacts the relative contribution of the anticipatory and reactive processes to the RT distribution. However, a simple analysis of mean reaction times using a LMM demonstrated that at least three other factors also had an impact on the average speed of the response 
(Fig. 3)
, namely:
• Amber light duration of the previous trial, a n−1 ;
• Task practice, indexed by the trial number, n;
• The cost-benefit structure of the trial (R 0 and τ).
The goal of incorporating these effects within a computational model (two-horse model) was to gain further mechanistic insight by considering the full RT distribution (as opposed to mere mean RT). In other words, the question asked was: what is the putative mechanism by which any of these experimental factors influence reaction time? For simplification purposes, the two experimental variables defining the cost-benefit structure of the trial (R 0 & λ ) were assumed to both affect the same compartment of the model. For each factor (a n−1 , n, R 0 & λ ), we tested three candidate computational mechanisms by which the factor could exert its influence ( 
Fig. S4
):
• By advancing/postponing the time at which the anticipatory process starts rising towards the response threshold, t 0 (Fig 
.   S4b
);
• By increasing/decreasing the mean rise of the anticipatory process, µ A 
(Fig. S4c)
;
• By increasing/decreasing the probability of the anticipatory process to be active on a given trial, w n 
(Fig. S4d
).
Incorporating these candidate mechanisms into the two-horse linear rise-to-threshold model required extending Eq. S10 as follows:
Pr(T ≤ t|n) =w(n) × [Ψ(t − δ (n), µ A (n), σ 2 A ) + Ψ(t − a n , µ R , σ 2 R ) − Ψ(t − δ (n), µ A (n), σ 2 A ) × Ψ(t − a n , µ R , σ R )] + (1 − w(n)) × Ψ(t − a n , µ R , σ 2 R ) (S12)
where w(n) is the probability of the anticipatory process to be active on the n-th trial (0 ≤ w(n) ≤ 1), δ (n) is the shift in starting time of the anticipatory process relative to the amber onset on the n-th trial, and µ A (n) is the mean rate-of-rise of the anticipatory process on the n-th trial.
As illustrated in 
Figure S4
, each of these alternative mechanisms (manipulating δ (n), µ A (n) or w(n)) has a unique, distinct, signature on the RT distribution. This mathematical property made it possible to determine, for each experimental factor (a n−1 , n, [R 0 & λ ]), the candidate computational mechanism (δ (n), µ A (n) or w(n)) that best explained its impact on human performance.
δ (n) and µ A (n) were assumed to be a linear combination of the experimental factors influencing them, that is:
δ (n) = Xβ δ (n) = Xβ (S13)
where X is in a design matrix containing the experimental factors of interest and β is a vector of parameter estimates capturing the magnitude of these effects. Because w(n) was bounded between 0 and 1, it was assumed to have instead a logistic relationship to the experimental factors of interest, that is:
w(n) = 1 1 + e −Xβ (
S14)
Note that the experimental factors included in a given design matrix were z-scored at the individual level to facilitate model fitting.
By considering all possible combinations of experimental factor (a n−1 , n, [R 0 & λ ]) vs. computational mechanism (δ (n), µ A (n) or w(n)), twenty-seven models were created (3 3 = 27 combinations; 
Fig. S5a
). In addition to these 27 models, we also tested the original two-horse linear-to-arise model described in Equation S10 
39
 (Reference model 1) as well as its simple upgrade (Reference model 2) that included a subject-specific probability of anticipating w that was fixed across trials.


Supplementary Results


Control tasks


Reactive Control Task
The Reactive Control Task was used to measure participants' ability to respond to unpredictable changes in screen background colour. Since no anticipation was possible, RT was thought to primarily reflect delay due to visuomotor processing. To investigate the relationship of apathy and impulsivity with this process, a LMM was built with the two questionnaire-derived scores as predictors of mean RT, controlling for age (fixed effect) and gender (random effect). Trials for which a response occurred within the 800 ms preceding a change in background colour were excluded from the analysis (0.67% of the data excluded).
Mean RT on the Reactive Control Task showed no relationship to neither apathy (β = 0.00, 95%CI = [−0.01, 0.01], t (56) = 0.30, p = 0.77; 
Table S8
) nor impulsivity (β = 0.01, 95%CI = [−0.01, 0.02], t (56) = 0.89, p = 0.38; 
Table S8
). This null result reinforces the idea that faster responses of more impulsive individuals on the TLT is due not to shorter visuomotor delays but rather to a greater tendency to anticipate.


Predictive Control Task
At the end of every TLT block, participants underwent a short Predictive Control Task in which they were explicitly instructed to respond based on their internal estimate of the green onset (see 
Supplementary Methods)
. The reaction time (RT) was expressed in relation to the most common green onset (i.e., 1000 ms after the amber onset). Trials for which the RT was further than three scaled median absolute deviations (MAD) away from the median of the participant were excluded from the analysis  
Table   S2
). Follow-up pairwise t-test comparisons of block averaged RTs showed that performance reached an asymptotic level as early as the second block since only the first block significantly differed from all others (p < 0.001, not Bonferroni-corrected).
Furthermore, participants responded earlier on average on the Predictive Control Task compared to the TLT in the first and second blocks (paired t-tests: both p < 0.01).
Performance on the Predictive Control Task therefore indicates that, when instructed to do so, participants were well able to anticipate the green light onset. Nevertheless, the strategy adopted by participants on the TLT task led to slower mean RT, especially in the first two experimental blocks 
(Fig. S3a)
. This is consistent with the idea that the learning effect observed on the TLT only marginally reflects predictive learning but instead seem to derive from a shift in strategy from reaction to anticipation.
To investigate the relationship of apathy and impulsivity with predictive learning, the two questionnaire-derived scores were added to the LMM while controlling for age (fixed effect) and gender (random effect). Although impulsivity did not significantly the two questionnaire-derived scores to the LMM while controlling for age (fixed effect) and gender (random effect) showed no interaction of these traits with metacognition (both p > 0.19).


Temporal Duration Discrimination Task
The Temporal Duration Discrimination Task was used to measure inter-individual differences in time perception. The effect of test duration on the response was analysed using the following logistic mixed-effect model:
Responded "Test duration is longer" ∼ 1 + Test duration
+ (1 + Test duration | Participant)
(S15)
Overall, participants' responses were accurate (slope: β = 1.64, 95%CI = [1.47, 1.80], t (3838) = 19.23, p < 0.001; 
Table   S10
 -Model 1). Adding questionnaire-derived scores to the logistic regression showed no significant interaction of apathy and impulsivity with the accuracy of time discrimination (Apathy score × accuracy: β = −0.07, 95%CI = [−0.21, 0.07], t (3834) = −0.95, p = 0.34; Impulsivity score × accuracy: β = 0.00, 95%CI = [−0.13, 0.14], t (3834) = 0.07, p = 0.94; 
Table   S10
 -Model 2).


A computational model of RT
The goal of this supplementary analysis of TLT data was to take advantage of the greater information carried by the full distribution of RT to characterise the impact of impulsivity on the putative cognitive mechanisms involved. It is well established that RT on the TLT follows a bimodal (double recinormal) distribution with an early "anticipatory" and a late "reactive" peak whose relative magnitude depends on the duration of the amber light 
[38]
[39]
[40]
 . This data feature is well reproduced by a two-horse linear rise-to-threshold model, which posits the existence of two competing decision processes -an anticipatory and a reactive one -racing towards a fixed response threshold. The anticipatory process is thought to capture an urge to respond that starts building up from amber onset onwards and culminates at the green onset. This can be seen as a direct manifestation of functional impulsivity on the TLT. By contrast, the reactive process captures to the response to the onset of the green light.
Visual inspection of the RT distribution in our modified TLT confirmed the presence of distinct anticipatory and reactive peaks, which were more or less ample depending on the duration of the amber light 
(Figs. S6-S8
). When the amber light duration was shorter than usual, the RT distribution was dominated by the late reactive peak, whereas when the amber light lasted longer than usual, the RT distribution was dominated by the early anticipatory peak. Crucially, the other experimental factors considered in the main text (a n−1 , block index, R 0 , λ ) appeared to have distinctive signatures on the RT distribution. In order to capture such effects, we extended the two-horse linear rise-to-threshold model to allow for three candidate mechanisms by which the factors may influence the model (see Supplementary Methods):
• by shifting the time at which the anticipatory process starts rising, t 0 
(Fig.S4b)
;
• by changing in the rate at which the anticipatory process rises toward the response threshold, µ A 
(Fig.S4c)
;
• by changing the probability of the anticipatory process to be active on a given trial, w 
(Fig.S4d)
 As illustrated in 
Fig.S4b-d
, each of these three candidate computational mechanisms was associated with a unique, distinct signature on the RT distribution, making it possible, through model fitting and comparison, to determine the mechanism that best explained the effect of each experimental factor. Variants of the two-horse linear rise-to-threshold model were created by testing potential candidate mechanisms for each experimental factor. To reduce the number of models to test, costbenefit parameters (R 0 & λ ) were assumed to operate through the same computational mechanism (see Supplementary Methods).
All combinations of three potential mechanisms (effect on t 0 , µ A , w) to explain three experimental factors (a n−1 , trial index, cost-benefit structure) led to 27 (i.e., 3 3 ) candidate models. Two additional models were tested for reference. They did not include a sensitivity to any of the three experimental factors, and merely differed in terms of their architecture: (1) two-horse model with an anticipatory process that was always active (i.e., w = 1; Reference model 1, equivalent to the model used in previous studies 
[38]
[39]
[40]
 ); (2) a "weighted" version of the same model in which the anticipatory process had a fixed probability w (0 ≤ w ≤ 1) to be activated. Models were fitted to individual datasets separately, using a ∆BIC = −213.74; 
Fig. S5a
) accounted for these effects in the following ways:
• The amber duration of the previous trial influences the mean rate-of-rise of the anticipatory process (faster/slower µ A when the previous amber light was shorter/longer than usual);
• The probability of the anticipatory process to be active (w) grows logarithmically with task practice (trial index);
• The cost-benefit structure of the trial influences mean rate-of-rise of the anticipatory process (faster/slower µ A when more/less reward is available and when the reward decays faster/shorter after the green onset). RT distributions. Note that, in this model, learning is parameterised as an increase in the probability of the anticipatory process to be active (purple curve in 
Fig. S5b
). In that respect, individuals can differ in term of the baseline w (intercept), as well as the speed at which w rises across successive trials.
In order to determine which features of the model conferred a functional advantage on the TLT, we investigated the relationship between parameter estimates and total earnings. These correlations were run separately for each of the nine model parameters with Spearman correlation after outlier removal (exclusion of parameter estimates further than three scaled median absolute deviations away from the median of the group), and controlled for Age and Gender (partial correlation). The mean rate-of-rise of both the anticipatory (ρ (55) = 0.78, p < 0.001) and reactive (ρ (57) = 0.35, p = 0.0078) process were positively associated with total earnings. In addition, the baseline probability of the anticipatory process to be active (ρ (50) = 0.72, p < 0.001), as well as the speed at which this probability rose over successive trials (ρ (49) = 0.52, p < 0.001) were both positively correlated to total earnings. None of the other five model parameters (σ A , σ R , effect of a n−1 on t 0 , effect of R 0 on µ A , effect of λ on µ A ) showed any significant relationship to total earnings. Thus, two features of the model were particularly rewarded: (1) maximising the speed of evidence accumulation in favour of a manual response (for both the anticipatory and reactive process), and (2) maximising the probability of the anticipatory process to be active.
Finally, we used the model developed above to investigate the mechanism through which impulsivity led to a functional advantage on the TLT. This was done by computing the Spearman correlation between Impulsivity Score and the four functional model parameter estimates (outliers removed as above), while controlling for Age, Gender, and Apathy Score. The only significant correlation was observed between Impulsivity Score and the baseline probability of the anticipatory process to be active (ρ (50) = 0.24, p = 0.045, one-tail). Note that this is a less sensitive analysis compared to the LMM reported in the main text due to the non-normal distribution of model parameter estimates that obliged us to exclude a large number of data points (n = 8 participants excluded from this analysis). Nevertheless, the results were consistent in that they indicated that the functional advantage impulsive individuals benefited from was related to a pre-existing tendency to produce an early anticipatory response before any exposure to the task, rather than any form of learning or sensitivity to the task environment.
Further support for this interpretation was provided by the relationship to questionnaire sub-scales. The only impulsivity sub-scale that showed a significant relationship to the baseline w was the UPPS-P "Lack of Premeditation" (ρ (50) = 0.30, p = 0.019, one-tail).


Apathy is expressed as a decoupling of reward and fatigue
Lower motivation has been proposed to be a central feature of both apathy and fatigue 
4,
49,
81
 . More specifically, both constructs have been associated with distorted effort-based decision-making 
82
 , and appear to implicate similar neural circuits involved in valuation and reward processing 
[83]
[84]
[85]
 . In the present study, fatigue ratings were collected in order to track the development of fatigue throughout the experiment. Participants were asked to rate, on a visual analogue scale (VAS), how tired they felt four times per TLT block (i.e., every 13 trials, see Methods).
There  
Table S6
). This finding is consistent with a protective effect of reward on fatigue -as observed in dedicated tasks 
86,
87
 and naturalistic work environments 
88,
89
 . However, the correlational nature of the data did not allow us to conclude on the directionality of the relationship observed. An alternative interpretation is that lower momentary fatigue might have led to better performance and therefore higher reward. Future work should disentangle between these two alternative interpretations.
Finally, adding the two questionnaire-derived scores to the LMM (while controlling for Age and Gender; LMM S9)
suggested that apathy weakened the association between earning and fatigue (Interaction Apathy × Block reward: β = 0.06, 95%CI = [0.00, 0.14], t (466) = 1.92, p = 0.055; 
Table S6

Follow-up parcellation of this result into the individual sub-scales of the AMI questionnaire revealed that it was driven mostly by behavioural apathy (Interaction AMI-behavioural × Block reward: β = 0.07, 95%CI = [0.00, 0.13], t (466) = 2.03, p = 0.043;

. Control tasks. a. On the Reactive Control Task, participants were instructed to respond to unpredictable changes in background colour from grey to green. This task was performed before the Traffic Light Task (TLT), and also served as a training to the use of the dynamometer. b. On the Predictive Control Task, the background turned red then amber, and participants were instructed the respond when they thought the background should turn green (based on their experience of the TLT). After their response, a visual representation of the normal time line was displayed, and patient had to indicate (by touching the screen to position an arrow) when they thought they had responded in relation to this time line. This control task was interleaved with the TLT (10 trials at the enf of each TLT block). c. On the Temporal Duration Discrimination Task, the back ground turned amber twice in a row, and participants had to indicate which of these two flashes (the first or the second) lasted the longest. This control task was performed last, after the TLT. d. At various points throughout the experimental session, participants were asked to rate how tired they felt. When doing so, a vertical scale appeared in the middle of the screen, and participants could place a cursor at the appropriate level. A number between 0 (no fatigue at all) and 100 (extremely tired) was displayed on the side of the cursor based on its position on the scale.    
Figure S4
. Visual illustration of the two-horse linear rise-to-threshold model of reaction time in TLT. a. Group and individual reaction time data were fit to a two-horse linear rise-to-threshold model. RT distributions arise probabilistically from one of two linear rise-to-threshold processes: (1) an anticipatory decision process, triggered by the onset of the amber light, with mean rate of rise mu A and SD rate of rise sigma A . The background in the box shows the duration of red, amber and green lights. The dashed vertical line marks the onset of the green light. This process has a small mean rate of rise and large variance, and therefore results in a wide but early RT distribution (the orange distribution above the top box), of which some are elicited prior to the onset of the green light. (2) A reactive decision process, triggered by the onset of the green light, with mean rate of rise mu R and SD rate of rise sigma R . This process has a high mean rate of rise and small variance, and therefore results in a narrow but late RT distribution with median shortly after green onset (the green distribution above the bottom box). The first process to reach the threshold (the top horizontal edge of each box) on a given trial will trigger a response. This results in a two-peak RT distribution observed in TLT, as illustrated in blue on the right box. The anticipatory process can be affected in three mechanisms: b. the starting point of the anticipatory process t 0 ; c. the mean rise of the anticipatory process µ A , and d. the probability of activating the anticipatory process w. The box grid shows the model architecture. Reference models 1 and 2 were a two-horse and weighted two-horse model, respectively. Models 1-27 were constructed by varying the computational mechanisms (effect on t 0 , µ A or w) by which each experimental factor (a n−1 , n, R0/λ ) had an effect. For each of the three columns, a black box on the left/middle/right means an effect on t 0 /µ A /w, respectively. The best model (lowest BIC) included an effect of a n−1 and cost-benefit structure (R 0 , λ ) on µ A , and an effect of trial number on w. b. These effects are plotted here.

The strongest positive associations were observed between the two questionnaires assessing the same construct (Apathy: AES vs. AMI; Impulsivity: BIS-11 vs. UPPS-P; both p < 0.0001). In addition, significant cross-construct correlations were observed between the AES and impulsivity measures (BIS-11 & UPPS-P; both p < 0.004). Pearson correlation coefficients are shown in the top left corner of each scatter plot (asterisks indicate significant relationships, p < 0.05). The sample distribution of each questionnaire total score is shown on top. b. PCAs were performed on apathy (AES & AMI total score) and impulsivity (BIS-11 & UPPS-P total scores) measures in order to capture, in a single score, most of the variance of the construct's questionnaires. These two scores were positively correlated (r (58) = 0.33, p = 0.0096).

A within-participant trialwise analyse of the determinants of the reward obtained (LMM S2) also demonstrated that although trials in which individuals responded faster led to greater outcomes (β = −0.08, 95%CI = [−0.11, −0.05], t (24685) = −5.52, p < 0.001), the amount of force exerted on the dynamometer was not associated with the reward obtained (β = 0.01, 95%CI = [−0.01, 0.02], t (24685) = 0.27, p − 0.27)

Participants responded faster on average when more reward was available (Main effect of R 0 on mean RT: β = −0.06, 95%CI = [−0.08, −0.04], t (9294) = −6.12, p < 0.001; Table S2 -Model 1; Fig. 3e), and when reward decayed faster after the green onset (Main effect of λ on mean RT: β = −0.04, 95%CI = [−0.05, −0.02], t (9294) = −3.82, p < 0.001;


constraints (Negative main effect of impulsivity score on mean RT: β = −0.10, 95%CI = [−0.18, −0.01], t (9282) = −2.28, p = 0.023; Table S2 -Model 2; Fig. 3a-b). In addition, their average RT was more influenced by the duration of the amber light of the current trial (Interaction Impulsivity score × a n : β = −0.05, 95%CI = [−0.09, −0.01], t (9282) = −2.46, p = 0.014;Table S2-Model 2;Fig. 3a-b). This suggests that more impulsive individuals were faster not because of shorter sensorimotor delays (see alsoSupplementary Resultsfor an absence of relationship between impulsivity and simple reaction time) but instead because of a greater tendency to anticipate the green onset. None of the other interactions with experimental factors were significant for neither impulsivity nor apathy(Table S2-Model 2;Fig. 3a).


task progressed, the vigour of the response diminished (Main effect of log-transformed block on mean vigour: β = −0.19, 95%CI = [−0.24, −0.13], t (9293) = −6.24, p < 0.001; Table S4 -Model 1), likely due to a fatigue effect and/or a better estimation of force threshold required to trigger a response. Finally, and crucially, participants were energized to squeeze harder when more reward (£1 vs. £0.20) was available (Main effect of R 0 on mean vigour: β = 0.09, 95%CI = [0.07, 0.11], t (9293) = 8.68, p < 0.001; Table S4 -Model 1), an effect we interpreted as a marker of reward sensitivity. By contrast, the decay rate of reward or the interaction between these two factors had no significant influence on the vigour of the response (Main effect of λ on mean vigour: β = −0.01, 95%CI = [−0.03, 0.01], t (9293) = −0.61, p = 0.54; Interaction R 0 × λ : β = 0.00, 95%CI = [−0.01, 0.01], t (9293) = 0.20, p = 0.84; Table S4 -Model 1). Thus, in summary, the vigour of the response was influenced by: (1) surprising amber foreperiod duration, (2) task-practice, and (3) the magnitude of reward available(Fig. 4).Next, we asked whether apathy or impulsivity interacted with any of these three effects. Adding the questionnaire-derivedscores to the LMM (LMM S7) revealed that the severity of apathy was associated with a weaker energization by reward (Interaction Apathy score × R 0 : β = −0.02, 95%CI = [−0.03, 0.00], t (9287) = −2.01, p = 0.044; Table S4 -Model 2; Fig. 4a). In other words, more apathetic individuals showed less evidence of increased subjective utility when the magnitude of the objective reward available increased. Follow-up parcellation of this result into the individual sub-scales of the AMI questionnaire revealed that it was predominantly driven by emotional apathy (Interaction AMI-emotional × R 0 : β = −0.02, Most impulsive participants (n = 30) Least impulsive participants (n = 30) Most apathetic participants (n = 30) Least apathetic participants (n = 30)

Apparatus Behavioural testing took place in a quiet room with only the participant and the experimenter present. All tasks were presented on a 17-inch touchscreen PC using MATLAB version 2018 (MathWorks; https://uk.mathworks.com) and Psychtoolbox 78 (version 3). Force responses were recorded using a dynamometer (SS25LA, BIOPAC Systems) held in the dominant hand.


: 4.87 min, s.d.: 0.34 min). To limit the cognitive load, the reward decay rate (animal) was held constant for the first and second half of each block, and changed only once, half-way through the block (after 26 trials). It alternated in a "AB-BA" fashion over a two-block period with half of the participants (15 females, 15 males) starting with the quick decay condition (FS-SF-FS-SF-FS-SF-FS-SF), and the other half starting with the slow decay condition (SF-FS-SF-FS-SF-FS-SF-FS). The amount of reward available (£1 or £0.20), by contrast, varied randomly on a trial-by-trial basis. All blocks included the same number of each trial type although in different order. Control tasks for (1) simple RT, (2) anticipatory abilities, and (3) time discrimination are described and analysed in Supplementary Information.

27% of the data excluded). The variation of average RT over successive blocks was used as a measure of predictive learning. A linear mixed-effect model (LMM) showed that the average RT improved over successive blocks (Main effect of log-transformed Block on block-averaged RT: β = −0.10, 95%CI = [−0.16, −0.03], t (478) = −2.87, p = 0.0042; Table S9 -Model 1; Fig. S3).

That is, greater Apathy scores were associated with faster reduction of mean RT over successive blocks in the Predictive Control Task. After squeezing the dynamometer, participants indicated when they thought they responded in comparison to when they should have responded. The position of the cursor they placed allowed us to calculate an "estimated RT" in relation to the theoretical green onset. The relationship between the estimated and actual RT gave us an measure of metacognitive abilities, i.e. how well individuals could perceive/report their own performance. On average, there was a good agreement between actual and estimated RT (both RT and estimated RT z-scored withinindividuals; slope: β = 0.49, 95%CI = [0.38, 0.52], t (4545) = 12.41, p < 0.001), indicating accurate metacognition. Adding

Model comparison was carried out with Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), summed across all individual datasets. This model selection method was chosen for its stringent penalisation of model complexity. The introduction of a probabilistic activation of the anticipatory process induced a large explanatory gain compared to the original two-horse model (Reference model 2 vs. Reference model 1: ∆BIC = −1, 117.03; Fig. S5a). Further, compared to simpler, context-insensitive reference models, incorporating a sensitivity to task statistics, practice and cost-benefit structure provided a better account of the data (lower BIC in Models 1-27 relative to Reference models 1-2; Fig. S5a). Overall, the winning model (lowest BIC score; Model 4 vs. Reference Model 1: ∆BIC = −7, 076.87; Model 4 vs. Model 17:

was a clear monotonic increase in block-averaged ratings as a function of task progression (Main effect of block on block-averaged fatigue rating: β = 0.28, 95%CI = [0.20, 0.38], t (478) = 6.17, p < 0.001; Fig. S9a). Concurrently, and as reported in the main text, the average vigour of the response gradually diminished (Main effect of log-transformed block on block-averaged vigour: β = −0.19, 95%CI = [−0.25, −0.12], t (478) = −5.61, p < 0.001), while participants learnt to harvest more reward per trial (Main effect of log-transformed block on block-averaged earnings: β = 0.39, 95%CI = [0.32, 0.46], t (478) = 10.72, p < 0.001; Fig. S9a). A LMM was used to investigate the extent to which block-averaged fatigue ratings co-varied with time-on-task, force exerted (block-averaged vigour), and reward obtained (block-averaged), while controlling for baseline (pre-TLT) fatigue (LMM S8). Higher fatigue was associated with longer time-on-task (Main effect of time-on-task on fatigue ratings: β = 0.34, 95%CI = [0.23, 0.45], t (475) = 6.02, p < 0.001; Table S6; Fig. S9) and greater force exertion (Main effect of block vigour on fatigue ratings: β = 0.08, 95%CI = [0.01, 0.15], t (475) = 2.33, p = 0.020; Table S6; Fig. S9). By contrast, fatigue showed a negative association with reward (Main effect of block earnings on fatigue ratings: β = −0.07, 95%CI = [−0.12, −0.02], t (475) = −2.68, p = 0.0076;
