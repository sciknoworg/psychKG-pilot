You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Background
Lexical abilities are fundamental in language proficiency, and they undergo considerable changes across the lifespan. Our vocabulary expands as we grow up and grow older, and this can bring about changes in lexical organization and in the efficiency of lexical access. Additionally, age-related shifts in general cognitive mechanisms may also affect the ability to access words. These shifts may follow different trajectories from childhood to adulthood and from adulthood to old age, and each phase can affect different aspects of the lexicon across the lifespan.
Aging is associated with slower lexical access and retrieval in older participants. Previous research has generally tied this to the broader concept of cognitive decline. This work has argued that, after a certain age, we will likely find a range of cognitive tasks more difficult, including lexical access (e.g. 
Salthouse 1996a
Salthouse , 2014a
. More recent work argues that this observed slow-down is due to language experience rather than age per se. That is, older speakers are slower at lexical access because they have more language experience and larger vocabularies and consequently need to sieve through more lexical structure during lexical access than younger speakers 
(Ramscar et al., 2014
). Whether we interpret the observed decrease in speed for lexical access as a sign of decline or experience has broader ramifications as average life expectancy keeps increasing and more and more people live to old age in the West 
(Giles et al., 2021)
. Despite this, work on the joint effects of age and vocabulary size on lexical access across a wide age range from childhood to old age has been relatively scant. We aim to address what we see as an understudied question in this study.
The purpose of this study is to explore how age and vocabulary size interact to influence age-related changes in lexical access and to disentangle their relative contributions to these changes in a lexical decision task. Our main questions are: do age and vocabulary size independently affect ease of lexical access across the lifespan? Is one factor modulated by the other (such that age is more important when you have a smaller vocabulary size, or vice versa)? How does this interact with the relative ease of access for individual words, shaped by their familiarity or frequency?


Age effects
Studies of developmental changes in lexical abilities either focus on differences between children of different ages and adults or investigate the effect of aging by comparing younger and older adults. While vocabulary growth has been well documented in children up to adulthood based on standardized tests (e.g. 
Dunn 2007;
Wechsler 2012)
, consequential changes in the efficiency of lexical access received limited attention. One notable exception is a study by Moret-Tatay and Perea (2011), who found faster response times in fourth-graders than in second graders in a lexical decision task. Since fourth-graders are better readers, overall, than second-graders, faster lexical decision times may stem from larger experience in visual word recognition, a more expansive and structured vocabulary, or a combination of both factors. 
Schröter and Schroeder (2017)
 find comparable results for Germanspeaking elementary school children.
Results on aging in adults are controver-sial: older speakers complain increasingly about word finding difficulties and experimental studies yield conflicting findings of stability 
(Singh-Manoux et al., 2012)
, growth (e.g. 
Balota et al. 2007
; 
Kavé and Halamish 2015;
Keuleers et al. 2015
) and decline 
(Carroll et al., 2016;
Hartshorne and Germine, 2015;
Kavé and Halamish, 2015;
Salthouse, 2014b;
Verhaeghen, 2003)
. The majority of findings show that some aspects of lexical skills are vulnerable to aging: while a decline in accuracy may not be observed in lexical decision tasks, such a decline is present in word recall in definitions and fluency tasks. Age-related changes are especially apparent and most prominent in slower access times in older than in younger adults both in naming (see 
Mortensen et al. 2006
 for a review) and in lexical decision tasks (e.g. 
Allen et al. 1991;
Carroll et al. 2016;
Kavé and Halamish 2015)
.
To summarise, growing up brings improvements in lexical abilities both in accuracy and efficiency, while growing old has controversial effects in both, with several results pointing to decline. Variation in the ease of lexical access is also observed not only as a function of age, but also as a function of general cognitive skills and vocabulary size, which are not independent of age. Agerelated slowing in lexical decision times has been empirically linked to changes in general cognitive skills, including slower processing speed and/or declining memory and executive functions (see e.g. Salthouse 1996a).


Vocabulary size effects
Individuals with larger vocabularies have had greater exposure to words and more experience with word retrieval. This can potentially result in faster and more efficient lexical access 
(Keuleers et al., 2015)
. With repeated exposure, processing becomes more efficient, and the retrieval of words may become proceduralized, making the retrieval process faster and more automatic 
(Perfetti and Hart, 2001;
Ullman, 2004
Ullman, , 2020
. As-suming that practice comes with exposure, a speaker with a larger vocabulary will have an easier time identifying a wider range of forms in a lexical decision task. In line with these suggestions, in studies of bilingualism and second language learning, participants are faster in lexical decision tasks in their L1 than in their L2, which is likely explained by larger vocabulary size in language 1 versus language 2 
(Brysbaert et al., 2017)
. While word frequency generally faciliates lexical access 
(Brysbaert et al., 2011)
, 
Diependaele et al. (2013)
 found that participants with more language experience show a smaller word frequency effect because, as they argue, all words in their lexicon are more entrenched, and their stronger representations are easier to access.


Age, experience, and vocabulary size in lexical decision
As we have seen above, elderly participants tend to be slower at a range of psychometric tasks, including the lexical decision task 
(Allen et al., 1991)
. 
Ramscar et al. (2014)
 argue that is the result of more language experience, richer linguistic representations, and a larger vocabulary. This account goes against models of aging effects on lexical access cited in the previous section and results from second language learning (which show that more language experience results in faster lexical access in a language). If a larger vocabulary helps second language learner respondents in the lexical decision task, it should similarly facilitate access in older respondents. These divergent predictions can be reconciled through the simultaneous analysis of vocabulary size and lexical decision times through different age groups. Lexical decision times reflect ease of access for specific word forms, which is influenced by word-level and individual-level factors. Word level factors include the word's structure and length, and, most relevantly for our paper, for real words, the word's average lexical strength, approximated by fre-quency of use/familiarity and linguistic distribution 
(Grainger, 1990;
Yap et al., 2015)
. Individual-level factors are the richness and depth of the respondent's lexical representation 
(Yap et al., 2012)
. Word-level effects, and, in particular, effects of lexical strength are demonstrated in multiple languages including French, Spanish, Chinese, and Hindi 
(Aguasvivas et al., 2018;
Ferrand et al., 2010;
Nemati et al., 2022;
Tse et al., 2017;
Verma et al., 2021)
. Age and vocabulary size might affect both word-level and individual-level factors. 
Balota and Chumbley (1984)
 model lexical decision tasks as a combination of two distinct processes: accessing the target form and discriminating the target form from other existing forms. Data on word-level effects in lexical decision support this: participants respond faster to a word target if the word is frequent (easier to access) and has fewer lexical neighbors (easier to discriminate; see 
Table 1
). This is, in turn, affected by age: older speakers show a stronger effect of frequency and a weaker effect of neighborhood density 
(Spieler and Balota, 2000)
.
In English, a word like 'go' is very frequent and has few lexical neighbors (especially in terms of its orthography) so it is easy to access and easy to discriminate. A word like 'table' is also frequent and familiar, but it has many close lexical neighbors which makes it easy to access and hard to discriminate. A word like 'aardvark' is infrequent but has few neighbors so it is hard to access and easy to discriminate. Finally, a word like 'gable' is infrequent and it has a lot of neighbors so it is hard to access and hard to discriminate.
Subsequent work has suggested a more complex picture of lexical access, both through the lifespan (Cohen-Shikora and 
Balota, 2016)
 and across different individuals 
(Wulff et al., 2022)
, but this model remains a starting point for predictions on the effect of vocabulary size and word familiarity on response times in lexical access.
In lexical processing, slower lexical decision times may signal greater difficulties  in two things: either in accessing the target form or in discriminating it from other words (or both). According to the Temporal Dynamics Hypothesis of 
Burke et al. (1991)
, the connections between lexical nodes deteriorate over time, which leads to the kinds of difficulties in word retrieval that are commonly observed in older populations. Such a deterioration may also affect lexical decision times 
(Carroll et al., 2016)
. Taking a different perspective, 
Ratcliff et al. (2004)
 suggest that decision processes in older respondents operate with more conservative criteria, resulting in longer response times in a range of decision tasks, including lexical decision. Although these approaches posit different underlying causes, both put forward factors that explain a decline in lexical access in old age and point to a complex interaction of multiple factors influencing age-related changes in lexical skills.
The other possibility, of course, is that older speakers might also have a harder time discriminating the target form from similar forms (its lexical neighbors), simply because they know more words and have richer lexical representations. This idea is central to the discriminative learning model of age effects on lexical decision 
(Ramscar et al., 2014)
, which asserts that a more complex individual lexical representation results in harder lexical discrimination, yielding slower lexical decision. This approach is based the observation that older speakers have larger vocabularies, at least when tested using standard vocabulary tests with the proviso that at least some of the age effects are due to more time spent in education, rather than aging in general 
(Gerstenberg, 2015;
Verhaeghen, 2003
).
There is consensus in the literature that aging is associated with slower lexical access; however, the reasons for this remain a subject of substantial debate. Some attribute it to a general slowing-down that affects various cognitive processes with advancing age, suggesting a broad, non-specific effect on cognitive functions. In line with these suggestions, others argue that low speed and problems in lexical access might result from weakening connections between nodes within the lexicon due to deteriorative neural changes. Older participants may also apply more conservative decision criteria. In a contrasting view, the major source of slower decision times is the size of the lexicon: increased difficulty in discrimination is a by-product of larger and / or more complex vocabularies accumulated over the years.
To investigate the individual effects of age and vocabulary size and to examine their interactions, it is necessary to examine the effects simultaneously. If older people are slower in the lexical decision task because they have larger vocabularies, it should be generally true that people with larger vocabularies are slower in lexical decision, i.e. adults should be slower than children, and if the effects of vocabulary size are facilitative, that should be observed within one age group as well. If there is an independent age effect, younger adults should be faster in lexical decision than older ones, even if their vocabularies are exactly the same size.
Moreover, these effects might interact. Such interactions between age and vocabulary size in lexical decision have been understudied in the literature. The effect of age can be more prominent for speakers with larger or smaller vocabularies. The effect of vocabulary size may be especially relevant for speakers of a certain age. In addition, these might both factor in differently for words that are, in general, easier or harder to access and discriminate.
In this paper, we aim to disentangle the effects of age and vocabulary size on the speed of responses to visual word targets in a lexical decision task. To ensure large variability in both age and vocabulary size, we tested a large pool of participants in a wide age range (between 9-90 years). Instead of relying on word corpus frequency and standard vocabulary tests, we used novel, precalibrated familiarity measures of a word's lexical strength and the complexity of a respondent's lexical representations.
We had the following research questions: 


Methods


Design
We ran a visual lexical decision task online with Hungarian native speakers. Participants responded to 250 trials of written stimuli presented in random order. They were presented with letter strings that were either existing Hungarian words or nonsense words. They had to accept word forms that they recognised as familiar and reject word forms that were unfamiliar (these included unfamiliar existing words and nonsense words).
Responses 
('yes' or 'no')
 and response times were recorded for each trial.


Stimuli
The study design was strongly motivated by earlier work of Hintz and colleagues 
(Hintz et al., 2020a,b;
Wolf et al., 2021)
. We used real Hungarian words and non-words in the main experiment. 900 word forms were sampled from a frequency dictionary built from a web-crawled and morphologically disambiguated corpus of Hungarian 
(Nemeskey, 2020)
. A separate set of four hundred participants rated these words in a previous pilot experiment. We then used these ratings to create a filtered word list, which we split into 50 bins based on word familiarity. Details of the pilot experiment and the filtering process are included in the online supplement.
To compile a list of non-words, we used a spelling dictionary based on Szabó and Kovács (2018) with a low-frequency cutoff to generate ngram models of valid Hungarian forms. We used these models to generate words of varying length and then used the pilot ratings and hand-filtering to arrive at a list of 51 non-words.
The end result was a set of 250 items, with 199 real words split evenly across 50 familiarity bins complemented with 51 nonwords. The design had 200 words and 50 non-words, the imbalance resulted from a mistake in the script. Real words were singular nouns, adjectives, and canonical verb forms, containing 2 or 3 syllables. They each had a familiarity score between 1 and 50, based on word frequency and response rates from the pilot experiment. non-words matched real words in length and make-up, and were rated as sufficiently distinct from real words in the pilot experiment. For the full list of stimuli see the online supplement.
Hungarian uses consistent orthography and relies more on compounds than borrowings, compared to English. As a result, word frequency is an imperfect proxy of word familiarity. Our aim was to aggregate over effects of frequency, lexical access, and lexical discriminability, which go into the decisions of our baseline raters, and use these ratings as a basis of a complex word familiarity measure.
This measure allows us to test the predictions of theories of lexical access and aging, namely, whether vocabulary size results in faster responses (due to ease of access), slower responses (due to harder discrimination), and how this is mediated by age.


Participants
507 participants completed the main experiment. After filtering, 475 participants were retained in analysis (between the ages of 9 and 90, 86 men). Data were collected online in 2021-22.
Participation was voluntary, participants either received course credit (if they were university students) or no compensation. Participant demographics can be seen in 
Table  2
.
The study was approved by XXX (ethics approval goes here in named version).


Procedure
Participants completed the task on their home computers. The experiment did not work on tablets and mobile phones. Each participant saw each of the 250 trials once in a random order. The task of the participants was to respond with 'yes' by pressing the right arrow on the keyboard if the letter string they saw was a familiar word, to say 'no' by pressing the left arrow if the letter string was not a familiar word. The task was set up with two practice trials, one with a common Hungarian word that participants were expected to say 'yes' to by pressing the right arrow on the keyboard, and a nonexistent form that they were expected to say 'no' to. The correct answer for the practice trials was spelt out in the instructions. The main experiment was coded in jspsych (De Leeuw, 2015) and run online on Pavlovia 
(Peirce et al., 2019)
.
The main experiment followed the practice trials. Each stimulus was displayed upon a button press (response to the previous stimulus) after a 500ms delay. Participants were instructed to be as fast and accurate as possible.


Outcome and predictor variables
Our main analysis focused on response times of 'yes' responses to existing words in the experiment. Our outcome variable was untransformed response time in each trial, following 
Lo and Andrews (2015)
. The data set included 72782 'yes' answers from 475 participants to 199 existing words. We calculated participant vocabulary size based on participant accuracy (see below). Our predictors were the participant's age, the participant's vocabulary size score, and word familiarity. We included word familiarity because it was not a priori clear whether age and vocabulary size effects are mediated by word familiarity (such that e.g. the vocabulary size effect is smaller for more familiar words and larger for less familiar ones etc.). Word familiarity ranged from a score of 1 (highly unfamiliar, examples: diffamál 'to slander', krakéler 'roisterer') to 50 (highly familiar, examples: pohár 'glass', extrém 'extreme'). It was established based on the pilot experiment.
Participant vocabulary size was established as follows. Each participant responded to non-words and real words. As described above, real words were distributed across pre-established familiarity bins (from 1, least familiar, to 50, most familiar). Based on participants' yes and no responses, we identified the highest familiarity bin in which the participant did not know more than one real word.
Here is an example. Bin 6, a relatively unfamiliar bin, has four real words: glosszáz 'to gloss', libling 'favorite', magmatit 'mag-age group: 
09-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69 70-79 80-90   women  64  195  39  32  26  11  12  9  men  39  13  2  1  8  13  10  0   Table 2
: Participant age and gender distributions in the lexical decision task, after filtering.
netite', viszonvád 'counter-accusation'. Bin 47, a relatively familiar bin, has barát 'friend', dolog 'thing', törékeny 'fragile', karakter 'character'. Participant A might say 'no' to magmatit and libling and glosszáz.
We check that hasn't happened in bins 7-50, where they only rejected one word per bin at most. Participant B might say 'no' to both barát and dolog (no actual participant did this). This means they rejected more than one word in bin 47. We check that this hasn't happened in bins 48-50 meaning that 47 is the highest bin where they did this. Note that participants see words in random order. Participant A might have responded to magmatit in trial 1, trial 250, or anywhere in between. For more detail, see the online supplement.
As a first approximation, this would mean that Participant A has a vocabulary size of 7 and Participant B, 48. For the sake of legibility, we want a higher number to express a larger vocabulary size, so we subtract these numbers from 51 to get the final vocabulary score: 43 for Participant A and 2 for Participant B. This way, vocabulary size mirrors word familiarity on a scale of 1-50.


Modelling
The extent to which participant vocabulary size, age, and word familiarity explain variation in trial response time (lexical decision time) in the experiment was modeled using Generalized Additive Modeling (GAM) 
(Wood 2003;
2017)
 with thin plate regression splines for smooth terms, and participant and word as grouping factors. Models were fit using maximum likelihood (ML) optimisation. The choice of the k parameter was verified by basic dimension checking. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and tests of the ML scores were used for model comparison. Since response counts across word and participant (the grouping factors) vary widely and since some words and participants have very few 'yes' responses, random slopes and factor smooths would have overfit the model, so we did not explore them. 
Table 3
 shows the ML scores and AIC values for each model, from most complex to least complex.
The best model includes a tensor product of participant age, vocabulary size, and word familiarity. Below, we report results from this model.
Note that participant age, vocabulary size, and word familiarity independently explain variation in our model. Removing any of them will result in a worse model fit.


Results
Participant vocabulary size, age, and relative word familiarity together predict response time in yes responses to existing words in a visual lexical decision task in our participant sample. The best model of our responses posits non-linear relationships between our predictors and response times. 
Figure 1
 shows the aggregate predicted effects of the three predictors: vocabulary size, age and word familiarity.
Predictor 1. Vocabulary size. Participants with larger vocabularies are, overall, faster in their 'yes' responses (left panel), with a steep drop in response time among those with smaller vocabularies compared to those with larger vocabularies. The amount of variation is higher for participants with very large vocabularies. This observation has two implications.  word familiarity (1−50) 
Figure 1
: Mean predicted response times (sec) by participant vocabulary size (left), participant age (middle), and word familiarity (right). The size of each observation indicates how many data the observation was aggregated from. A smaller circle / triangle represents a smaller number of observations for a data point (e.g. only a limited number of participants exhibited very small vocabulary sizes, resulting in mean calculations based on a smaller sample -conversely, only a few people knew words with very low familiarity). A large circle / triangle represents means from a larger number of participants (see e.g. the concentration of participants around 25 years of age). size score seems to be remarkably effective in predicting response times, especially on the lower end of the scale. Second, looking at 
Figure 3
 alone, it is difficult to determine whether participants with the highest vocabulary scores respond as quickly as those with slightly lower scores or if their response times are somewhat slower. Predictor 2. Age. Age has a nonlinear effect on decision times. Participants at the extremes of the age spectrum -very young individuals (9-14 years) and older adults ( > 65 years) -are slower than the middle age range of young and middle-aged adults (as shown in the middle panel of 
Figure 3)
.
Predictor 3. Word familiarity. Results show a linear effect of word familiarity: more familiar words are identified faster. However, there is an interaction between the three effects that is not apparent in the aggregated data for each individual effect. This interaction is displayed in 
Figure 2
. 
Figure 2
 is a topography plot. Contours show response times, hills (brown-yellow) represent slower responses, valleys (green) display fast responses. Each panel shows one range of word familiarity, from 1-6 (bottom left) to 44-50 (top right). Overall, as word familiarity increases, the panels get greener: participants respond faster to more familiar words. In each panel, the horizontal axis represents participant age, while the vertical axis indicates the size of the participant's vocabulary. Some combinations of age and vocabulary size are not attested in our sample: Only children and a small number of older adults have vocabularies that are smaller in size than size 20. Children under 14 and adults over 65 are slower than the rest of the sample. These differences are more apparent in participants with smaller vocabularies and/or in less familiar words. Overall, everyone responds to very familiar words with the same speed. In sum, there is a U-shaped polynomial effect of participant age that interacts with two largely linear effects, participant vocabulary size and word familiarity.
In order to have a better understanding of how the predictors act together on the outcome variable, response time, we break down this three-way interaction in four different ways in 
Figure 3
. 
Figure 3A
 has three panels. Each panel shows one age group, 14, 25, and 70, respectively, from left to right. The horizontal axis indicates participant vocabulary size, the vertical axis shows predicted response time. Only smooths depicting trend lines are shown, for three discretised levels of word familiarity, low (20), mid (30) and high (40). A larger participant vocabulary size translates to faster responses, but only for the younger and older groups (left-and righthand panels), not in the middle age range (middle panel). Responses to more familiar words are generally faster. As we noted above, participants who have small vocabularies (in the 10-20 range) have very few 'yes' answers and so their estimates are less reliable, as shown by the larger margin of error in the left-hand side of the middle panel. 
Figure 3B
 shows vocabulary size across panels and age on the horizontal axis. The trend lines for word familiarity are the same as in 4A. It shows that the age effect is modulated by vocabulary size. Among participants with relatively small vocabularies (lefthand panel), younger respondents are slower than the mean and older respondents are much slower, even more so than the younger ones. This trend is much weaker for participants with larger and largest vocabularies (middle and right-hand panel). 
Figure 3C
 shows word familiarity across panels and age on the horizontal axis (like 
Figure 3B
). The trend lines are for three different participant vocabulary sizes. Note that the trend lines are very similar across the panels. The age : vocabulary size effect is apparently largely the same when responding to words of low, mid, or high overall familiarity. This is largely independent of word-level effects. 
Figure 3D
 shows age across panels and word familiarity on the horizontal axis. The trend lines are for different participant vocabulary sizes. Word familiarity is more important in the responses of the younger and the older age group. This is shaped by participant vocabulary size: we see no such strong effect for older participants who had a small vocabulary.


Post hoc tests
The three main claims which emerge from the additive modelling analysis are that, for adults, (a) participant vocabulary size has a faciliating, (b) age, an impeding effect on response times to known words in lexical decision and (c) the age effect is mediated by vocabulary size: response times are less affected by age across participants with large vocabularies.
In order to quantify these claims, we refit the additive model as a linear mixed model on the data. We excluded participants under 19 to be able to focus on the negative trend in the age -response time relationship in our data. We fit a linear model to predict response times from participant age and vocabulary size, with a participant and word grouping factor. We centered predictor variables. Model selection used AIC, BIC, and likelihood ratio tests. The estimates of the best model can be seen in 
Table 4
. The overall, linear vocabulary effect tends negative (larger vocabulary means shorter response times), but the 95% confidence interval includes 0, if barely. The age effect is positive: older participants are slower. The interaction of vocabulary size and age is negative. This relationship is visualised in 
Figure 5
. 
Figure 5
 shows the predicted vocabulary size effect on response times in the linear model, spread across three age groups. We see that the youngest group (blue) have almost no effect of vocabulary size on response times. This effect is more and more prominent with increase in participant age: in the oldest group, participants with larger vocabularies are much faster.
We should note that the interaction has an elevated variance inflation factor in the model. We attribute this to the fundamental nonlinear structure of the data. We found similar patterns with residualised predictors, which, combined with the results of the additive model, make us more confident in the validity of the age : vocabulary interaction. In order to put these trajectories into context, we look at two aspects of our participant sample separately. These are education levels and processing speed.


Education effects
The analysis revealed a nonlinear association between participant age and vocabulary size. This relationship is likely further affected by the influence of education on language exposure and development. Given that higher levels of education generally correlate with a larger vocabulary size, the number of years each participant spent in education -data we collected from all participants -provides a check on how these factors interact. Education is mandatory until the age of 16 and most Hungarians in our sample will be expected to go to university. The amount of graduate and post-graduate education will vary. 
Figure 5
 shows the relationship between participant age, vocabulary size, and education. Participant vocabulary size increases with age until 23-25 (the end of graduate and post-graduate education for many). Beyond this point, however, vocabulary size stops increasing and variability becomes more pronounced. Consequently, our data suggest a less clear-cut correlation between age and vocabulary size in later adulthood.
A similar variability in years spent in education across age is indicated at the same inflection point. While the number of years spent in education keeps increasing up to 25 years of age, this trend goes away beyond this age. This is at least partly a reflection of the convenience sample in the study: all our participants in their twenties are university students, and the older adults vary more in   
Figure 4
: Predicted times drawn from a linear mixed model, across participant age (colour) and vocabulary size (horizontal axis), both scaled between 0 and 1. their backgrounds and levels of education.
The relationship between education and vocabulary size is a remarkably linear one. In effect, vocabulary size keeps increasing, but this growth is linked more closely to years spent in education rather than age per se. The distributions of education in the dataset might be partly shaped by sampling (our younger participants are all university students, people born earlier were less likely to go to university). Confirming previous findings, the patterns still suggest that education has a strong contribution to vocabulary size, which is independent of age.


Processing speed effects
Although testing the effect of processing speed on changes in lexical decision times was not among the aims of this study, processing speed data were available for 119 of our participants across a range of processing speed tasks, collected as part of a larger project (see XXXXXX). In this sub-sample, we wanted to see whether processing speed contributes to variation in lexical decision times in our main experiment, and whether the effect of age and vocabulary size are accounted for effects of processing speed. This subset of participants primarily sampled those under 20 and those over 40 and older. We used two processing speed measures, one from a simple visual task (detecting the image of a polka-dot ball on the screen) and a visual decision task (judging whether two visual grating plots have the same orientation). For each participant in our subset, we used the median response time values garnered from each processing speed task.
We extracted the predictions from the tensor product term in our main model (participant age : participant vocabulary size : word familiarity). We then fit a linearised mixed model 
(Bates et al., 2015)
 predicting untransformed response time for correct 'yes' answers in our main task from the model term prediction as well as the two visual processing speed measures, the simple visual task and the visual decision task, with a participant and a word grouping factor. If the measures from the two processing speed tasks are able to explain variation in the response times above and beyond our tensor product, that means that processing speed accounts for some of the patterns in participant response times above and beyond our usual suspects, age, vocabulary size, and word familiarity. We used likelihood ratio tests to test whether each predictor significantly improved model fit. We found that predictions from our main model improved fit in the new model (X 2 = 276.5, p < 0.001). The same was true, though to a considerably smaller degree, for visual decision task speed (X 2 = 4.16, p < 0.05). In contrast, simple visual task speed did not improve model fit (X 2 = 2.91, p = 0.09). Within the best model, visual decision task speed showed a positive correlation with response times in the main task 
(est = .27,
). These results indicate that processing speed contributes to variations in participants' response times, independently of age, vocabulary size, and word familiarity.


Discussion
In this study, we aimed to explore how age and vocabulary size influence ease of lexical access in a lexical decision task. We intro-duced two novel aspects of our design to address these questions. First, to achieve considerable variability in both age and vocabulary size, we included a large and diverse participant pool covering a wide age spectrum, ranging from 9 to 90 years. This allowed us to tackle changes in lexical processes across nearly the entire human lifespan. Second, parting with traditional methods that depend on word corpus frequency and standard vocabulary tests, we employed a novel, calibrated measure for assessing the lexical strength of words and vocabulary size. Taken together, these innovations enabled us to examine and disentangle the effects of age and vocabulary size.
We used Generalized Additive Modeling 
(Wood, 2003
(Wood, , 2017
, to model how participant vocabulary size, age, and word familiarity contributed to the variations observed in lexical decision times during our experiment. Since it was likely that all relevant predictors will be non-linear, we modeled response times of 'yes' answers to existing words as a tensor product smooth of word familiarity, participant vocabulary size, and participant age. We found that the most effective model for explaining response times incorporated an interaction between all three predictors: participant vocabulary size, age, and word familiarity. This finding points to the joint influence of these factors on lexical decision times, and suggests that they operate in a complex interaction, where each predictor's effect is modulated by the others.
We found that (1) participant vocabulary size is a reliable predictor of response times to visual word targets, and its effect is largely linear in participant samples that are homogeneous with respect to age. The influence of vocabulary size on response speed varies across different age groups. Younger 
9-14
and older (65+) participants respond faster to real word targets if they have larger vocabularies. However, between the ages of 20 and 25 (for the bulk of our sample) vocabulary size proved to be a less decisive factor in determining response times.
In line with previous results, (2) participant age is a significant predictor of lexical decision times. Younger (9-14) and older (65+) participants are slower than young and middle-aged adults. This is a U-shaped relationship between age and lexical decision speed, with the quickest responses typically found in the young and middle-age adult groups.
Our older participants were slower. This trend persisted even after accounting for vocabulary size, which itself had an independent facilitating effect on lexical decision speed. The observation that older participants are slower challenges the assumption that a larger vocabulary naturally results in faster lexical access. Slower response times might result from inherent difficulties in word retrieval 
(Burke et al., 1991)
 or more conservative decision criteria 
(Ratcliff et al., 2004)
 They can also be at least partly accounted for by age related changes in processing speed and working memory, which follow the same developmental trajectory, and variation in these function is associated with changes in lexical retrieval (e.g. Salthouse 1996b) In a subsample of our participants, processing speed in general did account for at least some of the variation observed in lexical decision times. However, participant age and vocabulary size were considerably more robust predictors of response times, and their contribution to explaining variation in the efficiency of lexical access was not accounted for by differences in inde-pendent measures of processing speed.
Regarding the age-related effects observed in our study, they might support the findings of 
Spieler and Balota (2000)
, who noted that older speakers are more influenced by word frequency and less by neighborhood density in lexical decision tasks. Our results indicate that older participants generally have slower response times. This overall decrease in speed could disproportionately impact their responses to less familiar words, potentially amplifying the difference in response times between frequently encountered words and less frequent ones, yielding a larger frequency effect. As for the diminished effect of neighborhood density observed among older participants, this could also be a consequence of their universally slower responses. When response times are longer across the board, the distinctions in speed due to varying neighborhood densities might become less pronounced or obscured, leading to what appears as a weaker effect of this factor in older individuals.
Participants who knew more words were faster. This pattern could be attributed to more effective lexical organization, greater practice, and consequently, more efficient retrieval of lexical items. However, it is noteworthy that this facilitating effect of vocabulary size appears to diminish among participants in the middle-age range. This observation may suggest that the benefits of an extensive vocabulary on processing speed are not uniformly experienced across all ages, but it could also be the byproduct of our biased sampling: vocabulary sizes are less variable in this age group than towards the ends of the age spectrum.
Facilitating effects of vocabulary size are open to different interpretations in terms of ease of access and discrimination 
(Balota and Chumbley, 1984)
. They are in line with results showing that lexical entrenchment due to larger proficiency results in faster access (and reduced effects of frequency/familiarity, 
Diependaele et al. 2013)
. First, it may be that low-familiarity words are subjectively more familiar to people with high vocabulary, and for them, they are much easier to access. Also, while it is likely that a more densely populated lexical similarity space translates to harder discrimination, at the same time, more entrenched lexical representation are more precise, and can facilitate discrimination. Overall, the advantage given by larger vocabulary size in lexical access is consistently larger than its increased costs in lexical discrimination, and a larger vocabulary translates to faster responses in lexical decision.
Measures of vocabulary size have been criticized for undersampling the right tail of the vocabulary distribution (types with very low frequency, see 
Ramscar et al. 2014)
. It is also true that different tests paint a different picture of how vocabulary size changes into old age: ours says vocabulary size does not increase into old age 
(Figure 1)
, 
Keuleers et al. (2015)
 find that it levels off, while Verhaeghen (2003) find a decrease of vocabulary size into old age, for some of the measures. We still think our particular measure is a good tool to map differences in vocabulary size, on three grounds. First, it uses an aggregate measure that is less sensitive to the knowledge of specific words. Second, it correlates robustly with age from childhood to adulthood, where we expect main gains in lexical knowledge. Third, it correlates with response times. Larger vocabulary, as established by our measure, is associated with faster lexical decision not just in the entire sample, but within different age groups as well. In line with previous results, these findings show that language experience, expressed in this study by vocabulary size, goes some way in explaining variation in response times in lexical access.
Our results also highlighted the divergent trajectories of the effect of age and vocabulary size. While a larger vocabulary is typically beneficial for response times, aging seems to have an opposing effect, slowing down decision times regardless of vocabulary size. This finding is particularly interesting as it challenges the notion that age-related slowdowns in lexical decision tasks are primarily due to increased language experience, which would presumably be associated with a larger vocabulary. One alternative explanation is that vocabulary size and age measure different facets of participant vocabulary in our data. This would open up the interpretation of this interaction to considerable degree and could be an important avenue for future research.


Limitations
Ours is an online study, and while the format is known to provide reliable response times 
(Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2020)
, it also places environmental factors outside our control. One main such factor is equipment. It is entirely speculative but possible that older participants had slower computer setups (such as outdated web browsers, lower cycle-count processors or worse quality peripheries) and this contributed to their experience in the experiment, which, in turn, affected response times. Word familiarity ratings come from a pilot experiment which relied on different participants from the same student pool that provided the bulk of the sample in the main experiment, but younger and older speakers were not represented in the pilot and did not contribute to the word ratings. We report response times for accurate 'yes' responses -we only consider participant accuracy in the aggregate using our vocabulary size measure, which is built on top of 'yes' and 'no' responses in the main task.
Our word familiarity measure is built on a large-scale rating task, providing ecological validity. An important alternative would be, however, to dissect the various aspects of word familiarity in our data set, such as word frequency, lexical neighbourhood size, or semantic transparency, and how these relate to participant-level predictors like age and vocabulary size (see e.g. 
Lim et al. 2020
.
The trend we see might be due to the particular characteristics of our participant pool, influenced by our use of a convenience sampling method. The majority of our participants were 20-25 year olds, mostly university students, yielding a relatively homogeneous sample. Older participants, on the other hand, showed greater variability in the number of years spent in education, and, consequently, in vocabulary size. The effects of vocabulary size, age, and word familiarty are very hard to disentangle not just from educational levels but also from other social and cognitive factors 
(Kidd et al., 2018;
Siegelman et al., 2017)
 which can affect task performance in a myriad ways. A representative sample would go some ways in addressing these issues.


Future directions
Further studies are required to clarify how individual differences and age-related changes in processing speed and working memory contribute to the observed differences across both individuals and age in lexical decision times. Such studies would not only clarify the mechanisms behind the slower lexical access in older adults but may also contribute to better understanding individual differences in lexical skills.
In addition, future research should aim to diversify participant demographics, including a broader range of social and educational backgrounds in each age group. Such studies should investigate the interplay between socioeconomic status, educational experiences, age, and vocabulary size more thoroughly. Additionally, longitudinal studies tracking individuals over time could offer deeper insights into how age and educational experiences influence lexical skills at various life stages.
While our results concerning the effects of age and vocabulary effects offer clear and novel insights, they do little to explain the reasons behind these intriguing patterns. The specific demographic composition of our sample can explain some of the peculiarities of the findings, but these also point to a more fundamental change in language processing that occurs during middle age and into old age. Our study design does not allow us to determine the processes that drive ageand vocabulary size related changes, and to decide whether they are due to differences in lexical organization, in practice, or in the efficiency of retrieval mechanisms. Future research could explore these individual factors directly, together with examining the effects of individual differences in cognitive factors on lexical skills in greater depth.


Conclusion
We demonstrated that age and vocabulary size both play a significant role in influencing lexical decision times, showing non-linear effects modulated by word familiarity. Our findings suggest that lexical processing efficiency in older adults cannot be solely attributed to cognitive decline but must also consider the impact of a large vocabulary acquired over a lifetime: older participants are slower in a visual lexical decision task, but this is attenuated by a large vocabulary. Taken together, our results go a long way in disentangling age and vocabulary size effects on lexical access and underline the importance of further work to ascertain the role of access and discrimination in lexical decision.
