You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Human organizations, like human societies, are almost universally defined by social hierarchy. Hierarchy necessitates inequality, and inequality creates potential for interpersonal conflict. In navigating social hierarchy, people inevitably engage in social comparison processes 
(Festinger, 1954;
Garcia, Tor, & Schiff, 2013)
, leading to the experience of personal relative deprivation for some: anger and frustration in response to perceiving that one is unfairly disadvantaged relative to others 
(Smith, Pettigrew, Pippin, & Bialosiewicz, 2012)
. The three components of personal relative disadvantage-social comparison, perceived unfairness/injustice, and a negative emotional reaction 
(Smith et al., 2012
)-together index sensitivity to being victimized by inequality 
(Callan et al., 2008;
Smith & Huo, 2014)
.
The experience of personal relative deprivation has been associated with numerous potentially harmful outcomes, including increased risk-taking, gambling, and delay discounting 
(Callan, Ellard, Shead, & Hodgins, 2008;
Mishra & Novakowski, 2016)
; poorer mental and physical health 
(Beshai, Mishra, Meadows, Parmar, & Huang, 2017;
Beshai, Mishra, Mishra, & Carleton, 2017;
Mishra & Carleton, 2015)
; and diminished prosociality 
(Callan, Kim, Gheorghiu, & Matthews, 2017;
Zhang, Liu, & Tian, 2016)
. Put simply, the experience of personal relative deprivation is associated with damaged social relationships, increased risk-taking and antisocial behavior, reduced cooperation, and increased interpersonal conflict. These findings are consistent with research more broadly linking inequality with a wide range of deleterious social effects in social collectives 
(Wilkinson & Pickett, 2011)
.
Social collectives in the form of small groups are fundamental to human organization.
However, surprisingly little is known about how the (ubiquitous) social comparison experience of personal relative deprivation influences group dynamics. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we examined if individual differences in personal experience of relative deprivation (resulting RELATIVE DEPRIVATION IN GROUPS 4 from comparison to other group members) reduced engagement in a university-level classroom group decision-making exercise with tangible stakes (i.e., significant attached grades). Given growing evidence that personal relative deprivation is associated with a wide array of damaging social outcomes, we predicted that the experience of personal relative deprivation would be associated with lower engagement with one's social collective in a small group context.


Method


Participants
Of 192 undergraduates in a first-year business course who participated in this study, 150 completed all variables of interest (37% female, Mage = 21.9, SD = 5.1). Informed consent was obtained for all participants. Post-hoc power analysis indicated 80% power to detect an effect of R 2 = 0.12 with 10 predictors. Data and materials are available at https://osf.io/6r8xc/. Analyses were conducted in R 3.6.0 (R Core Team, 2019). Additional sample and methodological details are provided in Appendix S1.
Students were randomly assigned to groups of four-to-six participants. In a class exercise, each group had to reach a consensus decision in a hypothetical product recall scenario. Each group member was assigned one of six roles with specific instructions: human resources manager, risk manager, production manager, plant controller, engineering manager, or marketing manager (see Appendix S2). Participants first read the instructions, then all participants assigned to a specific role were given verbal instructions. Students were given one hour to deliberate and reach a decision.
The exercise was designed such that roles had competing interests and a consensus would be hard to reach. Consensus was considered achieved when all group members recorded an identical (signed) decision outcome. Not all groups achieved consensus. After the exercise was complete, the survey below was distributed and completed individually.


Measures
Additional measures administered but not addressed in the present paper are included in Supplement B.


Personal relative deprivation. The five-item Personal Relative Deprivation Scale,
Revised (PRDS-R) assesses feelings of deprivation, resentment, and anger in response to perceived inequality. We adapted the scale to specifically reference group members (e.g., "I felt deprived when I thought about what I had compared to the other group members"). Participants responded using a seven-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree).
Group competition. On a seven-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree), participants indicated agreement with the following statements/questions: (1) "There was an imbalance of power in the group" and (2) "To what extent do you feel that you were competing with the other group members?". Each item was investigated separately.
Attitudes toward group experiences. Participants rated: (1) their agreement with the objective of their role; (2) how stressful they found the group activity; (3) how valuable they found the group activity; and (4) how seriously they took the exercise. Each rating was provided on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). All items were investigated separately.
Group engagement. To assess overall group engagement, we created a compound variable by averaging responses to the following three questions: (1) "How much of a role did you play in the final decision making?", (2) "Overall, how much did you participate in the exercise?", and (3) "Were you as vocal as you would have liked to be?". Responses were RELATIVE DEPRIVATION IN GROUPS 6 provided on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). This composite had good reliability, α = .86, 95% CI 
[.82, .89]
.


Results
To determine if feelings of personal relative deprivation predicted group engagement beyond demographic and exercise-related variables, we entered the following items in a threeblock sequential regression analysis: 
1
 The sequential regression analysis 
(Table 1)
 showed demographic variables (Block 1) explained 3% of variance in engagement scores, F(3,146) = 1.63, p = .19, R 2 = .03; exerciserelated variables (Block 2) accounted for 46% of variance, F(6,140) = 20.90, p < .001, R 2 = .46.
Personal relative deprivation (Block 3) significantly predicted 9% of unique variance over and above the two previous blocks, F(1,139) = 28.63, p < .001, R 2 = .58. This finding suggests that feelings of relative deprivation are a unique and surprisingly strong predictor of group engagement in the present study. The overall model accounted for 58% of variance in group engagement scores. When all variables were entered simultaneously into a regression analysis, personal relative deprivation scores accounted for 17% of variance in group engagement (see Supplementary B, Table SB.1). Zero-sum correlations between all relevant variables are presented in 
Table 2
.


Discussion
We provide novel evidence that personal relative deprivation is significantly associated with diminished group engagement. Individual differences in personal relative deprivation strongly predicted group engagement (r = -.39; 
Funder & Ozer, 2019)
, and relative deprivation explained a meaningful amount of variance in group engagement above and beyond demographics and subjective assessments of the group context (9%). These assessments included subjects' role fit, whether the group task was stressful, valuable and/or taken seriously, and the perceived degree of competition and power imbalance within the group. Finally, personal relative deprivation explained 17% of variance in group engagement when entered in a simultaneous regression along with all group context-specific attitudes and perceptions. Taken together, evidence from this study suggests that personal relative deprivation is an underappreciated predictor of poorer social relations (and downstream consequences) in small groups.
Consistent with previous research, we found strong and consistent associations between personal relative deprivation and damaged social perceptions, relations, and outcomes. More specifically, those who report greater personal relative deprivation experience poorer outcomes in small group context. To date, surprisingly little research has examined the consequence of personal, subjective, and emotional reactions to inequality in group context. Some research has suggested that objective inequality in small groups leads to poorer social outcomes (e.g.,
Christine & Barling, 2010), but it is clear that further study of subjective, emotional processes in group dynamics is necessary.
The results of this study have some potentially important implications. Groups are regularly formed in schools and in industry to work together on projects, deliberate, or to make decisions. In these contexts, it is impossible to escape social comparison and its resultant RELATIVE DEPRIVATION IN GROUPS 8 emotional consequences, leading to poorer outcomes if left unchecked. These results make clear that individual members of social collectives are of consequence; for example, from our results we may predict that a jury may experience relatively greater engagement in deliberations if status differences were reduced. There is a growing awareness of the damaging effects of inequality and a consequent appetite for interventions that may ameliorate these damaging effects; our results provide further evidence that consideration of emotions tied to inequality, like personal relative deprivation, may be fruitful in these endeavors.
