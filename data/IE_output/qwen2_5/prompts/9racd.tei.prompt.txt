You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

damage the well-being of others (e.g., manipulation), or lack consideration for others (e.g., lying). While psychopathy has been notably associated to antisocial behavior in the past 
(Rose, Lynam, & Miller, 2023)
, we attempt to address two gaps in the literature: i) antisocial behavior has yet to be connected with the new factor-facet measure of the AFFM, ii) antisocial behavior is often operationalized inconsistently and incomprehensively and thus we aim to develop and test an omnibus measure of antisocial behavior.
. 
Saklofske & McKerracher (1978)
 suggest complications in predicting antisocial behavior may be the result of inconsistent operationalizations within the literature. As an example, the study of antisocial behavior has historically focused heavily on criminal populations and illegal behavior. Crime, in particular, is not an exhaustive operationalization of antisocial behavior because crime is committed for a variety of reasons other than psychopathology and many forms of antisocial behavior are not illegal 
(Andrade, 2008;
Skeem & Cooke, 2010)
. As 
Moffit (1993)
 asserts, "arrest statistics merely reflect the tip of the deviance iceberg" (p. 675).
In the present study, we test a new scale which addresses issues of content inclusion seen in other scales (e.g., crime and analogous behavior; CAB; 
Lynam, Whiteside, & Jones, 1999;
Miller & Lynam, 2003)
 which largely excluding behaviors marked by interpersonal antagonism (e.g., manipulation or lying). This measure is entirely behavioral in content while others (e.g., the subtypes of antisocial behavior; STAB; 
Burt & Donellan, 2009)
 include affective and comparative content (i.e., "felt like hitting people" & "got into fights more than the average person"). This methodology helps to justify the use of a new antisocial behavior scale as a test of criterion (rather than convergent/discriminant) validity for measures of personality.


The HEXACO Model
The HEXACO model was developed in response to a growing literature supporting a sixth "H factor" (Honesty/Humility) in lexical approaches, like the FFM, to personality structure 
(Ashton & Lee, 2008)
. The HEXACO diverges from the FFM in several ways; for example, anger content is reorganized within (inverse) agreeableness rather than neuroticism (relabeled as emotionality) 
(Weller & Tikir, 2011)
. As such, honesty/humility, agreeableness, and emotionality in the HEXACO model do not map directly onto the FFM. Conversely, extraversion, openness to experience, and conscientiousness are relatively comparable to their FFM counterparts 
(Ashton & Lee, 2005;
Bashiri et al., 2011;
Ludeke, 2019)
. Though the HEXACO model is largely similar to the FFM, we aimed to evaluate whether the reorganized content and introduction of a new factor would affect associations with criterion variables.


The Alternative Five-Factor Model
The AFFM was initially developed by 
Zuckerman (1991)
 in response to the influence of Hans Eysenck's three-factor personality model 
(Eysenck & Wilson, 1991)
 growing interest in the psychobiological approach to personality 
(Zuckerman, 1991)
, and research supporting fivefactor structures of general personality 
(Zuckermam, Kuhlman & Camac, 1988)
. The AFFM theorizes the presence of five personality factors; neuroticism, extraversion, activity, aggressiveness, and sensation-seeking. While the FFM takes a lexical approach to organizing and understanding individual differences, the AFFM is grounded in an evolutionary and biological theory, offering a causal explanation for personality. As evidence of this, factors within the AFFM have been linked to various biological markers such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and enzymes 
(Aluja & Torrubia, 2004;
Zuckerman, 1991
Zuckerman, , 2005
.
Neuroticism from the AFFM and FFM are closely related to each other, while extraversion from the AFFM is related to both extraversion (strongly) and openness to Personality, Risk, and Antisocial Behavior 7 experience (moderately) from the FFM 
(Aluja, Garcia, Garcia, 2002;
Aluja, Kuhlman, Zuckerman, 2010;
Garcia et al., 2011)
. Aggressiveness is related primarily to low agreeableness but also somewhat related with high neuroticism (FFM) while sensation-seeking is partially related to low conscientiousness, high extraversion, and high openness to experience in the FFM.
Activity scarcely relates to FFM factors but shows low associations with both extraversion and conscientiousness 
(Aluja, Garcia, Garcia, 2002;
Aluja, Kuhlman, Zuckerman, 2010;
Garcia et al., 2011)
.


Triarchic Model of Psychopathy
Psychopaths that are able to avoid incarceration and remain financially successful are often termed successful psychopaths 
(Gunschera, Brazil, & Driessen, 2022;
Lasko & Chester, 2021;
Palmen, Derksen & Kolthoff, 2018;
Person & Lilienfeld, 2019)
; they are considered difficult to evaluate in scientific settings due to their protective features (i.e., superficial adaptive functioning). In response, the triarchic model of psychopathy was proposed 
(Patrick, Fowles, & Krueger, 2009)
 to measure all features of psychopathymeanness, disinhibition and boldnessin aims to account for even successful psychopaths.
While meanness and disinhibition have been proposed as central components of psychopathy 
(Collison, Miller & Lynam, 2021;
Lynam & Miller, 2015;
Stanley, Wygant, & Sellbom, 2013
, Sellbom & Phillips, 2013
 boldness has been suggested as an important construct 
(Crego & Widiger, 2022;
Lilienfeld et al., 2018)
 that may distinguish between subtypes of psychopathy 
(Lynam & Miller, 2012;
Semel et al., 2021)
. Individuals scoring high in boldness or fearless-dominance (FD; comparable to boldness; 
Drislane, Patrick, & Arsal, 2014;
Hall et al., 2014;
Patrick et al., 2019;
Sellbom & Phillips, 2013)
 have reduced fear-potentiation, low reactivity to aversive stimuli, and deficient emotional attention 
(Anderson et al., 2011;
Benning, Patrick, & Iacono, 2005;
Blonigen et al., 2010;
Dindo & Fowles, 2011;
Kimonis et al., 2020)
 which is theorized to contribute to exasperated psychopathic symptoms. In some cases, boldness has indicated greater aggression 
(Cima & Raine, 2009)
 and violent offending , though effect sizes are generally low.
Because boldness scarcely relates to relevant criterion directly 
(Drislane et al., 2018;
Laurinavičius et al., 2020;
Paiva et al., 2020;
Sleep et al., 2019)
, proponents of the TMP suggest boldness has a synergistic effect on psychopathic symptoms 
(Lilienfeld et al., 2012;
Lilienfeld et al., 2015;
Lilienfeld et al., 2016;
Patrick et al., 2019;
Patrick, Fowles, & Krueger, 2009)
. Highpsychopathy scorers with high-boldness levels have worse behavior and greater violent offending than low-boldness high-psychopathy scorers 
Drislane et al., 2022)
. Boldness has also been proposed as a mitigator that explains discrepant findings linking psychopath positively (low boldness) and negatively (high boldness) with internalizing 
(Benning et al., 2005;
Brislin et al., 2015;
Blagov et al., 2016;
Blonigen et al., 2010;
Drislane, Patrick & Arsal, 2014;
Gaughan et al., 2009;
Lynam & Miller, 2015;
Miller et al., 2001
).


Limitations of Triarchic Psychopathy
Interactive relationships between triarchic constructs are often either inconsistent with theoretical expectations, predict adaptive rather than maladaptive functioning, or are between meanness and disinhibition, but not boldness 
(Gatner et al., 2016;
Maples et al., 2014;
Miller, Maples-Keller, & Lynam, 2016;
Sharpe et al., 2021)
. Some explain that operationalizing antisocial behavior as criminality and/or overusing criminal samples excludes high boldness individuals (e.g., 
Hicks et al., 2004;
Preszler et al., 2018;
Skeem et al., 2007;
Thornquist & Zuckerman, 1995)
, because high boldness individuals are theorized to be "successful" psychopaths who avoid the law. However, nonsignificant differences of boldness between offender and non-offender samples counter this latter claim 
(Roy et al., 2021)
. Boldness is under substantial scrutiny and requires further investigation.


Risky Decision-Making Hypotheses
We expected that emotionality and conscientiousness would associate negatively with risky decision making and interact such that individuals scoring higher on either will have reduced framing effects. We expected that lesser openness and greater agreeableness would be associated with greater framing effect sizes. We also predicted extraversion to negatively associate with total risky decision making. The AFFM has less comparable traits to those in the FFM, due to its differences in item content, factor structure, and theoretical basis. As such, we had no specific hypotheses for how neuroticism, extraversion, activity, and aggressiveness will associate with risky decision making. The abundance of research on sensation seeking 
(Roberti, 2004)
 informed our expectation that sensation seeking would associate positively with risky decision making. FFM findings 
(Collison, Miller, & Lynam, 2021;
Drislane et al., 2022;
Poy et al., 2014;
Sleep et al., 2019;
Stanley, Wygent, & Sellbom, 2013)
 do not clearly inform on expectations for boldness. Increased sensation/excitement seeking and venturesomeness correlate with boldness potentially indicating a positive relationship between boldness and risky decision making 
(Ribes-Gaurdiola et al., 2020)
. Thus, the relationship between boldness and risky decision making was examined on an exploratory basis. 
Mishra, Lalumiere, and Williams (2010)
 found that low selfcontrol predicted risky financial behavior. In tandem with FFM findings, this informed our expectation that disinhibition and meanness would associate positively with risky decision making.


Antisocial Behavior Hypotheses
In study two, we also evaluate the potential relationships of the AFFM traits and TMP constructs with a comprehensive measure of antisocial behavior. We expected that both aggressiveness and sensation seeking would associate positively with antisocial behavior 
(Mann et al., 2017)
. We expected the former to associate with factors that include antagonistic, aggressive, and violent behaviors while the latter would associate with factors including theft, excitement seeking, and other non-interpersonal antisocial behaviors. We expected that meanness and disinhibition would associate with total antisocial behavior and more specifically with factors that include aggressive and criminal behavior. We expected boldness to associate with total antisocial behavior but primarily with factors including content such as lying, manipulation, fraud, and other non-violent but interpersonally malevolent behaviors. We did not hypothesize a synergistic (interactive) effect between triarchic constructs to predict antisocial behavior.


Study One


Method


Participants
Utilizing convenience sampling, recruitment resulted in the participation of 180 undergraduate students (25.56% men, 70.56% women, and 3.89% non-binary; M = 19.02 years, SD = 1.07) from two northwestern United States colleges (n1 = 72, n2 = 108). In response to a forced choice question, participants self-identified as White or European American (74.44%), Black or African American (1.67%), Native American or Native Alaskan (0.55%), Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian (0.55%), Hispanic or Latino (7.78%), Asian (11.67%), or as another race (3.33%). We excluded participants (n = 18) on the basis of invariant decision scores (all risky or all secure choices) or low decision timing (M < 5 seconds, [cutoff determined in preliminary analyses]) in either of the frames; leaving a sample size of 162 participants for analysis.


Measures


Risky Decision Making
Risky decision making was measured using 20 financial decision tasks that were presented to subjects in random order via Qualtrics. Half of these decision tasks were framed in terms of gains while the other half were framed in terms of losses. each task had a mathematical equivalent in the opposite frame. Each task presented a pair of options, a sure option (e.g., "Earn $15 with 100% certainty") , and a risky option (e.g., "Take a chance to earn $75 with 20% probability or $0 with 80% probability"), that were equivalent in expected value. The sure option always offered a gain (or loss) with certainty while the risky option always offered a potential gain (or loss) with probability P and a potential gain (or loss) with a probability 1-P.
Probabilities for the favorable outcome ranged from 10% to 90% with expected values ranging from $50 to $15,000. Consistent with the weighting function in prospect theory, the framing effect has been shown to be most exaggerated at moderate probabilities (DeKay et al., 2022;
DeKay & Garge, 2023) so extreme probabilities (90% < P < 10%) were not included within the task. Participants were not made aware of the mathematical equivalence between the two contracts and were prompted to respond to each task by choosing either of the two contracts. risky decision making was then measured as the proportion of risky options chosen in the loss frame and the proportion of risky options chosen in the gain frame which were not significantly related to each other (r = .14, p = .074).


HEXACO-PI-R (60 item)
The HEXACO-60 
(Ashton & Lee, 2009)
 was used to measure the HEXACO personality traits. Each of the six traits is measured by 10 items. Each item is scored on a five-point scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). Final scores are computed by summing all items (10 per trait) corresponding to each trait; these traits show good internal consistency (α > .73 
;
Ashton & Lee, 2009)
. The HEXACO-60 includes facet-level scores as well but these 2 or 3 item aggregates show low internal consistency 
(Ashton & Lee, 2009)
.


Results


Analytic Strategy & Preliminary Analyses
To test the effect of personality variables on risky decision making, we used multilevel modeling (MLM) to account for within-subjects (frame type) and between-subjects (personality traits) variance. We originally fit a "null" model with a random intercept for each participant and calculated the intra-class correlation (ICC = .11) which indicated considerable variance accounted for within clusters and justifying the use of MLM in further analyses.
Prior to evaluating interactions, we performed a paired samples t-test to test the difference in proportion of risky choices taken in the loss frame (M = .44, SD = .22) from the gain frame (M = .37, SD = .23) which showed statistical significance (t(161) = -2.89 , p < .001, Cohen's d = .34). We then fit an MLM which included a binary variable indicating either the loss or gain frame (β = -.32, p = .001) confirming the main effect of frames on risky choices; we refer to this model hereafter as the frame-only model. Using a likelihood-ratio test we found that the frame-only model improved fit compared to the null model ( 2 = 4.82, p = .028).


Frame Interactions
Using MLM we performed a separate regression model for each HEXACO factor which included an interaction term between the HEXACO variable and the frame indicator. In these six models, none of the factors within the HEXACO interacted with frames to predict risky decision making at significance 
(Table 1, upper half)
.


Exploratory Analyses
Though differences between correlations are not indicative of moderation 
(Chaplin, 2007)
, we exploratorily evaluated associations of HEXACO traits on risky decision making between loss and gain frames. This method of analysis was employed in 
Lauriola and Levin (2001)
 and we aimed to test whether our results paralleled theirs using their method. The results (see 
Table 1
; lower half) show significant negative associations between emotionality and risky decision making in both the loss and gain frame, and a marginally non-significant (p < .10) negative association between conscientiousness and risky decision making in the loss frame.
We then wanted to explore the possibility that traits are predictive of overall risky decision making, but not interactive between frames. We performed separate regressions for each HEXACO trait as an independent (rather than interactive) predictor while controlling for the framing effect. Emotionality (β = -.16, p = .004) emerged as the sole HEXACO predictor of risky decision making. This model could not be discriminated from the frame only model using the likelihood ratio test ( 2 = 2.48, p = .115) ambiguating the importance of emotionality is a predictor of risky decision making.


Study Two


Method


Participants
Study two was preregistered prior to recruitment; the preregistration can be viewed at the following link: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/KX2VR. Utilizing convenience sampling, we recruited 150 participants through SONA to complete an online survey in Qualtrics; participants were students in an introductory psychology course at a university in the northwestern United States and were given course credit for their participation. Initially, as preregistered, three participants were excluded due to missing responses. This left 147 participants (107 women; M age = 18.78) who identified as 69.38% White, 10.90% as Latinx or Mexican, 8.16% as Asian, 1.36% as Black or African-American, and 10.20% identified as other. This original sample was used for analyses with the antisocial behavior engagement scale.
Additionally, in accordance with the preregistered exclusionary criteria and congruent with the methods in study one, we removed 35 participants who responded to either the loss or gain frame tasks in less than five seconds on average; this sub-sample of 112 participants (86 women; M age = 18.82) was used for analyses with the risky decision-making variable. The 35 excluded participants did not show the abundantly reported and replicated framing effect (t(34) = .46, p = .65, Cohen's d = .10). The excluded and included groups did not differ in risky decisionmaking scores (t(145) = -.55, p = .58), however, the excluded group was found to score higher or neuroticism from the ZKA-PQ than the included group (t(145) = 3.77, p < .001, Cohen's d = .50).


Measures


Triarchic Psychopathy Measure
The Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM) was developed by 
Patrick (2009)
 to measure three constructs of psychopathy: boldness (19 items), meanness (19 items), and disinhibition (20 items). Each of the constructs show strong test-retest reliability and internal consistency 
(Blagov et al., 2016;
Paiva et al., 2020)
. The measure also shows convergent validity with established measures of personality 
(Poy et al., 2014)
 and psychopathy 
(Drislane,
 disputed 
(Collison, Miller, & Lynam, 2021;
Eichenbaum, 2020;
Roy et al., 2020;
Stanton, Brown & Watson, 2021)
, evidence for the three-factor structure has been shown in 
Paiva et al. (2020)
, 
Patrick et al. (2021)
, and Somma et al. (2018).


Zuckerman-Kuhlman-Aluja Personality Questionnaire (ZKA-PQ)
Aluja, Kuhlman, and Zuckerman (2010) created the 200-item ZKA-PQ measure of the five factors (each with four facets) in the AFFM: extraversion (EX), neuroticism (NE), sensation seeking (SS), aggressiveness (AG) and activity (AC). The factor structure of the ZKA-PQ has been replicated multiple times, with a five-factor solution consistently showing preferred fit 
(Aluja et al., 2015;
Garcia et al., 2012)
. The ZKA-PQ is internally consistent at the factor level (α > .85), though less so within the facets (α > .65 
;
Aluja, Kuhlman & Zuckerman, 2010)
.
Convergent validity with both normal-range (Abad et al., 2016) and pathological measures 
(Aluja, Blanch & Balada, 2013;
Aluja et al., 2021)
 of personality is well established.


Risky Decision Making
Risky decision making was measured using 60 decision-making tasks that were presented to subjects in random order both between (i.e., either loss or gain was presented first) and within the manipulation (i.e., tasks within loss and gain frames were presented in randomized order).
All other aspects of risky decision making were the same as in study one. Loss and gain frame risky decision making were modestly positively correlated with each other (r = .34, p < .001).


Antisocial Behavior Engagement Scale (ASB-ES)
To measure antisocial behavior, we developed a measure titled ASB-ES which contains 27 items derived from an original set of 34 items. Respondents indicate the frequency to which they have engaged in the described behavior: never (0), rarely (1), sometimes (2), and frequently
(3). After extracting a singular principal component, we removed seven items with factor loadings below ±.40. We then performed exploratory factor analysis revealing three factors which we used to develop the subscales: Interpersonal Hostility (α = .81, e.g., "lie to others to insult or hurt someone"), Social and Consequential Unconcern (α = .86, e.g., "Break rules at school or work"), and Criminal Behavior (α = .77, e.g., "Break into someone's car or house").
Subscales were titled by the author based on shared subject matter of items.
While this is a new measure, engagement in antisocial behavior has been used for tests of criterion validity in the literature, both through criminal records 
Hall, Benning, & Patrick, 2004;
Poythress et al., 2010)
 and self-report 
(Hannibal et al., 2019;
Lask & Chester, 2021;
Laurinavičius et al., 2020;
Lynam, Whiteside, & Jones, 1999;
Miller & Lynam, 2003)
. Self-reported delinquency has shown to be reliable in previous research 
(Hirschi, Hindelang & Weiss;
1980)
. The ASB-ES was created for two purposes: i) to introduce content characterized by hostile interpersonal behavior and ii) to assess the criterion validity of emerging measures more directly. We argue that the ASB-ES holds relatively strong face validity. For more information on the development of the ASB-ES, see Supplemental Materials.


Results


Risky Decision Making
We repeated the same analytic strategy as performed in study one. After specifying the null model, we calculated the intra-class correlation (ICC = .32) indicating considerable variance accounted for within clusters and justifying the use of multilevel modeling in latter analyses. We performed a paired samples t-test to test the difference in proportion of risky choices taken in the loss frame (M = .35, SD = .16) from the gain frame (M = .31, SD = .15) which was marginally non-significant (t(111) = -1.84, p = .06, Cohen's d = .21). We then performed a frame only model (see 
Table 2
, "Frame" model) for which the predictor was nonsignificant. A subsequent likelihood ratio test revealed relatively equal model fits between the frame only model and the null model ( 2 = 0.59, p = .441).
We then tested independent effects of each of the personality variables (i.e., ZKA-PQ factors and TriPM constructs) on risky decision making while controlling for the framing effect. No significant predictors emerged (see 
Table 2
, "Independent" models). We then tested for interactions between the personality variables and the decision frame in predicting risky decision making. No personality variables emerged as significant interactive predictors of risky decision making (see 
Table 2
, "Interaction" models). Finally, we evaluated whether triarchic traits would interact with each other to predict risky decision making. Interactions between meanness and boldness, disinhibition and boldness, and meanness and disinhibition, all emerged as nonsignificant in predicting risky decision making.
Exploratorily, we repeated all of the aforementioned analyses with the original sample of 147 participants (without the preregistered time exclusion). We found that the results were consistent in both the original and subsample; no significant predictors emerged. Additionally, we explored whether personality variables were correlated with risky decision making between frames rather than interactive in regression. Again, no significant correlations emerged between personality variables and risky decision making in either loss or gain frames.


Antisocial Behavior
We then performed regressions with the ZKA-PQ factors and TriPM constructs as predictors of the ASB-ES scales 
(Table 3
). Because factor analysis of the ASB-ES occurred subsequently to hypothesizing, our hypotheses specified expected content of the emerged factors rather than the actual factors themselves. Meanness and disinhibition were found to be strong predictors of all subscales within the ASB-ES as well as the total scale. Notably, meanness was most predictive of interpersonal hostility while disinhibition was the primary predictor of social and consequential unconcern and criminal behavior. Boldness was not directly predictive of any subtypes of antisocial behavior, though its relationship with interpersonal hostility approached significance (p = .06). Also incongruent with our expectations boldness was not associated with total antisocial behavior.
To test whether the triarchic traits have a synergistic effect in predicting antisocial behavior, we performed interactions with each combination of two constructs 
(Table 3
).
Meanness and disinhibition interacted to predict interpersonal hostility, criminal behavior, and total antisocial behavior. Additionally, boldness interacted with meanness to predict interpersonal hostility. Interaction between boldness and disinhibition were not predictive of antisocial behavior in the present study nor was the three-way interaction between boldness, meanness, and disinhibition predictive of any ASB.
Exploratorily, to further understand the relationship between boldness and antisocial behavior, we performed correlations between boldness and each of the items from the ASB-ES.
The five items with the highest correlations were as follows: "Get in a physical fight with another person", r = .29, p < .001; "Drive significantly above the speed limit", r = .21, p = .011; "Lie to others to save money", r = .15, p = .072; "Break another person's possessions on purpose", r = .14, p = .092; and "Hurt someone to get back at them", r = .11, p = .187. Three of these items are contained within the interpersonal-hostility factor while the other two are within the social and consequential unconcern factor.
Finally, we tested whether the traits from the ZKA-PQ were predictive of antisocial behavior 
(Table 3)
. Aggressiveness and sensation seeking were predictive of all forms of antisocial behavior. Sensation seeking was particularly predictive of social and consequential unconcern while aggressiveness was especially predictive of interpersonal hostility. Both extraversion and activity were also negatively associated with interpersonal hostility, while only the former associated negatively with criminal behavior. Finally, neuroticism was predictive of greater social and consequential unconcern as well total antisocial behavior.


Discussion


Personality and Risky Decision Making
While in the past the FFM has been able to predict differential decision making between loss and gain frames, results were inconsistent and the method of analysis did not provide a test of moderation. In the present study we aimed to evaluate both direct and interactive personality predictors of risky decision making between loss and gain frames. Two of our hypotheses were partially supported: we found that emotionality was a direct indicator of decreased risky decision making in both loss and gain frames and that conscientiousness operated in the expected manner in relation to the framing effect though nonsignificantly. Though not hypothesized, extraversion from the ZKA-PQ was marginally non-significant in predicting risky decision making. However, all of these variables provided little explanatory power within the linear model. Previous reports show that faster responding may be linked to increased framing effect sizes 
(Guo, Trueblood, & Diedrich, 2017)
. Additionally, individuals removed due to the time exclusion scored higher in neuroticism. To test whether the time exclusion provided a confound for our results, we reperformed the analyses from study two with the original sample. In terms of significance, the findings mirrored the original results. As such, while many traits did not emerge as predictors, emotionality and conscientiousness seemed to be among those that showed the most promised in predicting risky decision making. It is possible that these broad dimensions are rough indicators of affective and deliberative process preference.


Limitations
There are a variety of potential explanations for incongruence between findings in the present study with previous reports 
(Lauriola & Levin, 2001;
Levin et al., 2002)
 including power differences, sampling differences, and methodological differences. The present study provided larger sample sizes than in both 
Lauriola and Levin (2001)
 and 
Levin et al. (2002)
 but a smaller than in Sekścińskaa and Rudzinska-Wojciechowskab (2020). While our sample sizes may be similar to previous reports, detecting trait-manipulation moderations has been described as "one of the most elusive goals" of behavioral research 
(Chaplin, 2007)
 and often requires large samples to detect such effects 
(Garson, 2012;
Rohrer & Arslan, 2021;
Vize et al., 2023)
.
Furthermore, 
Lauriola and Levin (2001)
 suggest that education could be a confounding variable and therefor excluded all participants with education levels above a high school diploma.
Participants in our studies were all enrolled in higher education potentially reducing framing effects.
There are also various methodological differences in the present study. Previous reports differed from the present study by i) the number of decision tasks administered to participants (ranging from 1 to 60 tasks), ii) the kind of decision task administered to participants (e.g., financial task, epidemic/terminal illness tasks), iii) method of administration (e.g., online, inperson), and iv) personality measures administered. In study one we administered only 20 tasks, whereas in study two we administered 60; a larger framing effect and smaller correlation between loss and gain frame scores was observed in study one compared to study two. As such, administering a larger number of decision tasks may prompt homogenous responding by participants potentially through a fatigue effect. It is also possible that financial tasks are less suitable for measuring framing effects or that online administration The measures used in the present study may have also been responsible for nonsignificant findings. For example, anger content, which is included in FFM neuroticism but HEXACO agreeableness, may command the relationship with decreased framing effect size and effect overall risky decision making. Thus emotionality, which does not includes anger, did not show its expected effect while agreeableness, which includes anger, had a reduced association with risky decision making. Evidence has shown that state anger reduces framing effects compared to controls 
(Habib et al., 2015)
. As a result, the FFM may organize content in a manner that is particularly able to predict risky decision making compared to the relative inability of other omnibus models.


Antisocial Behavior
The relevance of meanness and disinhibition in predicting antisocial behavior was confirmed in the present study: while each were predictive of all forms of antisocial behavior, meanness was particularly predictive of interpersonal hostility whereas disinhibition was more predictive of social and consequential unconcern and criminal behavior. These relationships further delineate the divergent importance of each of the constructs.
Boldness also showed marginal utility in predicting antisocial behaviors under specific conditions. Boldness interacted with meanness to predict further interpersonal hostility suggesting that individuals scoring high on both meanness and boldness have exaggerated antisocial symptoms uniquely in social/relational situations. This is in line with theoretical assertions that the primary psychopath may use their social influence to engage in further antisocial behavior whereas the socially-disconnected secondary psychopath is more concerned with criminal behavior. Furthermore, boldness was shown to be predictive of items within the ASB-ES characterized by social aggression, manipulation, and deceit. Boldness and extraversion, which is negatively associated with antisocial behavior, are often linked to each other. Given that boldness predicted antisocial behavior despite a positive link with extraversion suggests that boldness may pick up on clinically relevant criteria, though this has been disputed in the past 
(Miller et al., 2019)
.
It should be noted that meanness and disinhibition also interacted to predict interpersonal hostility and to a greater degree than found between meanness and boldness. While this does not discredit the finding with boldness, it may reaffirm assertions that boldness may simply be an ancillary feature of psychopathy 
(Lynam & Miller, 2012)
 while meanness and disinhibition are sufficient for characterizing the disorder. Meanness and disinhibition interacted to predict criminal behavior as well further corroborating the particular utility of each trait.
Aggressiveness, like meanness, seems to have particular importance in predicting more interpersonally relevant antisocial behaviors whereas sensation seeking, like disinhibition, is linked to more reclusive antisocial behaviors. Previous links between sensation seeking and aggressiveness with gonadal hormones provide a potential explanation for the emergence of antisocial behaviors 
(Aluja & Torrubia, 2004)
. Neuroticism was also notably associated to social and consequential unconcern but neither of the other antisocial behaviors. This relationship may be driven by content within social and consequential unconcern describing substance use which has a strong relationship with neuroticism 
(Terracciano et al., 2008)
.


Limitations
Analyses with the ASB-ES were still subject to various limitations. Most notably is the immaturity of the ASB-ES measure which has only preliminary support for its factor structure in a small undergraduate sample. While the results presented her are informative, it is possible that the factor structure of the ASB-ES will not replicate in the same manner as found in the present study when analyses are performed with a more inclusive sample. The relatively small and unrepresentative sample size is another limitation of these analyses. Undergraduates may be in a particularly niche social environment (college/university) which prompts different interpersonal behavior than may be seen in the community. As such, the present results might not be generalizable.


Future Directions
Future research should continue to explore the connection between personality and risky behavior in diverse contexts to establish the relative predictive ability of personality variables between situations. Evaluations of personality alongside risky financial decision tasks, particularly with the FFM, may elucidate the incremental predictability of specific personality models above others and establish the replicability of previous findings. Future research of this kind should focus on providing an inclusive sample of diverse age ranges and education levels.
We believe the introduction of social/relational content in measures of antisocial behavior are of great importance in personality disorder research, particularly as the field begins to question the interpersonal nature of personality disorders 
(Lilienfeld et al., 2019;
Wright et al., 2022;
Widiger et al., 2023)
. Future research should also explore whether the results concerning antisocial behavior will replicate in more diverse samples including factor structure of the ASB-ES and associations with personality measures. We also believe future research should explore on the interplay between psychopathy and interpersonal behavior to delineate the relative importance of boldness in not necessarily criminal, but nevertheless aggressive, contexts.
