You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction:
The generative AI has grow rapidly, past research shows that large language model has passed Theory of mind test 
(Trott, S., Jones, C., Chang, T., Michaelov, J., & Bergen, B. 2023)
, overcoming intuition 
(Hagendorff, T., Fabi, S., & Kosinski, M. 2023)
 and judging innovation funding 
(Eapen, T. T., Finkenstadt, D. J., Folk, J., & Venkataswamy, L., Du, M. 2023)
. Recently, some large language models added a computer vision function to them, make it multimodal. This essay delves into the remarkable capabilities of multimodal systems in interpreting and analyzing images with an accuracy that often surpasses human visual judgment. Human perception, while sophisticated, is inherently subject to biases and inconsistencies, particularly in high-stakes environments such as criminal investigations 
(Dror, I. E., & Cole, S. A. 2010)
, medical imaging 
(Mullainathan, S., & Obermeyer, Z. 2019)
, and assessments of facial attractiveness 
(Lee, Y., & Jeong, S. K. 2023)
. In contrast, computer vision offers a consistent, objective, and precise approach, leveraging vast datasets and advanced algorithms to identify patterns and insights that might elude the human eye. It can even identify political orientation, Political orientation was correctly classified in 72% of liberal-conservative face pairs, remarkably better than chance (50%) and human accuracy (55%) 
(Kosinski, M. 2021)
.
Personality can be the other reason people make noisy decision-making 
(Kahneman, D., Sibony, O., & Sunstein, C. R. 2021)
 or change their preferences 
(Aleem, H., & Grzywacz, N. M. 2023
, Palumbo, L., Harrison, N. R., Trawiński, T., Kass, J., Metelmann, A. C., Bari, R. S. G., & Donnelly, N. 2023
, A handful of studies that have measured aesthetic preferences at multiple moments show that preferences may change in as little as two weeks. Personality such as openness to experience and need for cognitive closure, can be a predictor of aesthetic preferences.
Pattern recognition is not only a term used in computer vision, psychologists 
(Tversky, A. & Kahneman, D. 1983)
 found that people find patterns in words, such as the classic "Linda Problem", and GPT-4 can solve this now 
(Du, M. 2023)
.
"Linda Problem" is a classic probability question, language models acquire the ability to determine the likelihood of word sequences by analyzing the statistical patterns in which words are distributed within language.
Recently computer scientists come up with an idea of how to recognize patterns in language 
(Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., et.al.,2017)
, by using "attention". Unlike human attention, computer seeks the pattern underlying language to better understand it, whereas humans use language to communicate, social Interact or convey the essence of art, and persuasion.
As we explore this topic, we will consider the inherent limitations of human visual judgment, characterized by its susceptibility to noise 
(Kahneman, D., Sibony, O., & Sunstein, C. R. 2021)
 and error. In criminal investigations, for instance, eyewitness accounts and suspect identifications can be notoriously unreliable, leading to wrongful convictions or overlooked leads.
Take radiologists, a visually oriented profession for another example, some common biases that impact clinical decisions in radiology include framing bias, satisfaction of search, and the influence of a colleague's opinion. Framing bias occurs when a radiologist considers a case only within the context of a specific clinical specialty, potentially leading to a narrow differential diagnosis. Satisfaction of search occurs when a radiologist stops searching for additional findings after identifying an initial abnormality. Finally, the influence of a colleague's opinion can lead to undue influence on a radiologist's medical decision-making. (Busby, L. P., Courtier, J. L., & Glastonbury, C. M. 2018).
Relying solely on visual information can lead to biases and limitations in judgments of competence and performance. For example, people might use vision as a heuristic in judgments about competence in a way that is inconsistent with what they would deliberately choose and even contradicted by actual performance outcomes. Additionally, relying on demographic characteristics such as gender and ethnicity as visual cues can lead to stereotypes and discrimination. Therefore, it is important to consider multiple sources of information when making judgments about competence and performance. (Tolsá-Caballero, N., & Tsay, C. J. 2022).
Humans are the only species that can use language 
(Pinker, 2003)
, while vision is an evolutionary process that existed on Earth hundreds of millions of years ago 
(Li, 2023)
, computer vision, as well as human vision, has developed amazing abilities to reason some unspoken things.
Pattern recognition is a highly important cognitive ability to make a judgment and decision making, even in the business domain 
(Baron, R. A. 2006)
, entrepreneurs may use their cognitive frameworks, such as prototypes and exemplars, to identify new business opportunities. These frameworks are developed through their previous life experience and serve as "templates" that enable specific individuals to perceive connections between seemingly unrelated changes or events. By discussing opportunities they have recognized with family, friends, and others, entrepreneurs may form more accurate and useful prototypes for identifying opportunities. These cognitive frameworks whether ideas for new products or services are practical and potentially valuable rather than merely interesting or novel. understanding the pattern recognition perspective on opportunity identification can help aspiring entrepreneurs improve their ability to identify and pursue new ventures in several ways. Some psychologists discuss that the medical expert using pattern recognition to diagnose disease 
(Ericsson, A., & Pool, R. 2016)
, or a chess expert remembers where the chess was placed using their knowledge representation 
(Simon, H., & Chase, W. 1988)
, some expert cannot even express how they remember the play using language, they use more abstract terms to describe it. By looking at the sports court, the expert can better predict which team is gonna win.
This article is trying to explore how multimodal can evaluate creativity achievement. When it comes to innovation judgment, participants may suffer from imagining the right product by simply reading the text, now this research, giving participants images, can help them better understand what the real product is, while previous studies only focus on language 
(Du, M. 2023)
, now multimodal gain more information, and it can judge the product better as well. Moreover, we investigate how multimodal can predict marketing research outcomes by using computer vision reasoning 
(Karpathy, A., & Fei-Fei, L. 2015
, Krishna, R., et.al 2017
. VQA (Visual Question Answering: a new dataset containing open-ended questions about images.) provides a fertile training and testing ground for models aimed at tasks for accurate object detection, segmentation, and summary-level image captioning, Advertisements come with images of the product that is being sold, social media profiles contain both descriptions and images of the user while multimedia websites that play audio and video have associated descriptions and opinions of the content 
(Kiros et al. 2014)
 .The following study contains marketing research predicting by multimodal.


Study 1:
To evaluate the effectiveness of computer vision systems in identifying patterns, trends, and emergent properties in technological and creative domains, and compare this effectiveness with human judgment.


Hypothesis:
H1: Computer vision can distinguish a more successful innovation ( the one which got more funding) from another simply by using image recognition, comparing two innovation product image, a multimodal can tell which one is more successful.


Materials
Randomly select 8 crowdfunding project and 3 of its image, input it to multimodals and ask: which creative product is more creative (novel and useful), We ask the real participants the same question.


Procedures
We want to see if there are similar ideas, Machine learning involves an extensive amount of data, beyond human capacity to memorize.
Artificial Intelligence is capable of retrieving similar product information from the internet. In addressing complex issues like assessing creativity, the vastness of data can hinder certain heuristics 
(Simon and Newell 1971)
. Computer scientists can now use similar concept to identify image with one shot, and like most of the large language model, they use bayesian approach. 
(Fei-Fei, L., Fergus, R., & Perona, P. 2006)
 Results: The accuracy for GPT-4V and Google Gemini and other multimodal to distinguish the more successful product from a less one is 80%, which is much more accurate than human participants. 
Figure 1
. Conceal the commercial logo and modify to the generated image derived from some Kickstarter project's creative illustration


Study 2:
To see if multimodal can predict what recent marketing literature's result.


H2: Computer vision can distinguish what participants wants


Materials
We collect some literature of marketing research to see if multimodal can predict the result of the judgment of participants. Take presentation formats for example, some researchers investigate how the presentation format of scores (incremental, cumulative, or combined) influences decision makers' evaluations of entities, such as consumer ratings, employee performance, or product scores. The study demonstrates that the way in which scores are presented can significantly impact overall judgments and subsequent behaviors. The research provides theoretical insights, empirical evidence from multiple experiments, and practical implications for various domains, including consumer behavior, managerial decision-making, and marketing strategies. 
(Lembregts, C., Schepers, J., & Keyser, A. D. 2023)
, based on psychological theory such as loss aversion 
(Tversky and Kahneman, 1984)
.


Procedures
We ask GPT-4V, Google Gemini to guess which picture will the origin participants prefer from the original study. The preference for the incremental versus cumulative condition would likely be influenced by individual differences in how participants perceive and are motivated by feedback. Generally, the cumulative system might be more favored due to its ability to buffer the impact of any single poor performance.
For all the experiments, please check the original script.


Conclusion
The advancements in computer vision and its capability to predict marketing result through image analysis surpass human accuracy, signaling a transformative shift in the realm of A/B testing and beyond. This technology, powered by sophisticated algorithms and deep learning, offers a unique perspective, analyzing visual data with unprecedented precision and speed. As computer vision systems continue to evolve, they are not only automating the process of image analysis but also unlocking new levels of understanding and insights that were previously unattainable by human capabilities. This leap in technology heralds a new era in marketing prediction, where data-driven decisions become more accurate, efficient, and effective. The implications of this shift are profound, promising to reshape industries, enhance creative processes and innovation forecasting. The future beckons with the promise of a more informed and innovative world, guided by the extraordinary capabilities of computer vision.


Future suggestion:
We still don't know the difference when human progress image and language. Current research, including our study, has yet to unravel the full extent and nature of these differences. The intricacies of cognitive processing, influenced by a myriad of factors like cultural background, education, neurological diversity, and individual experiences, make it challenging to delineate clear boundaries and distinctions in how images and language are processed by humans, since personality and individual difference can be a major source of noise. 
(Kahneman, D., Sibony, O., & Sunstein, C. R. 2021)
, Moreover, the tools and methodologies available for studying brain activity, while advanced, still have limitations in terms of resolution and specificity. This restricts our ability to capture the full complexity of neural processes involved in image and language perception. Additionally, the interaction between linguistic and visual processing is a dynamic and context-dependent phenomenon, which adds another layer of complexity to our understanding. Future research can use FMRI or other method to investigate the physiology behind these phenomena.
As such, while this study contributes valuable insights to the field, it represents a stepping stone rather than a conclusive exploration of the subject. Future research, employing more sophisticated technologies and interdisciplinary approaches, is essential to deepen our understanding of this intricate aspect of human cognition.
Other than predicting innovation, researchers can try to apply this technique to study criminal investigation, or medical decision making, and human resource development.
