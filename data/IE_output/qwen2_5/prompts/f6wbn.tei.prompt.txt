You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

POWER MEASURES


Measures of Relationship Power Dynamics in Romantic Relationships
The concept of power dynamics is central to understanding dyadic relationships. In romantic partnerships, the determination of who has more ability to influence and resist influence is determined by personal characteristics, socioemotional factors, and past behaviors . Personal and relational outcomes are expected to be impacted by relationship power dynamics which in turn will impact personal characteristics, socioemotional factors, power strategies, and relationship power at later timepoints 
(Simpson et al., 2015)
. In past research, relationship power was related to general outcomes like relationship satisfaction 
(Gray-Little & Burks, 1983;
Joel et al., 2020;
Zeigler-Hill & LaCross, 2023)
 and specific behaviors like acting in prosocial ways 
(Gordon & Chen, 2013;
Karremans & Smith, 2010)
. However, relationship power is also linked to the experience of intimate partner violence 
(Gibbs et al., 2020;
Harrington et al., 2021)
, post-dissolution relationships 
(Goldberg et al., 2015)
, and depressive symptoms 
(Bosco et al., 2022;
Filson et al., 2010)
. Finances, legal rights, co-parenting arrangements, and social resources are all qualitatively related to relationship power 
(Dworkin et al., 2017;
Goldberg et al., 2015;
Moore, 2008;
Senn et al., 2009;
Tichenor, 2005)
; therefore, the study of relationship power is important to understand relationship initiation, functioning, dissolution, and violence.
The study of power dynamics in romantic relationships suffers immensely from a lack of consistent operationalization of the construct. Multiple scales to measure relationship power, equality, or division of tasks have been constructed [e.g., Sense of Power 
(Anderson et al., 2012)
, Household Decision-making Index 
(Mizan, 1993)
, Who Does What Questionnaire 
(Cowan & Cowan, 1988)
]. Yet, due to the multifaceted and hard to define nature of power dynamics, proxy measures are often used (e.g., income, expertise, dependence) instead of scales developed to POWER MEASURES measure power directly. Although there are myriad theoretical frameworks to explain power dynamics, the theories lack concrete guidance for measurement.
Theories of power proliferate psychology disciplines, sociology 
(Connell, 1987)
, and the social sciences more broadly 
(Blood Jr. & Wolfe, 1960;
French Jr. & Raven, 1959;
Huston, 1983;
Keltner et al., 2003;
Rollins & Bahr, 1976;
Thibaut & Kelley, 1959)
. 
Simpson and colleagues (2015)
 reviewed the major theories of power and their empirical support to try to reach a consensus on shared principles versus distinct advantages of different theories; they termed their synthesized theory, the Dyadic Power-Social Influence Model. Based on past theories and evidence, they defined relationship power as "the ability or capacity to change another person's thoughts, feelings, and/or behavior so they align with one's own desired preferences, and the ability or capacity to resist influence attempts imposed by another person" 
(Simpson et al., 2015, p. 409)
. Despite theoretical advancements, the measurement of relationship power still lacks consensus. To begin to address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of research on power in romantic or intimate relationships including all empirical research published prior to April 2022 to examine all scale, ad hoc, and proxy measures used.


Theoretical Background
The two major and disparate theories that guide power research that we will discuss are the Dyadic Power-Social Influence Model (DPSIM; 
Simpson et al., 2015)
 and the Theory of Gender and Power. The DPSIM is a theoretical model derived from early theories of power 
(Blood Jr. & Wolfe, 1960;
French Jr. & Raven, 1959;
Huston, 1983;
Keltner et al., 2003;
Rollins & Bahr, 1976;
Thibaut & Kelley, 1959)
 largely based on married relationships and hegemonic romantic relationship structures. The DPSIM theorizes how actor and partner characteristics, power perceptions, influence strategies, and outcomes interact with and influence one another 4 POWER MEASURES 
(Figure 1)
. Implicitly, the DPSIM focuses on heteronormative different-gender relationships between men and women.
According to the theory, individual characteristics of the partners as well as the interpersonal interaction between the partners (within dyad characteristics) lead to power perceptions/bases. Power bases refer to personal characteristics of each partner that are brought into the relationship. In turn, power bases affect the influence strategies enacted by the actor and the partner. Power strategies are behavioral or emotional influence tactics that may be employed to get the desired result. Finally, the strategies used affect the relational and individual outcomes (e.g., choices like what is for dinner or where to vacation) of the actor and the partner. When people are in a relationship, their outcomes are affected by both one's own characteristics, power, and influence strategies as well as their partner's characteristics, power, and influence strategies. 
Figure 1
 shows the full model as the different components relate to different ways in which power dynamics were measured in past research, including variables that are often distinguished from the power construct itself 
(Simpson et al., 2015)
. Few power theories consider the outcomes of power besides getting one's way. Simpson and colleagues proposed that in addition to changing one's partner's attitudes or behaviors, outcomes should also include individual outcomes, (e.g., well-being, depression, anxiety), and relational outcomes (e.g., satisfaction, commitment, trust; 
Fletcher et al., 2000;
Simpson et al., 2015)
. Contrary to earlier theories on resources, the DPSIM emphasized that resources only convey social power in as much as people understand they hold these resources, meaning that the perceptions of one's power may be distinct from one's actual resources. Finally, the DPSIM proposed that what is labeled an outcome (e.g., a relationship decision) should reciprocally impact the power bases and the 5 POWER MEASURES influence strategies one is willing to use in the future including those that may harm the stability of the relationship.
The Theory of Gender and Power (TGP) crosses each social ecological level from macro to dyad to the individual 
(Huston, 2000)
 to create a greater understanding of how power relates to gender, labor, and sexual relations in society 
(Connell, 1987)
. TGP arose from work by sociologist Raewynn 
Connell (1987)
 who created a framework for the social analysis of gender and sexuality. Connell drew on feminist and gay liberation writings and movements to dissect the nature of hegemonic relationships, which were defined as different-gender relations between men and women. According to Connell, the gendered division of labor, structure of power, and cathexis, referring to emotionally charged relationships with other people, were interrelated structural models of gender order. The gendered division of labor (originally referred to as "sexual division of labor") allocated certain work to certain categories of people based upon socially constructed differences according to the gender binary; for example, what jobs women versus men were allowed to do in the workforce 
(Connell, 1987)
. This division becomes a social rule as it is reinforced and perpetuated by relationship practices and institutions, including but not limited to the workforce, product development (e.g., household cleaning devices), and marriage. For instance, at the time of Connell's writing, and still today, in different-gender relationships men's choice not to do childcare places the requirements on women to make concessions with other aspects of their life to fulfill childcare needs (e.g., not working full-time).
Within families, there were multiple gendered divisions that constituted men's power. These included the gendered division of labor inside and outside the home, decision-making, emotional pressures (conceptualized as tactics to get one's way), and sexual behavior within the marriage.
When there was very strong gendered division of labor following traditional ideals in a family, 6 POWER MEASURES wives' authority over the home placed some limits on husbands' power because men were socialized to accept less control and expertise in this domain. Therefore, according to TGP, variables related to labor, decision-making, and sex were related to relationship power.
From a sociological standpoint, power is intertwined with gender at the systems-level, which may and should differ from the individual-level 
(Connell, 1987)
. Systems guide society at the aggregate and therefore are distinct from but influential on the dynamics within a partnership;
where one's own ability and desires, especially in the 21 st century, are partially able to define one's role in a relationship. The differentiation between TGP and psychological theories like DPSIM is that psychological theories tend to focus on the individual and involve less elaboration of systems. Both individual and systems-level information contribute to our understanding of relationship power.


Gender, Sexuality, and Power
A consequence of the conflation of systems-and individual-level power was that power measures often presumed male power was counter to female power or incorporated specific gendered expectations into the operationalization. Potentially highlighting the distinction between individual-and systems-level analysis of gender and sexuality, the empirical literature on differences in power between men and women who are heterosexual or between sexual orientations is differentiated by the level of analysis. Limited work with different psychological measures of relationship power found no gender differences in self-reported power within romantic relationships 
(Farrell et al., 2015;
Hall & Knox, 2019)
. This result might be slightly counterintuitive because systems-level gender gaps exist in faculty 
(Moss-Racusin et al., 2012)
, income, CEOs, and leader roles (C. 
Hill et al., 2016)
 with fewer women in leadership and prestigious work roles. Extensive work has also been done on power strategies within intimate POWER MEASURES relationships that indicated gender differences in the strategies used to influence each other within the relationship 
(Falbo & Peplau, 1980)
. Men and women differ less in their subjective relationship power and differ more in the ways they go about influencing others at the individuallevel.
Research on same-gender relationships (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual people) found that equality was often a self-reported priority. As a result, same-gender relationships more frequently reported having equality consistent with their values and freedom from gender roles within their relationships 
(Rostosky et al., 2006;
Rostosky & Riggle, 2017)
. Freedom from gender roles would be more impactful for women, who are archetypically the lesser-powered partner in heterosexual relationships, and lesbian women were most often found to value equality more than gay men or heterosexual partners 
(Falbo & Peplau, 1980)
. Some research suggested housework was also divided more equally in same-gender couples reflecting egalitarian behaviors matching their egalitarian values 
(Goldberg et al., 2012)
.
Researchers expected to find gender differences between men and women in power reflective of social systems, and often failed to support these expectations because individuals are a separate level of influence from systems. Also, within-dyad differences between men and women allude to a different process than simple gender differences, which may include people who date same-gender partners. Measurement of power reflected expected gender differences such that female power was scaled counter to male power. For instance, the type of relationship power was categorized as 'breadwinner' when the husband earned more or 'mother only earner' if the wife earned all of the family's income 
(Kanji & Schober, 2014)
. In another study the scores were coded to reflect equality in power with lower scores and less power for women with higher scores 
(Handley et al., 2019)
. However, a lack of power at the systems-level does not relate to POWER MEASURES lack of power at the individual-level based on gender or sexual orientation. In sum, the power literature conflated systems-level and individual-level considerations of gender differences in power and how gender differences may vary by sexual orientation or the gender composition of the relationship partners.


Measurement Considerations
Resulting from the power theories were a wide variety of operationalizations of power.
Thus, an initial challenge of studying power dynamics is finding an appropriate measure. For one, searches for relationship power measures do not always yield results because of jinglejangle fallacies (same name for different construct-different names for same construct) and, for another, a large number of experimental manipulations or observations were used to assign power. 
Farrell et al. (2015)
 developed a scale following the DPSIM by 
Simpson and colleagues (2015)
. A chosen measure must show construct validity in that it measures the concept it was intended to measure. To establish construct validity, convergent and discriminant validity are often examined, which refer to being strongly correlated with other measures of the same construct and weakly related to other constructs. Criterion-related validity, on the other hand, examines whether a measure correlates with outcome variables as expected. These considerations of measurement provide sufficient evidence to indicate a measure taps into the construct specified.
In the field of power research where proxy measures and ad hoc measures abound, the comparability of results is in question because the constructs are not singularly tapping into power dynamics. Proxy measures are often scales that may be previously established but were validated to study a different construct, e.g., a dependence scale to study power. Ad hoc measures are item(s) generated by the research team for their current study that have not been previously POWER MEASURES examined for validity. For example, if age is a proxy for power in the first study but decisionmaking dominance is a proxy for power in a second study and both investigate the association with communication, researchers may lack confidence that these results illuminate the correlations of the same underlying construct-power. As another example, it is difficult to compare results when power is measured by a single item (who holds more power) in one study versus a dependency scale in another study. Despite the fact that these studies may draw on similar theories and construe these variables as relationship power, there remains an issue of questionable construct validity.
A second issue for power measures is response options that may not be comparable. The common practice in much of the literature is to use Likert-type scales with ratings like 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree' or 'very untrue of me' to 'very true of me' where the ordering of response options is linear and only focused on one person (the respondent). The rating of each of the earlier examples (i.e., age, decision-making dominance, dependency, and 'who holds more power') are not all rated in a similar manner. Some rating systems correspond to more discrete categories (e.g., 'me,' 'you,' 'both'), whereas the bipolar dimensional ratings are taken to be continuous. Even if the question content is similar, the comparability of these scales remains unclear. Further, as mentioned earlier, often husbands' or men's power is assessed counter to wives' or women's power, which limits the application of these measures. In short, there are important measurement considerations that have not been addressed in the power literature. To understand the expected comparability between studies, we review all measures labeled as relating to power dynamics, their rating systems, and item-level information.
In sum, the study of relationship power dynamics has abounded with theory but lacked guides on measurement leading to a diverse array of new scale measures and proxy measures 10 POWER MEASURES used in practice. To address this oversight, the current review synthesizes the variety of measures used synonymously with power along with the study topic and types of samples used. Our research questions are: (1) What measures were used to study power dynamics in romantic relationships? (2) For each type of measure, what were the study topics? (3) What were the demographic characteristics of the samples? and (4) What response scales were used?


Methods


Literature Search
The current literature review included all research until April 25, 2022. We searched multiple databases (EBSCOHost, ProQuest limited to PsycInfo and ERIC, and Scopus) and limited the source types to academic journals in English. Gray literature and dissertations were excluded for their lack of peer review and potential overlap with published works. Literature search terms were "interpersonal power," "relation* power," "power dynamic," "dyadic power," "interpersonal control," or "interpersonal communication" (see Supplement for full search strings). Next, targeted searches were run for articles citing the major theories of social power 
(Blood Jr. & Wolfe, 1960;
French Jr. & Raven, 1959;
Huston, 1983;
Keltner et al., 2003;
Rollins & Bahr, 1976;
Thibaut & Kelley, 1959)
 reviewed in 
Simpson et al. (2015)
 and articles citing the Relationship Power Inventory scale 
(Farrell et al., 2015)
. From these multiple searches, 6,083 citations were referenced. We preregistered the literature search on OSF and provide review data and supplemental material there: https://osf.io/c75uw/?view_only=4b0173f73a504400a7a49469b277e441.


Coding Process POWER MEASURES
Each phase of the review was overseen by the first author through coding review meetings with each team of coders. In the first round of the review, at least two undergraduate research assistants read abstracts and removed articles that were non-empirical, not generally in social sciences (e.g., science and engineering articles on power dynamics were removed), or unrelated to romantic relationships. Articles that were not excluded in the first round were downloaded to be read in full. In the second round, at least two undergraduate research assistants supervised by the first author read the articles and excluded studies/samples that did not contain a measure of power or were deemed not to focus on romantic relationships. The coding pairs met to discuss coding choices and arrive at a final decision together. Disagreements were resolved by the first author in weekly coding review meetings. We did not exclude measure derivation papers but, in multi-study papers, we excluded the first steps with item generation. Later construct validity or confirmatory samples were coded. Lastly, the first author reviewed the operational definitions and citations of each power construct to fill in the categories about scales, types of measures, and measurement practices relevant to the current review. The full paper was referenced when the operational definition was unclear. The first author supervised all final coding across each phase of the review. They met with all research teams to maintain consistency across coding pairs. Notes and logs are included on OSF. The full description of the review process that led to the final included articles is presented in 
Figure 2
.


Coded Information
From each unique study or sample in an article, we coded study design, sample characteristics, and power measure information. Year of publication, study design, sample type, country of sample, sample size, demographics (percent White, percent women, percent men, percent married, percent heterosexual), topic of relationship study, focus on differences between POWER MEASURES groups, name of power construct, type of measure (scale, proxy, experimental manipulation), reporter (self-report, partner-report, information/observer, expert report), citation of power construct, operational definition of power construct, Cronbach's alpha of power construct, and power measure category were gathered for each study. The power measure category was derived from measure descriptions and naming; the steps to derive these categories are explained in results. The final categories were: 1. Sexual relationship power, 2. Power bases/ structural power, 3. Decision-making/ division of household tasks, 4. Relationship power, 5. Power/ equity/ balance, 6. Power outcomes/ socioemotional variables, 7. Power processes/ power strategies, 8.
Individual differences, 9. Control. Based on the operational definitions of power constructs, we also coded the scale name (if named), alterations to the measure (created within study, yes dropped items, yes added items, yes rescored), type of measure (continuous, categorical, experimental manipulation, observation, other), and number of items (range 0 -112).
Established scales were determined by using a named measure and citing it. If authors based their measure on or otherwise referred to a prior source but did not name the scale, we coded this as ad hoc, because often researchers described their measure as based on prior work but did not specify using the same items. Not discussed are the studies that used manipulations of power in experimental studies (k = 28) or qualitative studies (k = 60). For the current review, we focus on the descriptions of the power measures, the topic of relationship study [attraction, relationship initiation, relationship maintenance (during a relationship), relationship termination, violence (dating or sexual violence), loosely relationship-based or studies with some relational measures but a greater focus on other topics (mental health), and sex not necessarily connected to relationship], and the sample characteristics.


Results


POWER MEASURES
Included in the review were 319 unique articles containing 350 unique studies (due to multi-study/sample papers). From these studies, we examined 612 power constructs. Of the 350 studies, the publication year ranged from 1981 to 2022 (Median = 2014) whereas the data collection years ranged from 1968 to 2021. As shown in 
Figure 3
, the study of power dynamics expanded in the 2010s.


Studies of power dynamics sampled in larger proportion from non-Western regions,
including Africa (14.58%), Central America and the Caribbean Islands (2.58%), South America (0.57%), Southwest Asia (2.00%), South Asia (1.43%), Southeast Asia (0.86%), East Asia (4.00%), and Oceania (2.00%). Still a large portion of studies were conducted in North America (62.86%) and Europe (4.29%) whereas two studies were reported as being global or multiple parts of the world (16 studies did not state the country of respondents). Within North America, 5 studies sampled participants from Mexico and 11 sampled from Canada. The average percentage of White participants was 44.81%; however, a large number of studies did not report participant racial identity or ethnicity (209 studies). Still, many studies were on African American, African, Black, or Hispanic populations. In the later results, we describe how each different category of power measure was used in past research. We also provide Supplemental 
Table S1
 to succinctly describe the sampling, study design, and characteristics of the studies using each type of power measure. OSF contains the systematic review data to examine the features of each individual measure.
Sample characteristics showed a wide range in age and relationship length but less variety in gender and sexual orientation. Sample sizes ranged from 30 to 41,344 people (Median = 258). Participants ranged in age from 12 to 105 years old, (M = 29.73; SD = 8.80). Participants ranged from being in a relationship an average of 0.27 years to 42 years (M = 6.75 years; SD = POWER MEASURES 5.86). The majority of participants across studies were married on average (56.33%) using conservative coding of only those reported as married, not a combination of married and cohabiting. Additionally, 88.13% of the samples were heterosexual on average, 68.59% were reported as women, female, or wives, and 31.41% were reported as men, male, or husbands on average. Almost one-quarter of studies indicated or explicitly stated a fifty-fifty split in men and women (k =84 out of 350).


Measures Used to Assess Power Dynamics within Romantic Dyads
There was wide variability in the measures used to assess romantic relationship power dynamics. Our first step to examine the power measures was to group the 612 constructs identified in the studies into broader categories. To make these categorizations, we began with concepts from relevant theory (e.g., resources, strategies/tactics, outcomes, division of labor) as well as explicit construct labeling within studies (i.e., the terms used by different authors to define their power construct). The first author reviewed all 612 power constructs starting with a larger number of categories from a first pass at reviewing different study labels (the code is available in the shared data on OSF). Based on similar content between study labels, the final categories reflected unique operational content and relevant theoretical concepts. We finalized the categories to sexual relationship power, power bases/structural power, decisionmaking/division of household tasks, relationship power, power/equity/balance, power outcomes/socioemotional variables, power processes/power strategies, individual differences, and control based on the descriptions of the measures and theoretical considerations. Due to similarities in content, some categories were grouped together. For example, decision-making was studied with items about who makes decisions in the relationship, but they often reflected tasks similar to the division of labor, so these were combined. Other categories remained POWER MEASURES separate because of distinctions in their item content. There was a large amount of literature specifically focused on sexual relationship power rather than general decisions in the relationship. These measures tapped into control or decision-making over sex and ability to discuss sex between partners. In another instance, the power/equity/balance category and relationship power were both general assessments using similar questions. However, constructs categorized as equity/balance were labeled differently and often used ratings from inequality to equality or showing balance or a lack of balance. Relationship power measures were more likely to be rated from low to high and less likely to explicitly ask about balance in power. We reviewed each type of measure for how often it was used (number of studies), whether established scales were used versus created within the study (ad hoc), whether power was assessed continuously or categorically, and the number of items used on average (see 
Table 1
).


Sexual relationship power
Measures of sexual relationship power specifically focused on variables such as the sexual decision-making and sexual autonomy aspects of power dynamics 
(Table 2)
. For example, the most used measure was the 23-item Sexual Relationship Power Scale, which assesses decision-making dominance and relationship control and includes condom use in each factor 
(Pulerwitz et al., 2000)
. Researchers either scored the Sexual Relationship Power Scale as continuous where the Relationship Control subscale was measured on scales from 1 to 4 and the Decision-Making Dominance subscale was on a scale of 1 to 3 or they treated the data as categorical. There were multiple suggestions from the original authors for alterations to the measure. If the intent was to examine condom use separately, they created the modified version dropping those four items 
(Pulerwitz et al., 2000)
. A common adaptation on scoring was made to normalize the Decision-Making Dominance items on a 4-point scale to match the Relationship POWER MEASURES Control items; however, Relationship Control response options were 'strongly agree,' 'agree,' 'disagree,' and 'strongly disagree,' whereas Decision-Making Dominance was 'your partner,' 'both of you equally,' and 'you,' which were conceptually discrete categories more than ratings of strength of agreement (e.g., 
Hatcher et al., 2012)
. For categorizing participants by sexual relationship power, 
Pulerwitz et al. (2000)
 recommended splitting scale scores into terciles (low, medium, and high) rather than using the continuous information. These were each common alterations that affected the comparability between studies including those that made their own alterations dropping additional items or changing the rating system 
(Gibbs et al., 2017;
Kaufman et al., 2008;
Younge et al., 2010)
.
Two other scales were used once each in this category. The Sexual Communication Selfefficacy subscale assessed the subjective capability one feels in discussing risk of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) (Quinn-Nilas et al., 2016) and the Modified Perceived Partner Approval about Sexual Communication Scale 
(Alvarez, 2012)
, which is how much one's partner would accept sexual communication. All other measures were developed within the study or were adapted from other projects (e.g., 
Harvey et al., 2009)
. Among these, several single items were used to measure sexual relationship power. These included number of children, HIV status, last sexual activity, relationship length, residence, occupation, and control over money. The single items strongly reflected the TGP concepts related to relationship power in society: labor, sex, decision-making. Those with multi-items assessed questions like "who decides if you use a condom," "who usually has more say if you have sex," and communication about safe sex behaviors to prevent HIV or STIs.
Sexual relationship power was often studied in the context of intimate partner violence or dating violence (33.80%), sex behaviors like HIV risk or safe sex practices (28.70%), POWER MEASURES relationship functioning in existing relationships (25.93%), and studies loosely focused on relationships (e.g., greater focus on depression or resource access; 20.37%). None of these studies were focused on romantic attraction, relationship initiation, or relationship termination.
Moreover, 62.05% of the samples were collected in North America but were not overly focusing on White participants (29.18% White on average). In addition, 80.27% of the samples were women on average. Most of the samples were primarily Latina or African (American) women, which matches the derivation of the Sexual Relationship Power Scale and the majority of contexts in which it has been validated 
(Jewkes et al., 2006
(Jewkes et al., , 2010
. The psychometrics of the scale within HIV/AIDS research were reviewed elsewhere 
(McMahon et al., 2015)
.


Power bases/ structural power
The second most frequent measure of power dynamics focused on power bases 
(Table 3)
.
Power bases describe the resources or structural power that participants may hold. Most often power bases were measured with more than one proxy measure such as income, education, and employment. Power bases often co-occurred with one or both categories that related to different stages of power dynamics (i.e., power processes and power outcomes). Multiple studies used these labels to organize their investigation of power dynamics; in one example a power base was occupation, power process was dominance and domineeringness, and power outcome was marital power 
(Vogel et al., 2007)
.
One construct, named social power, was measured with ad hoc items based on the taxonomy from French Jr. and 
Raven (1959)
 split into material and immaterial resources.
Similarly, some studies used developed items to assess the six bases of power from Raven et al. POWER MEASURES (1998 1 ) including reward power, coercive power, expert power, legitimate power, referent power, and information power (1 item per base; listed in 
Table 3
). Other scales listed in 
Table 3
 did not solely measure power and therefore were proxies. To distinguish multi-item scales, we list the demographic items under ad hoc scales, which were worded and scored uniquely in each study though we refer to these as proxy measures.
Many of the studies measuring power bases did not report the percentage heterosexual or percentage White. Eighteen studies reported samples that were 100% heterosexual, 9 were 100% White, and 8 were 0% White. On average, the samples were 62.25% married and 69.62%
women. Roughly half of the studies were about relationship functioning during established relationships, but at least one of each study type (e.g., violence, sex, initiation, dissolution) used power base measures. 
Table S1
 shows that the countries in which power base measures were used match the overall review with no clear trends.


Decision-making/ division of household tasks
Household labor, decisions about activities, finances, friends, and childcare were discussed in terms of being power in the home. The concept of decision-making was often based on subjective or objective judgments by the participants about different decisions likely to arise (k = 68). The Marital Power Scale 
(Coleman & Straus, 1986)
, Power Perceptions and Power Satisfaction Scale 
(Ronfeldt et al., 1998)
, Role Measure of Conjugal Power 
(Bahr, 1972)
, Attitudes toward Power Ascription Scale 
(Hafner, 1984)
, Decision-Making Scale 
(Gray-Little, 1982)
, and Inventory of Specific Relationship Standards 
(Baucom et al., 1996)
 were each only POWER MEASURES used once. Decision-making, or "final say," judgments in relationships, were often assessed as an outcome of power dynamics.
The concept of division of household tasks mostly relied on ad hoc items covering a wide variety of tasks within the home, childcare, or other chores typical for families. There were two task indices based on prior work, Household and Child Care Task Index 
(SFI, 2009)
 and Household Decision-making Index 
(Mizan, 1993)
, as well as other scales like the Relative Share of Labor Scale 
(Baxter, 2002)
 and Who Does What Questionnaire 
(Cowan & Cowan, 1988)
.
Even though several scales were cited for decision-making/ division of household tasks, often only parts of the scales, fewer items, or some alterations were made. The other 55 measures were unnamed but may have been based on existing prior work. Example items included "who cooks the meals," "how you and your spouse should divide up household tasks," "hours spent on different household tasks," "relative influence on how much to spend on housing," and "who has the final say in making the decision." Oftentimes, the items reflected domestic labor that was considered traditionally feminine (e.g., Who cooks dinner? Who puts children to bed?) and items were rated as being done by the husband, both spouses, or by the wife. Similar items were meant to represent women's empowerment if women were reported to have some say in the decisions, like women's own health care or child's health care, major household purchases, and visits to family or relatives.
For studies using these scales, two were partially or completely about relationship termination, some were about intimate partner violence (12), and most others were about relationship functioning in established relationships. The countries where the most studies were conducted were North America (64.71%) or Asia (17.64%) and most of the samples were married on average (83.47%).


POWER MEASURES


Relationship power
General relationship power and the next category, power balance, were attempts to measure the unspoken and subjective question, "who has more power," that is not easily addressed by tangible items, like "who decides on the family vacation." Ad hoc measures in this area tended to cite past works and build upon the procedures used 
(Table 4)
. However, the validity of these items together was not established. Content overlap was evident from example questions and the cross-listing of scales. For example, Power Perception and Power Satisfaction Questionnaire was also used to measure decision-making. Based on study descriptions and study labels, we made the decision to categorize the measures differently.
The most common measure was the Sense of Power Scale 
(Anderson et al., 2012)
, which was derived from college samples. It was used as a global, generalized measure of personal power or a role specific assessment of power (e.g., at work, friends, romantic partner). The second most common was the Relationship Power Inventory 
(Farrell et al., 2015)
. The Sense of Power Scale and Relationship Power Inventory were always measured continuously, usually included all items, and were rated using Likert-type scales. Study types included one study of attraction (Sense of Power Scale), two studies per scale loosely focused on relationships, and the majority were about relationship functioning. The Sense of Power Scale was mostly used in North America (7) followed by Oceania (6), and Asia (5) using 100% heterosexual samples 
12
or undisclosed. The Relationship Power Inventory was used exclusively in North America on 100% heterosexual samples (6) or undisclosed. The samples using relationship power scales were a much higher average percentage White (73.25%) but lower average percentage women (52.35%) and married (50.63%). Taken together, the relationship power measures were focused on White, younger, and heterosexual men and women in shorter-length relationships.


POWER MEASURES


Power/ equity/ balance
Numerous named and cited scales were each used only once or twice to measure balance or equity within the relationship (k = 57). No scale had majority use. Power, equity, and balance differed from the relationship power measures in that they used balance and equity or items using semantic differentials from 'me' to 'you' or 'inequality' to 'equality.' However, there were strong similarities in the content of these two categories. The scale list included The Dependency Scale 
(Attridge et al., 1998)
, Desire for Power Scale 
(Williams et al., 2017)
, Final Say Measure of Marital Power 
(Allen & Straus, 1984
), Kurdek's Equality subscale from Relationship Values Scale 
(Kurdek, 1995
(Kurdek, , 1996
), Traupmann's Equity Scale 
(Traupmann et al., 1981)
, Marital Perceived Equity Scale 
(Sexton & Perlman, 1989)
, and Marital Power Index 
(Bogue et al., 2008)
. Even more ad hoc single items or sets of items were used to define marital power, equality/equity, balance, power imbalance, power, perceived power, fairness of power, power perception, relative power, investment, dependence, and dominance. For concepts like investment or dependence, the researchers often drew on interdependence theory linking increased investment with lower power. Thus, the focus of the power measure was on unequal investment.
Example items of ad hoc measures were "in general, who do you feel holds most of the power in your arrangement," "in your relationship, who would you say is generally in charge," "0 to 100 how much power do you have in your relationship with your spouse," and "how fair do you find your amount of effort and amount of power in your relationship." Ad hoc measures were between 1 and 40 items per study with an average of 3.94 items (SD = 7.02). Different measures rated balance from 'self' to 'partner' or 'inequality' to 'equality' or some other variation. In the first rating example, the midpoint is equality, and we obtain information about POWER MEASURES which direction the power is unbalanced. In the second example, we only determine that there is an imbalance. The different rating systems make results hard to compare within the power/equity category and between categories because high and low scores are not equivalent conceptually.
Similar to the relationship power measures, the power equity scales were higher percentage White on average (73.81%) and lower percentage married on average (50.18%).
Forty-two of the studies were in North America followed by 4 in Africa and 3 in Europe.


Power outcomes/ socioemotional variables
The power outcomes were sometimes differentiated within the article as being the outcome of power bases and strategies, or they encompassed socioemotional variables that are often studied separately from power dynamics. These variables therefore are proxies to the presumed results of the underlying dynamics of the relationship. For example, dyadic adjustment was used to measure power dynamics. From theory, it is expected that adjustment is a result of finding a power dynamic that works well for the couple. Adjustment, satisfaction, and socioemotional variables are the results of the power dynamics, and each have their own welldeveloped literature. Evident from the scales listed in 
Table 5
 is that many of these were relationship satisfaction measures. Therefore, despite 52.22% of the measures being established, they were not validated for these purposes. On average, these samples were 91.68% heterosexual, 80.92% White, and 54.98% women.


Power processes/ power strategies
Power processes related to the influence strategies enacted to get one's way, whereas power outcomes were assessments of the success of influence tactics as well as other socioemotional variables (e.g., commitment, dependence) that may be impacted by power POWER MEASURES processes. A few scales related to influence strategies and process-oriented control were used (k = 27). Maddock Power and Control Scales 
(Maddock, 1990 unpublished)
, Influence Scale 
(Davis, 1975 dissertation)
, Inventory of Marital Conflicts 
(Olson & Ryder, 1970)
 
Baucom et al., 1996)
, modified power tactic behaviors 
(Bui et al., 1994)
, French Jr. and 
Raven's (1959)
 concept of coercion, and direct power strategies adapted from 
Falbo and Peplau's (1980)
 research.
Observational coding schemes were also used to assess power processes (e.g., Inventory of Specific Relationship Standards) and pursuit withdrawal.
Example items from ad hoc measures were "when I need my partner's assistance, he/she is there to help me," "I am willing to offer to do something pleasant for you, if you would comply," "I believe that doing it my way would really be in your best interests," and "I drop hints or make suggestions about what I want." The demographics and countries of the participants in this category closely matched the average of all studies reported earlier.


Individual differences
The individual differences category encompassed beliefs, values, ideologies, general power perception, desires or need for power, and individual differences items (k = 22). Gender ideology was one of the most common to be grouped here. Multiple scales, like the GEM Scale 
(Pulerwitz & Barker, 2008)
, Sex Role Egalitarianism Scale 
(King & King, 1997)
, Sex Role POWER MEASURES Attitudes Scale 
(Huber & Spitze, 1983)
, Traditional Family Ideology Scale 
(Levinson & Huffman, 1955)
, and ad hoc items were used. The Power and Attitudes in Relationships Scale 
(Sherman et al., 2000)
 was defined as beliefs about power in heterosexual relationships rather than an assessment of one's own power, and therefore was grouped under individual differences.
Ad hoc measures were labeled as need for power, desired control or intimacy, male dominance, achieved power, daily situation power, locus of control, and similar. Example items were "I prefer having more influence than my partner in our joint decision-making," "how willing are you to change your own behavior, preferences, or goals to resolve the problems that exist in your relationships," and "I needed support from my partner." All of the studies that reported sexual orientation were 100% heterosexual (13 samples reported). Thirteen samples were in North America and 4 in East Asia, yet the samples were not primarily White on average (40.87%) partially due to infrequently reporting racial identity (15 undisclosed).


Control
Fear, aggression, abuse, intimate partner violence, and control were categorized together into the negative behavioral side of physically implementing power (k = 22). The Revised Conflict Tactics Scale 
(Straus et al., 1996)
, Revised Controlling Behaviors Scale (Graham-Kevan & Archer, 2005), SAFE 
(Smith et al., 2013)
, Woman Abuse Screening Tool 
(Fogarty & Brown, 2002)
, Anticipated Symbolic Aggression subscale 
(Straus, 1979)
, and a number of items about controlling or limiting behaviors and agreement with attitudes and justifications for abuse were used. Given that a large proportion of the studies reviewed were about power and violence, using violence measures to assess power was especially problematic because the independent and dependent variables were conflated. Examples of ad hoc items were "has your partner ever pushed you, thrown something at your that could hurt you, punched you, or slapped you," POWER MEASURES "whether your partner generally prohibits or controls your ability to carry out everyday activities (e.g., visit family or friends)," "my spouse would threaten to hit me or throw something at me,"
and "I try not to cause any problems with my partner because I am afraid of what he might do." Some of these items reflect coercive control, which is one manifestation of intimate partner violence. One of the challenges with studying power and violence is that relationship power should describe the normative levels of control that partners may have over each other leaving coercive control or abusive behaviors to be distinctly different. Eighteen samples reported sexual orientation, and all were 100% heterosexual, and a large percentage, on average, were women (84.86%) who were reporting on their experiences of being controlled or abused and/or their experiences controlling or abusing. Six of the samples were from Africa and 9 were from North America.


Discussion
We conducted a comprehensive review of the relationship power literature to evaluate the multitude of ways in which relationship power dynamics have been conceptualized and measured in practice. The compiled literature and database of power measures is extremely valuable for future researchers trying to determine how and what to measure to study power dynamics. There was a large variety from study to study in the power construct used and types of studies conducted. We created nine categories to encompass the scales, proxies, and ad hoc measures used in practice. The nine categories in order from most to least common were sexual relationship power, power bases/structural power, decision-making/division of household tasks, relationship power, power/equity/balance, power outcomes/socioemotional variables, power processes/power strategies, individual differences, and control. The categories reflect nine common conceptualizations of power that varied in the item content, operationalization and POWER MEASURES naming within studies, response rating system, samples used to investigate, and match between measures and theory. The sample and study design of each power category are succinctly presented in 
Table S1
 and the review data are shared on OSF.
The first and most prolific category was sexual relationship power, which was often studied in the context of HIV risk, safe sex practices, and intimate partner violence. The Sexual Relationship Power Scale was one of the single most used scales measuring relationship control and decision-making dominance regarding sex in a relationship. The sexual relationship power category was the most diverse with respect to racial identity/ethnicity and nationality in the samples studied. The next most frequent power category was power bases/structural power, which was most often made up of proxy measures such as income, education, employment, and other indicators of resources or relationship dependence. There were no established scales used repeatedly that were developed specifically with power bases in mind. The Basis of Social Power Scale by French Jr. and 
Raven (1959)
 and 
Raven et al. (1998)
 was the closest to an established power base scale; however, research has not consistently used this measure. Studies measuring structural power were varied in the focus of the study, but about half were focused on established relationship maintenance. The third category was decision-making/division of household tasks defined as objective or subjective judgments about different decisions or chores in the relationship/home. Decision-making was often discussed as being an outcome of the underlying power dynamics, whereas division of labor may lend itself to providing one partner more power if they control the home resources. Yet, the item content was remarkably similar. These studies were largely on married people in North America or East Asia.
Fourth, the general relationship power category measured the underlying relationship dynamics including getting one's way, making decisions, being able to influence the partner, and POWER MEASURES resist the partner. The two scales used multiple times each were the Sense of Power Scale and the Relationship Power Inventory. The Relationship Power Inventory followed from the DPSIM theory and therefore incorporates multiple aspects important in theory 
(Farrell et al., 2015;
Simpson et al., 2015)
. The items reflected power processes, power outcomes, and the dyadic nature of power rated on a bidimensional scale. Along with the subsequent category, these studies were largely on White people in North America in newer relationships rather than married. The equity/balance category used numerous scales and ad hoc measures to assess an imbalance in the dynamics. Some of the scales were about what was valued in the relationship, e.g., 
Kurdek'
s Equality subscale 
(Kurdek, 1995
(Kurdek, , 1996
, rather than necessarily examining the actual relationship. The sixth category was power outcomes/socioemotional variables, or the results of influence attempts. As a result, these measures focused on constructs like commitment, unity, and the importance of the relationship in the construal of the self. These measures were often more familiarly used to measure relationship quality. However, the theories of power do not propose specifically that any indicator of relationship quality is akin to the power outcomes.
In fact, lower dependence on the relationship may be a resource constituting a base of power 
(Thibaut & Kelley, 1959)
. Whether relationship dependence or other relationship quality measures are bases or outcomes of power is an important question that has not been addressed in past research. The assumptions by different researchers that it is one or the other and, therefore, a proxy for power is problematic framing in past research. Theoretically, power outcomes are the results of influences, so they should be attitudes, behaviors, decisions, or changes in them from one's original opinion 
(Simpson et al., 2015)
. The seventh category was power processes/power strategies, or the influence ability a person has, and there was not a common measure used in this area. However, the items are built on the idea of bargaining and persuading. POWER MEASURES Few studies discussed the final two categories, individual differences or control, as measures of power dynamics, yet there were distinctions in the content of these measures compared to the other categories. Individual differences, personality, and ideologies encompassed measures of general tendencies or attitudes rather than the specific dynamics within a partnership. For instance, these measures were about a need for power rather than a judgment of the current power in one's relationship. Most often the measures were gender role attitudes scales. Studies that reported sexual orientation were all heterosexual but included racially and ethnically diverse samples. Control power measures were important to distinguish from the other power categories because of how overlapping their content was with intimate partner violence or coercive control, which was often a dependent variable in power research.
For the control studies that reported sexual orientation, they were all heterosexual and most of the samples were largely women reporting experiences of being controlled or abused. In the results we listed all the scales under each category to help future researchers choose a measure or to take additional steps to validate existing or new scales. Incorporating valid measures of bases, processes, and outcomes of power would be especially beneficial to match measurement to theory.


Differences in Measurement and Applicable Contexts
Lack of consensus on the construct of relationship power dynamics and ideal scales to measure it can stifle the progress of important research questions. Few of the reviewed scales were developed based on one or multiple theories of power. Some scales focused on one domain of power, sex and control [e.g., Sexual Relationship Power Scale 
(Pulerwitz et al., 2000)
] or material and immaterial resources 
(French Jr. & Raven, 1959;
Raven et al., 1998)
. Of the scales reviewed, we encourage researchers to use a general relationship power style measure that 29 POWER MEASURES proposed to measure the balance or underlying decision-making that is non-specific to married couples composed of one man and one woman and non-specific to any individual decision. Great examples were the Relationship Power Inventory and to a lesser extent the Sense of Power Scale.
The Relationship Power Inventory considered outcome and process within the measurement development without tapping into third constructs, like satisfaction or demographics, and it assesses power of the self and perceived power of the partner 
(Farrell et al., 2015)
. Unlike other scales used in practice, the Relationship Power Inventory was developed based on theory and taps into multiple of the nine power categories (i.e., power process and power outcomes; 
Simpson et al., 2015)
.
Alterations and scoring of the measures also differed across studies. Although multiple studies used structural power bases like education, employment, or age, there were discrepancies in whether age conveyed higher resources or whether the relative age between partners conveyed higher resources. The chosen analysis strategies were under-specified for these common proxies of power bases. Many papers do not refer to theoretical reasons for choosing age or relative age; decisions for analysis appear to be interpretability or convenience. Going back to the example in the introduction, it is likely not the case that any association with age is reflective of power associations, so perhaps the measures of resources should derive from the relevant literature 
(Raven et al., 1998)
 or latent variable measurement with multiple proxy structural power base variables should be used. Profile analysis and principal components were used extremely rarely to create a power base factor from the multiple indicators, and latent variable measurement was even rarer to measure the common shared variance between multiple proxies of the same power construct. To move forward in the field, we require comparability and agreement on appropriate POWER MEASURES constructs to measure power dynamics; thus, we put forth starting with measures that derived directly from theory.
We note that the Sexual Relationship Power Scale was developed within a specific context to do research on HIV/AIDS. For this reason, it is important to not consider the measure an assessment of general relationship power dynamics to be used in other situations. It is a valuable scale that should be used more consistently using standardized cutoffs or primarily as continuous scales (see also 
McMahon et al., 2015)
. Validation between the Sexual Relationship Power Scale and other relationship power measures should be evaluated to determine how sexual decisions and control are related to general power dynamics.
The different rating systems of power measures also greatly limit the comparability of results. Thus, as one measure may be assessing the presence (or lack) of a balance, another assesses whether 'me' or 'my partner' hold greater power, whereas others assess whether the respondent would rate themselves from low to high. Although multiple theories posit that power is dyadic in nature 
(Simpson et al., 2015)
, the different scaling creates challenges in the interpretation of results and comparisons between studies. Future validation studies should evaluate what scaling is most appropriate. Given current evidence that suggests that self-power and perceived partner-power are distinct constructs, measures that are rated from self to partner are unlikely to provide the best information in future studies 
([anonymized]
, RR Stage 1, 2024; 
Overall et al., 2023)
. Similarly, equality ratings do not distinguish in what way the power is unbalanced and so these measures may not provide as much information as subjective assessments of the self-ratings versus subjective assessments of the relationship ratings. Proxy scales, like satisfaction or commitment, were not always elaborated within studies to convey which conferred low or high power based on theory. For meaningful associations to be POWER MEASURES understood, clarity in the response rating systems would enhance the link from empirical research to theory.
Limitations to the current review were found in the reporting of constructs where some authors did not disclose any details about scales, questions, or range of responses. Multiple studies cited unpublished manuscripts, dissertations, or stated that their items were drawn from existing scales without specifying using the full established measure. We drew on multidisciplinary fields to not limit the discussion to psychology or closely related fields, which kept the results we presented broad as most studies included some psychological constructs despite conducting safer sex interventions, for example. Although we captured Cronbach's alphas from studies that reported it, we did not discuss reported measures of reliability. Future studies should use the lists of scales presented to examine the construct validity and reliability of the power measures, especially regarding discriminant validity with socioemotional variables and stronger criterion-related validity for relationship functioning measures, to determine which measures are more appropriate to use in further research. We put forth some suggestions on which measures may be more appropriate to study power processes and power outcomes as well as ways to improve the power bases, but construct validity still needs to be established for these suggested measures and any others that are used in the field. Construct validity will help researchers determine which of the measures reviewed here is or is not appropriate to use in further power research.
In addition, most of the reviewed literature was on already established relationships. The studies focused on sex behaviors were mixed between current partners, extradyadic partners, or casual hookups. Less is known about power dynamics in choosing to date and define oneself in a relationship with a partner or ending a relationship. Furthermore, 60 of the studies reported a POWER MEASURES longitudinal design that was often not analyzed with repeated measures. Many of these designs were multi-stage interventions and power dynamics were not often measured repeatedly.
Therefore, quantitative examinations of the change in power dynamics from early in the relationship to later years has not been investigated.
Despite clear evidence that relationship power dynamics matter for individual emotional, individual health, and relational outcomes, one meta-analysis of dyadic effects of power suggested little influence on relationship quality or satisfaction 
(Joel et al., 2020)
. Specifically, the power of the partner as rated by the partner did not account for a large amount of variance of the actor's relationship outcomes. The subjective sense of how able a person feels to bring up issues, argue their point, and get their way remains important to the individual. Another challenge of the past theory and research was the overemphasis on men-women dyads despite the emphasis in the power literature (e.g., Theory of Gender and Power) on societal influences that lead to disparities in power between various privileged and underprivileged groups (e.g., men versus women, heterosexual versus gay/lesbian). In reality, relationships encompass all gender identities, all sexual orientations, relationship configurations, and relationship structures like polyamory or consensual non-monogamy 
(Hammack et al., 2019)
. A limited area of research focused on men, and women who were gay/lesbian 
(Kurdek, 2003;
Rostosky et al., 2006
Rostosky et al., , 2010
.
In the available literature, researchers point to some uniqueness in gay/lesbian relationships in that there is high value placed on equality. Overall, the perception of equality as important and beneficial to the relationship is consistent across same-gender relationships 
(Kurdek, 2001
(Kurdek, , 2003
(Kurdek, , 2005
Rostosky & Riggle, 2017)
. Broadly, there were few studies not focused on HIV or STIs that explicitly included gay, lesbian, bisexual, other sexual orientations, and transgender or gender nonconforming people (for exception see 
Haydon et al., 2020)
. POWER MEASURES Taken together, key areas for future research are more diverse relationship configurations and diverse identities of people in relationships, longitudinal research following people within one relationship and from relationship to relationship, and meta-analyses on the associations between relationship power and health and relational outcomes. First, the reviewed literature largely emphasized heterosexual relationships or in few cases same-gender relationships 
(Bosco et al., 2022;
Howard et al., 1986)
 and the vast majority of people were cisgender men or women; there were few transgender women or men but rarely gender nonbinary or gender nonconforming. Therefore, despite the emphasis in theory on the intertwined nature of sexuality and gender 
(Connell, 1987)
, the literature has not adapted appropriate approaches to examine diverse relationship configurations composed of different sexual orientations and gender identities beyond the common two by two design of heterosexual versus gay/lesbian men and women. Second, much of the reviewed research was cross-sectional meaning those that were longitudinal, including intervention designs, did not examine either how power changes over time within a relationship or how power changes within-person between partnerships. Both of these longitudinal questions are needed to draw together the literature on power processes, power outcomes, commitment, and relationship dissolution 
(Rusbult et al., 1991;
Thibaut & Kelley, 1959)
. Last, establishing criterion-related validity is one way to examine whether a measure shows construct validity; however, the expected correlates of power within health and relational outcomes has not been defined in theories. Therefore, it is a challenge to contrast the criterionrelated validity of different power measures if the expected associations have not been established. To that end, the first step for future research will be meta-analyzing correlates of different power measures. Although it is not ideal to work bottom-up in this manner, we hope to make use of the decades of power research that has used a vast array of measures by synthesizing POWER MEASURES across the different theoretical components of power (base, process, outcome) to understand what power is expected to relate to.


Conclusion
A majority consensus on how to measure power or even what to measure has stifled the development of the study of romantic relationship power dynamics. Psychological and sociological theories differ in the extent to which gender and sexuality are a central organizing principle by which to understand power within romantic relationships. Some measures build in gendered expectations within the rating systems or focus on the division of labor, whereas others allow for continuous ratings by both partners, which separates the individual-level from the systems-level. In reviewing the measures of power used across fields from 1981 to 2022, we found nine broad categories encompassed what was measured. The same constructs that are frequently studied independently of power (e.g., psychological aggression, satisfaction, dependence) were also used as power measures. The same scale was defined by different researchers as a power base versus general relationship power (e.g., love). These types of measurement practices lead to ambiguity in the findings that can be supported and interpreted with respect to power dynamics. The necessary next steps are to validate which measure taps well into the multiple dimensions of power and review what personal and relational outcomes are related to power dynamics. Both steps are needed to synthesize and programmatically move the power literature forward. POWER MEASURES
