You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Anchoring is a phenomenon whereby people's numeric judgments assimilate to previously considered, explicitly uninformative standards of comparison 
(Chapman & Johnson, 1999;
Strack & Mussweiler, 1997;
Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
. The anchoring effect has been documented in various domains, such as factual questions, estimates of distance and time, negotiations, legal judgments, and mathematics problems (for a review, see 
Furnham & Boo, 2011)
. While many studies show how anchoring affects numeric judgments, few consider how anchoring affects the choices that may rely on those judgments, and none focus on consumer choices.
Anchoring has been shown to influence preferential judgments, particularly willingnessto-pay (WTP), a widely used measure of consumer preferences 
(Adaval & Wyer, 2011;
Ariely, Loewenstein, & Prelec, 2003;
Bergman, Ellingsen, Johannesson, & Svensson, 2010;
Green, Jacowitz, Kahneman, & McFadden, 1998;
Simonson & Drolet, 2004;
Yoon, Fong, & Dimoka, 2019)
. In an influential study, 
Ariely et al. (2003)
 asked participants to state the maximum amount that they would be willing to pay for several market goods. Before providing their WTP, participants were asked whether they would purchase the item for a specified dollar amount, using the last two digits of their social security number as an arbitrary dollar amount; this amount served as the anchor. Even though the task was incentive compatible, participants' WTP was systematically influenced by the random price anchor, with higher random anchors resulting in higher WTP. 
Ariely et al. (2003)
 noted that relative preferences across items appeared to remain stable, creating an "illusion of order" they term "coherent arbitrariness." We extend these findings by exploring whether the effect of anchoring on consumer preferences is restricted to preferential judgments (i.e., WTP) or carries over into preferential choices.
Understanding the effect of anchoring on preferential choices will provide several important theoretical and practical contributions. Firstly, our findings partly contradict the notion of coherent arbitrariness in preferences. In 
Ariely et al. (2003)
, a single anchor was used across six market goods for each subject. Using a single anchor does not provide a strong test of the stability of relative preferences. By varying the anchoring value across different items, we examine whether arbitrary anchors can generate preference reversals, breaking the illusion of order. In our experiments, we consistently find WTP reversals, where the relative valuations (i.e., WTP rank orderings) of items change based on their respective anchors. These WTP reversals indicate less coherence in relative preferences than implied by 
Ariely et al. (2003)
.
However, we find that the WTP reversals do not always translate into choice reversals, establishing a boundary on anchoring-induced incoherence. Some participants even make choices inconsistent with the valuations they had assigned moments beforehand. While higher WTP has generally been interpreted as indicating higher preferences, consumers sometimes display inconsistent preferences across preference elicitation tasks, because they focus on different aspects when evaluating an item individually, as opposed to jointly evaluating items in a choice set (e.g., 
Hsee, Loewenstein, Blount, & Bazerman, 1999;
O'Donnell & Evers, 2019)
.
Furthermore, the principle of scale compatibility 
(Chapman & Johnson, 1994;
Tversky, Slovic, & Kahneman, 1990)
 would suggest that anchoring is more likely to affect numeric judgments on the same scale (e.g., both the anchor and WTP are measured in dollars), whereas a discrete choice response is provided on a different scale from the anchor.
Regarding practical implications, preference anchoring studies have focused on a handful of numeric judgments, generally, WTP or willingness-to-accept (WTA), that do not necessarily establish the potential to affect market outcomes. One approach to address this is to use a metaanalysis to better assess the effect size and moderating factors, and a recent effort found a smaller average effect size relative to the earliest reported studies 
(Li, Maniadis, & Sedikides, 2021)
. Their analysis also suggests that scale compatibility moderates the effect of anchoring on valuations. Prior research has also tested anchoring on WTP in field settings, which found an asymmetrically stronger effect of low anchors on prices under a pay-what-you-wish mechanism (e.g., 
Jung, Perfecto, & Nelson, 2016)
. Another approach has been to embed the anchoring procedure in a setting that generates market outcomes, which found a double auction was unaffected by anchoring 
(Ioannidis, Offerman, & Sloof, 2020)
 1 . We complement these efforts by examining the effect on a simple choice task familiar to consumers, which resembles consumer behavior in certain contexts.
Our findings further our understanding of the relationship between judgment and choice in consumer decision making. When consumers make buying decisions, they may need to make valuation judgments to decide whether they are willing to pay the price offered to them. Thus, a decision on whether to buy a product evaluated in isolation can be influenced by valuation anchoring. However, valuation anchoring does not affect choices between products evaluated head-to-head. This implies that valuation judgments do not necessarily factor directly into consumer choice -surprisingly, even when valuations are elicited immediately prior to choice.
Anchoring on preferential judgments could, in some situations, directly affect consumers making WTP decisions, such as customers of direct-to-consumer brands 
(Droesch, 2020;
Ingrassia, 2020)
, or pay-what-you-wish pricing for museums or charitable donations (e.g., 
Jung et al., 2016
). However, in many settings, consumer decision making takes the form of choice (e.g., purchasing a product displayed with other brands). In such contexts, anchors that affect valuations (such as reference prices or opening bids) may have limited impacts on market outcomes.


Background


Judgment and Choice Preference Reversals
While normative theories of preferences imply that people should exhibit the same preference regardless of the preference elicitation methods, people often display inconsistent preferences depending on the preference elicitation method or the decision contexts 
(Tversky et al., 1990)
. For example, in an early preference reversal study, 
Lichtenstein and Slovic (1971)
 found that participants tended to prefer a gamble which had a higher possible gain in a judgment task when gambles were evaluated separately, while they tended to prefer a gamble which had a higher probability of winning in a choice task. This is because participants focus on the amount they can earn from the gambles in the judgment task, whereas they focus more on the probability to get positive outcomes in the choice task 
(Tversky et al., 1990)
. Thus, a higher preference in judgments does not necessarily indicate a higher preference in choices.
Similarly, while higher WTP has generally been interpreted as indicating higher preferences, consumers often show inconsistent preferences between preference elicitation tasks 
(Hsee et al., 1999;
Lichtenstein & Slovic, 1971;
Nowlis & Simonson, 1997;
O'Donnell & Evers, 2019;
Schkade & Johnson, 1989)
. In particular, people focus on different aspects when evaluating an item individually as opposed to jointly evaluating items in a choice set, resulting in preference reversals. High evaluability features (e.g., whether a dictionary has defects or not) tend to matter more in single evaluations, whereas low evaluability features (e.g., how many word entries the dictionaries have) matter more in joint evaluations 
(Hsee, 1996;
Hsee et al., 1999)
. Unlike judgment tasks where an item is presented and evaluated individually, choice decisions inevitably accompany comparisons between alternatives, resulting in inconsistent preferences in single evaluation and choice contexts 
(Brenner, Rottenstreich, & Sood, 1999;
Hsee et al., 1999;
Hsee & Zhang, 2004)
. Similar inconsistencies have been observed in studies on anchoring and choice, but in contexts outside typical consumer decision making.
Furthermore, whether anchoring results in inconsistencies may depend on the anchoring mechanisms in play, which can differ by judgment domain (e.g., factual questions vs. preferences).


Anchoring and Choice
The majority of anchoring studies focus on a single numeric judgment following standard anchoring procedures, or following a sequence of numeric judgments where a previous numeric judgment serves as an anchor (e.g., 
Mochon & Frederick, 2013)
. To our knowledge, only two prior studies have investigated the effect of anchor-influenced numeric judgments on choice decisions. In both cases, anchoring effects did not carry over to measurable effects on choice, but neither addressed WTP or a consumer choice context. 
Ariely et al. (2003)
, participants registered higher WTA for listening to annoying sounds after previewing the sounds and considering high anchors, compared with low anchors. However, in a subsequent choice task where participants were asked to choose between listening to the annoying sounds for 30 seconds or experiencing pressure from a vise for 30 seconds, the anchor did not affect choices between the annoying sound or the vise pressure.


In Study 5 of
While having theoretical relevance pertaining to the nature of preferences, the stimuli were, by design, unrepresentative in that consumers were unfamiliar with the options and would not typically confront such a situation. Also, WTA has been found to have less robust anchoring effects than WTP 
(Li et al., 2021)
. Finally, the study was conducted with too small a sample size (N=44) to discern effects in a binary choice task. Our combined sample size (N=1,726) allows us to more precisely estimate a choice effect that we find to be small, if it exists. 
Brewer, Chapman, Schwartz, and Bergus (2007)
 investigated the effect of irrelevant numeric anchors on doctors' and patients' judgments on the probability of having or transmitting a disease (HIV or pulmonary embolism), and how the judgments biased by anchoring influenced the subsequent treatment choice. Two studies found that anchoring influenced patients' (N=99) and physicians' (N=191) perceived probability of getting the disease, but it did not influence the subsequent treatment choice decision. However, the target quantity of the anchoring, a subjective probability, differs markedly from a valuation judgment and is arguably further removed from treatment choices than valuations are from product choices.


Anchoring Mechanisms and Predicted Effects on Choice
While it may seem self-evident that a manipulation affecting valuations should affect choice shares in the same direction, predictions may differ depending on the anchoring mechanisms in play. The literature has offered multiple accounts for the mechanisms underlying anchoring effects, and to further complicate matters, more than one could be operative for a given population and task. Different anchoring mechanisms diverge on whether anchoring entails representational changes of the targets as perceived by decision makers, or anchoring reflects the use of different response scales without representational changes. If anchoring affects the overall impression of products, anchoring should not only affect preferential judgments, but also affect preferential choices. However, if anchoring is the result of the use of distorted response scales, it may be the case that anchoring affects preferential judgments, but not preferential choices. Thus, conflicting predictions for anchoring effects on preferential judgments and choices can help us to differentiate between competing theories of anchoring on preferences.
Anchoring effects were initially explained as the result of insufficient adjustment from the anchor 
(Epley & Gilovich, 2001
, 2006
Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
. For example, in a task where a person is asked to estimate the distance between San Francisco to New York in miles 
Jacowitz & Kahneman, 1995)
, when the person is asked whether the distance is shorter or longer than 1,500 miles (or 6,000 miles), they start to adjust from the standard of comparison and stop the adjustment when they reach a plausible answer. However, the adjustment tends to be insufficient, so numeric estimates appear to assimilate to the anchors.
Plausible estimates usually consist of a range rather than a point estimate, so people stop adjusting when they reach the upper bound of the plausible answer range when a higher anchor is given, whereas they stop adjustment when they reach the lower bound of the plausible answer range when a low anchor is given. In a preferential judgment task, anchoring effects on WTP might reflect the upper and lower bounds of their plausible WTP range, indicating indifferent consumer preferences. However, anchoring effects derived from "thick indifference curves" should weakly maintain the rank ordering of preferences. Based on the classic insufficient adjustment account, we predict a significant anchoring effect on WTP, but neither WTP reversals nor choice reversals.
The selective accessibility account suggests that anchoring occurs because an anchor induces people to consider the given anchor as a possible answer for the given question and retrieve information to address that query 
(Mussweiler & Strack, 1999
, 2000
Strack, Bahník, & Mussweiler, 2016;
Strack & Mussweiler, 1997)
. This leads to higher accessibility for anchor consistent information, and people's reliance on the accessed information contributes to the biased estimates. For example, 
Mussweiler and Strack (2000)
 showed that participants who considered whether the average price of a new car is higher or lower than 40,000 German marks (high anchor) showed faster response times for expensive car words (e.g., Mercedes, BMW, limousine), while those who considered whether the price is higher or lower than 20,000 German marks (low anchor) showed faster response times for inexpensive car words (e.g., Golf, Opel, Fiesta) in a subsequent lexical decision task. The results imply that the high (low) price activates information relevant to expensive (inexpensive) cars, and the activated information is used when they estimate the price of the target car. The selective accessibility account also has been tested using a process-tracing method. Using a Mouselab paradigm, 
Chapman and Johnson (1999)
 found that, in a WTP task for apartment rents, participants searched more and spent longer time on a dominating attribute in a high anchor condition, while they searched more and spent longer time on a dominated attribute in a low anchor condition.
Based on the selective accessibility account, people tend to activate anchor consistent information during the judgment process, which can influence people's perception of the target items 
(Mussweiler, 2003)
. Thus, anchoring is not limited to response distortions, but rather entails representational changes of the target items that can have persistent effects. 
Blankenship, Wegener, Petty, Detweiler-Bedell, and Macy (2008)
 and 
Mussweiler (2001)
 have shown that thoughtful consideration of anchors can induce durable effects (e.g., one-week) on participants' perception of the target items. Thus, based on the accessibility account, we predict that anchoring should result in directionally consistent effects on WTP, WTP reversals, and choice.
An alternative explanation of anchoring, scale distortion theory, suggests that anchoring is caused by the use of different response scales in accordance with given anchors, not by changes in the underlying mental representation of the target items 
(Frederick & Mochon, 2012;
Mochon & Frederick, 2013)
. For example, 
Frederick and Mochon (2012)
 asked participants to indicate the item closest to 400 calories from a set of food items with various calories ranges (from hard-boiled egg to Burger King Whopper with cheese). The results showed that participants who first estimated the calories for an average apple indicated a higher-calorie item as being closest to 400 calories, compared to those who did not first consider an apple. This implies that considering the caloric value of an average apple, a low anchor, made the participants perceive 400 calories as greater, showing a contrast effect.
A key distinction between selective accessibility and scale distortion is that scale distortion does not affect the underlying representation of the target items. If anchoring entails representational changes of the target items, we could observe anchoring effects using different response scales (e.g., weight using a 7-point Likert scale) with the scale of the anchor (e.g., weight in pounds). However, supporting the principle of scale compatibility, 
Frederick and Mochon (2012)
 found that the compatibility between the units of the anchor and the target question is a necessary condition for anchoring. Under this mechanism, anchoring does not affect the overall impression of an item, or the relative preferences of items. Based on scale distortion theory, we predict that anchoring affects WTP, with directionally consistent WTP reversals. The effect would not carry over to preferential choices, as anchoring does not cause representational changes of the target items, and WTP and choice do not employ the same response scale. This paper is organized as follows. Across six experiments (Study 1 -Study 6), we replicate the anchoring effect on WTP and test whether the anchoring effect could have a spillover effect in a following preferential choice with slight variations in experimental procedures. Pooling the results of the six experiments, we also conduct a within-study metaanalysis 
(Mcshane & Böckenholt, 2017)
 to assess the robustness of anchoring effects on preferential judgments and choices. Theoretical and practical implications and future research directions are discussed.


Study 1. The effect of anchoring on WTP and Choice


Method
A total of 359 participants (Mage = 36.06 years old, SD = 11.63, female = 177) from Amazon Mechanical Turk participated in this study in exchange for a cash payment, and two items were used (a cordless mouse and a Bluetooth keyboard). Participants were first randomly assigned into one of the two conditions; control condition where participants received either low ($8) or high ($55) anchors for both items vs. manipulation condition where participants received a low anchor for one item and a high anchor for the other item. Participants were given the two items with randomization and were asked to answer two questions for each item following a classic preference anchoring paradigm 
(Ariely et al., 2003)
: (1) whether they would be willing to buy the item for a random price with an instruction that the random price is randomly generated by the computer (WTB; Yes vs. No) and 
2
what is the most they would be willing to pay (WTP in dollar amounts). After answering these two questions, participants were asked to choose either the cordless mouse or the Bluetooth keyboard for a prize with an instruction that we will select three winners from a random drawing after completing data collection and the winners will receive an item they select. The key dependent variables were WTP and the prize selection. If anchoring affects both preferential judgments and choice, both WTP and choice share in the prize selection for the item associated with a high anchor will be higher than those for the item associated with a low anchor in the manipulation condition. In the analysis, we excluded a total of 31 respondents whose WTP was inconsistent (e.g., WTP was greater (or lower) than the given anchor ($55 or $8) after they said "No" (or "Yes") to purchase the item for the given anchor) or out of three standard deviations from the mean. Omitting either or both of these screening rules does not substantially change the results (see Web Appendix A for more information). All studies are approved by the Institutional Review Board of the institute where the authors were affiliated, and the data and analysis scripts are available on this paper's OSF project page (https://bit.ly/3S90vXn) 2 . The results of all studies are summarized in 
Table 1 and Table 2
.


Results
Willingness-to-pay. First, we examined the effect of anchoring on WTP. For the analysis, we treated anchor as a between-participant variable, because even though participants in the manipulation condition were given both a low anchor and a high anchor, they were given one anchor for each item. In the control condition (N=153), we found higher WTP in the high anchor condition than in the low anchor condition for both the cordless mouse (Mlow = $13.32, SD = 7.09 vs. Mhigh = $19.33, SD = 10.23; t(151) = 4.19, p < .001, d = 0.68) and the Bluetooth keyboard (Mlow = $17.86, SD = 7.96 vs. Mhigh = $29.42, SD = 13.25; t(151) = 6.48, p < .001, d = 1.06). Similarly, in the manipulation condition (N=175), WTP was higher in the high anchor condition than in the low anchor condition for both the cordless mouse (Mlow = $11.54, SD = 4.36 vs. Mhigh = $21.65, SD = 7.90; t(173) = 10.55, p < .001, d = 1.60) and the Bluetooth keyboards (Mlow = $15.80, SD = 8.24 vs. Mhigh = $33.14, SD = 16.57; t(173) = 8.69, p < .001, d = 1.32). The results indicate that anchoring significantly influenced participants' WTP.
We also tested whether anchoring could influence relative preference across items by comparing the average WTP between the two items. We focused on the Bluetooth keyboard (target item) because we had two items in the experiment. To test this, we assessed whether WTP for the target item was higher than that for the non-target item (cordless mouse) when the target item was associated with the high anchor than when it was associated with the low anchor in the manipulation condition where the two items had different levels of anchors. 92.22% of the participants showed higher WTP for the target item than the non-target item when the target item was associated with the high anchor, while 20% of the participants showed such a pattern when the target item was associated with the low anchor (χ 2 (1) = 93.11, p < .001, Cramer's V = .72).
The results indicate that anchoring can influence relative preference across items, breaking the relative coherent preference across items. Note: Low and high anchors in Studies 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are $8 and $55, and low and high anchors in Study 3 were $25 and $85, respectively + All t-test results were statistically significant at the 99.9% confidence level $ Combined treated high and low anchor conditions based on the associated anchor regardless of the item types in the manipulation conditions. Thus, paired-sample t-tests were conducted for comparing WTP responses.
Choice. Next, we investigated the effect of anchoring on a subsequent preferential choice.
Because the prize selection was a binary choice, we focused on the choice share of the Bluetooth keyboard in the two anchor conditions and ran a cross-tabulation analysis for the control and manipulation conditions respectively for the analysis. In the control condition, participants showed a slightly higher preference for the Bluetooth keyboard when they considered to purchase the keyboard for a low anchor than when they considered to purchase it for a high anchor, but the association between anchor and choice was not statistically significant (low anchor: 58.11% vs. high anchor: 51.90%; χ 2 (1) = 0.60, p = .440, Cramer's V = .05). In the manipulation condition, on the other hand, participants showed a higher preference for the Bluetooth keyboard when they considered to purchase it for a high anchor than when they considered to purchase it for a low anchor, and the association between anchor and choice was statistically significant (low anchor: 42.35% vs. high anchor: 62.22%; χ 2 (1) = 6.92, p = .009,
Cramer's V = .19). For a robust check, we also tested whether the effect of anchoring on the subsequent preference choice was moderated by the experimental conditions using a logistic regression analysis and found a significant interaction between anchor (-1: low anchor vs. 1: high anchor) and the two experiment conditions (-1: control condition vs. 1: manipulation condition; B = 0.83, SE = 0.15, z = 5.51, p < .001). The results indicate that providing two different levels of anchors not only influences preferential judgments but also could influence preferential choices. The main effect of anchor was statistically significant (B = 1.10, SE = 0.15, z = 7.34, p < .001), but the main effect of experimental conditions was not (B = -0.20, SE = 0.15, z = -1.34, p = .179). Note 1: Low and high anchors in Studies 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are $8 and $55, and low and high anchors in Study 3 were $25 and $85, respectively. Note 2: Across 6 studies, only Study 1 resulted in a significant effect of anchoring on choice. Chronologically, we conducted this study first, with a working hypothesis that anchoring on WTP would carry over into subsequent choices. Study 4 came next chronologically, designed to test the limits of the result in Study 1. When Study 4 failed to replicate Study 1, we ran Studies 5 and 6 to see if demand characteristics might account for the discrepancy. Finally, we ran Studies 2 and 3, more closely following the procedures of Study 1 to confirm that the initially observed choice effect did not somehow result from the specific procedures of that study. * These items indicate target items in the choice task


Study 2. Replication of Study 1 Method
The main aim of Study 2 was to replicate the findings of Study 1. Thus, we used the identical procedures to Study 1, except that we only employed the manipulation condition of Study 1. A total of 128 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and completed the study (Mage = 35.22 years old, SD = 11.79, female = 71, two participants did not provide demographic information). A total of eight participants' responses whose WTP was inconsistent or outside of three standard deviations from the mean were excluded.


Results
Willingness-to-pay. We found that participants stated higher WTP in the high anchor condition than in the low anchor condition for both the cordless mouse (low anchor: than that for the non-target item (cordless mouse) when the target item was associated with the high anchor, while 31.58% of them showed the pattern when the target item was associated with the low anchor (χ 2 (1) = 53.13, p < .001, Cramer's V = .65).
M = $
Choice. Unlike Study 1, participants in the high anchor condition showed an almost identical preference for the Bluetooth keyboard compared to those in the low anchor condition in the choice task (low anchor = 54.10% vs. high anchor = 54.24%; χ 2 (1) = 0.0002, p = .988, Cramer's V < .001).


Study 3. Replication of Study 1 with Items from the Same Product Category
In Study 1 and Study 2, participants made judgments on and made a choice between two different items (cordless mouse vs. Bluetooth keyboard), even though both can be categorized into the same category (e.g., computer accessories or computer input devices). It is possible that people use distinct processes when they compare between two subordinate categories (e.g., mouse vs. keyboard) of a bigger category (e.g., computer input devices) and when they compare between two items in the same subordinate category, since these two cases involve different semantic hierarchies 
(Mervis & Rosch, 1981;
Murphy & Lassaline, 1997)
 or thematic and taxonomic relations 
(Lewis, Poeppel, & Murphy, 2015;
Lin & Murphy, 2001
). Thus, in Study 3, we explored the effect of anchoring on WTP and a subsequent preferential choice using two items in the same item category.


Method
A total of 501 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk completed the study (Mage = 36.75 years old, SD = 12.18, female = 281). The overall procedures were identical to Study 1, except that we replaced the cordless mouse and the Bluetooth keyboard with two portable chargers of two different brands (Insignia vs. myCharge). Participants were randomly assigned to either the control condition in which a low or high anchor was provided for both portable chargers or the manipulation condition in which a low anchor was provided for one portable charger and a high anchor for the other portable charger. The two anchors were $85 (high anchor) and $25 (low anchor), which were $30 above and below from the average market price of the two portable chargers. Participants were asked to answer both WTB and WTP questions for the two portable chargers with randomization of the presentation order of the items.
End of the study, participants were asked to choose one of the two portable chargers with an instruction that we will select three winners from a random drawing after completing data collection and the winners will receive an item they select. We excluded a total of 63 participants' responses whose WTP was inconsistent or out of three standard deviations from the mean.


Results
Willingness-to-pay. We found significant anchoring effects on WTP in both the control and the manipulation conditions. In the control condition (N=240), the high anchor condition stated higher WTP than the low anchor condition for both the Insignia (Mlow = $23.78, SD = 9.84 vs. Choice. Because the prize selection was a binary choice task between Insignia and myCharge portable chargers, for the analysis, we focused on the choice share of the Insignia portable charger. We did not find a significant association between anchor and choice from the control condition. (low anchor = 82.24% vs. high anchor = 71.43%; χ 2 (1) = 3.83, p = .050, Cramer's V = .12), showing that there was no difference in preferences between the two portable chargers. In the manipulation condition, participants selected the Insignia portable charger more when they considered purchasing it for a low anchor than when they considered purchasing it for a high anchor, but the association between anchor and choice was not significant (low anchor = 70.33%
vs. high anchor = 68.22%; χ 2 (1) = 0.07, p = .749, Cramer's V = .01). Overall, consistent with previous experiments, we found significant anchoring effects on WTP but not on preferential choices.


Study 4. The Role of Preceding WTP Response
In Study 1, we found that anchoring affected both WTP and the subsequent preferential choice, but it is not clear whether the preceding WTP prompt is a necessary condition of the significant effect of anchoring on preferential choices or the significant anchoring effects on the preferential choice was driven by consistency motivation 
(Festinger, 1962)
. In Study 4, we aimed to replicate the findings of Study 1 and to examine whether answering WTP responses is a prerequisite of the significant anchoring effects on a subsequent preferential choice.


Method
The design was identical to Study 1, except that (1) half of the participants answered only WTB (No WTP condition) and the other half answered both WTB and WTP (WTP condition) before selecting an item for the prize, and that (2) we only employed the manipulation condition in Study 1 (i.e., a low anchor for one item and a high anchor for the other item). A total of 336 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk participated in this study 
(Mage = 36.53
 years old, SD = 11.51, female = 146). We excluded 16 participants' responses whose WTP was inconsistent or out of three standard deviations from the mean. . We also found that anchoring affected relative preference between the two items. 96.43% of the participants stated higher WTP for the target item (Bluetooth keyboard) than for the non-target item (cordless mouse) when the target item was associated with the high anchor, while 27.91% showed the pattern when the target item was associated with the low anchor (χ 2 (1) = 84.48, p < .001, Cramer's V = .69).


Results


Willingness
Choice. First, we tested whether we could replicate the significant effect of anchoring on a subsequent preferential choice in the WTP condition, but we failed to replicate the findings of Study 1. Participants showed a slightly higher preference for the Bluetooth keyboard when they considered purchasing it for a high anchor than when they considered purchasing it with a low anchor, but the association between anchor and choice was not significant (low anchor = 56.98%
vs. high anchor = 58.33%; χ 2 (1) = 0.03, p = .858, Cramer's V = .002). Not surprisingly, we did not find a significant effect of anchoring on the choice from the No WTP condition (N=150; low anchor = 61.11% vs. high anchor = 66.67%; χ 2 (1) = 0.50, p = .479, Cramer's V = .04). In summary, consistent with Study 1 and previous preference anchoring studies, the effect of anchoring on WTP was significant and led to relative preference reversals between items,
whereas the effect of anchoring on the subsequent preferential choice was not significant.


Study 5. Single Item Evaluation
It was possible that the inconsistent effect of anchoring on the subsequent preferential choice was due to the experimental design. In the manipulation condition of Studies 1, 2, and 3, participants clearly knew that one item was associated with a low price and the other item with a high price, followed by a forced choice task. Thus, the sense of being manipulated by the experimenter could influence the participants to behave negatively 
(Christensen, 1977)
 or positively 
(Nichols & Maner, 2008)
. In Study 5, to prevent possible demand characteristics, we slightly changed the protocol so that participants do not make a choice between items associated with two different levels of anchors.


Method
A total of 285 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk completed the study (Mage = 32.21 years old, SD = 10.31, female = 121; one participant did not provide demographic information). Unlike the previous two experiments, participants were asked to answer both WTB and WTP questions for only one item, a Logitech cordless mouse. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to the low anchor condition and the other half was assigned to the high anchor condition. The low and high anchors were the same as those used in Study 1. After answering both WTB and WTP questions, participants were shown the Logitech cordless mouse paired with a Microsoft cordless mouse and were asked to choose either the Logitech cordless mouse or the Microsoft cordless mouse for the prize. This design enables us to eliminate the possible demand characteristics driven by forcing participants to choose between an item associated with a high anchor and an item associated with a low anchor. Indeed, if there is any confounding effect from comparing a previously considered item with a new item, we could assume that the effect is the same in the low and the high anchor conditions. For the analysis, we excluded a total of 12 participants' responses whose WTP was not consistent or out of three standard deviations from the mean.


Results
Willingness-to-pay. We found significant anchoring effects on WTP. The high anchor condition (N=127) stated higher WTP than the low anchor condition for the Logitech cordless mouse (N=146; Mlow = $12.27, SD = 5.87 vs. Mhigh = $23.88, SD = 11.89; t(271) = 10.43, p < .001, d =


1.27).
Choice. To examine whether anchoring influenced the subsequent preferential choice, we focused on the choice share of the Logitech cordless mouse over the Microsoft cordless mouse in the prize selection between the two anchor conditions. The high anchor condition selected the Logitech cordless mouse slightly less than the low anchor condition (low anchor = 73.29% vs.
high anchor = 68.50%). However, the association between anchor and choice was not statistically significant. (χ 2 (1) = 0.76, p = .385, Cramer's V = .04).


Study 6. Replication of Study 5 Method
The aim of Study 6 was to replicate the findings of Study 5. Thus, we employed the identical procedures to Study 5, except that we replaced the Microsoft cordless mouse with another Logitech cordless mouse to rule out the possible effect of brand preferences. A total of 257 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and completed the study (Mage = 31.97 years old, SD = 10.35, female = 129; one participant did not provide demographic information). A total of 10 respondents' answers whose WTP was inconsistent or outside of three standard deviations from the mean were excluded in the analysis.


Results
Willingness-to-pay. Since we used two Logitech cordless mice, we call the Logitech cordless mouse used in the anchoring procedure the target item. Participants in the high anchor condition (N=123) stated higher WTP than those in the low anchor condition (N=124) for the target item (Mlow = $12.27, SD = 5.84 vs. Mhigh = $23.89, SD = 11.31; t(245) = 10.16, p < .001,
d = 1.30),
showing a significant anchoring effect on the preferential judgment.
Choice. In the subsequent preferential choice task, the high anchor condition showed a slightly lower preference for the target item than the low anchor condition, but the association between anchor and choice was not significant (low anchor = 63.71% vs. high anchor = 60.16%; χ 2 (1) = 0.33, p = .566, Cramer's V = .03).


Within-Study Meta-Analysis
Across six experiments, we consistently found significant anchoring effects on WTP and relative WTP ranks, whereas we found inconsistent anchoring effects on preferential choices. To examine the robustness of this incongruence, we conducted a within-study meta-analysis by pooling the data from Studies 1 -6.
We conducted three within-study meta-analyses;
(1) anchoring effects on WTP, 
2
anchoring effects on relative WTP rank (for the target items), and (3) anchoring effects on preferential choices. Since our interest was to investigate whether providing two different levels of anchors could affect preferential judgments, relative preferences, and choices, we focused our analyses on the target item of each study (i.e., the Bluetooth keyboard in Studies 1, 2, and 4, the Insignia portable charger in Study 3, and the Logitech cordless mouse in Studies 5 and 6).
Studies 1 and 3 had two conditions (Control condition vs. Manipulation condition), but as the control conditions were provided the same anchor (the low or high anchor) for both items, we did not include the Control conditions in the analysis. As participants stated WTP for only one item in Studies 5 and 6, we excluded these two studies for the WTP reversals. For the effect sizes, we used Cohen's d to examine the average effect of anchoring on WTP and log odds ratios to examine the average effect of anchoring on preferential choices and the WTP reversals. The analyses were conducted using metafor package embedded in R with random effect models 
(Viechtbauer, 2010)
.
The forest plots of the three meta-analyses are presented in 
Figure 1
. The result of the within-study meta-analysis for the effect of anchoring on WTP showed that the average difference of WTP between low and high anchor conditions was significant (average effect size = 1.27, SE = 0.16, z = 7.17, p < .001, 95% CI = [0.96, 1.57], 
Figure 1
, top-left). The average effect of anchoring on the WTP rank for the target items was also significant (average effect = 1.75, SE = 0.25, z = 7.00, p < .001, 95% CI = [1.26, 2.24]), showing that WTP rank for the target was higher when a high anchor was provided than when a low anchor was provided (bottom-left). However, the average effect of anchoring on preferential choices was not significant (average effect size = 0.02, SE = 0.08, z = 0.30, p = .762, 95% CI = 
[-0.13, 0.18])
, showing that considering an item priced at a high or low anchor did not affect the probability of choosing the item 
(Figure 1
, top-right).
We consistently found significant anchoring effects on WTP rank, while the effect of anchoring on preferential choices was not significant. In order to contrast these two findings, we directly compared the effect of anchoring on relative preferences between the items across the two elicitation tasks in Studies 1 -4. We regressed whether participants showed higher preferences for the target item (1: Yes vs. 0: No) on the anchor of the target item (-1: low anchor vs. 1: high anchor)
interacted with elicitation type (-1: WTP rank vs. 1: preferential choice). In Studies 1 -4, the effect of anchoring on relative preferences between the items was significantly higher for WTP rank than for preferential choices (see the full regression results in Web Appendix B). A within-study metaanalysis result also supported this pattern (average effect size = -0.88, SE = 0.13, z = -7.04, p <
.001, 95% CI = [-1.12, -0.63]; 
Figure 1
, bottom-right). 


Conclusions
We investigated whether the effect of anchoring on consumer preferences is restricted to preferential judgments (i.e., WTP), or whether the effect extends to preferential choices. The Effect Size (Cohen's d) results showed that the effect of anchoring on preferential judgments was robust and consistent across a series of experiments, consistent with the previous findings which showed significant anchoring effects on numeric judgments in other domains (e.g., factual questions). Participants would be willing to pay more when they considered purchasing an item for a high anchor than when they considered purchasing the item for a low anchor. Moreover, the results of a withinstudy meta-analysis for the effect of anchoring on WTP supported that the average difference in WTP between high and low anchor conditions was significant. The results imply that providing a high (low) anchor could significantly increase (decrease) the amount that consumers would be willing to pay for market goods.
We also found that anchoring affects relative preferences between items. In every comparison where two items were given different (high vs. low) anchors for the same participants, WTP rankings shifted consistently with the anchors, i.e., items receiving high anchors were ranked higher in terms of WTP more often than when receiving low anchors. These WTP rank reversals imply that anchoring can undermine the relative coherence of preferences with respect to WTP, in contrast to the findings in 
Ariely et al. (2003)
. They found that while WTP responses were arbitrarily influenced by irrelevant numbers, the relative preferences across items were stable (e.g., higher WTP for a rare wine than for an average wine across all the anchor quintile groups), a pattern they refer to as coherence. However, since the study provided the same anchor across all items for each participant, it did not provide a strong challenge to the coherence principle. In our study, we provided two different anchors for two market goods for each participant and found that anchoring can affect relative preferences. Thus, the coherence observed in 
Ariely et al. (2003)
 may be more malleable than previously assumed.
Unlike in preferential judgment tasks, however, the effect of anchoring on choices following anchoring procedures was inconsistent. In Study 1, we found that anchoring increased the probability of choosing a market good in a subsequent preferential choice, but we failed to find supporting evidence in any subsequent study. The within-study meta-analysis for the effect of anchoring on preferential choices also showed that the average effect of anchoring on preferential choices was not significant, indicating that considering purchasing an item for a high anchor price did not increase participants' preferences for the market goods in preferential choices. Thus, while we do not necessarily conclude that there is no effect whatsoever, any effect of WTP anchoring on choice appears to be small in magnitude and is not robust.
The incongruence of these two results may seem contradictory, but there are several potential explanations. WTP responses likely reflect perceptions of market value, but transaction costs and impatience might result in choosing an item with a lower reservation value and higher personal utility. For example, someone may place a higher valuation on a keyboard following a high anchor but may choose the mouse in a subsequent choice task because they have more immediate need for it, and do not want to incur the time and expense to sell a keyboard and buy a mouse. However, Study 3 had items with similar functionality (portable chargers), and still Finally, our study provides practical implications. Previous anchoring studies have shown that anchoring can influence various real-world consequential judgments that include buying and selling prices, credit card minimum repayments, real estate evaluations, and purchase quantity decisions 
(Green et al., 1998;
Northcraft & Neale, 1987;
Stewart, 2009;
Wansink, Kent, & Hoch, 1998)
. In day-to-day life, however, consumer decision making often takes the form of choices (e.g., choosing an item presented alongside other items) rather than the form of a single numeric judgment (e.g., pay-what-you-wish pricing). To the extent anchoring effects occur naturally in the field, they have limited potential to influence consumer decisions in choice scenarios. Note: Low and high anchors in Studies 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are $8 and $55, and low and high anchors in Study 3 were $25 and $85, respectively * These items indicate target items in the choice task + all t-test results were statistically significant at the 99.9% confidence level $ Combined treated high and low anchor conditions based on the associated anchor regardless of the item types in the manipulation conditions. Thus, paired-sample t-tests were conducted for comparing WTP responses. Note: Low and high anchors in Studies 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are $8 and $55, and low and high anchors in Study 3 were $25 and $85, respectively * These items indicate target items in the choice task
Mhigh = $30.92, SD = 13.93; t(238) = 4.47, p < .001, d = 0.58) and the myCharge portable chargers (Mlow = $21.55, SD = 9.94 vs. Mhigh = 29.20, SD = 12.85; t(238) = 5.06, p < .001, d = 0.66). Similarly, in the manipulation condition (N=198), the high anchor condition stated higher WTP than the low anchor condition for both the Insignia (Mlow = $26.66, SD = 9.03 vs. Mhigh = $34.96, SD = 17.23; t(196) = 4.14, p < .001, d = 0.59) and the myCharge portable chargers (Mlow = $24.50, SD = 10.39 vs. Mhigh = 34.64, SD = 17.23; t(196) = 4.56, p < .001, d = 0.72).We also found that anchoring affected the relative preference between the two portable chargers in the manipulation condition. 71.03% of the participants stated higher WTP for the target item (Insignia portable charger) than for the non-target item (myCharge portable charger) when the target item was associated with the high anchor, while only 19.78% of the participants showed the pattern when the target item was associated with the low anchor (χ 2 (1) = 51.79, p < .001, Cramer's V = .50).

resulted in inconsistent anchoring effects for WTP and choice. Another potential explanation results from differences in response scale compatibility. The response scale of preferential judgments is compatible with that of the anchor, whereas for preferential choices the response scales between choice and anchor are not compatible. This difference would be particularly important if valuation anchoring is driven by scale distortion, as opposed to changes in underlying perceptions of target items that might result from selective accessibility or other anchoring mechanisms.

In addition to demographic information and the main dependent variables, we also collected individual difference measures (Tightwad-spendthrift scale and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices in Study 1 and Study 4, item familiarity and previous purchase frequencies in Study 2 and Study 4, and item attractiveness ratings in Study 5). Since they were not our key variables of interest, we did not discuss them in the manuscript. But those variables are all included in the datasets available in the OSF repository.








WEB APPENDIX B. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ANCHOR AND PREFERENCE ELICITATION TASK TYPES
.79 (0.20) Note: Anchor (whether the target item in the study had the high anchor; No = -1 vs. Yes = 1) and Elicitation Type (WTP Rank = -1 vs. Choice/Prize Selection = 1) were effect coded. Studies 1, 2, and 3 include only the manipulation conditions, and Study 4 includes only the WTP condition.
