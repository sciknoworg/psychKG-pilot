Introduction
Making superior choices under risk demands flexibility in reactions to dynamically changing task demands 
(Gigerenzer et al., 1999;
Payne et al., 1993)
. Multiple theories (i.e., Drift diffusion model, Decision field theory, Dynamic signal detection theory, to name a few) and empirical results in decision-making advocate that extensive deliberation always leads to better and superior choices 
(Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008;
Bogacz et al., 2010;
Busemeyer and Townsend, 1993;
Pleskac and Busemeyer, 2010;
Ratcliff et al., 2016)
. However, when relatively less is at stake, one has the luxury of not taking the best action available and instead choosing an action that is just good enough. Every day we dwell on decisions that require different levels of deliberation as they differ in the extent of their consequences. For example, if one's personal goal is to make a good impression during an interview for a desired job, the decision to take an umbrella on a cloudy day is straightforward, and deliberation on its cost and benefit is unnecessary. However, if the personal goal is to have a good time with an old friend, we may seriously consider whether it is worth carrying the cumbersome umbrella while accepting the risk of leaving it in a restaurant or getting wet on the way. This example illustrates that a numerically proficient person may carefully choose an option that maximizes their expected value (EV) when the difference in value between two options is sufficiently large and stakes are meaningful (i.e., getting the job vs. not getting the job). On the other hand, the same person may not carefully consider all possible outcomes when the stakes are more trivial (i.e., having a good time vs. the risk of getting wet). Instead, one may choose any option that seems just good enough, thereby saving time and effort. In a similar vein, 
Traczyk et al. (2018b)
 demonstrated that more numerate individuals could better understand the structure of the environment than less numerate individuals. They observed that more numerate individuals can employ adaptive strategies to maximize value when it is meaningful (i.e., high-payoff condition) and save time and effort when the problems are trivial (i.e., low-payoff condition). In the current study, we examined such adaptive modulation in strategy in a more controlled task environment. More specifically, we aimed to evaluate whether more numerically proficient individuals are more likely to follow the EV maximization model when the relative difference in value is significant (i.e., high-payoff condition) and, on the other hand, adaptively change their plan to an EV inconsistent strategy when the relative difference in value is small (i.e., low-payoff condition). Inconsistent with earlier findings, we discovered that individuals do not adaptively modulate their strategy following changes in payoff conditions regardless of their numeric proficiency. Instead, individuals focus on the absolute difference in value when making decisions.


Theoretical background 2.1 Numeracy and superior decision making
Understanding numerical information (i.e., statistical numeracy) and its effective use in everyday situations is the key to making good decisions 
(Ancker and Kaufman, 2007;
Cokely et al., 2018;
Paulos, 1988;
Reyna and Brainerd, 2007)
. Since the publication of the first psychological tests measuring numeracy, the area of research on this construct has developed rapidly 
(Garcia-Retamero et al., 2019;
Nelson et al., 2008;
Reyna et al., 2009)
. Numeracy can be defined as a measure that evaluates individual proficiency in probabilistic and statistical computations 
(Schwartz et al., 1997)
. Researchers are focused on understanding psychological mechanisms that differentiate individuals with low and high numeracy. These efforts would be helpful in developing methods for communicating numerical information to people with low numeracy, which would allow such people to make more informed decisions. For example, the results of studies conducted so far indicate that people with high numeracy, compared to people with low numeracy, make normatively better decisions (i.e., those that are consistent with the predictions of the expected value maximization model) and are less sensitive to various cognitive biases 
(Liberali et al., 2012;
Peters and Levin, 2008;
Reyna and Brainerd, 2007)
. As a consequence, in everyday functioning, higher numeracy may manifest itself in better overall health 
(Garcia-Retamero et al., 2015a)
 and in greater wealth 
(Estrada-Mejia et al., 2016;
Tang, 2021)
.
Among the potential psychological mechanisms that are responsible for differences in decision making between people with high and low numeracy, we can distinguish: (1) more linear weighing of outcomes and probabilities 
(Millroth and Juslin, 2015;
Patalano et al., 2015;
Petrova et al., 2014;
Schley and Peters, 2014;
Traczyk and Fulawka, 2016)
, (2) longer deliberation on the problem 
(Ghazal et al., 2014;
Petrova et al., 2016)
, (3) elaborative and more thorough information processing based on heuristics 
(Cokely and Kelley, 2009)
, (4) creating a gist representation of the decision problem 
(Broniatowski and Reyna, 2018;
Reyna and Brainerd, 2008)
, which leads to a more accurate assessment of the accuracy of the decision made 
(Garcia-Retamero et al., 2015b;
Barrafrem et al., 2021)
, and (5) consideration of important affective information (e.g., fear of negative consequences of choices) in the decision-making process 
(Peters, 2012;
Peters et al., 2006;
Traczyk et al., 2018a;
Traczyk and Fulawka, 2016;
Grohmann et al., 2015)
.
In this sense, people with high numeracy do not only make good decisions due to their greater efficiency in counting, more extensive mathematical knowledge, or acquired skills in this field. Instead, highly numerate people are more sensitive to changes in the probability scale and spend more time processing a decision problem, which in turn allows them to create a general, affect-rich, and accurate mental representation of the decision problem. Such cognitive faculties can facilitate adaptive decision-making among people with high numeracy.


The adaptive role of numeracy
When making risky decisions, our choices can be shaped by different factors 
(Baron, 2008
). The simplest model that is often used to evaluate such factors is the EV model. It assumes that the decision-maker maximizes EV, understood as the sum of the products of payoffs and probabilities assigned to them (for exact formula, see Appendix 1). Existing findings indicate that there is a positive relationship between numeracy and more frequent use of choice strategies based on maximizing EV 
(Pachur and Galesic, 2013)
. Interestingly, 
Cokely and Kelley (2009)
 showed that despite the positive relationship between numeracy and choices maximizing EV, the decision process of people with high numeracy was preceded by operations unrelated to the calculation of EV. They concluded, employing the retrospective verbalizations method, that participants used an elaborative heuristic search to make their judgment. These verbalizations have manifested, for example, in more frequent transformations of probabilities, focusing on the most and least favorable outcomes, or considering the risk associated with other options. This result points towards two conclusions. On one hand, people with high numeracy can better perform a more complex mathematical operations resulting in choices maximizing EV-they are more sensitive to changes in EV 
(Jasper et al., 2013)
. On the other hand, their choices can be based on accurate heuristics. In this sense, more numerate people can have a greater repertoire of decision strategies that will be adaptively selected depending on the structure and requirements of the decision problem 
(Payne et al., 1988)
. 
Traczyk et al. (2018b)
 tested the above conclusion using a series of 24 two-outcome choice problems, where choice problems were divided into high-payoff (EV ratio is around 5) and low-payoff condition (EV ratio is around 1). Decision problems were considered less important in the low-payoff condition because, regardless of participants' choice, they would earn relatively similar payoffs. However, choice problems in the high-payoff condition were considered to be more important because selecting a gamble with a higher EV, on average, will lead to a significantly higher payoff. The choice problems were designed to distinguish between compensatory (i.e., Cumulative prospect theory/EV maximization) and non-compensatory (i.e., Priority Heuristics) strategies, which allowed the authors to track modulation (if any) in strategies across the two payoff conditions. The first model-cumulative prospect theory (CPT; 
Tversky and Kahneman, 1992)
-posits that the decision-maker weighs the subjective representation of outcomes with a subjective representation of probabilities (in the form of decision weights).This operation is performed for each gamble (prospect), where the decision maker selects the prospect with the highest subjective value. Also, predictions of CPT, simulated with the standard parameters from the seminal paper of 
Tversky and Kahneman (1992)
, were consistent with the EV maximization model. Hence, when participants select any gamble consistent with the predictions of CPT, participants inevitably choose the same gamble with a higher EV (i.e., EV maximization strategy). The second model-priority heuristics (PH; 
BrandstÃ¤tter et al., 2006)
 assumes that decision-makers do not perform transformations aimed at calculating or approximating EV, rather they sequentially compare the properties of the decision problem by focusing on the least attractive payoff, its probability, and the most attractive payoff. When the difference between these values is significant, the decision-maker applies the stopping rule and makes a choice.
Previous results in 
Traczyk et al. (2018b)
 suggest that, in meaningful problems (i.e., high-payoff condition), individuals with higher objective numeracy maximized EV and made choices consistent with the predictions of CPT. However, in trivial problems (i.e., low-payoff condition), where the EV ratio was low and the potential payoffs in the two gambles were comparable regardless of the decision made, they made choices inconsistent with EV maximization model and in line with the predictions of PH, understood here as the adaptive modulation in choice strategy. Put simply, highly numerate individuals are more sensitive to changes in EVs, allowing them to maximize expected payoff when the decision problems are meaningful. On the other hand, highly numerate individuals do not use an EV maximization strategy when expected payoffs are comparable in trivial problems. This result was successfully replicated 
(Mondal, 2021)
.
However, these previous studies suffer from some limitations. Choice problems used in earlier studies were not well controlled. Contrary to the conclusion, payoff is not the only varying factor between high-and low-payoff conditions. The absolute difference in expected values between two options has a skewed distribution across the two payoff conditions -that is, choice problems in the low-payoff condition have consistently lower absolute differences in expected values compared to the high-payoff condition. Furthermore, the difficulty level between two payoff conditions is also not consistent . As a result, adaptive modulation in decision strategy between two-payoff conditions can not only be attributed to varied EV ratios embodied by payoff conditions. Put differently, it is not clear whether payoff conditions alone can provide sufficient context necessary for highly numerate individuals to make better adaptive modulation in decision strategy compared to less numerate individuals.


Experiment 1
In the first experiment, we aim to test adaptive strategy selection between highly numerate and less numerate individuals with more evenly-distributed choice problems. We expect, on average, highly numerate individuals, compared to less numerate individuals, to make more EV consistent choices in the high-payoff condition (i.e., important problems) but not in the Difficulty can be defined in terms of the similarity between options (e.g., similar EVs; . In other words, the similarity of EVs between options makes a choice problem more difficult, increasing the error rate and decision time. However, AlÃ³s-Ferrer and Garagnani (2022) demonstrated that these chronometric and psychometric effects are a function of the differences in expected utility and not expected value. For the choice problems used in the current study, the prediction made by the expected utility theory with a power utility function and expected value model are very similar (i.e., 97.2 %; for more details, see section 8 from the Appendix). Hence, we chose to define difficulty in terms of similarity in EVs between options. low-payoff condition (i.e., trivial problems) by recognizing the relative difference in payoff distribution across the two payoff conditions. Here, EV consistency refers to choices that, if made, maximize expected value. In the same vein, EV inconsistency refers to choices that, if made, do not maximize expected value. That includes choices that, on average, are random (i.e., EV consistency around 50%). Therefore, participants' choices would be considered adaptive if participants, on average, followed the EV consistent strategy in the high-payoff condition and changed their strategy to EV inconsistent choices in the low-payoff condition.
The decision to use the expected value maximization model to measure changes in decision strategy hinges on the normative quiddity of the EV maximization model . Even though numerous descriptive models of decision making (e.g., cumulative prospect theory, TAX, priority heuristic, etc.) have been shown to explain and predict choices under risk better than the EV model, we decided to incorporate the latter model as a benchmark for optimal decision making. According to the proposition of normativity, choosing the option with a higher EV will provide the decision maker with a better average outcome in the long run, over an infinite number of independent yet structurally identical repetitions 
(Baron, 2008)
. Nevertheless, we have also simulated prominent expectation models among other positive decision making models to observe the similarity in predictions across 72 choice problems. We did not find any statistical difference in the prediction between the EV maximization model, CPT, and Expected Utility Theory (EU; see, 
Figure 1
 from the Appendix). Besides, the EV maximization model gives us a tool to measure changes in optimality in accordance with the changes in relative difference (i.e., two payoff conditions). In other words, the EV maximization model will allow us to monitor whether participants maximize EV regardless of the payoff conditions or whether they adaptively modulate between optimal and sub-optimal strategies in accordance with the payoff condition. This definition of adaptiveness was adopted from earlier studies 
(Traczyk et al., 2018b;
Mondal, 2021)
. Lastly, given that participants adaptively modulate their strategy between two payoff conditions, we also anticipate that the relative magnitude of change will be larger for numerate individuals than for less numerate individuals.


Materials and Procedure
We presented each participants with 36 high-payoff and 36 low-payoff choice problems in a random order and recorded their preference and response time (RT). In addition, we
We chose the EV maximization model to monitor changes in decision strategy, assuming that a decision maker is indifferent between two lotteries with the same EV. In other words, we assumed that lottery A (10% chance of getting 300 $; otherwise 0) and lottery B (1% chance of getting 3000 $; otherwise 0) are the same. However, a decision maker who is minimally risk averse will consistently prefer lottery A over lottery B due to the concavity of the utility function. It has been demonstrated that risk neutrality is the optimal strategy (i.e., following EUT) in tasks with multiple choices with modest stakes because risk aversion in small stake choices results in absurdly high levels of risk aversion over large stakes 
(Rabin, 2000)
. Although evidence of risk-averse behavior can be observed over modest stake choices, 
Rabin and WeizsÃ¤cker (2009)
 argue that risk aversion observed in small stakes laboratory tasks could be attributed to narrow bracketing. also measured participants' numeracy using the Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT; 
Cokely et al., 2012)
. The presentation of choice problems and numeracy scale was counter-balanced. Pre-registration, experimental procedure, choice problems, data used for analysis, and complete analysis (R markdown file) of Experiment 1 has been posted on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/p8av4/).


Objective statistical numeracy
We used the BNT to measure objective statistical numeracy and risk literacy. A computerized version of the traditional paper and pencil format of the BNT was presented to participants. Possible scores ranged between 0 to 4 points, with higher scores indicating higher objective statistical numeracy. We planned to divide participants into high numeracy (BNT â‰¥ 2) and low numeracy groups (BNT â‰¤ 1) based on their performance on the BNT scale.


Choice problems
We developed 72 new binary choice problems consisting of two-outcome gambles distributed evenly between the high-and low-payoff condition in the gain domain. The distribution of EV ratios (see, Appendix 1.1 for exact formula of EV ratio) between the two payoff conditions was adopted from 
Traczyk et al. (2018b)
. In the low-payoff condition, as the name suggests, the EV difference between options is relatively low (i.e., the EV ratio between options is 1-2), indicating a relatively insignificant difference in value between the two options. Conversely, the EV difference between options is relatively large (i.e., EV ratio between options is 5-6) in the high-payoff condition, indicating a substantial difference in value between the two options 
Traczyk et al., 2018b;
Mondal, 2021)
.
In earlier studies, the EV ratio is not the only factor that varied between two payoff conditions 
(Traczyk et al., 2018b;
Mondal, 2021)
. Choice problems used by 
Traczyk et al. (2018b)
 were not controlled adequately across the two payoff conditions. For example, as 
Figure 1A
 suggests, the Absolute-EV-Difference (AED; see, Appendix 1.2 for exact formula) between options was not controlled. AED between options is always higher for choice problems in the high-payoff condition, whereas AED between options is always lower for choice problems in the low-payoff condition. This skewness in AED distribution resulted in an asymmetric trade-off between EV consistent and EV inconsistent choices. On average, there is no difference in total reward earned by participants when they fail to maximize EV compared to when they maximize it in the low-payoff condition. On the contrary, as 
Figure 1B
 suggests, there is, on average, a significant difference in total reward earned by participants when they fail to maximize EV compared to when they do maximize it in the high-payoff condition. These differences in reward distribution across the two payoff conditions are referred to as an asymmetric trade-off. The asymmetric trade-off is a property of the choice problems and is not used in its conventional sense (i.e., not an attribute of participants). In the current study, we followed the same principle to develop the choice problems and tried to control as many factors as possible (i.e., variance, AED between options, and asymmetric trade-off) to let only the EV ratio vary between the two conditions. We controlled outcomes and AED by restricting them to 100 and 50, respectively, in both payoff conditions. As a consequence, regardless of the payoff condition, participants will earn significantly less if they decide to make EV inconsistent choices compared to EV consistent choices. There is now, unlike in earlier studies, a trade-off present if one decides to change the decision strategy. Furthermore, the relative position of the choice problem is randomized for each participant. Also, we counterbalanced option placement as well (i.e., option A is not option A for each participant). All control measures were taken to vary only EV ratios between two payoff conditions across all participants. That is, the difference between options, across two payoff conditions, did not differ in variance (p = .925), outcome (p = 1.00), and probability (p = .722). In addition, variance (p = .805), outcome (p = .940), probability (p = .232), and expected value (p = .218) of option A did not differ significantly from option B over 72 choice problems to ensure that the change in participants' response is not based on any other factors other than EV ratio of 72 choice problems (see

Participants
Ninety-five volunteers participated (mean age = 26.32 years, SD = 6.81) in an online study for a half-hourly compensation of 2.56 GBP (equivalent to approximately 3.5 USD). The sample size was calculated using G*Power software to obtain a statistical power of .95 with a significance level ( ) of 0.05 in order to detect an effect size (d) of 0.684 (medium effect size was noticed in the previous study; Mondal, 2021). Participants were recruited via the Prolific platform. They were instructed that the aim of the study is to measure the cognitive abilities of people belonging to different social and demographic groups (see, Appendix 10 for more detailed instructions). Furthermore, participants were told that they would be asked to solve a few tasks and questionnaires, and they would be compensated based on their performance in the task. As a bonus, participants were informed that for every 1000 points, they would receive an additional 1 GBP on top of the flat fee. Lastly, participants were made aware that they could stop the task at any time. However, if they do so, they would not be able to continue the study further and would not receive any compensation.


Results


Numeracy
The mean score of participants in the BNT scale is 1.126 with SD of 1.24. Out of 95 participants, 32 participants are part of the high numeracy group (BNT â‰¥ 2), and 63 participants are part of the low numeracy group (BNT â‰¤ 1). 


Choice problems
Mean EV consistency between the two payoff conditions were analysed using the paired samples t-test . Mean EV consistency is significantly higher, t(94) = 5.72, p < .001, d = .59, in the high-payoff condition (M = 0.85, SD = 0.14), consistent with earlier results, than mean EV consistency in the low-payoff condition (M = 0.80, SD = 0.13). In contrast, mean RT in the low-payoff condition (M = 8.10, SD = 0.52) is significantly higher, t(94) = 3.71, p < .001, d = .38, than mean RT in the high-payoff condition (M = 8.05, SD = 0.523). Next, we used the independent sample Mann-Whitney U-test to compare EV consistency in the high-payoff condition between high and low numeracy groups. The results suggest that participants with high numeracy followed EV consistent choices, consistent with our hypothesis and earlier results, significantly more times, U = 1459, p < .001, = .45, in the high-payoff condition (M = 0.90, SD = 0.13) compared to less numerate participants (M = 0.82, SD = 0.13). However, as 
Figure 2
 suggests, this trend continues, inconsistent with our hypothesis and earlier results, in the low-payoff condition as well. Highly numerate individuals followed EV consistent choices (M = 0.85, SD = 0.12), significantly more often, U = 1412.5, p < .001, = .40, in the low-payoff condition compared to less numerate individuals (M = 0.77, SD = 0.13). Furthermore, we used the independent sample t-test to measure the magnitude of change in decision strategy ( ; see Appendix 2) between the high numeracy and low-numeracy group. Results suggest that there is no significant
We reanalyzed the current choice data similar to how it was analyzed in the study done by 
Traczyk et al. (2018b)
. The conclusions of the current study are robust to different ways of analysing the data. For more details, see 
Table 7
 & 10 from the Appendix. Following this result, we used Hayes' PROCESS-macro analysis (4.0.1) to test whether the nature of the relationship between payoff and EV consistency varies as a function of AED 
(Hayes, 2012)
. In this regression-based analysis, we tested whether the interaction of two predictors (e.g., X and W) significantly improved the model fit indexed by the change of R 2 . The significant interaction indicates that the effect of predictor X on dependent variable Y is moderated by predictor W. We mean-centered the continuous variable (i.e., AED) and dummy coded the categorical variables (i.e., Payoff and EV consistency) to avoid high multi-collinearity with the interaction term. Results from the moderation analysis suggest that there is a significant interaction, = -0.014, Z = -2.97, p = .003, between payoff and AED on EV consistency. However, there is no significant direct effect, = 0.129, Z = 1.86, p = .063, of payoff conditions on EV consistency. On the other hand, AED has a significant direct effect, = 0.035, Z = 14.60, p < .001, on EV consistency. In addition, We calculated the Johnson-Neyman interval to further prove the interaction effect of AED between payoff and EV consistency. As 
Figure 3A
 suggests, when AED difference between options crosses the [23.11] point, the slope of the Payoff difference becomes insignificant (p > .05). Put differently, when AED between options crosses the [23.11] point, there is no significant difference in EV consistency between the two payoff conditions.


Summary
The results at hand indicate that there is a positive relationship between numeracy and EV consistency across the two payoff conditions 
(Traczyk et al., 2018b;
Mondal, 2021)
. How-ever, the presence of the high-payoff and low-payoff condition together does not necessarily initiate adaptive strategy selection, regardless of participants' numeracy, when choice problems are evenly distributed. Highly numerate individuals changed their decision strategy between the high-and low-payoff condition, but the change does not embody adaptive strategy selection. Highly numerate individuals, compared to less numerate individuals, made EV consistent choices in the high-payoff condition. However, they made more EV consistent choices, contrary to our expectations and earlier results, in the low-payoff condition as well.
Compared to earlier results, the magnitude of difference in EV consistent choices between the two payoff conditions is also relatively small. In addition, there is no significant difference in the degrees of change, contrary to our expectation, in EV consistency across the two payoff conditions between high and low numeracy groups. Lastly, we used moderation analysis to observe the effect of AED distribution on the relationship between payoff and adaptive strategy selection (embodied by the change in EV consistency). We identified that when AED remains constant, the change in payoff condition has no significant effect on EV consistency. However, change in AED has a significant direct effect on EV consistency.
This leads us to two conclusions. First, modulation in EV consistency is informed by understanding that the relative difference in value is significantly dissimilar across the two payoff conditions (i.e., EV ratio 1-2 in the low-payoff condition compared to EV ratio 5-6 in the high-payoff condition), but the magnitude of that effect is comparatively small. Second, participants did not recognize the relative difference in value, and the presence of two payoff conditions together has no significant effect on the changes in EV consistency. Instead, the change in EV consistency across the two payoff conditions is largely due to participants' response to the absolute difference in value (i.e., AED between options) regardless of the relative difference in value.


Experiment 2
In the second experiment, we plan to eliminate one of the two interpretations of the previous result. In Experiment 1, participants were presented with choice problems from both payoff conditions to provide them with the knowledge that the relative difference (i.e., EV ratio 1-2 in the low-payoff condition compared to EV ratio 5-6 in the high-payoff condition) in value across the two payoff conditions is significantly dissimilar. Hence, if the change in EV consistency is motivated by the relative difference in value, then the lack of information about the relative difference should, in principle, stop participants from making changes in their decision strategy (i.e., modulation in EV consistency between two payoff condition). We plan to test this hypothesis using the non-inferiority test. Put simply, Experiment 2 aims to test the non-inferiority of mean EV consistency in the low-payoff condition compared to mean EV consistency in the high-payoff condition.
If we find that there is no meaningful difference in EV consistency between the twopayoff conditions, then we can with sufficient confidence conclude that the change in EV consistency occurred due to participants' recognition of the relative difference in value between the two payoff conditions (i.e., EV ratio 1-2 in the low-payoff condition compared to EV ratio 5-6 in the high-payoff condition). Otherwise, the change in decision strategy across two the payoff conditions is due to participants' response to the absolute difference in value (i.e., AED between options).


Materials and Procedure
We randomly presented each participant with 36 low payoff or 36 high-payoff choice problems. Unlike Experiment 1, participants were presented with either choice problems from the high-payoff or low-payoff condition, together with a numeracy scale. Presentation of choice problems and the numeracy scale was counter-balanced. Pre-registration, experimental procedure, data used for analysis, and complete analysis (R markdown file) of Experiment 2 have been posted on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/67hwc/).


Non-inferiority test
Employing the non-inferiority test enables us to prove that something does not exist 
(Streiner, 2003)
. In most instances, we design studies to show statistical significance using nullhypothesis significance testing (NHST)-that is, if we were to observe that p is less than or equal to 0.05, we would conclude that we can reject the null hypothesis and therefore accept the alternative-that there is a significant difference between the two groups. However, if p is greater than 0.05, we would not say that we can accept (or prove) the null hypothesis; rather, we would conclude that we failed to disprove the null. Therefore, such a methodology does not allow us to prove the nonexistence of something. In other words, using NHST, we can not say that there is no practical difference between the two groups; hence we can reject the null hypothesis. In such cases, one uses the equivalence test to show that there is no meaningful difference between the means of two groups.
In the current study, we used the non-inferiority test paradigm (a specialized version of the equivalence test) to show that the mean of one group is neither meaningfully larger nor smaller than the other group. Importantly, rather than saying that the means of two groups have to be absolutely identical, we establish an acceptable range of closeness ( ) within which we would say that the groups are similar enough. Here, meaningfulness is not a statistical question, rather a practical one. Following the recommendation from Cribbie and Arpin-Cribbie (2009), we used a three-point scale, instead of a single absolute value, to establish the degrees of closeness ( ) between the two conditions (see, Appendix 4). If < 5%, then there is a "definitive non-inferiority" between the high-payoff and low-payoff condition. If < 10%, then there is a "probable non-inferiority" between the two conditions. Lastly, if < 15%, then there is an "anecdotal non-inferiority" present between the two conditions. Therefore,
0 : 0 âˆ’ 1 â‰¥ (1) 1 : 0 âˆ’ 1 <
(2)
0 = Null hypothesis 1 = Alternative hypothesis 0 = mean EV consistency in the high-payoff condition 1 = mean EV consistency in the low-payoff condition = acceptable difference


Objective statistical numeracy
We used the 3-item numeracy scale developed by 
Schwartz et al. (1997)
 and the BNT scale together to measure objective statistical numeracy and risk literacy. Possible scores ranged between 0 to 7 points, with higher scores indicating higher objective statistical numeracy.


Participants
The sample size was calculated following the formula provided by 
Chow et al. (2007)
 to obtain a power of 0.80 with a significance level ( ) of 0.05 considering a non-inferiority margin of .08 (see, Appendix 3 for the exact formula). Two hundred and forty-eight volunteers (mean age = 27.7 years, SD = 8.92) participated in an online study for a halfhourly compensation of 2.5 GBP (equivalent to approximately 3.5 USD). Participants were recruited via the Prolific platform, where they were explicitly told that the current study would only examine their cognitive abilities (see, Appendix 11 for more detailed instructions). Furthermore, participants were told that they would be asked to solve a few tasks and questionnaires, and they would be compensated based on their performance in the task. As a bonus, in the low-payoff condition, participants were told that for every 1000 points, they would receive an additional 0.80 GBP on top of the flat fee. However, in the high-payoff condition, participants were told that for every 500 points, they would receive an additional 0.65 GBP on top of the flat fee. Lastly, participants were made aware that they could stop the task at any time. However, if they do so, they would not be able to continue the study further and would not receive any compensation. The difference in bonus payment between the two conditions is contingent upon the estimated earning difference between the two payoff conditions (See Appendix 5 for the exact calculation).


Results


Numeracy
The mean score of participants in the numeracy scale is 3.27 (SD = 2). Out of 248 participants, 111 participants are part of the high numeracy group (Numeracy â‰¥ 4), and 137 participants are part of the low numeracy group (Numeracy â‰¤ 3). Mean EV consistency in the high-payoff condition is higher for highly numerate individuals (M = 0.91, SD = 0.09) compared to less numerate individuals (M = 0.79, SD = 0.16). Similarly, mean EV consistency in the low-payoff condition is higher for highly numerate individuals (M = 0.83, SD = 0.11) compared to less numerate individuals (M = 0.73, SD = 0.13). Both results are consistent with the results from Experiment 1. 


Choice problem
Mean EV consistency and RT in the high-payoff condition is 0.84 (SD = 0.14) and 8.04 (SD = 0.46), respectively. Whereas, the mean EV consistency and RT in the low-payoff condition is 0.78 (SD = 0.13) and 8.13 (SD = 0.45), respectively. We used the TOSTER R package to test the non-inferiority between the two payoff conditions using the independent groups Student's equivalence test 
(Lakens et al., 2018)
. When < 5% (definitive non-inferiority), the non-inferiority test was non-significant, t(246) = 1.166, p = .878, given the bounds of -Inf and 0.040 (on a raw scale) with an alpha of 0.05. Similarly, when < 10% (probable non-inferiority), the non-inferiority test was non-significant, t(246) = -1.166, p = .122, given the bounds of -Inf and 0.080. However, when < 15% (anecdotal non-inferiority), the non-inferiority test was significant, t(246) = -3.497, p < .001, given the bounds of -Inf and 0.120. Looking at the mean EV consistency of both payoff conditions from Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, we can rule out the interpretation of anecdotal non-inferiority between the
The results are consistent even if we conduct an equivalence test instead of the non-inferiority test. two payoff conditions due to the similarity of distribution and magnitude of modulation in decision strategy across the two payoff conditions.
Next, we conducted a moderation analysis and calculated the Johnson-Neyman interval. Results from the moderation analysis suggest that there is a significant interaction, = -0.034, Z = -8.19, p < .001, between payoff and AED distribution on EV consistency. There is no significant direct effect, = 0.104, Z = 1.75, p = .08, of payoff conditions on EV consistency. On the other hand, there is a significant direct effect, = 0.033, Z = 16.28, p < .001, of AED on EV consistency. The current result mirrors the result from Experiment 1. Lastly, as 
Figure 3B
 suggests, the Johnson-Neyman analysis indicates that when AED is outside the interval of the 
[23.18, 30.96]
 points, the slope of payoff difference is significant (p < .05). Put differently, when AED between options is between the [23.18, 30.96] points, there is no significant difference in EV consistency between the two payoff conditions. Unlike Experiment 1, we have a smaller interval of insignificance 
[23.18, 30.96]
. 11] there is no significant difference in EV consistency between the two payoff conditions. B) In Experiment 2, there is no significant difference in EV consistency between the two payoff conditions in the interval between 
[23.18, 30.96]
.


Summary
Mean EV consistency is meaningfully higher in the high-payoff condition compared to the low-payoff condition. Put differently, mean EV consistency in the low-payoff condition is not non-inferior to the mean EV consistency in the high-payoff condition. The significant moderation effect and insignificant direct effect of payoff conditions on EV consistency argue that the nature of the relationship between the two payoff conditions and EV consistency is significantly moderated by absolute differences in values. Therefore, the result at hand conclusively indicates that the change in EV consistency is not motivated by the understanding of the relative difference in value (i.e., EV ratio 1-2 in low-payoff condition compared to EV ratio 5-6 in high-payoff condition). Thus, Experiment 2 successfully dissociated the relationship between the change in EV consistency and the payoff conditions. Lastly, we observed that the change in EV consistency across the two payoff conditions is, corroborating evidence from Experiment 1, participants' response to the absolute difference in value (i.e., AED between options).


Discussion
Earlier studies had delineated the importance of payoff conditions on adaptive decision making 
(Traczyk et al., 2018b;
Mondal, 2021)
. However, the current results from both studies revealed that the payoff conditions alone do not invoke adaptive strategy selection, irrespective of numeracy levels. In earlier studies, multiple factors (i.e., lack of tradeoff between strategies, asymmetry in AED distribution) were not consistent between the two payoff conditions. However, when controlled, we identified that numerate individuals are better at maximizing expected reward following absolute difference in value between options and not the relative difference in value embodied by two payoff conditions. Both experiments successfully dissociated the relationship between payoff conditions and changes in EV consistency.
The current result shines a light on the context needed for numerically proficient individuals to make adaptive choices. Contexts such as lack of trade-off between strategies, asymmetry in AED distribution, and varying difficulty levels provide the information needed for highly numerate individuals to make more adaptive choices. For example, First sentence: Rahul entered the room and Raj started smiling. Second sentence: Rahul entered the room and therefore Raj started smiling.
If someone asks us to explain what the first sentence means, we often presume that both events (i.e., entering the room and smiling) are related as described by the second sentence. This idea of causation comes from our proficiency in understanding implicit contexts (unlike other artificial systems). The context of a sentence plays a big part in the way we extract meaning from it 
(Wlotko and Federmeier, 2012;
Conrad, 1974;
Gigerenzer, 2007)
. Notably, age has a moderating effect on the ability to understand context information. As we grow older, our experience in the world helps us in decoding the context (from sarcasm to passiveaggressive anger) associated with sentences 
(Wlotko and Federmeier, 2012)
. Similarly, in earlier studies, multiple factors (i.e., lack of trade-off between strategies, asymmetry in AED distribution, and varying difficulty levels) more readily provided highly numerate individuals with the context they need to adaptively switch between optimal and sub-optimal strategies (i.e., make changes in EV maximization strategy) over the two payoff conditions compared to less numerate individuals. However, in the current study, when we controlled such factors to let just the EV ratio vary between two payoff conditions, participants did not adaptively modulate their decision strategy in accordance with the changes in payoff condition. Instead, they started maximizing EV following AED between options regardless of their numeracy levels.
Participants' judgment in both studies indicates that choices are made with respect to the frame of reference of AED distribution. Moderation analysis and the Johnson-Neyman interval of insignificance attest to the empirical validity of the frame of reference that led to the difference in strategies. The current result is in line with the prediction from Adaptation-Level Theory (ALT; 
Helson, 1964)
, one of the most prominent and widely used theory on stimulus frame of reference. The ALT argues that judgments are made in relation to adaptation level, and the adaptation level depends on all past and present stimuli. Put simply, the ALT postulates that people respond to the current stimulus using a frame of reference, which is a function of all earlier stimuli 
(Helson, 1948)
. Adaptation level can be defined as a region in the stimulus scale that produces indifferent responses. Results from the Johnson-Neyman interval of insignificance in both studies validate the notion of adaptation level and the region of indifferent responses. Support for adaptation-level theory is more prominent in the field of perceptual or psychophysical research for diverse phenomena such as constancy, contrast, and adaptation in the domain of vision, hearing, smell, taste, etc. 
(Helson, 1947;
Bevan et al., 1962;
Hulshoff Pol et al., 1998)
. Nevertheless, results from the current study indicate that adaptation level can also be found in the cognitive domain (i.e., adaptation to value distribution) as well. Lastly, future studies should investigate whether the range of indifference found in the current study remains the same with different AED levels or changes with a specific AED distribution.
The current study also highlights the importance of focusing on absolute values. Almost all modern theories of decision making are built on the idea of relativity 
(Tversky and Kahneman, 1992;
Friedman and Savage, 1952)
, where preference for an item is judged with respect to other items. The higher value object is consistently preferred if the difference in value is relatively large between items. Although, as the psychological interpretations of the law of diminishing returns dictate, preferences become more inconsistent when the difference in value is relatively similar 
(Shevlin et al., 2022)
. However, the current result is inconsistent (in agreement with 
Shevlin et al., 2022)
 with the hypothesis of diminishing value sensitivity. We have identified a more complex relationship between relativity and preference consistency. As noted in the previous section, we argued that the nature of the relationship between consistency of preference and the relative difference in value is anchored to the absolute difference in value one expects to earn or lose. For example, when the absolute difference between two offers is 50 $ and the relative difference is large (i.e., option A is 10$ and option B is 60$), preference for the higher value item is consistent and in accordance with the hypothesis of diminishing value sensitivity. Similarly, when the absolute difference between two offers is 50 $ and the relative difference is small (i.e., option A is 400$ and option B is 450$), preference for the higher value item is relatively less consistent and in accordance with the hypothesis of diminishing value sensitivity. Following the same logic, when the absolute difference between two offers is 200 $ and the relative difference is large (i.e., option A is 50$ and option B is 250$), preference for the higher value item is consistent and in accordance with the hypothesis of diminishing value sensitivity. However, the current study revealed that when the absolute difference between two offers (i.e., option A is 1000$ and option B is 1200$) is large (i.e., 200 instead of 50) and the relative difference is small, preference for the higher value item is equally as consistent as it was when relative difference was large and against the prediction of the hypothesis of diminishing value sensitivity. We identified a boundary condition for the hypothesis of diminishing value sensitivity. We speculate that the boundary condition is modulated by risk appetite, where individuals with more risk appetite will be more inconsistent compared to individuals with less risk appetite. However, to say anything conclusively, more work needs to be done in the matter.
Classical decision theory assumes that people make rational choices and prefer options that maximize subjective expected utility. However, human decisions can be driven by various motives. For example, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that some people prefer the best option (i.e., maximizers), but others prefer the good-enough option (i.e., satisfies) 
(Schwartz et al., 2002)
. In line with this distinction, decision-makers may exhibit different sensitivity to changes in EVs, depending on their goal (whether to maximize or satisfy).
The present findings can be interpreted in the light of personal goals set by participants and their sensitivity to EV changes. That is, previous studies on numeracy and adaptive strategy selection 
(Traczyk et al., 2018b)
 employed two payoff conditions that included either meaningful (i.e., maximizing EV could lead to a substantially greater payoff) or trivial (i.e., making random choice led to comparable payoffs) choice problems. Consequently, participants with high numeracy who were more sensitive to EV could adapt their behavior by putting more effort into solving meaningful choice problems and, at the same time, they employed a less effortful heuristic strategy or made a fast random choice in trivial problems. In other words, depending on the structure of the choice task, they modified their personal goals to maximize the payoff or make a satisfying choice that minimized their effort and saved time. The current study with evenly distributed choice problems eliminated the opportunity to easily compare the potential payoff and understand the importance of choice problems. Consequently, participants were not able to manage their time and effort, so this goal was eclipsed by the goal of maximizing EV.
Theoretical models 
(Lopes, 1987)
 and empirical research 
(Wulff et al., 2015)
 have already focused on the aspiration level and tested how instructions to follow a particular decision strategy 
(Schoemann et al., 2019)
 and achieve a specific goal 
(Jarecki and Rieskamp, 2020)
 shape decision-making process. We believe that introducing the concept of personal goals to decision-making research can provide a promising new avenue for future research. It would be especially helpful in studying adaptive strategy selection since rational behavior in dynamic and complex environments might be evidenced by choices that increase the likelihood of achieving a personal goal 
(Baron, 2008)
.
Finally, it is worth noting that the present study does suffer from some limitations. Consistent with earlier studies 
(Mondal, 2021;
Traczyk et al., 2018b;
, the current study also suffers from varying difficulty levels across two payoff conditions. Future work should investigate whether there is a relationship between adaptive strategy selection and varying difficulty levels across two payoff conditions. Second, all previous studies and the current study focused exclusively on monetary gambles to test adaptive strategy selection. However, in everyday life, one encounters more value-based situations than monetary problems. Also, value-based problems would help us distinguish between true preference and mistakes made while expressing that preference across varied numerically able participants 
(Mechera-Ostrovsky et al., 2022;
Lilleholt, 2019;
Drouvelis et al., 2020)
. Lastly, the current study used computational models to explore changes in decision strategy. Future studies can use process tracking methods (such as retrospective verbalization) to evaluate the actual decision strategy employed by participants.
In summary, we illustrated that individuals do not make adaptive strategy selection in the presence of two payoff conditions alone, regardless of the numeracy level of the individuals. Instead, the change in EV consistency across two payoff conditions is primarily due to participants' responses to the absolute difference in value. We successfully dissociated the relationship between EV consistency and payoff conditions. Lastly, we highlighted the anchoring effect of absolute difference in value in human preference and choice consistency. In conclusion, we demonstrated that numerate individuals, compared to less numerate individuals, maximized their expected reward more consistently following absolute differences in values irrespective of the relative differences in value provided by the two payoff conditions.
