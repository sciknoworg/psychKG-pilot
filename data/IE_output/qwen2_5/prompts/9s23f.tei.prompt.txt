You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

The neuroeconomic research program
The expected utility model was established as the standard normative model of decision-making under risk 
[1,
2]
. Integrating Bernoulli's intuition about the curvature of utility function and probability theories, Von Neumann and Morgenstern demonstrated that choices based on the expected utility (i.e., the product between utility of an outcome and its probability) satisfies four basic axioms of rationality (completeness, transitivity, continuity and independence). Historically, the neoclassical economics research program disregarded the study of the internal processes governing economic behaviours. 
Keynes'
 animal spirits 
[3]
 were considered unmeasurable, and economic theory was built on the assumption that the human mind as well the brain were ultimately black boxes. The 'as-if' hypothesis 
[4]
 illustrates this position by endorsing an instrumentalist epistemology: theory predictive power prevails on the realism of its initial assumptions. Accordingly, it was considered acceptable to rely on unrealistic assumptions regarding the unbounded cognitive capacities or perfect knowledge of economic agents, as far as the predictions were sufficiently accurate.
However, with the accumulation of behavioural evidence against the standard normative expected utility model, it soon appeared that it had to be profoundly amended to successfully account for decisions under risk 
[5,
6]
. Positive, descriptive, models of decision under risk that integrate insights from psychology, such as the notion of bounded rationality (i.e., humans display limited computational capacities), heuristics (taking computational shortcuts to make decisions) and biases (selectively overweighting some variable) were then proposed and formalized 
[7]
[8]
[9]
. Among the descriptive theories of decision under risk and uncertainty, 'prospect theory' (PT) had a strong empirical ground and stood out 
[8,
10]
. PT postulates that expected utility is calculated relative to a reference point (the frame), an asymmetric treatment of gains and losses (loss aversion), as well as a subjective weighting of probabilities (probability distortion). PT proved successful to explain known paradoxes (such as the Allais's paradoxes) and new ones (e.g., the Asian disease paradox, as well as a certain number of 'real life' irrational behaviours 
[11,
12]
).
However, despite these successes, some aspects of the descriptive approach, in general, and PT, in particular, remained unsatisfactory. First, it remained difficult to ultimately arbitrate between competing descriptive theories solely based on behavioural data. For instance, alternative behavioural theories have been proposed (such as rank-dependent utility, regret and disappointment theories; see 
[13]
 for a review) that make overlapping predictions with PT, making them hard to disentangle. Second, while making accurate predictions, PT, and other descriptive theories, do not specify which are the actual cognitive operations and how they are implemented by the brain. In terms of the Marrian analysis of modeling, PT (as other descriptive theories) is situated at the computational level that specifies which is the goal of the agent (in this case: maximizing a subjective utility that includes reference point dependence, loss aversion and probability deformation), but is silent concerning the algorithmic (i.e., what are the operations involved in the manipulation of decision variables) and implementational levels (i.e., how these operations are physically embodied and realized) 
[14]
.
A couple of decades later the time was ripe for a group of scholars of diverse origins seeing in neuroscientific data the way to address the issues related to descriptive theories, developed by psychologists and behavioural economists. This was facilitated by the rapid development of non-invasive neuroimaging techniques in humans (most notably functional magnetic resonance imaging: fMRI 
[15]
[16]
[17]
) and improvement of single unit electrophysiological recordings in monkeys 
[18,
19]
. The hope was (and still is) that, taking advantage of neuroscientific methods and concepts, neuroeconomics (as this raising field was named), would be able to address the epistemological issues of economic theories highlighted above. Concerning the adjudicating on competing theories (our first issue), by opening the brain "black box" functional neuroimaging studies would provide an additional crucial and observable measure -neural activity (as indexed by blood oxygen level dependent -BOLD -signal: an aggregate and indirect measure of neural electrical activity) to compare, ultimately falsify and refine behavioural models. We define this approach as the weak neuroeconomic agenda, as it does not involve rewriting economic descriptive theories 
[20]
[21]
[22]
. Coming back to our example, while making similar behavioural predictions in respect of preferences under risk, different theories postulate different utility functions that can be searched in the brain 
[23]
[24]
[25]
. Assuming one knows where to look for utility representation in the brain 1 , it would be, in principle, possible to assess which model better predicts its activity (a sort of neural model comparison: see 
[29]
). Beyond comparing different theories, neural activity could in principle help refining a theory by fixing some of its parame-

 Subjective utility (or subjective value) representation seems to be distributed across a network of areas that include the ventral and the dorsal prefrontal cortices (both medial and lateral part), posterior cingulate cortex, the striatum, the insula, the amygdala and the hippocampus 
[26]
[27]
[28]
.
ters. For instance, in many circumstances PT is silent about how the reference point should be set 
[30]
. Assuming one knows where to look for positive (gain) and negative (loss) utility representation in the brain, in some cases the reference point could be inferred comparing the profile of activity of the 'gains' and 'losses' areas 2 
[25,
33]
.
Concerning build new theories (second issue), accepting the fundamental epistemological tenet that (economic) decisions ultimately result from neural activity in the brain (which is a standard materialistic and monistic assumption with regards to the mind-body problem, see 
[34]
), entails that neuroscientific methods should provide the conceptual and methodological tools necessary to develop new, neurobiologically grounded, neural models encompassing the algorithmic and implementational levels. In contrast with the previous approach, we define this approach as the strong neuroeconomic agenda, as it involves rewriting economic theories in neurobiological terms. By integrating biological constraints and cost functions, such neurobiologically grounded economic models, have the ambition of redefining why human decision-making presents certain biases from a biologically (not logically or statistically) normative perspective 
[35,
36]
.
The methodological requirements of the two main neuroeconomics agenda are not quite the same. The weak neuroeconomic agenda can, in principle, be fulfilled by experiments relying on aggregate and indirect measures of the neural activity, such as the BOLD signal recorded by fMRI scanners in areas encoding subjective values. Furthermore, since goal is arbitrating between different behavioural theories of decision-making developed by psychologists and economists, the experiments belonging to this research agenda should be preferentially (if not exclusively) performed in humans.
On the other side, as neural models are, ultimately, models of which information is encoded in neurons and how neurons are connected (networks), the strong neuroeconomic agenda research program cannot be pursued only relying on fMRI neural signals 
3
 . In fact, BOLD signal, at its best of resolution, aggregates over thousands of neurons 
[37]
[38]
[39]
. Furthermore, it is still unclear to which extent it reflects presynaptic or postsynaptic activity (probably a mixture of both) 
[39,
40]
. Such neural models should eventually be validated based on recording of single cell activities, which is, for obvious ethical reasons, nearly impossible in humans 
4
 . This is why neuroeconomics research, from its very inception, strongly relies on electro-

 It is indeed the case that brain systems encoding positive and negative values are, at least partially, dissociable. Losses are generally encoded by the insula, the amygdala and the dorsal prefrontal cortex, while gains are generally encoding in the ventral prefrontal and striatal

 Other non-invasive imaging techniques, such as magneto-and electroencephalography present no advantage over fMRI when it comes to infer single unit activity. They present better temporal resolution traded off against a worst spatial resolution.

Decision process of interest


Monkey
In 
Figure 1
 we represent how a prototypical workflow should look like to combine human and monkey data to deliver a neural model of decision-making. Of note, we describe it from an abstract perspective of theory-building, but in reality, its different steps can occur simultaneously (or in reverse order), and in very distant laboratories. Once identified as a behavioural process of interest (e.g., decision-making under uncertainty) a behavioural protocol is designed (typically, a series of choice problems involving different amounts of rewards and probabilities) and administered to both humans and monkeys. If the behaviour is comparable across species (meaning that the monkey represent a valid experimental model of hu-man behaviour 
5
 ), functional imaging in humans can then be deployed to identify neural targets encoding macroscopic variables (e.g., probabilities, outcomes) that are later used to guide the selection of the areas where single units will be recorded in monkeys. As desirable intermediate step, to reinforce the functional correspondence between human and monkey brain activations would be to deploy fMRI also in monkey 
[43]
. Similarly, in some neurologic and psychiatric diseases, intra-cranial neural activity can also be recorded in humans 
[44]
. Finally, all these data can then be combined together to propose and validate a neurobiologically plausible model of the behavioural process of interest. Thereafter, the proposed model should be validated using lesions and assessing its generalization . Methods such as trans-cranial magnetic stimulation and brain lesions can be used to test the alleged 
5
 Of course, there is a lot of information to be gained also in the case where humans and monkeys do not display the same decisions and biases. Such differences currently represent a strong area of research in comparative psychology and ethology 
[71]
. However, the (not so implicit) assumption of the vast majority of research in neuro-economics is that monkeys are valid experimental models for human cognition, and they are not investigated for comparative reasons.

In pure description, two options are presented with explicit probability distribution of outcomes, while no feedback is given (outcome of the decision).

In the 'description plus experience' paradigm, explicit representations of probabilities and outcomes are provided, as well as the outcome obtained subsequently to the choice.
causal relationship between neural correlates and behavioural processes 
[45]
[46]
[47]
. The model's ability to generalize can be assessed by generating predictions in tasks involving different decision-problems and behavioural processes (out-of-sample validation). A crucial step in this workflow is checking that humans and monkeys display the same behavioural processes and biases as a result of a true homology. This is something notoriously tricky to assess, because several, to some extent unavoidable, methodological differences exist between human and non-human primate research.
The foundational experimental paradigm of behavioural decision-making research consists in making choices between 'lotteries' or 'gambles', i.e., options associated with known or unknown probabilities of obtaining different outcomes 
[2,
5]
. According to the gambling metaphor of individual choice 
[48]
, lotteries are believed to be prototypical of real-life decisions 
[49]
. Outcomes and their probabilities are described to participants, who often (especially in the first generation of behavioural economics studies) make only one or very few choices, without being informed about the result of their choices (sometime to purposely avoid learning processes to impact decision-making 
[50]
). On the other side, monkey electrophysiological research adopts very different methodological standards. For various reasons (including ethical ones), monkey studies are limited in terms of sample size, and consequently the number of observations per subject is greatly increased in order to improve statistical power and reduce noise in measurements. In fact, behavioural tasks in monkeys display a greater number of trials per subject, collected on a sample size of often less than five subjects (e.g., 
[51,
52]
). Both parameters (sample size and number of trials) are roughly a couple of orders of magnitude different compared to what is common practice in behavioural economics (e.g., 
[53,
54]
) ( 
Figure 2A)
.
Strikingly, fMRI studies of decision-making present experimental parameters somehow in-between those used in monkeys and Human studies: they usually involve hundreds of trials and also sample sizes of about 20-40 subjects (see two notable examples in neuroeconomics: 
[25,
55]
). Assuming that decision-making possesses ergodicity (i.e., the behaviour averaged across trials is the same as the behaviour averaged across subjects), different ratio trial/participants per se should  In the description domain, subjective probability is reflected by a probability weighting function (here denoted π) following an inverse S-Shape (i.e. low probabilities are overweighted while high probabilities are underweighted). This tendency is reversed when it comes to the experience domain, where the curve follows an S-shape. B, Illustration of the classical linear utility function in the description domain (left panel) and the value function for the experience domain (right panel). In description, the utility curve displays a steeper slope for losses than gains. In experience, an opposite phenomenon is frequently observed. The sign of the prediction error (i.e. the difference between the obtained reward R and the associative value Q) affects learning. not present a big challenge to compare results from human and monkey studies (but note that ergodicity does not seem to be granted for psychological processes, see 
[56]
). However, in addition to these quantitative differences, in monkey studies, an outcome (usually a primary reward) is provided on a trial-by-trial basis. This is because a monkey would simply stop doing the experiment in the absence of extrinsic motivation. Thus, in virtual all cases monkey experiments include a reinforcement learning component, where past actions are associated with past outcomes. This is true even when the paradigm involves establishing a symbolic system to communicate outcomes and probabilities. In fact, in absence of a shared language or semantic system to communicate, monkeys are compelled to learn any representational system by trial-and-error from feedback.
In the present article we argue that the above mentioned differences do not only present a technical issue, but also a major epistemological challenge for the (strong) neuroeconomic agenda. We detail below why.


The description-experience gap
As mentioned before, foundational contributions to decision behavioural science were made through the use of explicitly described gambles. Several representations have been used to convey outcomes values and probabilities, including textual and numerical descriptions (e.g. 
[5,
8,
53]
), later replaced by visual cues such as pie-charts (e.g. 
[25,
57]
). In these paradigms the information pertaining the decision-relevant is processed by verbal and mental calculation systems and rely upon some degree of semantic knowledge to decode the meaning to the symbols used. In addition to that, decision problems were usually presented only once and, in case multiple decision problems were used, the final outcome (i.e., the realisation of the lottery) was usually not displayed on a trial-by-trial basis ( 
Figure 2B
). However, relatively few situations in real life match the characteristics of the pure description-based paradigms, namely a complete and explicit information about outcome values probabilities. In fact, in many circumstances, it seems rather prudent to assume that information about outcome values and probabilities are shaped by past encounters of the same decision problem. Experimentally, this configuration is often translated into multi-armed bandit problems (starting with Thompson 
[58]
, but see 
[59]
 for a review), where the decision-maker faces abstract cues of unknown value and has to figure by trial-and-error the value of the options. Computationally, behaviour in multi-armed bandit problems is generally well-captured by associative or reinforcement learning processes 
[60]
. In the early 2000s a line of enquiry arose where researcher translated the typical decision problems used in behavioural economics (i.e., involving choices between a safe and a risky prospect in the gain and loss domain 
6
 ) into experience-based paradigms 
[54,
62,
63]
 
(Figure 2B)
. Systematic comparisons between these two decision-making modes revealed the existence of robust description-experience gaps regarding risk preferences in humans 
[64]
[65]
[66]
 . More precisely, probability weighting functions eventually show opposite deformations when comparing description-based and experience-based choices 
(Figure 3, Box 1)
. In particular, most of the tenets of prospect theory do not seem to hold in experience-based choices 
[8]
. While traditionally, in the description domain, the occurrence of rare events is overestimated (possibility effect) and the occurrence of frequent events underestimated, experience-based decision tends to show the opposite biases: an effect that is only partially explained by incomplete sampling 
[54,
62,
63]
.
In description-based choices, a behavioural hallmark of loss aversion (overweighting of negative outcomes) is the reflection effect, where subjects are risk-averse in the gain domain and risk-seeker in the loss domain. The opposite pattern has been repeatedly found in the experience-based decisions 
[66]
. This observation may be explained by biases in the learning process, such as remembering preferentially extreme outcomes or integrating preferentially better-thanexpected outcomes 
[67,
68]
. Finally, a smaller subset of studies investigated a hybrid situation where decision problems are fully described, choices are repeated and followed by a trial-by-trial basis feedback. These 'description plus experience' paradigms showed that prospect-theory compatible probability distortions are initially present, but corrected by the presence of feedback 
[69,
70]
. To summarize, the whole spectrum of decision-making under uncertainty in humans is far from being fully captured by PT's loss aversion and subjective probability deformation. Specifically, different descriptive models seem to apply as a function of how outcome and probability information is conveyed. In the remaining of the paper, we illustrate why we believe that this feature seriously challenges leveraging on neural and behavioural data in monkeys to build a neural model of decision-making under uncertainty.


Decision under risk in monkeys
In the present section we try to address the question of whether monkeys are a good experimental model for human decisionmaking under uncertainty. We will focus this survey on rhesus monkey (macaca mulatta) results because most electrophysiological studies are performed in this species (but see 
[71]
 for a more detailed review including other primates). Asking whether monkeys are a good experimental model translates into asking whether in the laboratory setting their behaviour displays the distinctive features and biases observed in humans. We stress again that the comparison is complicated by the fact that pure description-based paradigms cannot exist in monkey studies because of the lack of language. In fact, whenever in monkey studies, outcomes and probabilities are conveyed via a symbolic system, it is still learned and maintained by trial-by-trial outcomes (i.e., a situation similar to the 'description plus experience' paradigm, described above). In such 'pseudo' description-based paradigm, monkeys are trained to associate continuous variations in one visual feature (e.g., colour and size) to continuous variations of a decision variable (e.g., outcomes or probabilities). The comparison is further complicated by the fact that only few studies formalize risk preferences in terms of model parameters (such as probability distortion, loss aversion or learning rates) and data reporting is often limited to behavioural measures.
The general picture ( 
Table 1)
 emerged from "pseudo" description-based paradigms in monkeys (i.e., studies relying on learned symbolic systems to communicate values) is, at best, mixed. Prospect theory has been explicitly tested in paradigms using visual cues carrying symbolic information similar to those presented to humans (e.g. pie-charts). Only few studies show results in conformity with the pattern of description-based decisions observed in humans. Riskaversion, suggestive of marginally decreasing utility in the gain domain, has been rarely reported 
[72]
. Nioche et al. 
[73]
 is the sole study confirming all PT features: marginally decreasing utility (risk aversion in the gain domain), loss aversion (risk seeking in the loss domain) and subjective probability weighting consistent with overestimation of rare events. Probability weighting function consistent with standard PT has been reported by other studies, but the same studies also reported increasing marginal utility and risk seeking in the gain domain, which is not typically observed in description-based decisions in humans 
[74,
75]
. Many others pseudo descriptionbased experiments also reported risk-seeking attitudes and/or marginally increasing utility in gains 
[76]
[77]
[78]
[79]
. In addition, although the traditional inverse probability weighting function has sometimes been observed 
[73,
74]
, variation of experimental design features (such as randomly mixing gambles instead of repeating the same gambles sequentially) can reverse the direction of the probability weighting function 
[80]
.
Regarding "pure" experience-based studies in monkeys (i.e., involving no symbolic system to communicate values), the picture is somehow clearer. Indeed, rhesus macaques exhibit robust risk-seeking behaviour in the gain domain 
[81]
[82]
[83]
[84]
[85]
[86]
[87]
[88]
[89]
[90]
. Risk-seeking attitudes have also been reported in the loss domain 
[91]
. Risk-seeking behaviour in experience-based studies can be computationally explained by an increased sensitivity to positive (compared to negative) prediction errors ('positivity' bias) as the one generally documented in humans (Box 1) 
[67,
92,
93]
. This hypothesis is corroborated by studies  
Table 1
. Studies investigating risk attitudes in rhesus monkey. The modality 'E' denotes experience paradigms (i.e. without explicit representation of outcomes and probabilities). The modality 'D' denotes description paradigms (i.e. involving explicit representation of outcomes and probabilities). Note that in monkeys this implies a 'description plus experience' set-up. We mention the nature of the reward, which is most of the time a juice (fruit juice or water). Risk attitudes can take two values, either 'seek', either 'avoid'. When probability distortions are studied, we mention the direction of the curve (either an S-Shape, either an inverse S-Shape). When loss aversion is explicitly studied and replicated, we indicate it.
demonstrating a stronger impact of past positive outcome in choices using either model free and model-based measures 
[82,
85,
94]
.
Finally, it can be argued that if monkeys are a good model for human decision-making under uncertainty, they should display a description-experience gap. To our knowledge, so far only one study started explicitly tackling this issue 
[95]
. Monkeys were asked to make repeated choices between safe, and risk options, whose outcome probability was either learned by experience or described by the ratio between colors on a rectangle. Replicating previous findings in monkeys, and in discordance with the standard result in humans, Heilbronner and Hayden found that monkeys were risk-seekers in the description domain. However, consistent with the gap observed in humans, they also found that risk seeking behaviour was higher for experience-based cues.
To summarize, the literature seems to suggest that monkeys' decision-making for experience-based choice is quite consistent to what is observed in humans in terms of riskpreference. This is consistent with a large body of literature showing that the neural substrates of reinforcement learning are largely preserved in the two species 
[96,
97]
. Risk seeking in this context may be driven by higher learning rate from positive compared to negative prediction errors, which is essentially a computational reinforcement learning translation of the 'hot hand' fallacy 
[98,
99]
. The situation is much less promising concerning description-based decisions, as preferences compatible with prospect theory are rarely observed. This can be due to the fact that pseudo description-based design in monkeys resembles the 'description plus experience' set-up in humans, where PT-like deformation are blunted or even disappear, as if description-based and experience-based biases reciprocally cancel themselves 
[69,
70]
. As a result, it remains unclear to what extent description-based processes can be captured by the monkey model.  


The impact of other experimental differences
Experimental results concerning decision-making under uncertainty in monkeys do not seem to straightforwardly comply with the predictions of prospect theory. Overall it seems that monkeys' behaviour is better accounted for as an experiencebased decision process, which is consistent with the fact that pure description-based paradigms are not possible and monkey experiments always involve trial-by-trial feedback. The systematic presence of trial-by-trial feedback is not the only recurrent methodological difference between the monkey and human studies 
(Figure 2
 and 
Figure 4)
.
First, monkey studies essentially rely on primary rewards (mainly water or fruit juice), while human studies are realized mainly with secondary rewards (sometimes hypothetical ones) and primary reinforcers are only occasionally used 
[100,
101]
. Preliminary evidence from a study comparing risk propensity for different kinds of rewards in humans (money versus sport beverage) and monkeys showed similar patterns, thus suggesting that in the good experimental condition risk preferences in both species could converge 
[102]
. Furthermore, while the neural correlates of different kinds of rewards converge in the ventral prefrontal and striatal systems (principle of the common currency; 
[103]
) they also have specific correlates, which may contribute to the different neural mechanisms and result in distinct, reward-specific, risk preferences 
[100]
. On the other side, a proxy for secondary reward can be found in monkey paradigms that involve collecting (virtual) tokens to be later exchanged for a primary reward. Unlike pure primary reward tasks, where losses cannot be implemented (it is impossible to take some fruit juice away from the stomach of a monkey), tokens have the advantage of making possible subtracting previously acquired rewards from the animal, thus inducing 'losses' in the same manner as in human. However, a recent study using tokens, showed risk-seeking attitudes comparable to that observed using primary reward 
[79]
. Furthermore, when tokens are used, they are almost immediately changed against primary reward, making them not really comparable to money, whose value is much more permanent. Taken together the available evidence suggests that the primary / secondary reward dichotomy per se does not explain the fact that human description-based biases are hardly observed in monkeys.
Second, in addition to the difference in the nature of the reward; description-based paradigms in humans and paradigms in monkeys often present a systematic difference in the amount of the reward 
(Figure 4)
. Indeed, most of the original studies about prospect theory used hypothetical gambles of hundreds of dollars and the same biases have been replicated using real stakes of about a month salary 
[104]
. On the other side monkey studies use very small amounts of rewards (mere drops of liquids). It has been argued that the part that the description-experience gap may simply derive from this difference in stake and not present fundamental differences in the process that generates preferences 
[89]
. This would be consistent with Markowitz utility function which suppose riskseeking for small stakes ('peanuts effect') before converting to risk aversion of higher stakes 
[105]
 and is supported by the finding that increasing the relative amount of reward (by reducing its frequency) decreases risk-seeking down to risk neutrality in monkeys 
[89,
105]
. However, risk-aversion in the gain domain (and a reverse pattern in the loss domain: the reflection effect) has also been observed with small stakes in description-based decisions in humans 
[66]
. Thus, available evidence suggests that differences in the size of the stake cannot fully explain the fact that human description-based preferences are hardly observed in monkeys.
Finally, another notable difference between human and monkey experiments is represented by the amount and the type of training required to perform the task (See 
Figure 2
 and 
Figure 4)
. In human experiments, task training rarely takes more than a few minutes (in some extreme cases of description-based paradigms, there is virtually no training, subjects are just asked their preferences). On the other side, monkey experiments requirement extensive training, in general spanning through several months (usually training takes longer than the experiment itself). It can be therefore argued that their behaviour becomes to some extent habitual or automatized: a cognitive state that contrasts dramatically with the declarative and deliberative stance of description-based choices taken by humans 
[106]
. In addition to that, training in monkeys (and other animals) often involves simplified versions of the task (often deterministic contingencies), which may reinforce specific risk preferences. Although the role of extended (several days, weeks) training and the resulting behavioural automation (or habituation) in risk preferences is unclear, it may contribute to the fact that human descriptionbased biases are hardly observed in monkeys.


Conclusions and perspectives
Our review suggests that the rhesus monkey is a partial model of human decision-making under uncertainty. Risk preferences in monkeys are generally better explained as experiencebased processes. Accordingly, monkeys proved to be a very good model of human reinforcement learning processes, providing crucial insights into its neural implementation (the dopamine prediction error hypothesis: 
[55,
61,
107]
). The situation is less clear concerning description-based choices. In paradigms using explicit symbolic information about decision variables, only rarely monkeys displayed risk preferences compatible with human results. Deciding by description implies a symbolic system of communication. While in humans this system pre-exists (language), in monkeys it has to be learnt by trial-and-error, thus irremediably confounding description and experience. In addition to differences in the way value information is conveyed (experience-or descriptionbased), other methodological factors (training, reward type and stakes) further drive away the experimental set-ups of the two species. This situation is problematic as building a neural model of decision-making under uncertainty should integrate human (fMRI) and monkey (single unit) neurophysiological data, while explaining risk preferences in a wide range of situations that span from pure description-based choices to pure experience-based choices.
We propose further lines of research that could eventually help filling these gaps and ultimately fulfilling the strong neuroeconomic agenda. On the human side, the descriptionexperience gap has been extensively studied at the behavioural level, but surprisingly neglected at the neural level. A notable exception 
[108]
, found different neural representations for description-and experience-oriented decisions. Furthering this line of enquiry would prove useful to redefine the target areas where to look specifically for description-based processes in monkey electrophysiological studies.
With the development of online testing techniques, it is becoming easier to implement extended massive training in humans 
[109]
. Translated in the field of decision-making under risk, these experiments would provide crucial insights into the impact of extensive training in risk preferences. While, description-based studies in monkeys, require learning ex novo a symbolic system, in humans the meaning of pie charts is provided by language. It would be interesting to put humans in situations, where they have to figure out by trial-and-error the code linking continuous visual features to decision variables.
In general, all the efforts aimed at increasing the methodological overlap between human and monkey studies will provide further insights into what are the behavioural processes shared across the two species. Popularizing fMRI experiments in monkeys would help confirm the neuro-anatomical targets and increase the focus on shared neural systems. The token paradigm (conceptually closer to notion of secondary reward) offers the possibility to implement losses in monkeys, hence facilitating the cross-species study of loss aversion. Finally, on the monkey side, PT has been sporadically replicated. It will be important to understand and formalize the experimental factors (in terms of stimuli, training and reward type; see 
Table 1
) that predict whether PT-like behaviour will be observed in a monkey experiment 
[89]
. Determining under which experimental conditions prospect theory is replicated in monkeys, will imply a deeper understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying decision-making under uncertainty.


Box 1: description-and experience-based behavioural models
In the present box we sketch the formalisms standardly employed to explain and quantify risk preferences in descriptionbased and experience-based decisions. Description and experience paradigms radically differ in how they model decision under risk. In the description domain, risk preferences are the direct result of subjective deformations of probabilities and outcomes that are explicitly stated. On the other side, in the experience domain there is no separate representation of outcomes' probabilities and no explicit deformation of outcomes' values. Consequently, risk preferences are the indirect result of the learning process that links past outcome information to subsequent to choices. Eventually, these two approaches lead to different explanations of risk-attitudes.
Risk preferences in description-based paradigms are commonly explained by prospect theory (PT). The expected value of k iterations of the same gamble X (which is random variable) is computed as follows:
E(X) = k ∑ i=1 p i x i (1)
where x i is the value of an individual outcome and p i the objective probability of the outcome. PT states that the utility of an outcome, that is the subjective value u(x i ), is non-linear and modulated by different parameters: α and β , that are the power to which respectively a positive or negative outcome are elevated, and λ the loss aversion coefficient. Thus, the PT utility function is defined as follows:
u (x i ) = x i α i f x i ≥0 −λ (−x i ) β i f x i < 0
(2)
an α ≤ 1 corresponds to risk-aversion in the gain domain (the intuition dates back to Bernoulli), α > 1 corresponds to risk-seeking behaviors. In the loss domain, the same relation is true concerning the values of β . Value of λ > 1 corresponds to loss aversion; its typical empirical value is around 2 
[10,
110]
. A decision-maker with α < 1, β > 1 and λ > 1 will present different risk preference in the gain (risk aversion) and the loss (risk seeking) domain (see 
Figure 3B
). In addition, PT postulates a subjective deformation of probabilities. There are multiple ways to mathematically express the probability weighting function. One of the most common is the 'Prelec' function 
[111]
:
π (p i ) = e −δ (−log(p i ) ) γ
(3)
with δ controlling the elevation, and γ the curvature. When both parameters are set to 1, the function tends to linearity. The more γ > 1, the more the function adopts an S-shape. A classical result is the overweighting of low probabilities compared to high probabilities, where the direction of the curve follows an inverse S-shape (see 
Figure 3A)
, with γ < 1. Note that other probability weighting function has been proposed 
[53]
. Finally, the subjective expected utility is given by:
SEU(X) = k ∑ i=1 π(p i )u(x i )
(4)
By the variation of these parameters, PT allows to account for inter-individual differences in risk preferences. Of note, concurrent theories such as regret theory 
[112]
 or rank-dependent utility models 
[113]
, which use very different representational structures and parameterizations, are also used to model decision under risk.
Experience-based paradigms can be seen as reinforcement learning problems operationalized as k-armed bandit tasks 
[60]
.
Consider an environment composed by a state vector S, with s ∈ S. In each states s, there are available actions denoted a ∈ A. Each state-action pair has an underlying reward probability distribution, such that P[R|s, a], is the probability of obtaining the reward R, knowing the state-action couple (s, a). An agent must then follow a policy in order to maximize a state-action value function Q(s, a) (i.e. to maximize the average expected reward). A common learning policy is to compute subsequently to a choice the prediction error δ , that will be used to incrementally update the value associated to a specific state-action pair (s, a):
δ = R − Q (s, a) (5) Q (s, a) ← Q (s, a) + αδ
(6)
with α the learning rate, that determines to what extent newly acquired information overrides previous one.
In this paradigm, inter-individual variability in behaviors can be accounted by differences in individual parameters such as the aforementioned learning rate α. However, this model with only one parameter is too simple to accommodate different risk preferences. A way to refine this model to account for different risk preferences, is to allow for two different learning rates, α + and α − :
Q (s, a) ←Q (s, a) + α + δ i f δ > 0 α − δ i f δ < 0
(7)
If α + = α − , the two learning rates model is equivalent to a one learning rate model. We define the tendency to preferentially update Q(s ,a) from positive prediction errors rather than negative prediction errors as positivity bias (or loss neglect) (α + > α − ). Conversely, we define the opposite situation (α + < α − ) as negativity bias (or loss enhancement).
The learning rate asymmetry has direct consequence for risk preferences in the setting where a subject has to learn the value of a safe (say a fixed value of 0) and a risky (say 50% chance of winning/losing one euro) option. A subject displaying an optimistic bias would neglect the past losses and will therefore be risk-seeker (see 
Figure 3B)
. Conversely, the pessimistic bias implies risk-aversion. Both pessimistic and optimistic biases have been reported in the literature, with the latter bias being more frequently reported 
[67,
92,
93,
114]
.
While it is tempting to see the optimistic bias as the experience-based antithesis of loss aversion, their formalism and psychological interpretations are quite different and they are therefore not mutually exclusive. Indeed, loss aversion concerns the valuation of prospective losses, while the optimistic bias concerns the retrospective assessment of past losses.
It is important to note that, in humans, although the average values of the behavioural biases are reported as described above (for instance: inverse S-shape in description-based paradigms and loss neglect in experience-based paradigms; see 
Figure3A)
, there results are further tempered by high degree of inter-individual variability in the bias parameters. At the individual level, some subjects may in fact display opposite biases in both experimental settings 
[67,
115]
. If inter-individual variability is equally high in other primates, the fact that monkey studies use very small sample size (see 
Figure 2
) can explain the comparably less consistent picture observed (see 
Table 1
).

A, Sample size and number of trials listed in two electrophysiological studies [51,52], two human fMRI studies [25,55] and two human behavioural studies [53,54]. B, Schematic representation of the different steps forming a trial in these different paradigms. In pure description, two options are presented with explicit probability distribution of outcomes, while no feedback is given (outcome of the decision). In pure experience, two abstract cues are presented without any a priori information, but subjects are provided with the outcome of their decisions. In the 'description plus experience' paradigm, explicit representations of probabilities and outcomes are provided, as well as the outcome obtained subsequently to the choice.

The figure illustrates how human (purple) and monkey (green) experimental settings map into a four-dimensional space, whose axes are: the way value information is provided (from description to experience); the nature of the reward (from primary to secondary; A), the amount of training (from moderate to extreme; B) and the amount of the stakes (from low to high; C).


In the human reinforcement learning literature, the most frequently used paradigms involve options that possess, at a given trial, different expected values but overall similar risk level
[55,
61]
. As a result the human reinforcement learning literature is more concerned about measure of objective performance rather than subjective preference.
