You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

INTRODUCTION
Researchers have long argued that humans evolved the use of language to increase the size of human groups that could successfully coordinate and make collective decisions at scale 
[15,
18,
50,
60]
. Deliberation is at the basis of many decision-making systems, from friends deciding where to go out to a business board discussing an organization's strategy and politicians debating policies. Nevertheless, the ability to share viewpoints and reach a consensus via deliberation breaks down when group size increases from a handful of individuals to hundreds, thousands, or millions of individuals 
[62]
. Empirical evidence shows that it is difficult to sustain casual conversations when more than four people are involved (the dinner party problem 
[34]
).
The number of possible person-to-person links ( ) rapidly increases with the number of individuals composing a group:
. The number of possible two-person links = ( 2 − ) / 2 in a group of four is six, but in a group of twelve is 66. Notably, the dynamics of social influence change as a function of group size. Experimental evidence shows that different speaker-audience dynamics affect small and large groups. In small 5-person groups, members are influenced most by those with whom they interact in the discussion. However, in large, 10-person groups, members are influenced most by the dominant speaker and show greater post-interaction internal agreement due to the dominant speaker's greater influence 
[19]
. When social influence is unbalanced, information independence decreases and can damage group performance 
[7,
22]
.
Modern organizations and societies are made of thousands or even millions of individuals, where deliberation is currently impossible. Decision-making at this scale is often achieved with leadership, chains of command, division of labor, bureaucratic systems, or representation 
[61]
. Groups face a well-known trade-off between the depth of the information aggregation process and the size of the group involved in it 
[28]
, typically with the former becoming simpler as group size grows larger. For instance, democratic election processes, arguably the largest scale of decision-making processes, rely on voting as a simple way to aggregate preferences from millions of individuals -or even billions in the case of Indian elections.
In recent years, there has been an impetus to bring back deliberation in the political arena 
[17,
21,
47]
. Political scientists have argued for the positive properties of deliberative democratic processes, such as deliberative assemblies, as seen in the Paris Climate Assembly and the Irish Assembly 
[25]
. These methods of collective decision-making are considered fairer by citizens while producing larger buy-in and a more informed populace. However, also here, the size of group conversations limits the number of citizens that can be included in a citizen assembly. Deliberative methods, such as deliberative polling 
[20]
, rely on small representative samples of citizens but some scholars have even argued that in democratic deliberative assemblies, more is smarter 
[35]
.
From an information point of view, whether decision-making at this scale requires deliberation (or even social interaction) is still a matter of debate. Deliberative and non-deliberative opinion aggregation leverage distinct properties of collective intelligencenamely social learning (in the case of deliberative processes) and judgment independence (in the case of non-deliberative processes) -that are both beneficial under the right circumstances. Importantly, deliberation interacts with team size in many real-world tasks and complex information environments. When judgments are independent, and the average accuracy is above chance, group accuracy monotonically increases with group size (the "wisdom of crowds" phenomenon) 
[11,
24]
. In many real-world decision environments, however, individual judgments are often not independent, and tasks can be so difficult that average individual accuracy is below chance. In these scenarios, the opposite result is observed, with small groups showing an advantage compared to larger groups 
[16,
23,
27,
32,
44]
. Whether deliberative decision-making can constructively scale to thousands, millions, or even billions of people remains unexplored.
In what follows, we describe the PSi (or People Supported Intelligence) algorithm. The algorithm is designed to scale deliberative decision-making while avoiding the downsides affecting real-life large-group discussions. The platform uses a real-time voice API to automatically manage audio rooms, allocating users to them to facilitate voice-based discussions among concurrent users. We describe the algorithm's central intuition and novelty. To ground PSi's method on a real use case, we ran a discussion on abortion rights following the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade, the national law that protected abortion rights. PSi interface. a) The user is prompted to answer the discussion question by submitting an "idea". They record a short voice note and choose a title for their idea. b) The user is randomly assigned to a small discussion group. They are prompted to discuss a subset of the ideas and vote on the best ones. A timer on the left of the user interface helps users keep track of time. c) Each user at a table can allocate a number of vote credits to all ideas except for their idea in the first round of discussion. This limitation is introduced to reduce the risk of deadlocks on the first round. Dot voting allows capturing the mean and the variance of the preference distribution. In the figure, the user expresses a stronger preference for the first idea than the following ideas.


METHODS
The PSi process starts by posing an open-ended question and scheduling a new discussion. While binary and multiple-option questions (e.g., Do you agree with the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade?') can be asked, we focus on open-ended problems in this paper.
Users take part by joining a waiting room at the scheduled time. Users are prompted to answer the discussion question by submitting a unique answer ( 
Figure 1A)
, called "idea" (see Box 1. Terminology). The ideas provide a summary of the user's viewpoint regarding the question and consist of a short text title and a voice recording. The system can be adapted to include other answer formats, such as long-format text answers, numerical estimates, or graphical representations.
Thus, a discussion with n individuals produces n unique answers, which describe the space of possible answers according to the respondents. The goal of the PSi method is to find a unique ranking of these answers (e.g., the answers that should be prioritized by impact or importance, or effectiveness) according to users' deliberation, argumentation, and discussion.


PROCEDURE
PSi is an iterative deliberative method designed to generate a ranking of solutions influenced by discussions among participants in response to an open-ended question. Upon entering the discussion, each user i is required to contribute a unique idea denoted as X i . The method operates by taking a solution vector X, which consists of n independent answers input by the users, and producing a ranking R based on peer-to-peer discussions, denoted as R = d(X).
In the initial round, users are randomly assigned to breakout sessions referred to as "tables" (see Box 1. Terminology), as depicted in 
Figure 2
. Each table aims to accommodate a predetermined target size denoted as m (m=2 in 
Figure 2
). The researcher sets a pre-established discussion time (t), typically 5 minutes, during which users engage in conversations related to the m ideas present at the table 
(Figure 1b)
. At the conclusion of the discussion time, users are prompted to vote on the idea they deem to possess greater merits among the m ideas discussed within their table. This voting process employs dot voting 
(23)
, allowing users to allocate a number of vote credits across the m answers at their table. This approach captures the user's belief distribution rather than a single-point preference. Users can distribute their votes across multiple ideas if they are uncertain or allocate all their votes to a single idea if they strongly support it 
(Figure 1c
). Alternative voting mechanisms, such as 1-person 1-vote, quadratic voting, or ranked voting, may also be implemented. While voting serves as the primary means to integrate discussion insights into the decision-making process, other methods of information aggregation can be explored (see Discussion). After voting, votes are aggregated, and one idea per table moves to the next round.
In round two, users are reshuffled to new tables ( 
Figure 2
, middle row) and new rooms (Box 1. Terminology) containing m tables and m ideas are formed. With each new iteration, the number of ideas discussed is reduced by a factor m while the number of tables per room increases by a factor m. As the number of users and tables is constant, but the number of ideas is reduced, smaller rooms are merged into larger ones with each iteration. As more ideas are eliminated after every round, the number of tables where an idea x i is discussed increases by a factor m on every iteration. Users who belong to the same room in round r will belong to the same room in all following rounds. Rooms are sets of tables that discuss the same set of ideas. In Round 1 (top), n users (here n=8) suggest N unique ideas to answer the discussion question. Ideas and users are randomly paired in discussion rooms. Users discuss ideas in their room for a set time and allocate votes to the ideas they support the most. One idea per room advances to the next round based on the votes received. In round 2 (central row), all users are redistributed across tables and winning ideas are redistributed across new rooms. Users discuss ideas in their room for a set time and allocate votes to the ideas they support the most. One idea per room advances to the next round based on the votes received. The process repeats until two (in this particular example) remaining ideas are left. In round 3 (bottom row), all users discuss the remaining ideas for a set period. One idea is selected based on the votes received across the room (all tables).
The platform automatically deals with dropouts while preserving the ideas submitted by users who drop out after the discussion starts. The platform also ensures that the discussion remains civil by letting users flag disruptive users at their table and AI moderation to filter out ideas that use inappropriate language.


ANALYSES
For every discussion, PSi automatically transcribes submitted ideas and, optionally, conversational data. It then computes behavioral and semantic measures that are visualised on an interactive dashboard allowing the researcher to interact with the data. Idea submissions from a single discussion are transcribed and analyzed to compute the ideas' semantic variance. This value indicates the diversity of all submitted ideas. To compute it, we embed submitted ideas using the Universal Sentence Encoder 
[10]
 and then assemble all possible idea combination pairs. Each combination pair is scored for semantic similarity using cosine similarity and the final idea diversity score is computed as the variance of semantic similarity score across all pairs.
To explicitly model redundancies between ideas, we cluster submitted ideas based on semantic similarity, by projecting the idea embeddings on a cartesian plane where each point represents a single idea. Transcribed idea statements are individually encoded into word embedding vectors. The collection of vectors is then subjected to dimensionality reduction to render coordinates compatible with a cartesian plane. The resulting coordinates are then passed through either of two clustering methods to identify clusters, namely HDBSCAN or K-Means. Each cluster of text is summarized using the abstractive Bart-Summarizer model 
[39]
.
Similarity between ideas is also assessed using collaborative filtering. The algorithm, commonly used by recommender systems, is used here to infer the votes that a participant i would have given to idea j had they encountered it during the discussion. This method addresses a common problem in statement-based collective intelligence tools, namely the sparsity of the user-item matrix 
[57]
. Even though a participant does not discuss and vote on every idea submitted, the algorithm helps inferring the similarity of different ideas based on the votes received by similar users 
[14]
.


THEORETICAL ADVANTAGES


SCALABILITY
The first advantage of the PSi method is that the number of ideas discussed in each round reduces exponentially, depending on the base m and the number of initial ideas n. Thus, the number of rounds r needed to reach a consensus increases logarithmically as a function of n:
(1) = ( )
For instance when ten people (n=10) take part and discuss their ten ideas in pairs (m=2), they reach a consensus in three discussion rounds. However, a discussion with the entire world population ( billion people and ) would take only 15 discussion rounds = 7. 88 = 5
(r=15) to reach a deliberative outcome. The logarithmic property of the aggregation process makes it feasible to reach a deliberative decision with incredibly large groups. For instance, a discussion time of 5 minutes per round with the same settings ( ) will = 7. 88 , = 5
be resolved in less than 2 hours: 15 discussion rounds x 5 minutes = 75 minutes (87.5 when including current latency times). 
Figure 3
 shows the variation in convergence time as a function of group size and time allowed for a table discussion, assuming a table size of five (m=5). Most variability in decision time is explained by increases in discussion time rather than increases in the number of people present in the discussion, suggesting that the algorithm is scalable across larger group sizes 
(Figure 3a
). Notice that most variability is explained by increases in time rather than increases in the number of people present in the discussion. b) The same plot but with the x-axis (group size) plotted on a logarithmic progression.


ATTACK RESILIENCY AND SOCIAL BIASES.
Previous studies showed that individual members in a centralised network disproportionately influence group outcomes 
[7]
. In estimation tasks, group accuracy is increased when central nodes are themselves accurate, but it is reduced when central nodes show high error rates or bias. Over-influential individuals can bias the crowd. Greater social influence can lead to desired outcomes in certain situations, for instance, when an epidemiologist is given air time on TV, gaining influence on public opinion and behavior. However, greater social influence of a few individuals can also lead to undesired consequences. Group performance can be hindered when influence is assigned to non-experts, and uninformed individuals or incentives between influential members and the crowd are not aligned (e.g. when a central node wants to influence to attain personal gain).
The proposed method relies on small-scale parallel discussions that limit the influence that each given individual has on the final group decision. discussion round x 5 discussion rounds), or 2.5% of all participants. In other words, collective decisions emerge from individuals interacting locally (i.e., by directly talking to a handful of other users) rather than via global broadcasting of opinions, comments or posts. Aggregation emerges from the fact that opinions receiving support across independent conversations replicate while the others die out. Emergence from local interaction is a common principle in self-organising collective biological systems, such as swarms, schools and flocks 
[12]
. Similarly, unwanted error cascades can occur in groups, even without malicious agents, due to herding, groupthink and other known social biases. Assuming these biases are uncorrelated across parallel discussions, PSi is expected to be more robust than having a one-shot one-group conversation.


INDEPENDENCE AND SOCIAL LEARNING.
Deliberation is known to increase opinion alignment 
[30,
43]
. Opinion alignment reduces the wisdom of crowds by decreasing estimates diversity 
[29,
40,
56]
. Social learning models show that less efficient network structures benefit group accuracy in complex environments because they slow down the rate of convergence to a majority solution 
[6,
38,
41]
. By limiting social interactions to local interactions, PSi can theoretically reduce or slow down social alignment. In open-ended tasks, small groups tend to produce more divergent category systems 
[26]
. Because interaction happens primarily in self-contained small groups, independence is preserved across tables, even in the presence of alignment within groups.
Being part of a large group often produces unwanted social biases such as bystander effects and social loafing. Being part of a large group reduces the incentives for each individual to contribute because responsibility for taking action is diffused among more people 
[13]
.
Individual effort often decreases, as seen in social loafing 
[36]
. In a discussion, these effects can be compounded by negative emotions, such as the anxiety speaking in front of a large audience can cause 
[9,
42]
. Group size can also limit the amount of information each individual can share as information is shared serially. PSi's reliance on small group discussions happening in parallel reduces the impact of these concerns.


FOUR-EYE PRINCIPLE.
In various design systems and teams, the four-eye principle is employed, which mandates that two individuals must approve an action before it can be implemented. This principle is commonly used in quality assurance, business management, and engineering to ensure robust decision-making. Similarly, the engineering proverb "with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow" conveys a similar approach to detecting and rectifying errors through increased scrutiny by independent observers.
On PSi, as ideas progress from the first round to subsequent rounds, they undergo multiple discussions involving an increasing number of individuals. The ideas that make it to the last round of discussion (and thus the "winning" idea) are discussed, by design, by everyone in the group at least once 
(Figure 2
, bottom row). The repeated discussion of ideas by a growing number of users ensures that everyone in the group has at least one chance to raise relevant criticisms before an idea receives the group's endorsement. Importantly, as ideas advance through rounds, they are discussed across independent (i.e., non-communicating) tables, which thus represent independent samples of conversation. This methodology safeguards against herding bias and groupthink, making the process more resilient.


INCREASED BUY-IN.
Beyond a purely quantitative informational perspective, significant qualitative advantages are worth mentioning. We designed the PSi method to increase the ability to meaningfully consult large groups without reducing the depth of the information shared (e.g., via surveys) or the number of people involved in the decision process (e.g., via representation). The ability to hear from many voices constructively will likely increase buy-in as people are given a chance to be heard and participate in the decision process. Even when some individuals disagree (or explicitly oppose) the collective's decision, they will be aware of the arguments supporting it because they had the chance to discuss them with others. Supporters of deliberative democracy argue that deliberative practice improves people's ability to understand nuances in complex topics, to understand better (if not agree with) opposite perspectives and even to make bolder policy decisions 
[17,
58,
59
].


RESULTS
We ran an online debate on the divisive issue of abortion rights in the United States, following the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade, the national law that protected abortion rights. 300 Democrats and 300 Republicans were recruited on Prolific to deliberate on the question: "What do you think the laws around abortion access should be in the United States?" A total of 270 participants proposed ideas, with 208 engaging in the conversation over four discussion rounds. Participants were randomly assigned to discussion groups, ensuring a mix of individuals who either aligned with their political stance or represented the opposing viewpoint. The platform recorded 15 hours of dialogue data in just 45 minutes.
The proposed ideas showed a 0.62 diversity score, signifying a broad range of perspectives. Perspectives ranged from highly liberal ("Abortion should be legal for anyone who wants an abortion in the United States. And it is a woman's choice.") to highly conservative ("I believe that most abortion should be illegal"). The average correlation among people's votes within a table was r=-0.10, reflecting the fact that our sample was balanced across opposing camps of the political spectrum.
Submitted ideas clustered around two main themes. The first idea cluster (the blue cluster in 
Figure 4a
) was related to the legal aspects of abortion, such as when it should be permitted, until what trimester, and who should be responsible for the decision. The second cluster (in red) grouped ideas related to medical aspects of abortion and womens' individual rights. Finally, for each idea submitted, we computed a polarization score based on the fraction of Republicans and Democrats who voted for the idea out of all people who discussed the idea:
P i = |(p rep / (p rep +p dem )|-0.5) * 2
(2)
This measure varies from 0 (Republicans and Democrats are equally likely to vote for the idea) to 1 (Republicans or Democrats are the only ones voting for the idea). We found an inverse correlation between the polarization score of an idea and the number of votes it cumulatively received during the discussion (r=-0.1, p<0.001), suggesting that highly polarizing ideas did not perform well during the discussion.


DISCUSSION
In this paper, we introduced the PSi method as a scalable approach to deliberative decision-making. Information aggregation and collective decision-making methods in very large groups currently rely on voting, surveying, polling, group representatives or chains of command. These non-deliberative methods solve the scalability problem by reducing information complexity or the number of decision-makers. We presented a technical solution for how large groups can preserve information aggregation and decision-making via deliberation. The PSi method crowdsources individual responses to open-ended questions and hosts iterative local conversations that sort the solutions into a final group ranking. Given enough computing power, the method is virtually infinitely scalable, meaning that deliberative decision-making is possible among thousands, millions or even billions of concurrent speakers. Importantly, the process is guaranteed to converge to a collective decision (i.e. a group solution ranking) in a known and finite amount of time. Notice that deliberation per se does not necessarily bring people to agree on one answer. However, the PSi method always outputs the most supported answer at the end of each discussion by design. We do not claim that PSi is a silver bullet to finding consensus solutions. However, the method ensures that the group can come to a deliberative decision in a reasonable amount of time, no matter how large the group is. Compared to other platforms for large-scale deliberation 
[55]
, PSi does not use AI to integrate ideas and reach a consensus but relies on human decision-making. AI is used after the discussion to help summarize and gain insights from the data. The system's scalability is ensured by the fact that ideas that receive more support across parallel independent conversations grow exponentially fast, while ideas that do not receive support quickly die out. Future work will relax these features and parametrize them to control how quickly popular opinions grow and unpopular opinions die out.
Even if ideas exponentially spread within the entire group, social interaction remains localized. Individuals can influence only a limited number of people (other users at their table) rather than having sway over the whole group. This dynamic is very different from how most online fora operate today. For instance, social media platforms tend to be characterized by signal broadcasting, where individual posts are broadcast to many people (their followers or, sometimes, the entire platform user base). In this environment, influence can grow exponentially according to well-understood dynamics, such as winner-takes-all and preferential attachment 
[1,
45]
. It also makes the system vulnerable to attacks. Central nodes can be targeted to accelerate or slow down contagion waves 
[3,
37]
 or to dismantle a network into isolated components 
[53]
. Instead, PSi relies on local interaction and information cascading from one individual to the next in a decentralized manner. This type of information propagation is closer to models of collective behavior in animal groups, such as swarms and schools 
[12]
, where global information aggregation emerges from local interactions among animals with limited access to global information (e.g., the state of the whole swarm). Attacking the PSi system requires influencing many independent small-group discussions happening in parallel. Notably, a successful attack requires a disproportionate larger effort over rounds. For example, it is relatively easy for an attacker to influence the output of a decision in round 1 because they would need to sway only one last round of discussion, the attacker would need to influence all parallel discussions happening across all tables. The attacker would need a confederate (e.g., a bot or an accomplice) in each table they aim to influence. This approach makes attacks more costly as group size increases.
Contrary to swarm dynamics, however, information aggregation on PSi occurs across independent group discussions (i.e., parallel table discussions within a room). Aggregating across modular or small group discussions has been shown to increase aggregate accuracy over and above the wisdom of crowd 
[16,
33,
44,
49]
. This effect is partly explained by the fact that modular groups achieve the benefits of social learning without the downsides of error propagation and diversity reduction. Errors in modular crowds remain confined to the social module and do not spread to the whole group. Furthermore, small groups have been shown to outperform larger ones in realistic tasks 
[23,
27]
, forecasting 
[16,
49]
 and innovation 
[63]
.
A third characteristic of the process is that ideas are discussed multiple times and by more people as they move from round 1 to the following rounds. Many design systems and teams use the four-eye principle, requiring two individuals to approve some action before it can be taken. This approach is used in quality assurance, business management and engineering to ensure robust decisions are taken. On PSi, the fact that ideas are discussed multiple times by increasingly more users ensures that all relevant criticisms are addressed before an idea is endorsed. This approach ensures that the process is resilient to herding bias and groupthink.
A criticism is that ideas are still sorted based on voting rather than discussion. However, PSi voting comes only as a support to deliberation rather than its replacement. Users can influence each other, express the pros and cons of each idea, and express the strength of their support. Voting is not fundamental to the PSi process, while deliberation is. Voting can be replaced by any other aggregation method that ensures a univocal idea among the ones discussed is selected to move forward to the next round. In the future, large language models can be used to map discussions to a unique ranking of the ideas discussed. Although technically possible 
[55]
, whether algorithms should influence human decisions remains an open debate.
Aggregating information across parallel small-group discussions around the same question has the benefit of averaging out random noise and errors emerging from social interactions 
[44,
49]
. While idiosyncratic elements of a discussion will tend to average out (e.g. who spoke first, who was more confident), errors that are systematically present across parallel discussions will not. For example, controversial or emotional topics, such as using nuclear energy to reduce carbon emissions, might bias the collective decision away from the best decision. However, our preliminary results suggest that even on a highly controversial topic such as abortion rights in the US, less polarizing and emotionally charged ideas tend to receive more support. Importantly, modeling and empirical work is needed to validate the PSi method. The preliminary results presented here are promising, but open questions remain. Are PSi decisions better than the average decision (i.e. weak synergy)? Are they better than expert decisions (i.e. strong synergy) 
[2]
? Are PSi decisions influenced by the frequency of similar ideas. Cultural evolution research suggests that ideas that are popular (i.e., salient) prior to social interaction have an advantage in contagion dynamics, independent of their quality 
[48]
. Data collection and behavioral modeling will help determine under what conditions the system succeeds and when it fails.
Another known limitation in the current system is that the group outcome belongs, by definition, to the set of ideas initially submitted by the users in round 1. Some of the benefits of discussing with other people might come from creating new ideas by merging solutions or building on top of other people's answers. Social groups exhibit search dynamics and innovation (e.g., via skill complementarity and coordination) that allows them to discover solutions that experts may not identify due to a lack of diversity in their views 
[2]
. In the Extensions section, we relax this constraint, introducing an idea synthesis feature that allows users to submit new ideas during the discussion.
Several of the limitations above can be addressed without changing the fundamental contribution of this system, namely, the ability to scale deliberative decision-making to thousands, millions, or even billions of synchronous people. This ability opens up opportunities to widen collective participation and democratize decision-making. The Mayor of London's Office for Policing and Crime and the community interest company Black Thrive Global recently used PSi for a London-wide consultation on community-led police scrutiny and accountability 
[8]
, suggesting that the potential societal impact is immense. The PSi method promises to produce fairer outcomes by lowering the barriers to meaningful large-scale public conversations. Beyond democratic participation, large-scale deliberation can produce positive outcomes for businesses and organizations by enabling a wider exchange of ideas, aligning values, and fostering innovation.


EXTENSIONS
We proposed several extensions to relax some of the constraints described in our method. The first extension relaxes the constraint that the group outcome must belong to the set of ideas submitted by the users in round 1. One way to relax this design is by allowing users to incur a little cost to add ideas to the fold during the discussion. While delaying convergence, introducing a few new ideas can improve the collective decision process, building consensus or favoring compromise. This feature allows the user to introduce one new idea at any point during the discussion. This can be used to synthesize existing ideas or to introduce new ideas that were sparked by the conversation. Each user can only use this option once to ensure idea convergence.
The convergence delay introduced by the idea synthesis feature (Equation 1) has an upper bound of 2r. In this "worst-case" scenario, all users wait until the last round to add a new idea, essentially restarting the process. We ran 1000 simulations (n=1024, m=2) where, on each discussion round, a random number of users uses their bonus idea ( 
Figure 5
, red lines) and compared it with the baseline convergence dynamic of Equation 1 (blue line). The second extension of the PSi mechanism is the input to the deliberative decision-making system. In this paper, each user submitted a 30-second voice note and a short idea title. However, many other types of input can be used. For instance, much research on collective intelligence and the wisdom of crowds has used numerical estimation tasks where participants are asked to enter numerical estimations of quantities, dates or measures 
[24,
31]
. Finally, some experiments used graphical representations and GUIs to allow group members to share answers with each other and with the experimenter 
[46,
54]
. No matter the type of interface used to input individual answers, the PSi method can be used as a deliberative process to discuss those answers in a group setting.
A third extension is to introduce more effective group composition procedures to form tables, compared to random assignment. Recent evidence suggests that a better approach to reduce polarization on political issues is to match people who share issue-irrelevant features 
[5]
.
A fourth and last extension of the base PSi method is based on the aggregation mechanism used during a deliberation round. In this paper, we presented dot voting as the information aggregation method to select, out of the ideas discussed, one idea that moves to the next round. Dot voting can represent preference distributions (mean and variance) over alternative options rather than single-point preferences. Contrary to other voting mechanisms that express belief strength, such as quadratic voting, this method is easily understandable by laypeople. However, alternative aggregation methods should be explored. 1-person-1-vote is a common voting mechanism. Quadratic voting has several important properties, making it a desirable voting strategy 
[51,
52]
. Non-voting options can be explored too. For instance, large language models (LLMs) and foundation models can be tuned to maximize the expected approval of a linguistic statement for a group of people with potentially diverse opinions 
[4]
. These promising new avenues pave the way for aggregation methods based on natural language.

(a) Ideas submitted during the discussion were individually encoded into word embedding vectors and projected onto a 2D Cartesian plane. The resulting coordinates are passed through a clustering algorithm which highlighted two main clusters of submitted ideas. The blue cluster included ideas on the legal aspects of abortion ("Laws surrounding abortion access need to consider the cause of the pregnancy as well as the needs of mother and child.") and the red cluster included ideas about the medical aspects of abortion ("Doctors and patients have exclusive rights to medical decisions."). (b) inverse correlation between the number of votes an idea received during the discussion and its polarization score. The polarization score was computed as the fraction of Republicans who voted for the idea out of all people who discussed the idea.

Idea convergence with and without idea synthesis. The blue line represents the expected convergence according to equation 1 (without idea synthesis). The orange lines represent the empirical convergence dynamics of 1000 simulations with idea synthesis. Idea synthesis increases the amount of discussion rounds to reach convergence but this number is bound to 2r.
