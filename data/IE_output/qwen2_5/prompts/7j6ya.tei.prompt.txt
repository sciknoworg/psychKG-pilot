You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Decisions often not only affect the decision makers themselves, but also other people.
Sometimes, these other people belong to the same group or community as the decision maker, and sometimes they belong to more or less rivaling outgroups. Extant research with experimental as well as natural groups has revealed that, in general, people are more generous when their decisions affect the outcomes of other individuals seen as part of one's ingroup, rather than some rivaling outgroup 
(Balliet, Wu, & De Dreu, 2014)
. At the same time, there is growing evidence that some people are more likely to display such ingroup bias than others. In intergroup contests, individuals with stronger prosocial preferences, who prefer fairness and care about own as well as other people's welfare, are more likely to make costly contributions to their group than individuals with weaker prosocial preferences 
(Aaldering, Ten Velden, van Kleef, & De Dreu, 2018
; De Dreu, 2010; but see 
Thielmann & Böhm, 2016
).
Here we address the still poorly understood attentional mechanisms behind such moderated ingroup bias in cooperation and generosity. We do so using eye-tracking technology as a tool to capture the cognitive processes underlying human judgment and decision-making.
Eye tracking allows tracing overt attention allocation through recording gaze behavior during visual information search. It shows what is processed at a specific point in time, how much attention is allocated to specific pieces of information, and how much information is surveyed overall. In decision making it thus allows to track the extent of information search (i.e., number of fixations) and provides an indicator of the cognitive processing effort invested 
(Fiedler & Glöckner, 2012
 in the context of risky choices; 
Jacob & Karn, 2003
 as an example in visual search tasks). Moreover, the proportion of attention allocated towards or nonattendance of a specific piece of information as an indicator of the weight it is given during decision formation 
(Fiedler, Glöckner, Nicklisch, & Dickert, 2013;
Raab & Johnson, 2007)
 can be assessed. Accordingly, recording how information search unfolds over the course of the decision making process can reveal the utility function underlying behavior.
When decisions affect both own and another individual's outcomes, decision-makers process the consequences of the decision alternatives for themselves as well as for others.
Differences in generosity may thus be traced back to the extent to which individuals consider and weight these consequences to both themselves and others 
(Messick & McClintock, 1968)
. A simple and straightforward model 1 represents utility U in terms of the tradeoff between own and others' payoffs as differences in the respective decision weights wown and wother : = × u(own payoff) + ℎ × u(others ' payoff).
(1)
It follows from this equation that higher prosocial preferences (i.e., higher weighting of others' payoffs) lead to an increase in utility for more generous decisions towards others (H1a). Now further assume that decision-makers weight the welfare of ingroup members more than the welfare of outgroup members, which we model with a discounting parameter : = × u(own payoff) + × ℎ × u(others ' payoff),
where = { 1, ingroup 0 < < 1, outgroup.
It follows from Equation (2), first, that decision makers may be more generous to ingroup members than to outgroup members given the discounting factor (H1b) and, second, that stronger prosocial preferences are associated with more ingroup bias in generosity, given prosocials' larger weight placed on others' outcomes (H1c).
The contribution of this paper is to address the cognitive process underlying this wellestablished ingroup-biased generosity by investigating the processing level and attention to others' outcomes as potential channels of the effect. Prior evidence shows that information about ingroup members is processed more thoroughly compared to information about outgroup members 
(Kawakami et al., 2014;
Van Bavel, Packer, & Cunningham, 2008;
Van Bavel & Pereira, 2018)
. Building on the attentional Drift Diffusion Model, utility differences do not only predict behavioral choices but also the cognitive effort spent on decision making. Note that processing effort is conceptualized here as the resources (i.e., time, attention) spent on making a choice, not as the (intuitive vs. deliberate) processing mode. According to drift diffusion models, information is accumulated in a stochastic process and integrated to identify the best option, i.e. the option whose calculated Relative Decision Value exceeds a certain decision threshold. The aDDM captures the speed of evidence accumulation over time in the drift rate parameter, which depends on utility differences between the choice options. When the differences in utilities are large, the evidence sampled is relatively more diagnostic for the Relative Decision Value, which therefore changes more drastically over time. In choice sets with large utility differences, the drift rate is therefore steeper compared to choice options with small differences in values 
(Ratcliff & Frank, 2012)
. Consequently, when utility differences are large and a strong preference for one choice option exists, less effort is required to make a decision than when utility differences are small 
(Krajbich & Dean, 2015)
. Accordingly, effort should depend on social preferences and whether the partner belongs to the ingroup or the outgroup. When facing both in-and outgroup members, individualists process the decision problem less effortfully than prosocials 
(Fiedler et al., 2013)
. Between the in-and outgroup setting, individualists' difference in utility changes less drastically compared to the prosocials' utility difference between the options. Therefore, there is a larger change in the utility difference between the in-and outgroup setting for the prosocial decision maker, which should lead to more pronounced differences in processing effort between the in-and outgroup setting than among individualistic decision makers in decision time (H2a), number of fixations (H2b), and amount of inspected information (H2c). Finally, because information weighted more highly in the decision process receives more attention while the choice is made 
(Russo & Leclerc, 1994;
Smith & Krajbich, 2018)
, Equation
(2) in parallel to the expectations for choices and cognitive effort implies that stronger prosocial preferences are associated with more visual attention directed at others' outcomes 
(Fiedler et al., 2013)
. Stronger prosocial preferences are expected to lead to ingroup bias in attention to others' outcomes (H2d) compared to more individualistic preferences.
In sum, we expect that because the outgroup discounting factor has a bigger influence when preferences are prosocial rather than individualistic, the partner's group membership should impact choices, attention and information processing effort more among people with strong rather than weak prosocial preferences. These predictions were examined in two experiments in which subjects were categorized into two groups, and made allocation decisions in decomposed dictator games with partners from their ingroup, and from the outgroup. Using eye-tracking technology, we accessed cognitive effort by considering the processing time required to make a choice, the number of fixations and the number of pieces of information being inspected. We additionally tracked the proportion of attention to outcomes to oneself and the partner among the decision alternatives. All hypotheses were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework prior to the start of the experiments (https://osf.io/wf5zy/ and https://osf.io/q8dfk/, links for review process available at https://osf.io/z2t2q/?view_only=2152fe8b4961489183b74c00204948d6), where all materials relating to methods and data are openly shared.


Study 1


Methods
In accordance with the preregistration, we invited 110 participants (anticipating dropout we aimed for at least 95% power, N = 65, power calculations were based on a medium effect size (f 2 = 0.25), and α = 0.05, omitting the multilevel structure of the dataset) of which 84 actually took part (55.95% women, Mage = 24.82, SDage = 6.76). Participants (mainly students) were recruited from the DecisionLab subject pool in Bonn, Germany, via the database system ORSEE 
(Greiner, 2015)
, and provided written informed consent prior to participation. The study took about 40 min to complete, did not involve deception and was fully incentivized. Payoffs ranged from 5.30€ to 13.80€ (M = 9.52€, SD = 2.15€) and depended on participants' decisions and performance as described below.
In the first stage of the study, administered online via unipark (www.unipark.de), we assessed participants' prosocial preferences with the Social Value Orientation (SVO) Slider Measure 
(Murphy, Ackermann, & Handgraaf, 2011)
. Participants encountered six monetary allocation problems, each asking them to choose between nine possible allocations of money between themselves and another person. For the payoff in this task, participants were randomly allocated to the role of the dictator or recipient and matched in pairs. After the study, one out of the six allocation problems was randomly drawn to be paid out. Depending on their role, participants were paid either in accordance with their own decision if they were a dictator, or if they were a receiver in accordance with the randomly selected decision of a matched dictator.
From participants' choices, we computed the SVO angle as a continuous measure of prosocial preference (see 
Murphy et al., 2011)
. Note that earlier work often classified people into prosocials when 22.45° < SVO° < 57.15° and individualists when -12.04° < SVO° < 22.45° 
(Murphy et al., 2011)
.
Thereafter, we manipulated group membership by using an adaptation of the wellestablished Kandinsky-or-Klee procedure 
(Tajfel, Billig, Bundy, & Flament, 1971)
. Five pairs of paintings consisting of one Kandinsky and one Klee clipping were shown 
(Chen & Li, 2009)
, Presentation order was randomized and participants were not informed of the painter. They indicated their liking of each painting presented (1 = dislike very much; 7 = like very much, 
(Pinter & Greenwald, 2010)
. Based on their preferences, participants were then assigned to two groups: Giants (preference for Klee) or Titans (preference for Kandinsky), and informed of their group membership.
At least twelve hours after completing the online questionnaire, participants began the second stage of the study. They came to the laboratory where they were first introduced to a group reinforcement task that involved a competition with the outgroup. In a simplified version of the Serial Reaction Time Task 
(Nissen & Bullemer, 1987)
, participants were instructed to indicate the position of an asterisk shown randomly in one of four locations on the screen as quickly and accurately as possible. They were told that their reaction time would be added to their group's total reaction time, and that every error they made would add 5 additional seconds to the group's total, whereas finishing with less than 5 errors would reduce the group's total by 50 seconds. At the end of each session, the running total of the groups' reaction times in the group reinforcement task was compared. The group with the lower running total received a bonus payment of 3€.
Hereafter, participants underwent the calibration procedures to set up the eye tracking devices. To assess decision behavior, participants played 80 rounds of 2-person money allocation tasks (minimal dictator games) and received information about the group membership of their respective partner for each trial. To manipulate the group setting, participants were assigned to one of two within-subject conditions: for 40 money allocations (28 target trials, 12 filler trials) their decisions concerned an ingroup member; and for another 40 money allocations their decisions concerned an outgroup member. The order of the trials was randomized. In each trial, participants decided between two options of allocating money between themselves and another participant, and for each option were shown how this decision could affect their own payoff, the other person's payoff, what the differences and sums of their own and the other person's payoff would be 
(Fig 1)
. In each trial, participants could give up a certain amount of their own payoff that they would receive in the selfish option, to benefit the other player by choosing the prosocial option, where the prosocial option was randomly shown on the left or right of the decision screen. In both options, the dictator would earn a higher payoff than the matched receiver.
Different to simple dictator games, in our design the sums of payoffs differed between the options of the decomposed games to avoid any redundancies in the information about the two choice options. Redundancies would naturally result in lower gaze attendance due to uninformativeness and hence prohibit any clear interpretation of the attention distribution. To control for the resulting efficiency differences between the options and for the different costbenefit ratio of the tasks, all choice analyses control for these variables. In the target trials, own payoffs varied between 2.40€ and 10€ (M = 7.18, SD = 2.04), others' payoffs varied between 0.10€ and 7.80 € (M = 3.03, SD = 2.22). All participants were again assigned to either the dictator or recipient role and matched within the same pairs. Role assignment was determined by the random draw for their online decisions, in that participants that acted as a dictator (recipient) in the SVO task were now in the role of the recipient (dictator). One decision was again randomly selected per pair and determined the payoff for both players. 
Figure 1
. Money allocation task requiring a decision between two options for own and others' payoff. Font sizes used in the experiment were smaller and spaces between items were larger than displayed here.
In each trial, information about the group membership of the matched receiver (Titan or Giant) was presented on the decision screen 
(Fig 1)
. Group membership information was displayed in a box together with two other, undiagnostic pieces of information about the other player (the outcome of a coin toss (heads or tails) and a personal code consisting of a random number they drew from an urn (e.g., "Code45")), in order to mirror natural decision contexts in which group membership information is rarely presented by itself, but rather jointly with other person-related information. Using additional undiagnostic information allowed us to additionally test whether attention towards group membership was specifically directed at the diagnostic information instead of just a byproduct of simple curiosity during the experiment. At the end of the experiment, participants indicated (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) their identification with their in-and outgroups on eight items ("I identify with the group Giants [Titans]", "I see myself as a member of the group Giants [Titans]", 
Doosje, Ellemers, & Spears, 1995)
, and their explicit attitude towards their in-and outgroups on four items ("I like the group Giants [Titans]", "The group Giants [Titans] is good", Pinter & Greenwald, 2010).


Results
Data Pre-processing. We defined three types of areas of interests (AOI) to assess fixations. AOIs containing payoff information or information on the identity of the matched person involved in the decision were defined as 100x100 pixels in size. AOIs containing labels describing the payoff information on the left side of the decision screens were contained by AOIs of 100x190 pixels. Fixations were identified with a 30 pixel tolerance in the summed deviation of points' maximum and minimum coordinates on the x-and y-axes and a minimum duration of 50ms 
(Salvucci & Goldberg, 2000)
.
In line with the preregistration, the following data exclusions were made: Data from two participants had to be excluded because of missing gaze recordings. Additionally, one participant's data was excluded for having indicated in a question included as a check for experienced experimenter demand that they decided against their personal preferences during the experiment. Further, data was excluded if participants failed to correctly indicate their outgroup, if they identified more with their outgroup than with their ingroup or liked the outgroup better than the ingroup (N = 8), to ensure that only participants who were successfully treated to consider themselves members of their ingroup more than their outgroup were included in the analyses. Additionally as specified in the preregistration, trials in which participants allocated less than 50% of their fixations towards payoff and identifying information (2.99%), as well as trials in which decision times were shorter than 200ms and longer than 3 standard deviations above the overall mean decision time (1.91%) were excluded from further analysis to ensure high quality data. After these exclusions carried out according to the preregistration 85.01% of all observations were retained. Additionally, a further exclusion criterion which had not been preregistered was used: For all process analyses, trials were excluded if participants failed to attend the group membership information, because they could not know about the relevant group context. To determine if participants attended to the group membership of the other player, conservatively, all gazes to the AOI containing this information were considered, regardless of the fixation duration. Overall, data from 55 participants was retained for further analyses. Note that there was no evidence that the overall proportion of excluded trials depended on participants' SVO angle (β = -0. 01, t = 1.01, p = 0.32).


Generosity.
To analyze choice behavior we employed a mixed effects repeated measures logistic regression using centered variables, predicting prosocial choices from SVO angle, group membership (ingroup vs. outgroup) and their interaction; we controlled for the percentage of monetary disadvantage incurred when making the prosocial choice and joint outcome 
(Table 1,
 Model 1). This revealed a main effect for SVO angle, indicating that participants with stronger prosocial preferences made more prosocial choices (H1a). Furthermore, we find that the odds of deciding prosocially increased by a factor of 27.07 when decisions involved an ingroup rather than outgroup partner (H1b). Finally, as predicted, we observed an interaction of SVO angle and group setting, showing that while individualists made similarly few prosocial choices in both group settings, we observed more prosocial participants being more generous in the ingroup than in the outgroup setting (H1c 
, Fig 2A)
. The effect held when also including trials in which the receivers' group membership was not attended to (Table 1, Model 2). 
Figure 2
. Probability of making prosocial choices in the money allocation task when facing in-or outgroup members depending on SVO. Separate for all trials, and trials in which group membership information was seen. Panel A: Study 1; Panel B: Study 2. Moreover, participants proportionally attended less to their own payoffs when their partner was ingroup rather than outgroup. Finally, an interaction effect between SVO angle and group setting was present, showing that the partner's group membership influenced attention to own outcomes more among participants with weaker rather than stronger prosocial preferences 
(Fig 3A)
, in contrast to the original hypotheses (H2d).

. Proportion of attention to own outcomes depending on individual SVO, split by attention to the group identifier: overall (A), only before the group identifier was attended to (B) and only after the group identifier was attended to (C), with 95% confidence intervals for studies 1 and 2.
Effort in Information Search. We ran three mixed effects repeated measures linear regressions, predicting effort in information search operationalized via (i) decision times (H2a,    
Table 3
, Model 5). 
3
 As predictors, SVO angle, group setting as well as the respective interaction were used. Results showed a significant main effect of SVO angle, indicating that stronger prosocial preferences were associated with more decision effort, i.e., longer time to make decisions, more fixations and more information being inspected. A main effect of group setting showed that with ingroup rather than outgroup partners, effort increased as reflected in longer decision times, more fixations, and a higher number of inspected information. Finally, we found an interaction effect between SVO angle and group setting for all three effort measures.
Results revealed that individuals with weak prosocial preferences invested less time, showed fewer fixations, and inspected less information when the partner was outgroup rather than ingroup. In contrast, individuals with stronger prosocial preferences showed reduced differences in effort between in-vs. outgroup settings 
(Fig 4)
. Thus, whereas behavioral generosity patterns were as a predicted -stronger prosocial preferences were associated with greater generosity especially to ingroup members -the eye-tracking results showed an unexpected pattern. Before interpreting this set of results, we first examined its robustness in Study 2.  


Study 2 Methods
In accordance with the preregistration we aimed at 90 complete data sets. Power calculations were based on Study 1, where 95% power was estimated to be achieved with a sample size of N = 65 based on a medium effect size (f 2 = 0.25), and α = 0.05, omitting the  .59, SDage = 3.05, demographic information missing from four participants). Participants were recruited and compensated as before, with an additional flat payment given the longer duration of the sessions (total payoff between 6.00€ and 18.30€, M = 11.73€, SD = 2.74€). Experimental procedures and tasks were the same as for Study 1, except for the manipulation of group membership. Specifically, we used an adapted a procedure from 
Simon and Brown (1987)
 to increase group identification. Participants were shown 12 color boards (3 clearly blue, 3 clearly green, 6 an ambiguous mixture of blue and green) and asked to indicate their perception of each color board as blue or green. Based on their perceptions, participants were then assigned to two groups: Giants (more indications of blue) and Titans (more indications of green). To increase the relevance of the group and reinforce group membership, each participant also received a secret group password after being informed about their group membership. They were asked to memorize it so they could report it during the lab stage of the experiment. Providing the correct password would result in an additional payment of 1€. To increase group competition, they were also informed, that they would receive an additional "spying bonus" of 1€ if they could correctly name the outgroup's password during the lab stage. In this event, all members of the outgroup present in their session would get no bonus even if they reported the correct password. They were instructed to keep their own group password secret to avoid spies from the other group costing them their bonus.


Results
Data Pre-processing. AOI definition and data pre-processing for eye tracking analyses were conducted as in Study 1. One participant was excluded for deciding against her/his personal preferences during the experiment. Further, data was excluded from participants who failed to correctly indicate their outgroup, they identified more with their outgroup than with their ingroup, or liked the outgroup better than the ingroup (N = 10). Again, trials in which participants allocated less than 50% of their fixations towards payoff and identifying information (2.87%), as well as extremely short or long trials (2.59%) were excluded from the analyses. 
Overall,
85.19%
 of all observations and 77 participants were retained for further analyses. As in Study 1, for process analyses all trials were excluded if participants failed to attend the group membership information. There was again no evidence that the overall proportion of excluded trials depended on participants' SVO angle (β = -0. 01, t = -0.06, p = 0.95).


Generosity.
As before we used a mixed effects repeated measures logistic regression predicting generosity from the SVO angle and the partner's group membership (ingroup vs.
outgroup), while controlling for the percentage of monetary disadvantage incurred when making the prosocial choice and the joint outcome 
(Table 1
, Model 3; 
Fig 2B)
. As in Study 1, results
showed that stronger prosocial preferences associated with greater generosity (H1a), and that the odds of being generous increased by a factor of 21.91 when participants had been matched with an ingroup instead of an outgroup member (H1b). Again, we found a significant interaction of SVO angle and group setting: While individuals with weaker prosocial preferences showed smaller differences in generosity between in-and outgroup settings, differences were larger for more prosocial participants (H1c). The effects held when also including trials in which the group membership information was not attended to 
(Table 1
, Model 4).
Attention to Own Outcomes. Regarding attention to own vs. others' outcomes, we again ran a regression with SVO angle and the group setting as the independent variables, predicting the proportion of attention to own payoffs 
(Table 2
, Model 2; 
Fig 3A)
. As in Study 1, results showed significant main effects of SVO and the ingroup: prosocials attended less to own outcomes than individualists, and when facing an ingroup member, the level of attention to own outcomes was lower than when facing an outgroup member. In line with our initial hypotheses (H2d), we found an interaction effect of SVO and group setting indicating a bigger difference in attention to own outcomes between in-and outgroup situations for more prosocial participants.
This finding was in contrast to the result of Study 1, where individualists had shown bigger differences in response to the group setting than prosocials. Analyzing these findings on a more fine-grained level, we restricted the analyses to the information search after the group identifier was first attended to (be it in a swift glance or a fixation), and found that the interaction effect in Study 1 remained the same 
(Table 4
, Model 1, and 
Fig 3C)
, while the interaction effect of Study 2 did not present as significant 
(Table 4
, Model 2, and 
Fig 3C)
. The main effects of SVO and group setting, as well as the interaction effects between these factors remained qualitatively the same and significant when rerunning the analyses on the dependent variables of decision effort for both Studies 1 and 2 
(Table S2)
. From this it follows that the overall interaction effect of Study 2 was most likely due to noise in the subsample before the group identifier was first attended to 
(Table 4
, Model 4, and 
Fig 3B)
.
Effort in Information Search. Again, three regressions were conducted to assess effort in information search, predicting decision times (H2a, 
Table 3
, Model 2), number of fixations (H2b, 
Table 3
, Model 4), and number of inspected information (H2c, 
Table 3
, Model 6) as a function of SVO angle, the group setting, and its interaction. Again, we found significant main effects of SVO and the group setting, as well as a significant SVO angle ⨉ group membership interaction. Whereas individuals with weaker prosocial preferences generally invested less effort when making a decision involving an outgroup rather than ingroup partner, participants with stronger prosocial preferences exerted similar amounts of effort when the partner was in-or outgroup 
(Fig 4)
. 


General Discussion
Across two studies, we demonstrate behavioral ingroup-based generosity and illuminate the cognitive processes underlying such decisions, which are excavated using eye-tracking. On the behavioral level, we found new evidence for stronger ingroup bias among decision-makers with stronger rather than weaker prosocial preferences. Earlier work revealed such a pattern in intergroup contests in within group public goods, which we extend to ingroup biased generosity in a non-strategic setting. Thus, people with stronger prosocial preferences are more willing to reduce personal welfare to benefit another person for someone from one's in-rather than outgroup.
On the cognitive level, we demonstrate that decision effort and processing differed as a function of prosocial preferences and the group setting. First, stronger prosocial preferences were associated with more decision effort: longer time to make decisions, more fixations and more information being inspected. This finding fit predictions based on the attentional drift diffusion model, and lends new support to the notion of relative utility weighting being reflected in the sampling process. Interestingly, the observation that stronger prosocial preferences are associated with more decision effort is at odds with work suggesting that cooperation is an intuitive choice made fast and without much deliberation 
(Rand, 2016;
Rand, Greene, & Nowak, 2012
; but see 
Achtziger, Alós-Ferrer, & Wagner, 2018;
Bouwmeester et al., 2017;
Piovesan & Wengström, 2009;
Tinghög et al., 2013)
. Future work using process-tracing techniques is needed to clarify when and why prosocial preferences and generosity is automatic and effortless, or instead more effortful and deliberative.
Investigating the influence of social preferences further, our analyses show that others' outcomes were attended to more with increasing prosocial preferences. In line with the notion that information more important to the decision makers receives proportionally more visual attention, this finding lends new support to the notion that prosocial preferences affect the weight decision makers assign to others' outcomes. However, the finding with regard to the question whether individualistic persons show a stronger difference in their attention bias towards own payoffs between in-and outgroup situations in comparison to more prosocial participants did not replicate across the two studies, which we attributed to unanticipated noise in Study 2. Further research is needed to conclude whether pro-social preferences bias attention differentially towards in-and out-group individuals.
Our second, main finding is that processing effort systematically differed between in-and outgroup settings. Decision-makers weighted others' outcomes more, and invested more time and effort into acquiring information before making a decision when the partner was an in-rather than outgroup member. Possibly, humans are particularly concerned about the consequences of their decisions when ingroup members are involved and affected. The observed attentional neglect of the outgroup and the increased attention towards the ingroup fits other work showing that ingroup bias in cooperation and generosity is not primarily driven by a desire to hurt members of an outgroup, but rather by a desire to be good to one's ingroup 
(Aaldering et al., 2018;
Balliet et al., 2014;
Yamagishi & Mifune, 2009)
.
Third, prosocial preferences modulate the decision effort spent on generosity towards ingroup versus outgroup partners. Behaviorally, stronger prosocial preferences were associated with larger differences in outgroup vs. ingroup generosity, and this difference was smaller among decision makers with more individualistic preferences. However, for decision effort we observe the reverse pattern, in that individuals with stronger prosocial preferences present with smaller processing differences between in-vs. outgroup situations than their individualistic counterparts. We did not anticipate the direction of this interaction pattern, and suspect it reflects a greater tension between individual-level preferences for selfishness and the group norm to be generous to the ingroup among individuals with weaker prosocial preferences compared to those with stronger prosocial preferences (e.g., 
Wills, Hackel, & Van Bavel, 2018)
. Put differently, being partnered with someone from one's ingroup creates a stronger choice dilemma with concomitant greater decision effort spent among individuals with weaker prosocial preferences.
In conclusion, the present research takes a new look at intergroup research, moving beyond assessing mere choice behavior and towards considering the processes underlying these choices. First evidence sheds light on how much people with different social value orientation care about others' outcomes in the intergroup context, and how much they invest into searching for information when they make a decision that maximizes their own outcomes, that favors the ingroup or that supports the outgroup. With this glimpse at the cognitive processes underlying intergroup decisions, future avenues of research could investigate the implications of our findings for ameliorating ingroup favoritism, and intergroup conflicts.

The location in which information about the matched player and the payoff relevant information was presented (top, middle, bottom), counter-balanced between subjects.Eye movements were recorded during this task with the eye gaze binocular system (LC Technologies) with remote binocular sampling rate of 120Hz and an accuracy of about 0.45˚. Decision options were presented on monitors with a native resolution of 1280x1024 pixels and a refresh rate of 60 Hz (Samsung SyncMaster 740B (17 in, response time 8ms), Samsung SyncMaster 931BF (18 in, response time 2ms), Asus VB195T (18 in, response time 5ms)).

A mixed effects repeated measures linear regression, predicting the proportion of attention to own payoffs from SVO angle, group setting as well as the respective interaction (Table 2, Model 1), showed a significant main effect of SVO angle. Stronger prosocial preferences were associated with proportionally less attention to own payoffs.

Note that other social preference models could also be considered
(Bolton & Ockenfels, 2000;
Charness & Rabin, 2002;
Falk & Fischbacher, 2006;
Fehr & Schmidt, 1999)
, but that this paper uses as simpler model as a starting point.


Analyzing differences in the proportion of attention spent on diagnostic vs. undiagnostic information about the other player showed that significantly more attention was directed to the group membership (Study 1: t(56) = 6.24, p < 0.001, Study 2: t(79) = 8.34, p < 0.001).


For the correlation table across both studies presented here, see Table S1.
