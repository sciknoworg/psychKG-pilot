You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Adolescence is marked by increased independence for self-directed decisionmaking and an accompanying increase in risky and impulsive decisions 
(Crone & Dahl, 2012;
Defoe et al., 2015;
Kann et al., 2018;
Romer, Reyna, & Satterthwaite, 2017;
Somerville, Jones, & Casey, 2010;
Steinberg, 2007)
. Many experimental studies have attempted to capture this pattern (for review, see 
Rosenbaum et al., 2018)
, focusing on developmental differences in reward sensitivity, peer influence, risk tolerance, and preferences for immediate or future outcomes 
(Albert, Chein, & Steinberg, 2013;
Blankenstein et al., 2016;
Braams et al., 2015;
Figner et al., 2009;
Lejuez et al., 2003;
Mitchell, Schoel, & Stevens, 2008;
van den Bos et al., 2015)
. In these laboratory tasks, adolescents are typically presented with full information about the consequences of their choices. However, for many decisions associated with risk, such as drug use and sexual activity, and for decisions not stereotypically associated with risk, such as deciding whether or where to attend college, full information is not directly available.
Instead, individuals often need to gather information from peers, observation, or other sources prior to making decisions. How, and how much, information is gathered impacts final choices 
(Rosenbaum et al., 2018;
Wulff et al., 2017)
. However, evidence on developmental differences in information gathering is comparatively scarce.
Some evidence suggests that adolescents gather more information than adults, reflecting a general pattern of decreased exploration from childhood through adulthood 
(Nussenbaum & Hartley, 2019;
Gopnik et al., 2017)
. For example, adolescents explore more information than adults when potential choices lead to immediate reward (e.g., 
Jepma et al., 2020;
Kwak et al., 2015)
. However, this greater exploratory behavior may not generalize to contexts in which rewards after information gathering are delayed.
When selecting between options offering high reward or high informational value, adolescents were more likely to favor the high reward option than adults 
(Somerville et al., 2017)
. Adolescents also sampled less information than older children and adults when drawing from two lotteries before picking which lottery to play for a reward, making decisions with comparatively less information (van den Bos & 
Hertwig, 2017)
.
The delay in reward incurred by additional information sampling may discourage adolescents from more sampling 
(Galván, 2010;
Christakou, Brammer, & Rubia, 2011;
de Water, Cillessen, & Scheres, 2014;
van den Bos et al., 2015)
. Adolescents may also be more confident that the available information is sufficient to make good decisions; even when selecting less-rewarding options than adults, adolescents expressed similar levels of confidence in their decisions 
(Jepma et al., 2020)
.
Another underexplored possibility is that adolescents are more averse to the effort costs required to obtain information. Although some evidence suggests that adolescents are less sensitive to effort costs than adults when exerting effort for reward 
(Rodman et al., 2020;
Sullivan-Toole et al., 2019)
, effort in these paradigms also led to immediate rewards. Thus, adolescents may be more averse than adults to effort costs when not directly associated with immediate reward. Exerting effort to accumulate information for decisions without immediate payoffs may be particularly aversive for adolescents.
We investigated whether adolescents sample less information than adults prior to decisions and whether adolescents are more sensitive than adults to sampling effort costs. To this end, we developed an effort-based information sampling task (adapted from 
Clark et al., 2006
Clark et al., , 2009
. Sampling effort costs were manipulated by varying the number of mouse clicks to sample information. In this task, participants see 25 gray squares that can be clicked to reveal one of two colors underneath. Participants are instructed select which color is the underlying majority and can decide which color is the majority at any point during the trial. Several task features mitigate confounding factors on effort-based sampling decisions. First, the effort required to sample information was made explicit, preventing differences in individuals' ability to learn about implicit effort costs from influencing decisions; second, no feedback was provided to avoid strategy formation and prevent reward and punishment sensitivities from affecting subsequent decisions; third, sampled information was always available, reducing working memory demands, which influence information sampling 
(Hertwig et al., 2004)
; and lastly, certainty could always be achieved if desired by sampling until a majority is flipped (e.g., 13 squares of one color).
Given prior evidence of adolescents' limited information sampling prior to decisions and decreased preference for information over reward compared with adults, we predicted less information sampling in adolescents than young adults.
Consequently, we also predicted that age-related differences in sampling would become more pronounced as the effort costs to sample information increased, such that adolescents would decrease sampling more than adults if effort costs for sampling increased. Additionally, Bayesian models from prior research and novel heuristic models were fit to better determine the mechanisms underlying differences in information sampling behavior 
(Hauser et al., 2017)

Methods


Transparency and Openness
This study was preregistered and was performed according to the preregistration except where explicitly indicated otherwise. All data, materials, and analysis code, including the preregistration, are publicly available on the project's repository on the Open Science Framework (View only link for peer review: https://osf.io/yqdfe/?view_only=57d0b8736d714283a1f74eba24cc4ed5). All analyses were conducted in R Studio, version 1.2.5042 (RStudio Team, 2020). Mixed models were run using the lmerTest package 
(Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, & Christensen, 2015)
, built upon. The snowfall package was used for conducting computational models 
(Knaus et al., 2009)
. Data were visualized using the ggplot2 and ggpubr packages 
(Kassambra & Kassambra, 2020;
Wickham, 2011)
.


Participant Sample
Adults (N=359; 20.53 years (SD=2.34; range: 17.83-47.00); 247 female, 2 nonbinary, 11 unreported) were recruited from the local university participant pool and completed the protocol for partial course credit. Adolescents (N=95; 15.02 years (SD=0.52; range: 13.59-17.00); 48 female, 1 unreported) were recruited from secondary schools in The Netherlands. We only included adolescents attending upperlevel secondary school students because only these students typically continue to university, increasing the validity of age comparisons. Participating adolescents provided informed consent and parental passive or active consent, depending on school preference. All procedures were approved by the local Ethics Review Board. Deviating from the pre-registration, we decided prior to analyses to eliminate participants who failed to sample any square on all medium-or high-effort trials, reasoning that these participants did not experience these sampling effort costs. This criterion excluded a similar percentage of participants across groups: 28 adults (6.1%) and 6 adolescents (5.9%). Highly convergent results were obtained with the full sample (Supplementary Material).


Procedure
The study took place over one session in which the effort-based information sampling task was completed amongst other cognitive assessments and questionnaires. The full protocol typically ranged from 50-80 minutes. Adolescents completed the session in groups of 15-28 participants. Adults completed the session in two groups of approximately 190 participants in a large study hall. The information sampling task was administered using NeuroTask (scripting.neurotask.com; Murre, 2016), an online task environment. Participants also completed the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale 
(Carleton, Norton, & Asmundson, 2007)
, administered via Qualtrics (Provo, Utah). Analyses of the latter data are in Supplementary Material.


Effort-based Information Sampling Task
The effort-based information sampling task was adapted from 
Clark and colleagues (2009)
, with several alterations 
(Figure 1
). On each trial, participants saw a 5x5 array of gray squares that could be flipped via clicking to reveal one of two colors underneath, yellow or blue. Participants were instructed to decide which color was the underlying majority color. Participants selected the majority color by clicking one of two buttons beneath the array at any point during the trial. Sampled squares remained flipped for the entire trial. To manipulate sampling effort costs, participants were instructed that the number of clicks needed to flip a square would vary across trials (1, 4, or 12 clicks), similar to other effort-based decision-making tasks 
(Treadway et al., 2009;
Sullivan-Toole et al., 2019)
. A small square in the upper right corner indicated how many clicks were needed to sample a square. To discourage participants from sampling less only to proceed through the task more quickly, the instructions indicated that participants would play for 15 minutes, thereby mitigating potential confounding opportunity costs. Instructions emphasized that participants could sample as many squares as desired until feeling certain enough to make a decision. Participants completed 10 trials at each effort level, resulting in 30 trials, and trial order was randomized within participants. The same 10 screen arrangements of blue and yellow squares were used at each effort level. The majority color on each screen ranged from 17 to 20 out of the 25 squares. A 2-second interval was used between trials, and no feedback was provided. If participants had played for more than 15 minutes, the task ended after the current trial. Participants finishing earlier progressed in the study protocol or were dismissed (if no task followed the current one). Instead of the preregistered procedure of rewarding participants on two randomly selected trials per effort level, every participant was compensated €1.00 after the full protocol due to practical concerns in compensating participants different amounts while testing in groups.
Adolescent instructions were translated into Dutch and reviewed by three native speakers (Supplementary Material).


Analyses
Two primary outcome variables were calculated for each trial and then averaged over trials at each difficulty level within participants: total squares sampled 
(Clark et al., 2009)
 and p(correct), that is, the probability that the color chosen is the majority color, which was formalized as a Bayesian inference problem using an uninformative prior updated with the sampled information at the time of decision, as follows 
(Bennett et al., 2017)
:
( ) = Pr( ≥ 13| 1 , 2 ) = ∑ Pr( = | 1 , 2 ) 25 =13
where 1 is the number of squares flipped of the selected majority color, 2 is the number of squares flipped of the color not selected, and Pr( ≥ 13| 1 , 2 ) is the likelihood of the sampled boxes if the true number of boxes of the chosen color ( ) were the majority (M) (remember that the total number of boxes is 25). p(correct) provides complementary information to the number of squares sampled, as participants could see different strengths of evidence while sampling the same number of squares (e.g.,
12 blue and 4 yellow squares provide stronger evidence for blue (>99%) than 8 blue and 8 yellow squares (50%)). Analysis of discrimination errors, in which participants do not select the shown majority color 
(Clark et al., 2009)
, is included in Supplementary Materials. Mixed model linear regressions were conducted with random slopes (effect of effort cost) and intercepts for participants, including covariance between random slopes and intercepts. Low-effort trials were coded as 0 to directly compare group differences with minimal effort costs, medium-effort trials as 1, and high-effort trials as 2.
Adolescents were coded as -.5, and adults as .5. Thus, main effects indicate age differences on low-effort trials, and interactions indicate whether adolescents and adults differ in the effect of effort costs.


Computational Modeling
To better understand the mechanisms underlying information sampling, we fitted several computational models. We fitted two families of models: regular Bayesian 
(Hauser et al., 2017;
Ma, Sanfey, & Ma, 2020)
 and new heuristic models. We describe the motivation for these models below, full mathematical descriptions of the models are included in the Supplemental Materials. The Bayesian models consist of prior beliefs over the distribution of yellow and blue squares and an evolving posterior distribution.
Given that participants initially have no information about the distribution, the prior is an uninformative beta distribution, and the posterior is updated with each sample.
The first Bayesian model (Bayesian Optimal) computes the value of both sampling more and the value of stopping at each possible state (combination of blue and yellow boxes flipped) a participant can be in. When 13 boxes of one color are flipped, the majority color is known with full certainty. Thus, these states (13 blue or yellow) are considered end states, where sampling more has no value (zero) and the expected value of stopping is the reward for being correct (one). By starting with the final state, we can retrogress in sampling time to obtain the expected value of sampling or stopping for every possible state. The value of stopping is the product of the probability that a color is the majority and a one point reward for accuracy. The value of sampling is the product of the probability of the next state (i.e., state with one more yellow or one more blue square) and the expected value of that next state. The probability of the next state is determined by the current state. For example, if the current sample consist of a lot more blue than yellow squares, it is also more likely that the next square will be blue. The value of the next state is again the expected value of stopping and value of sampling more. This process proceeds until one of the end states is met, and therefore, these end states can be used to calculate the expected value of each state by recursively taking steps back in time (i.e., dynamic programming). Note that in principle more information will always yield better predictions of the majority, and the optimal solution is to sample until 13 squares of one color are revealed. However, this Bayesian models can be adapted to accommodate that sampling itself is costly. In our models, the sampling cost is a free parameter that reflects subjective sampling cost.
In sum, this model calculates the expected value of sampling for more information by calculating how much further sampling would improve a future decision minus the cost of search (see Supplemental Material).
The second Bayesian model (Bayesian Uncertainty) also assume that agents use Bayesian updating of the beta distribution and that search is costly, but now sampling stops when a subjective certainty criterion is met. The uncertainty of a state at a given time is determined by the standard deviation (SD) of the beta distribution, and the model stops sampling when the SD is below a threshold. In this model both the threshold and the cost of search are free parameters.
Finally, we also added versions of the Bayesian models in which the cost of sampling with a trial increases over time (urgency), indicating increasing impatience to make a decision regardless of the available evidence with each box opened. Following 
Hauser et al. (2017)
, the urgency parameter was fixed over participants and resulted in a trial by trial increase in the subjective search cost.
The heuristic models are based on simple count data from the total squares sampled. The absolute difference model (Absolute Difference) assumes that agents only attend to the absolute difference between yellow and blue squares and stop sampling when a threshold of minimum difference is met. Another heuristic model (Total Squares) assumes that agents stop sampling after a threshold of a number of sampled squares is met. Finally, we implemented a heuristic model that uses the combination of absolute difference and total squares sampled (Two-rule). This model continues to sample until a threshold of a number of sampled squares is met or until a difference threshold is hit, with no priority over each rule. For all these heuristic models, the threshold value(s) were free parameters estimated for each participant.


Model Fitting
The free parameters of the models were estimated by fitting the model predictions to participants' decisions, we did so per participant, per effort level. For model selection purposes, we computed and then summed the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) across all subjects, we did so for all models, where lower BIC values indicate better fit. All model parameters were estimated using the L-BFGS-B method in the optim toolbox in R 
(Byrd et al., 1995)
. This algorithm allows box constraints in which each parameter can be given a lower and/or upper bound (Supplementary Materials).
To prevent local minima, we generated 20 sets of randomly generated starting values for the parameter values from a uniform distribution within the bounds. Models were fit to each effort level separately to determine how effort impacted sampling strategies.
Parameters of the best-fitting model were used to study developmental differences in sampling strategies.


Results


Sampling effort is higher in adolescents than adults
Descriptive statistics for outcome variables are included in 
Table 1
 
Figure 2B
). Follow-up t-tests indicated that adults and adolescents did not significantly differ in p(correct) on the low-and medium-effort levels (ps>.3) but that p(correct) was significantly higher in adolescents than adults on high-effort trials (t(153.44)=3.05, p=.019). These results indicate that adolescents and adults had similar probability of responding correctly on low-effort trials, but adolescents had a higher probability of responding correctly on high effort trials.


Trials without Information Sampling Indicate Effort Avoidance
During data collection, we discovered that participants completed some trials without any sampling. We subsequently explored whether no-sample trials differed by age and by effort level using the full data sample. No-sample trials increased with effort level (=2.43, t(452.00)=4.83, p<.001) and were less frequent in adults than adolescents on low-effort trials (=-2.33, t(452.00)=-2.16, p=.031). A significant group by effort level interaction was observed (=1.99, t(452.00)=1.98, p=.048), indicating that adults selectively avoided high-effort trials more than adolescents.


Decision Accuracy is Similar Across Groups
We explored decision accuracy to examine whether the additional sampling by adolescents led to better task performance. Accuracy was high in both groups at all effort levels (Adults: 97%, 95%, and 90%; Adolescents: 96%, 93%, and 93%, for low-, medium-, and high-effort trials, respectively 


Increased evidence thresholds for decisions in adolescents
Finally, in the Two-rule model, we tested for developmental differences in the two threshold values using mixed model regression with random intercepts and slopes for participants across effort levels. The total squares flipped threshold (ktot) decreased with increasing effort costs (=-3.31, t(452.00)=-17.28, p<.001; 
Figure 3
). As expected, people made decisions after sampling fewer squares on high effort trials, regardless of the evidence. No main group effect was observed (=-0.50, t(452.00)=-0.75, p=.45); however, a significant group by effort level interaction was observed (=-1.50, t(452.00)=-3.91, p<.001), suggesting adolescents sampled more than adults as effect costs increased.
The absolute color difference threshold (kdiff) also decreased with effort costs (=-2.24, t(452.00)=-11.63, p<.001; 
Figure 3)
. A main group effect was observed (=-2.17, t(452.00)=-3.28, p<.01), and no significant interaction was observed (=-0.36, t(452.00)=-0.93, p=.351), suggesting that adolescents maintained a higher threshold for evidence than adults across effort levels.


Discussion
Before making important choices, we often have the opportunity to search for information. This information can be used to improve the outcomes of our decisions but requires some effort to obtain. Given prior evidence of adolescents' increased impulsivity and decreased preference for information over reward compared with adults, we predicted less information sampling in adolescents than young adults.
Consequently, we also predicted that age-related differences in sampling would become more pronounced with increased effort costs, such that adolescents would decrease sampling more than adults if effort costs for sampling information increased.
Adolescents and adults were sensitive to sampling effort costs. Both groups decreased information sampling and obtained weaker evidence for decisions as effort costs increased. Surprisingly, however, adolescents sampled more information than adults prior to making decisions and were more willing than adults to expend effort to sample information as effort costs increased. We applied computational modeling to further investigate the possible mechanism underlying these developmental effects.
These analyses revealed that a heuristic two-threshold model, which combined a minimum evidence threshold for deciding and an absolute sampling threshold, outperformed the more sophisticated Bayesian models in predicting adolescent and adult sampling behavior 
(Hauser et al., 2017;
Ma et al., 2020)
, suggesting that participants relied on a simple strategy when sampling information to make decisions.
Differences between age groups in the heuristic model were largely driven by adolescents exhibiting higher evidence thresholds for making decisions. Evidence thresholds decreased linearly with increasing effort costs in adults, whereas sampling thresholds were more similar on medium-and high-effort trials in adolescents, indicating that adolescents maintained a minimum level of evidence for making decisions even as effort costs increased.
The increased information sampling in adolescents may seem at odds with prior work showing that adolescents sampled less from different lotteries prior to choosing which lottery to play than children and adults 
(van den Bos & Hertwig, 2017)
 and
showed less aversion to ambiguity than adults 
(Blankenstein et al,. 2016
). However, several theoretically meaningful task differences may contribute to these divergent results. First, our sampling task differs from previous paradigms in that certainty can be achieved with sufficient sampling, whereas in prior studies, uncertainty was irreducible (see 
Rosenbaum & Hartley, 2019
 
(Albert & Steinberg, 2011;
Shulman et al., 2016;
Spear, 2011;
van Duijvenvoorde et al., 2010)
, they could sample less information at this age when immediate rewards are available.
Adolescents were also more willing to put forth the effort to sample information than adults at higher effort costs, indicating that adolescents may be more willing to expend extra effort to gain relevant information for their decisions. These results are in line with recent evidence showing that adolescents were less averse to higher effort costs to obtain reward and persisted in exerting effort longer than adults even after earning rewards 
(Sullivan-Toole et al., 2019;
Rodman et al., 2020)
. Similar to this prior work, in which adolescents' extra sampling effort did not yield higher rewards than adults, greater sampling within increasing effort costs here did not result in appreciably higher task accuracy compared with adults. Collectively, these results suggest that adults better conserve and calibrate their effort by not sampling more information than needed to maintain good performance.
Our study has several limitations that potentially constrain its generalizability.
Sampling behavior may change outside of the classroom or testing environment. Being informed that the task would take 15 minutes may have diminished the ecological validity our task, as decision horizons are not always fully known in the real-world.
Further, our task reduced working memory demands, which may be required in different decision-making contexts and has been shown to influence information sampling 
(Rakow & Rahim, 2010;
van den Bos & Hertwig, 2017)
. Moreover, our sample was restricted to academically high-performing individuals in the Netherlands, which increased the validity of our age comparisons but reduces generalizability to other populations.


Conclusions
The present study introduces an effort-based information sampling task that enables explicit manipulation of sampling effort costs and assessments for how much evidence individuals acquire prior to making decisions. Effort-based decision-making remains relatively underexplored across development. Unexpectedly, adolescents sampled more information than adults, requiring a higher threshold of evidence, prior to making decisions. Further, adolescents continued to sample more information than adults even as effort costs increased, suggesting that adolescents may be less averse to effort costs. The additional sampling observed in adolescents did not result in substantial improvements in task performance, indicating that the calibration of sampling effort for decision accuracy continues to improve into adulthood.
Computational models indicated that both adolescents and adults relied on simple sampling strategies, making decisions once reaching a certain evidence threshold or after sampling a certain amount. Our findings shed light on the complexity of factors influencing adolescent decision-making, suggesting that risky and impulsive decisions in adolescence may not be due an aversion to effort costs in gaining information but instead maybe due to other factors, such as reward sensitivity, impulsivity, and improvements in working memory.

. The number of squares flipped decreased with increasing effort costs (=-2.83, t(451.98)=-23.90, p<.001). In contrast to our hypotheses, adolescents sampled more squares on low-effort
trials than adults (=-1.37, t(451.98)=-2.35, p=.019), and no significant interaction between

decision accuracy.
Computational model comparison
BIC's are given in Table 2. Model comparison revealed that the heuristic models
generally outperformed the Bayesian family of models, suggesting that participants of all
ages used simple rules for deciding when to stop sampling. The Two-rule heuristic
model best described behavior. These results suggest that participants generally
sampled until they met an evidence threshold (overall kdiff: 8.31 (SE=0.16)) or stopped
when they flipped a fixed number of squares (overall ktot: 14.29 (SE=0.18)). Simulations
