You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Avoiding threats to one's integrity is a common and adaptive behaviour 
(LeDoux et al., 2017
).
Yet, real-life situations often mandate pursuing rewards in circumstances that entail danger, exemplified by risky foraging. Such situations give rise to conflicting motivations to approach the reward, and avoid threat 
(Bach, 2021)
. Solving this dilemma requires a careful assessment of available options, and the probabilities and magnitudes of the outcomes associated with each of them 
(Aupperle & Paulus, 2010)
.
Approach-avoidance conflict (AAC) tests encapsulate this situation in a well-defined laboratory setting 
(McNaughton et al., 2016;
Rodgers et al., 1997)
. Anxiolytic substances -i.e., drugs that reduce subjective feelings of anxiety in clinical conditions -crucially alter animals' cautiousness in such tasks (see Cryan & Sweeney, 2011 for a review). This has led to a long history of employing them as a primary preclinical model in anxiety disorder research, and for the development of anxiolytic drugs. More recently, AAC tasks have been translated to humans, and validated by cross-species similarity of underlying neural substrates including their sensitivity o benzodiazepines and other anxiolytics, as well sensitivity to hippocampus lesions (see Bach, 2021 for a review).
An initial assumption in this translational effort was that AAC task readouts relate to trait anxiety 
(Aupperle et al., 2011)
 and might even be used as diagnostic tests for anxiety disorders (see 
Bach, 2021;
 Stephan et al., 2016 for a review). While this appears intuitively plausible, evidence that AAC behaviour relates to trait anxiety is inconsistent (see Fricke & Vogel, 2020 for a review). Specific relations reported in individual studies 
(Bach, 2015;
Fung et al., 2019;
Walz et al., 2016)
 were largely not replicated 
(Biedermann et al., 2017;
Gromer et al., 2021;
Kallai et al., 2007;
Struijs et al., 2017
Struijs et al., , 2018
Walz et al., 2016)
, including in a large sample 
(Bach et al., 2020)
. Similarly, a large-scale clinical study found no relation of approach-avoidance behaviour with anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse diagnosis 
(Smith et al., 2021)
. At the same time, cautiousness in human AAC tasks appears to be a relatively stable trait as shown by 2-year test-retest reliability 
(Bach et al., 2020)
. This raises an important question: if anxiolytic-sensitive cautiousness, and self-reported trait anxiety, are both stable traits but not specifically related to each other, then what other psychiatric symptom dimensions predict cautiousness?
This is the question we sought to address here in two large online samples and with a comprehensive psychiatric symptom battery. To this end, we capitalised on a previously validated human AAC task 
(Bach, 2015)
 with a simple and abstract visual design that could be presented online.
In this task, a participant can decide whether, and how rapidly, to approach a reward, under risk of being virtually attacked by a predator and incurring a variable loss. As with many AAC tasks, its core behavioural indices are passive avoidance, i.e., rate of avoidance decisions, and behavioural inhibition, i.e., latency to initiate approach. Previous work has consistently demonstrated that both of these indices linearly increase with increasing threat probability and threat magnitude (i.e., potential loss; 
Abivardi et al., 2020;
Bach, 2015
Bach, , 2017
Castegnetti et al., 2020;
Khemka et al., 2017)
, a group effect that we replicated in the present sample. Notably, behavioural inhibition in this task is not reward-maximising but might be optimal if the agent has assumptions about the temporal coupling of reward and threat 
(Bach, 2015)
. Thus, in a secondary task, we assessed people's implicit beliefs about such reward correlations 
(Bach, 2017)
. We then asked whether passive avoidance and behavioural inhibition, and their relation to threat probability and magnitude, are linked to psychiatric symptom dimensions. For comparability with previous work on other behavioural dimensions, we utilised a comprehensive clinical questionnaire battery with a known three-factor structure 
Rouault et al., 2018)
 which we replicated in our samples. These factors were previously named 'Compulsive Behaviour and Intrusive Thought (CIT)', 'Anxious-Depression (AD)' and 'Social Withdrawal (SW)'. We added an IQ test, further anxiety questionnaires, and questionnaires found relevant in previous work on AAC tasks. As we had no prior hypothesis on which symptom dimensions or questionnaires would relate to cautiousness, we opted for a rigorous exploration-confirmation approach. Hypotheses were first generated based on analysis of a discovery sample (N = 315), and then confirmed after pre-registration in a second sample (N = 690).


Methods and Materials


Participants
Participants (> 18 years old) were recruited online using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk, https://www.mturk.com/). We included 315 participants in the discovery sample (149 females, mean age ± SD: 36.40 ± 11.01; October-November 2021) and 690 in the confirmation sample (338 females, mean age ± SD: 33.41 ± 9.89; February-March 2023; see 
Table S1
). The combined sample comprised 1005 participants (487 females, mean age ± SD: 34.35 ± 9.89). Participants who completed the task per protocol were included if they did not meet any of the following exclusion criteria: (1) Pressed (or did not press) the same button on the keyboard in more than 95% of the trials, (2) Responded incorrectly to all three attention checks in the questionnaires (see SI),
(3) Returned to the safe place in fewer than 50% of the trials, indicating lack of understanding of the task, (4) Performance at chance level. We excluded 189 (37%) participants out of 504 in the discovery sample and 478 (41%) participants out of 1168 in the confirmation sample (see 
Figure S1
). Our exclusion rate, while somewhat higher than the typical 3-37% range found in a meta-analysis, is not unusual for such studies . Although there are plausible concerns about the quality of behavioural data acquired online 
Burnette, Luzier, Bennett, Weisenmuller, Kerr, Martin, et al., 2022;
Chandler et al., 2014;
Zorowitz et al., 2023)
, extensive supporting analyses confirmed that our findings are unlikely to be influenced by low data quality (see SI; 
Zorowitz et al., 2023)
.
After reading an information sheet about the experiment, participants confirmed their consent online. All procedures were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and local regulations. The study was approved by the Governmental Ethics Committee (Kantonale Ethikkommission Zurich, BASEC 2016-00068). Participants were paid a base sum of $10 plus a bonus ranging from 2$ to 14.5$ (with a mean of 12$) conditional on task performance and on attention checks.


Experimental design


Tasks
Participants performed a AAC task (see 
Figure 1
) based on previous studies in a lab setting 
(Abivardi et al., 2020;
Bach, 2015
Bach, , 2017
Bach et al., 2019;
Castegnetti et al., 2020;
Khemka et al., 2017)
. Participants could collect one monetary token (approach motivation) under threat of getting caught by a predator and consequently losing an explicitly signalled number of tokens (avoidance motivation). At the beginning of each trial, the participant started in a "safe place" at the bottom of the grid and had to decide whether to collect a token that would appear on either side after an interval.
Tokens appeared after a random interval; task timing details are in the SI. In case the participant did not collect the token, it disappeared after a variable time drawn from the same distribution. Below the grid, the potential loss of the current trial (0-5 tokens) was indicated by red tokens. A "sleeping" predator was waiting opposite the safe place in the top grid block and could catch the participant if they were outside the safe place. Three threat levels, corresponding to different wake-up rates following a Bernoulli process using values established in previous work (see 
SI;
Bach, 2015)
, were represented by different frame colours Crucially, threat probabilities were not explicitly instructed but it was emphasised that the predators were differently dangerous and that the participants needed to learn this difference. If the participant got caught, then the token disappeared, the predator turned red, and the indicated potential loss was realised.
The second block comprised the predator exposure task, randomly interspersed with AAC task refresher trials. In this task, participants could not move to the sides of the grid and were instructed to expose the awake predator by pressing the up-arrow key (i.e. a motor action unavailable on AAC trials).
If the predator was awake during the attempt, it turned red and the trial would end early. Otherwise, it would turn black and the trial would continue to the pre-determined end. This feedback allowed participants to update their knowledge of the experimental statistics (which were maintained throughout all blocks), according to which the probability of being awake was independent of time or token appearance and was randomly determined at each capture attempt. Participants were explicitly informed that the tokens were irrelevant to the task and could not be collected. If participants correctly believed that catch probabilities were constant, approach time would not depend on token appearance and the optimal strategy would be to approach the predator as soon as the trial starts to shorten the experiment.
On the other hand, if participants incorrectly assumed a temporal threat-reward correlation, as suggested in previous work 
(Bach, 2015
(Bach, , 2017
, then the reward-maximizing strategy would be to approach whenever a token appeared, at the maximum of their subjective threat wake-up function.
After the two tasks, participants were asked to estimate the probability of getting caught if they left the safe place for each of the three threat levels on a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 100%. The association between the colour of the threat and threat level depended on behaviour and had to be implicitly learned during the experiment.


Psychiatric symptom questionnaires
After completion of the behavioural tasks, participants were asked to answer a battery of selfreport questionnaires based on previous work 
Rouault et al., 2018)
 assessing a range of psychiatric symptoms including depression (Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale; Zung, 1965), generalised anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale; 
Spitzer et al., 2006)
, schizotypy (Short Scales for Measuring Schizotypy; 
Mason et al., 2005)
, impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11; 
Patton et al., 1995)
, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised; 
Foa et al., 2002)
, social anxiety 
(Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale;
Liebowitz, 1987)
, eating disorders (Eating Attitudes Test; 
Garner et al., 1982)
, apathy (Apathy Evaluation Scale; 
Marin et al., 1991)
, alcoholism (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; 
Saunders et al., 1993)
, and a short IQ evaluation (International Cognitive Ability Resource; 
Condon & Revelle, 2014)
. In addition to this battery, they also answered questionnaires assessing trait anxiety (State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety; , sensation seeking (Brief Sensation Seeking Scale; , and the daringness subscale of the Child and Adolescent Disposition Scale  to replicate 
Figure 1
. Experimental set-up for the approach-avoidance conflict task (A) where participants could approach a reward at the risk of getting caught by a predator with varying levels of threat probability (shown by colour of the grid, learned beforehand by direct experience) and magnitude (signalled by the number of red tokens). In the predator exposure task (B), participants had to guess when the predator awoke which followed the same threat probabilities as in the AAC task. As such, the probability of awakening was independent of time or token appearance and was randomly determined at each capture attempt.
and extend previous findings with other AAC tasks 
(Bach, 2015;
Bach et al., 2020)
. See SI for questionnaire scores 
(Table S1
), distributions ( 
Figure S2
), and correlations ( 
Figure S3
).


Analysis Plan
Exclusion criteria, pre-processing steps (see SI) and analysis plan were based on a discovery sample and pre-registered before the confirmation sample was recruited (https://osf.io/5hmgk ; registered on 05 January 2023). The analysis plan encompassed 3 steps.
Step 1 consisted of replicating the 4 behavioural group-level effects of the task previously shown in lab settings 
(Abivardi et al., 2020;
Bach, 2015
Bach, , 2017
Castegnetti et al., 2020;
Khemka et al., 2017)
.
Step 2 consisted of replicating a 3factor solution of the transdiagnostic symptom dimensions 
Rouault et al., 2018)
. For steps 1-2, each precondition needed to be confirmed at p<.05 to progress to the next step; hence there was no multiple comparison correction. The goal of step 3 was to assess our main research questions and investigate associations between behavioural variables of interest (indexing passive avoidance and behavioural inhibition), and psychiatric symptom dimensions extracted in step 2 and individual psychiatric questionnaires. Holm-Bonferroni method was applied to correct for multiple comparisons across 20 pre-registered hypotheses in the confirmation sample.
Step


-Replication of behavioural inhibition and passive avoidance
To test whether any of the behavioural variables were influenced by the independent variables, we conducted (Generalized) Linear Mixed-Effects Models. The specification was: Dependent variable ~ 1 + threat level * potential loss + (1 | participant).
Step


-Replication of the 3-factor psychiatric symptom dimensions
To replicate a previously established latent transdiagnostic structure 
Rouault et al., 2018)
, we applied a factor analysis with Maximum Likelihood Estimation and an oblique rotation on the questionnaire items (see SI for more details). It revealed a 3factor latent structure which was concordant with previous studies 
Rouault et al., 2018)
. As the loadings across items had large positive correlations with the previous studies (see 
Figure S4
), we adopted the same labels. For Factor 1 'Compulsive Behaviour and Intrusive Thought (CIT)', the highest loadings came from the Alcoholism, OCD, Eating Disorders, Impulsivity, and Schizotypy questionnaires. Factor 2 'Anxious-Depression (AD)' was dominated by items from the Generalised Anxiety, Depression, and Apathy questionnaires. Lastly, Factor 3 'Social Withdrawal (SW)' had the highest average loadings from the Social Anxiety questionnaire, with some significant contributions from Generalised Anxiety and Eating Disorder questionnaires (see 
Figure 2
, S3, and S5).
Exploratory inclusion of the three additional questionnaires assessing daringness, sensation seeking, and trait anxiety did not alter the 3-factor latent structure (see SI and 
Figure S6
).


Step 3 -Effect of the psychiatric symptom dimensions on task readouts
To test the extent to which the interindividual differences predict behaviour, we included each symptom dimension score as a z-scored fixed effect predictor into a simplified model from step 1. The specification was: Dependent variable ~ 1 + (threat level + potential loss) * IV + (1 | participant). For all hypotheses relating to symptom dimensions, we ensured that the tests in the discovery sample remained significant in a model in which all demographics were added as covariates.  
Figure S5
 shows the results separately for the discovery and confirmation samples. See 
Figure S3
 for the eigenvalues and correlation matrices between questionnaire in both samples.
To test the extent to which the symptom dimensions predict recollection of threat memory (i.e. learned association between colour and threat level), we included each score as a z-scored fixed effect predictor of estimated catch rates while accounting for true catch rates. The specification was: Estimated catch rates ~ 1 + actual catch rate * IV + (1 | participant).
Estimating explained variance in symptom dimensions is complicated by the fact that mixedeffects models include within-subjects effects and trial-by-trial data. Thus, we estimated the proportion of explained variance in a regression model with symptom dimension as dependent variable and six perparticipant predictor variables: each participant's average approach rate and latency, and their respective linear relation to threat probability and magnitude.
To investigate a subjective prior assumption that the presence of tokens alerts the predator, we estimated the influence of each symptom dimension on the percentage of predator exposure attempts before token appearance in a linear regression.


Results
We investigated the relation between AAC behaviour and three transdiagnostic symptom dimensions. Twenty hypotheses (denoted as H) were first generated based on a large discovery sample (N1 = 315) and then confirmed after pre-registration in a second sample (N2 = 690) with correction for multiple comparisons. To put our findings into context, we report effect sizes and inference statistics from post hoc exploratory analyses conducted on the combined sample.
We confirmed that in line with previous lab-based results 
(Abivardi et al., 2020;
Bach, 2015
Bach, , 2017
Bach et al., 2019;
Castegnetti et al., 2020;
Khemka et al., 2017)
, passive avoidance (i.e., proportion of avoidance decisions) and behavioural inhibition (i.e. approach latency) increased with threat probability and magnitude (see 
Figure 3
.A. and S7, 
Table S2
). We also confirmed that the factorial structure of our questionnaire battery matched the one found in previous work (see SI).


Approach-avoidance conflict decisions
We found a strong and robust relation between AAC behaviour and CIT (see 
Figure 3
.B. and S8; 
Table 1
). Individuals with high CIT scores exhibited a greater inclination to approach tokens (i.e. reduced passive avoidance, H1; p<.0001), such that one standard deviation increase was associated with an 59.2% increase in approach rate. Secondly, individuals with high CIT scores were delayed in approaching tokens (i.e. higher behavioural inhibition, H8; p<.0001), such that one standard deviation increase corresponded to a 128 ms increase in approach latency. Finally, people with high CIT had a higher tendency to approach into the incorrect direction, i.e., side opposite to the token (H20; p<.0001).
Post-hoc analysis also revealed that individuals with high CIT were caught more often (β = 3.2, t(1, 997) = 6.71, p<.0001).
Next, individuals with high CIT were less sensitive to parametric threat features. The decrease in approach rate towards the token with higher threat probability (H2; p<.0001) and magnitude (H3; p<.0001) was less pronounced in people with high CIT. Similarly, the increase in approach latency with higher threat probability (H9; p<.01) and magnitude (H10; p<.0001) was less pronounced in people with high CIT. All in all, behaviour explained 37.4% variance in CIT.
The next best predictor was IQ, with behaviour explaining 8.0% variance (see 
Figure S8
). The decrease in approaching tokens under higher threat probability (H5; p<.0001) and magnitude (H6; p<.0001) was more pronounced in people with higher IQ. Similarly, the increase in approach latency with higher threat magnitude was more pronounced in people with high IQ (H15; p<.0001).
Crucially, no strong relation between behaviour and AD or gender was found, and those that were initially hypothesised were rejected in the confirmation sample (see 
Table 1
). Indeed, no relation of any behavioural index with AD exceeded R² = .01 in the combined sample. Thus, in line with previous work, we found no evidence that AAC decisions related to transdiagnostic anxiety.
Notably, some of the aforementioned relationships were profoundly non-specific, i.e. extended across multiple questionnaires. In a post-hoc analysis across the combined sample, 11/12 questionnaires had a positive relation at p<.05 with approach choices (see 
Table S3
 and 
Figure 4
). Among those, sensation seeking and daringness had the strongest effect. In contrast, social anxiety had no effect.
Similarly, 12/12 questionnaires had a significant positive relation at p<.05 with approach latency.
Among these, OCD and daringness had the strongest effect. Nonetheless, the effect of CIT was larger than any of these individual questionnaires and accounted for the greatest proportion of variance. This exceeded the variance explained by daringness and OCD, the two highest among the questionnaires, at 21.2% and 21.1% respectively (see 
Table S3
). Thus, while altered approach-avoidance behaviour broadly related to questionnaire scores, it was better explained by a single transdiagnostic dimension.


Subjective prior assumptions
To investigate the subjective prior assumption that the presence of tokens alerts the predator, participants completed a predator exposure task. In the combined sample, the majority of the exposure attempts (58.8%) were made after the token had appeared, confirming previous work in lab-based settings (see 
Figure 5
.A). People with higher CIT made more exposure attempts before the token appeared than those with low CIT (H18; p<.0001). A one standard deviation increase in CIT score corresponded to a 161.33 ms reduction in exposure latency. This suggests that people with high CIT might have a less strong prior assumption that the presence of rewards alerts the predator.  
Figure S7
 and S8 shows the results separately for the discovery and confirmation samples. Low CIT: -1.5, Mean CIT: 0, and High CIT: +1.5.


Biased threat memory
After the behavioural tasks, participants estimated the probability of getting caught by each predator. As expected, the estimated catch rates depended on threat level (ANOVA: F(2, 1004) = 29.98, p<.0001) and true catch rates (LME: t(1, 2009) = 131.59, p<.0001) across all participants. However, the relation was far from perfect (regression coefficient β = .21), and there was a significant intercept (t(1, 2009) = 4417.79, p<.0001): participants estimated catch rate on average 36.6% higher than the true catch rate (see 
Figure 5
.B), which is in line with previous lab-based results 
(Bach et al., 2019)
.
CIT was linked to a biased threat memory: people with high CIT overestimated catch rates more, even while accounting for true catch rates (H16; p<.0001). Additionally, the estimated catch rates of people with high CIT depended less on actual catch rates (H17; p<.0001). Post-hoc exploratory analysis suggested that the effect of the CIT scores was driven both by a higher memory bias (β = .21, t(997) = 6.70, p<.0001) and lower memory precision (β = -.08, t(997) = -2.54, p<.01) as indexed by the intercept and the slope relative to variations between estimated and actual catch rates. This indicates that high CIT scorers were significantly impaired in their ability to differentiate between threat levels. To illustrate this, the top 25% of CIT scorers demonstrated an inability to accurately gauge threat levels(see 
Figure    5
.C; see SI). 


Discussion
Cautiousness in AAC tests is a stable behavioural trait 
(Bach et al., 2020)
 and is sensitive to anxiolytic drugs 
(Bach, 2021;
Cryan & Sweeney, 2011)
 across species including humans 
(Bach et al., 2018;
Korn et al., 2017)
 but with no strong evidence of a relation to self-reported anxiety 
(Bach, 2021;
Bach et al., 2020;
Fricke & Vogel, 2020)
.
Here, we establish a broad transdiagnostic psychopathology factor (i.e. CIT) as the main predictor of all behavioural readouts. High CIT was related to decreased passive avoidance (i.e. lower avoidance rate), heightened behavioural inhibition (i.e. later approach), and decreased sensitivity to trial-by-trial threat characteristics such as probability and potential loss. Furthermore, we found that CIT was linked to a diminished belief that the presence of tokens alerts the predator, and a less precise representation of threat features, including overestimation of overall catch rates and less sensitivity to the catch rates of different threats.
Taken together, these results confirm previous findings that self-reported anxiety is not the main driver of behavioural cautiousness in AAC tests, and instead highlight the crucial impact of broad psychopathology, including daringness and compulsivity. Interestingly, this impact plays out on different levels and into different directions. First, despite overestimating threat probability, people with high CIT tend to approach more often. This is not adaptive, and indeed they get caught more often.
Secondly, they tend to approach later. Such increased behavioural inhibition is traditionally thought to be an index of cautiousness in the same way as passive avoidance is 
(McNaughton et al., 2016)
, and as such increased approach and increased approach delay might appear to be in contradiction. However, there are alternative reasons for delayed approach. One is a subjective belief in reward-threat correlations 
(Bach 2015)
, which was however reduced rather than increased in people with high CIT. Another potential reason are longer decision times, due to less efficient decision strategies. This resonates with our third finding that people with high CIT are less sensitive to threat features, both in terms of their behaviour and in terms of explicit recollection of threat features, even though their higher approach rates meant they had more opportunity to learn the task statistics. Inefficient decision-making would be consistent with both findings and links with previous studies suggesting that individuals with compulsive disorders 
(Gillan et al., 2011;
Morris et al., 2015;
Voon et al., 2015)
, and healthy people with high CIT  show reduced goal-directed control, and that compulsive behaviour relates to difficulty in building an accurate explicit model of the world .
Furthermore, some studies hint towards the idea that model-based learning deficits in compulsive individuals predict the presence of habits 
(Gillan et al., 2014)
. In the context of behavioural inhibition, a similar mechanism might be at play at least to the extent that it seems to rely on a basic association between cues (i.e. rewards) and response (i.e. avoidance) that does not adapt to environmental characteristics (i.e. threat probability and magnitude). Furthermore, our findings revealed that higher IQ, generally associated with enhanced goal-directed control 
(Schad et al., 2014)
, was linked to higher integration of threat features into behaviour, and an increased belief in threat-reward correlations (see SI). These results, concordant with previous findings 
(Bach et al., 2020)
, suggest a form of attenuated behavioural inhibition, further endorsing the premise that variations in this behaviour could stem from differences in goal-directed control abilities. Furthermore, overestimation of threat has been implicated in the pathogenesis of OCD due to biased processing of threat-related information 
(Moritz & Jelinek, 2009;
Moritz & Pohl, 2009;
Sookman & Pinard, 2002;
Tolin et al., 2003)
.
In sum, we add to a large body of literature suggesting that cautiousness in AAC tests, although these are often referred to as "anxiety tests", does not specifically relate to self-reported anxiety 
(Bach, 2021;
Bach et al., 2020;
Fricke & Vogel, 2020)
. Our study found no connections with transdiagnostic anxiety (AD). However, it is worth noting that the AD factor might relate more closely to apathy and depression rather than anxiety, as general anxiety scores demonstrated closer ties with apathy and depression than with another trait anxiety questionnaire (see SI). Additionally, some connections between some (but not all) anxiety-related questionnaires and approach-avoidance biases were found.
However, these links were not unique and exhibited the same directional patterns as other psychiatric questionnaires, some of which consistently explained more variance than anxiety. These findings are unlikely to be due to the characteristics of the online sample, which was equally, if not more, anxious than in-person samples (see SI for details). In result, the validity of using AAC tests in healthy humans for aetiology research related to anxiety disorder may be questioned 
(Bach, 2021;
Bach et al., 2020)
.
Beyond the specific findings of our study concerning behavioural inhibition and avoidance, our data underscore the advantages of employing transdiagnostic dimensions in contrast to traditional methods of phenotyping. Similar to Seow & Gillan (2020), we identified nonspecific patterns of correlation with task-related variables when we scrutinized commonly used yet infrequently compared clinical questionnaires. For instance, all twelve questionnaires consistently associated with behavioural
inhibition, yet only the CIT factor distinctly aligned with this association and exhibited a larger effect than any individual questionnaire. Moreover, our findings affirm the generalisation of these symptom dimensions to another independent dataset, reinforcing their utility across various experimental designs 
Katyal et al., 2023;
Lee et al., 2023;
Rouault et al., 2018;
Seow et al., , 2021
).
An important consideration is whether CIT might in fact represent a general factor of psychopathology (i.e. p-factor; 
Caspi et al., 2014;
Watts et al., 2023)
, given the broad and relatively unspecific loadings onto this factor. However, the strong correlations between our loadings and those identified in prior studies which delineated distinct cognitive effects, make this interpretation of CIT as a p-factor unlikely. Additionally, a second-order principal component, which might represent a broadspectrum p-factor 
(Caspi et al., 2014;
, did not explain behaviour better than CIT, and several individual questionnaires (see SI). Yet, it is likely that CIT is more general than the initially chosen name suggests.
While web-based data collection offers many benefits in psychiatry research 
(Crump et al., 2013;
W. Mason & Suri, 2012)
, concerns regarding data quality-particularly on mTurk-have been on the rise 
Burnette, Luzier, Bennett, Weisenmuller, Kerr, Martin, et al., 2022;
Chandler et al., 2014;
Zorowitz et al., 2023)
. Our exclusion rate, while somewhat higher than the typical range found in a meta-analysis, is not unusual for such studies . Interestingly, Zorowitz et al. 
(Zorowitz et al., 2023)
 demonstrated that inattentive responding can lead to spurious correlations. Our supporting analyses addressed potential sources of spurious correlations, making it unlikely that our results are due to inattentive responding (see SI for more details).
In conclusion, we find that a transdiagnostic symptom dimension is the main predictor of cautious behaviour in an AAC task. Even if AAC tests have been extensively used to characterise the effects of anxiolytic agents and probe neural circuitry related to anxiety

Supplemental Methods


Attention checks
In an attempt to identify inattentive participants, we included several attention checks within the questionnaires. Namely, we asked:

• "If you were focusing on the statements above, tick "A little"". in STICSA.
Each statement was formulated such that participants could not easily search for a recurrent keyword. Participants were told that if they missed the attention check questions, it would disqualify them from obtaining any potential bonuses that they may have won during the task.


Task details
For the AAC task, 144 trials were presented in randomised order, evenly distributed across 6 different levels of potential token loss, and 3 different threat probabilities. The token appeared on either side after an interval that was the sum of a fixed delay (500 ms) and a random sample from a truncated gamma distribution (k = 2, theta = 1, mean = 2 s, truncated at 6 s). The wake-up of the predator followed a Bernoulli process, independently determined in successive time bins of 20 ms. Using values established in previous work 
(Bach, 2015)
, the catch probabilities were p1 = .1, p2 = .2, or p3 = .3 if the player was outside of the safe place for 100 ms. The actual catch rates depend on the participants' individual return latencies. In all cases, the trial ended 1 s after the pre-determined token disappearance time.
The second block comprised 57 trials from a different task, the predator exposure task, randomly interspersed with 15 AAC task refresher trials. As the graphical set-up is similar, the type of task was signalled with either a grey token on AAC task trials or a grey circle for predator exposure task trials.


Pre-processing
Data were pre-processed according to a pre-defined pipeline. To avoid response latencies being biased by lapses or extreme values, they were only included if they fell into response windows of 150 ms < approach latency < 2,000 ms and 0 ms < return latency < 2,000 ms, as in previous work 
10,
23
 , and were then log-transformed.


Factor Analysis
To replicate a previously established latent transdiagnostic structure 25-27 , we applied a factor analysis with Maximum Likelihood Estimation using the fa() function from the Psych package in R with an oblique rotation (oblimin). We selected the number of factors based on Cattell's criterion 44 using the Cattell-Nelson-Gorsuch (CNG) test from the nFactors package. The participants' factor scores were estimated using the Thurstone method. The CNG test revealed a 3-factor latent structure which was concordant with previous studies 
[25]
[26]
[27]
 .
To ensure that our extracted latent structure replicated previous findings, we compared the item loadings and participants' z-scored scores using the item weights between our current study and that of 
Hopkins et al. 27
 who had access to a substantially higher subject-to-variable ratio (N = 4782).
A difference between our sample and previous ones is the higher loading of alcoholism on the CIT. As addiction is known to strongly relate to compulsive behaviour, this deviation is unlikely to skew the interpretation of our results.


Adding three additional questionnaires to the factor analysis
The three additional questionnaires -daringness 
(CADS, Lahey et al., 2010)
, sensation seeking 
(BSSS, Hoyle et al., 2002)
, and trait anxiety (STICSA,  -did not alter the 3-factor latent structure. In fact, we found close to perfect correlations between loadings and factor scores from the factor analysis including the same questionnaire set as in 
Rouault et al. (2018)
 and 
Gillian et al. (2016)
 and from the factor analysis including the additional questionnaires ( 
Figure S3 -S6
).
However, all three questionnaires loaded highly on the CIT factor and only marginally on AD and SW. While it was anticipated that sensation seeking and daringness would align closely with the CIT factor, we had predicted that trait anxiety would be more closely associated with the AD factor. Several factors might account for why trait anxiety showed greater relevance to CIT rather than AD. First, STICSA contains quite a few items that are linked to the intrusive nature of anxiety-related thoughts (e.g. item 10: "I can't get some thought out of my mind.", item 16: "I keep busy to avoid uncomfortable thoughts.", item 17: "I cannot concentrate without irrelevant thoughts intruding." and item 19: "I worry that I cannot control my thoughts as well as I would like to.". Second, the AD factor might relate more closely to apathy and depression rather than anxiety. Indeed, generalised anxiety as assessed by the STAI and which mapped more strongly onto AD than CIT, correlated more with apathy (discovery: r=.70, confirmation: r=.55) and depression (discovery: r=.79, confirmation: r=.72) than with STICSA scores (discovery: r=.62, confirmation: r=.68; see 
figure S3
).


Second-order Principal Component Analysis
To test whether the effect of the CIT symptom dimension could be explained by a general psychopathology factor broader than CIT we tested the effect of a second-order factor. Second-order factor analysis can highlight higher-order, broad-spectrum factors by analysing associations between the oblique first-order factors 
(Caspi et al., 2014;
 
(Caspi et al., 2014;
.
To this end, we conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the prcomp() function from the Stats package on the factor scores from the combined sample. We then tested the effect of the first component of the resulting PCA on behaviour.
While this second-order principal component significantly predicted behaviour, it did not explain behaviour better than the CIT symptom dimension. Indeed, behaviour only explained 13.49% variance in this second-order component, compared to 37.42% in CIT. In fact, it performed worse than 6 individual questionnaire scores, namely those assessing alcoholism, OCD, impulsivity, schizotypy, sensation seeking, and daringness (See table S3).


Supplemental Results


Higher anxiety levels in the online sample
The absence of anxiety's effect cannot be attributed to low anxiety levels within the online sample. Indeed, our current online participants exhibited higher anxiety scores compared to those in a previous in-lab study conducted by 
Sporrer et al. (2023)
. Specifically, the in-lab study reported mean trait anxiety scores  of 27.93 (SD = 5.57) for the discovery sample and 29.80 (8.89) for the exploratory sample. In comparison, the online sample presented considerably higher scores, with means of 39.38 (15.68) and 48.99 (14.66), respectively. However, it is worth noting that the STICSA has a cut off at 43 to identify probable cases of clinical anxiety 
(van Dam et al., 2013)
, which is above the mean of the second sample. While it is possible that the second is more pathological it may also showcase underlying issue with data quality (see section below for more details).


Inattentive Responding and Data Validity
It is worth noting that the distribution of clinical scores differs significantly across waves in our study. Specifically, the confirmation sample exhibits more unusual patterns compared to the discovery sample. For instance, scales assessing OCD and Generalized Anxiety lack the expected positive skew, and the Alcoholism scale displays bimodal distributions, both of which deviate from typical findings. Such atypical distributions have been linked to inattentive responding in questionnaires. 
Zorowitz et al. (2023)
 demonstrated that inattentive responding can produce spurious associations between task behaviour and symptom measures. At first glance, one might think this could explain the lack of specificity in the pattern of cognitive deficits associated with CIT and other psychiatric questionnaires in our study. However, we believe several factors indicate this is not the case here.
First, 
Zorowitz et al. (2023)
 reported that nearly no significant (spurious) correlations emerged among symptom measures with more symmetric distributions. In our study, the strongest effects were observed in the discovery sample, where clinical scores followed typical patterns and were more symmetric (see 
Table 1
, 
Figure S2
). Second, Zorowitz et al. noted a marked reduction in significant correlations after excluding inattentive responders, a result unlikely to be due to reduced statistical power. In our experiments, we employed conservative, pre-registered exclusion criteria, combining several task-behaviour and self-report measures (see Methods). This approach, as noted by the authors, is one of the best ways to prevent spurious correlations. Although we used instructed items (e.g., "Please select 'Strongly Agree'") rather than the recommended infrequency items (e.g., "I competed in the 1917 Summer Olympic Games"), we still believe our self-report screening was adequate. Additionally, rigorous participant screening does not appear to introduce overcontrol bias, as inattentive responding is independent of psychopathology(see 
Zorowitz et al., 2023)
.
Finally, 
Zorowitz et al. (2023)
 highlighted that false-positive rates for spurious behaviouralsymptom correlations actually increase with sample size (i.e. keeping the inattentive responders) due to an increase in measurement bias rather than measurement noise. In our study, when all participants were included in the analysis, the results of interest were smaller or insignificant compared to those excluding inattentive respondents. Based on these additional tests and the successful replication of results, we can conclude that our findings are unlikely to be driven by false-positive correlations.


Interindividual differences in subjective prior assumptions
To investigate the subjective prior assumption that the presence of tokens alerts the predator, participants completed a predator exposure task. Here, optimal behaviour according to the task statistics was to make an exposure attempt early in the trial, regardless of token appearance. Interestingly, post hoc analysis on the combined sample show that the opposite pattern is true for people with high IQ who tried to tried to expose the robber more frequently after the token appeared (β = -2.1, t(1, 961) = -2.06, p<.05). A one standard deviation increase in IQ score is linked to a 76.98 ms later approach. This suggests that people with high IQ might assume that the presence of tokens alerts the predator.


Interindividual differences in threat memory bias and precision
To further investigate which aspect of threat memory is influenced by factor scores, we extracted each participant's slope and intercept from a linear regression between the estimated catch rates and the threat levels, indicating threat memory precision and bias, respectively. We then used these regressors as dependent variables in another linear regression with the factor scores or demographics as predictors.
In this post-hoc exploratory analysis, CIT was associated with higher bias (β = .21, t(997) = 6.70, p<.0001) and lower precision (β = -.08, t(997) = -2.54, p<.01). The inverse was true with people with high IQ who had a lower bias (β = -.12, t(1002) = -4.08, p<.001) but a higher precision (β = .09, t(1002) = 2.86, p<.005).
We then split the data into subsets comprising of either participant scoring in the 25% top or the 75% bottom of CIT scores. We then repeated our analyses in these sub-samples. The 25% highest CIT scorers were not able to dissociate between the threats and reported similar catch rates (F(2, 249) = 1.59, p>.05) in contrast to the 75% lowest CIT scores who could (F(2, 749) = 37.01, p<.0001).

CIT is linked to biased threat memory such that the top 25% CIT scorers (centre top) cannot distinguish between different threat levels and overestimate their probabilities. While the bottom 25% CIT scores (left top) and all participants (right top) distinguished the threats better, they still overestimated the threat probabilities. Actual threat rates for each level are denoted by red diamonds. Est.: estimated.
