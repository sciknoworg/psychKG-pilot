You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Research Highlights
• Little is known about how cognitive, behavioral, and psychophysiological processes interact in the development of learning across different contexts; this study addresses that gap.
• Youth exhibited enhanced learning performance, faster value-updating, and more exploitative decision-making (for older youth) when engaging with socioemotional stimuli, supporting theoretical models of affectively salient learning.
• Youth's psychophysiology remained flexibly organized across learning conditions but was uniquely linked to reward-based value updating, highlighting dynamic neuromodulatory engagement.
• Future work should explore how socioemotional learning processes develop over time and how they interact with children's lived experiences to shape adaptive outcomes.
Throughout development, we learn to navigate our environments by recognizing patterns in objects and events, understanding their relationships, and associating them with rewards or consequences. Beginning in infancy, these foundational forms of value-based reinforcement learning support evolutionarily conserved adaptive behaviors that help us avoid threats, seek safety, and optimize rewards and opportunities 
(Frankenhuis et al., 2019)
. These highly automatized learning processes guide attention and decision-making, serving as a key mechanism through which early experiences shape biological and behavioral development across the lifespan 
(Greenough et al., 1987;
Nelson et al., 2012;
. These learning-derived adaptations influence self-regulation 
(Keramati & Gutkin, 2014)
, social skills and relationships 
(Reeb-Sutherland et al., 2012)
, and goal-directed decision-making 
(Humphreys et al., 2016;
Oudeyer et al., 2007)
, with far-reaching implications for long-term health and well-being 
(Brown et al., 2021;
Vogel & Schwabe, 2016)
.
Early adolescence is a pivotal developmental stage marked by exposure to new challenges and opportunities amid increasingly complex socioemotional demands, alongside rapid neurocognitive and biological changes 
(Fuhrmann et al., 2015)
. Understanding how youth learn from and respond to diverse environmental cues is critical for both science and policy. However, individual differences in reinforcement learning across socioemotional contexts remain underexplored, as prior research has relied primarily on arbitrary, decontextualized stimuli and broad summary metrics of behavior (which we describe below). Grounded in a multilevel developmental approach, this study combines cross-disciplinary perspectives and recent methodological advances to investigate how cognitive and psychophysiological learning processes differ among adolescents (ages 12-15) in varying socioemotional contexts.


Neurocognitive computational modeling perspectives of learning
Developmental researchers have used a wide range of tasks and performance indices to examine how value-based, or reinforcement learning (RL), unfolds. Many paradigms involve choices among abstract or neutral stimuli (e.g., shapes, colors), where participants select between two to four options that yield positive (e.g., points gained) or negative (e.g., points lost) outcomes. Reinforcement contingencies can be deterministic or probabilistic, and some tasks introduce reversals, requiring participants to override previously learned associations to acquire new ones 
(Shiu & Chan, 2006;
. Research has shown that both accuracy (e.g., percentage of correct responses, omission errors) and the rate at which associations are learned improve with age 
(Bonawitz et al., 2014;
Izquierdo et al., 2017)
. While such summary behavioral metrics have provided insights into broad learning patterns, newer approaches use computational models to uncover the cognitive processes driving these behaviors.
In recent decades, mathematical RL models have given researchers a powerful framework for describing fundamental cognitive learning processes 
(Rescorla et al., 1972;
Sutton & Barto, 1998;
Palminteri et al., 2017)
. These models use fitted model parameters to estimate latent cognitive processes based on dense behavioral data from learning tasks 
(Ahn et al., 2017)
. For example, when tasked with learning which stimuli yield points, youth gradually assign higher value to rewarded stimuli, shaping future choices. Explicitly asking them to report these values would be disruptive and unreliable, as these processes operate largely outside conscious awareness. Instead, computational RL models infer individual-level parameters by linking trial-by-trial decisions (e.g., clicking or not clicking) to falsifiable models of learning 
(Niv, 2021)
. These models generate predicted behavior and refine their estimates based on observed responses 
(Ahn et al., 2017;
Zhang et al., 2020)
.
Unlike aggregate behavioral performance measures, computational RL models differentiate between processes involved in learning the value of different options and those that translate value estimates into choices 
(Ahn et al., 2017)
. The initial value-updating process is captured by the learning rate parameter, which reflects how much individuals adjust their value estimates based on prediction errors-the discrepancy between expected and actual outcomes 
(Bolenz et al., 2017)
. A higher learning rate means greater sensitivity to recent outcomes, leading to rapid behavioral adjustments, while a lower learning rate reflects slower updates, resulting in more stable behavior 
(Nussenbaum & Hartley, 2019)
. For example, in an unpredictable task, youth with a high learning rate will quickly adapt their choices, whereas those with a low learning rate in a predictable environment will show more consistent responses. Thus, learning rates indicate how past experiences shape future actions.
As value-based associations form, they guide the next step in learning: decision making. In RL models, this process is captured by the inverse temperature parameter 
(Cohen & Aston-Jones, 2005;
Weiss et al., 2021)
, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation. A low inverse temperature indicates greater exploration of lower-valued options. A high inverse temperature reflects a stronger tendency to choose higher-valued actions. Research suggests that inverse temperature increases with age 
(Decker et al., 2015;
Nussenbaum & Hartley, 2019;
Palminteri et al., 2016)
, aligning with an explore-then-exploit developmental pattern 
(Gopnik et al., 2017)
. Younger children, with fewer constraints from prior knowledge and greater neural plasticity, tend to favor exploration 
(Werchan & Amso, 2017)
. As youth develop, increased executive function and accumulated knowledge shift behavior toward exploitation, leading to more rigid value-updating and decision-making 
(Weiss et al., 2021;
Cohen et al., 2007)
. While individuals of all ages can use exploratory strategies, children and youth tend to explore more than adults, resulting in lower inverse temperatures in children across tasks 
(Eckstein et al., 2022;
Giron et al., 2022;
Nussenbaum & Hartley, 2019)
.


Learning in context: the role of socioemotional salience
While computational modeling provides valuable insight into latent cognitive mechanisms, inconsistencies in study findings have highlighted the need to examine additional contextual factors influencing within-and between-person differences in RL parameters 
(Wilbrecht & Davidow, 2024;
Nussenbaum & Hartley, 2019)
. A recent large-scale within-person study (N = 281; ages 8-30) found that the inverse temperature parameter followed similar developmental trajectories across RL tasks 
(Somerville et al., 2017)
, aligning with prior research 
(Gopnik, 2020)
. In contrast, learning rates varied by age and task context 
(Eckstein et al., 2022)
. The authors proposed several explanations for these discrepancies in learning rates, both in their study and the broader developmental RL literature. Here, we explore the possibility that RL parameters are shaped by modulatory processes. Such processes may be driven by top-down influences (e.g., environmental uncertainty triggering a stress response) or bottom-up factors (e.g., anxiety heightening threat detection), potentially enhancing, hindering, or shifting parameter values.
This study expands on the modulatory hypothesis by applying the priority state space (PSS) framework 
(Todd & Manaligod, 2018)
. The PSS provides a useful lens for understanding how modulatory processes shape learning parameters, proposing that developmentally and contextually prioritized sources of salience-both internal and external-guide attention and learning. In experimental tasks, learning occurs within a broader landscape of competing priorities, including the affective salience of stimuli, short-term task-related goals and motivations, and long-term semantic associations shaped by prior learning.
One way to examine how modulatory processes influence learning is by studying responses to social and emotional stimuli, which are key external salience cues that shape attention in early adolescence 
(Bolenz et al., 2017;
Rosenblum & Lewis, 2003;
Rosen et al., 2018)
. Socioemotional stimuli may either impair or enhance reinforcement learning by affecting behavioral performance, learning rates, or inverse temperature. Impairment may occur if these stimuli compete for limited cognitive resources, disrupting learning or leading to less optimal value-updating and decision-making. However, this idea is primarily supported by working memory research (e.g., 
Garrison & Schmeichel, 2018;
Mather et al., 2016)
, which may not fully apply to reinforcement learning. Since reinforcement learning tasks often involve more stimuli than working memory can hold, memory constraints are unlikely to hinder learning from socioemotionally engaging stimuli 
(Yoo & Collins, 2021)
.
Conversely, enhancement may occur if socioemotional stimuli mobilize cognitive and attentional resources, strengthening associations shaped by prior emotionally salient experiences. Research in adults shows that both positive and negative emotional information is prioritized, leading to faster detection 
(Pool et al., 2016;
Todd et al., 2012)
 and improved recall 
(Talmi, 2013;
Vuilleumier & Huang, 2009)
 compared to neutral information. While evidence in the learning domain is limited, recent studies suggest initial support for this enhancement hypothesis. In a statistical learning task, one study found higher recognition accuracy for emotionally valenced stimuli 
(Everaert et al., 2020)
, another demonstrated faster learning for emotional faces compared to neutral faces or shapes 
(Plate et al., 2022)
. Given the welldocumented sensitivity to emotional signals in early adolescence 
(Rosenblum & Lewis, 2003;
Towner et al., 2023)
, socioemotionally arousing cues may enhance reinforcement learning.


Psychophysiological processes of engagement to contextual learning demands
Just as socioemotional stimuli can externally modulate behavior and cognition during learning, biological processes are also influenced by these stimuli while exerting their own bottom-up effects. Studies in adults show distinct brain activation and physiological responses depending on whether learning stimuli are emotional 
(Nashiro et al., 2012)
 or whether a prelearning stressor occurred 
(Schwabe et al., 2008)
, both of which can enhance behavioral learning performance. While reinforcement learning research typically focuses on midbrain striatal dopaminergic circuitry 
(Wirz et al., 2018;
Lin et al., 2020)
, the PSS framework highlights the role of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system in establishing attentional biases through learning. The LC-NE system directs arousal and attention by integrating bottom-up sensory inputs from the brainstem and forebrain with top-down goal-directed regulation via the amygdala and prefrontal cortex 
(Breton-Provencher et al., 2021)
. In reinforcement learning, it helps reconcile competing or reinforcing sources of salience-such as rewards, punishments, and stimulus types-within the broader attentional landscape shaped by prior experience. Since youth are particularly attuned to socially and emotionally arousing cues, as well as rewards, LC-NE modulation likely drives greater psychophysiological engagement in these contexts compared to non-emotional or punishing ones.
Psychophysiological engagement during learning emerges from the interplay of LC-NEdriven neuromodulatory processes across space and time. Closely linked to the LC-NE system is the central autonomic nervous system (ANS), which the LC influences both directly, via spinal cord projections, and indirectly, through autonomic nuclei such as the amygdala and vagus nerve, which regulate sympathetic and parasympathetic activity 
(Thayer et al., 2009)
. Withinperson autonomic coordination varies by affective context, shaped by interactions between the LC-NE and autonomic systems 
(Gatzke-Kopp, Benson et al., 2020;
Ulrich & Herman, 2009)
. This dynamic coordination is often described as a hallmark of a complex system-one in which self-organized structures emerge from interactions among multiple interconnected components 
(Smith & Thelen, 2003;
Van Orden et al., 2003)
.
One approach to capturing real-time psychophysiological dynamics during learning is through cardiac time series, specifically heart rate variability (HRV). HRV reflects nonlinear organizational structures emerging from interactions between the LC-NE and autonomic systems. These structures can be mathematically characterized by fractal patterns-self-similar organizational structures repeating across nested time scales. This fractal complexity varies along a spectrum from randomness to rigidity, often indexed by the long-term interrelatedness or "color" of the time series 
(Ihlen, 2012)
. White noise reflects randomness, while brown noise indicates highly rigid temporal variability. Optimal variability, often represented as pink noise, reflects a flexible, self-organized system best suited to environmental adaptation. Fractal complexity is thought to capture the system's "long-term memory," where past events influence future functioning. Higher fractal complexity has been linked to better mental and physical health outcomes 
(Beckers et al., 2006;
de la Torre-Luque et al., 2016)
.
The relation between cardiac fractality and learning remains an open question, particularly in developmental samples. However, research suggests that cardiac fractality is a useful marker of cognitive processes more broadly 
(Favela, 2019;
Van Orden et al., 2011;
Wijnants, 2014)
. In children, moderate cardiac complexity (i.e., flexible pink noise) has been linked to better executive function performance when tasks are challenging 
(Berry & Stallworthy, 2018)
. Similarly, in preschoolers, loosely organized fractal patterns were associated with selfregulation but became more structured under challenge 
(Berry et al., 2019)
. Evidence also suggests that fractality may serve as a proxy for social engagement 
(Stallworthy et al., 2020
(Stallworthy et al., , 2024
 and attentional engagement when viewing complex images 
(Marlow et al., 2015)
. As this field evolves, cardiac fractality may offer novel insights into psychophysiological modulation in dynamic learning contexts.


The current study
The current study integrates RL and dynamic systems frameworks alongside recent methodological innovations to examine the behavioral, cognitive, and psychophysiological processes of learning in early adolescence (ages 12-15 years old). Our first aim examined whether youths' learning performance varies as a function of stimulus content (non-emotional versus socioemotionally-salient). Specifically, we tested whether these various stimuli elicit different levels of traditional aggregate scores of performance (i.e., points earned) and computationally-derived cognitive mechanisms (i.e., learning rates and inverse temperature). Given that salient socioemotional stimuli likely enhance learning for youth, we hypothesized that performance would be more optimal (i.e., higher overall points) when learning from socioemotional stimuli compared to non-emotional stimuli. With respect to the RL model-derived parameters, we hypothesized that learning rates would reflect greater sensitivity to and thus result in faster value-updating processes in the socioemotional context. For decision-making strategies via inverse temperature, we anticipated that there would be no substantive versionbased differences, given recent evidence for similar patterns across task demands 
(Eckstein et al., 2022)
.
Our second aim examined the main and interactive effects of stimulus content (nonemotional versus socioemotionally-salient) and RL parameters on psychophysiological engagement, indexed via HRV fractality. We hypothesized that youth would exhibit temporal organizations suggestive of organized, yet flexible autonomic dynamics-as indexed by pinknoise dynamics-in the socioemotional condition than the non-emotional condition. Such a pattern would be reflective of greater arousal and engagement to task demands including affective salience. We did not have specific a priori hypotheses regarding the link between RL computational parameters and HRV fractality and thus these analyses were exploratory.


Method


Participants
A sample of 56 typically developing 12-15-year-old adolescents (M age = 13.3 years; 51.8% female) and their primary caregivers were recruited through the University of Minnesota's Institute of Child Development Participant Pool. Exclusion criteria included (a) parent-reported developmental or learning disability and/or severe language, hearing, vision deficit; (b) diagnosed ASD, ADD/ADHD, ODD; (c) known deficits in fine motor and/or eye movement control; or (d) known cardio-respiratory abnormalities. Overall, participants were predominately White from middle to upper-middle class backgrounds. Sociodemographics are shown in 
Table  1
 (also see supplemental 
Figure S1
 for additional histograms).


Procedure
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of XXX (Study #8326). Data were collected during a one-and-a-half-hour laboratory visit. After consent and assent, primary caregivers filled out the questionnaires in a separate room while youth completed a computerized learning task on a laptop as continuous heart rate was recorded. After the task, youth completed additional questionnaires.

Measures


Learning task
Youth completed two versions of an adapted computerized learning paradigm ( 
Figure 1
) in counterbalanced order while recording continuous cardiac activity from a wireless electrocardiogram. The 'nonemotional' version included 24 stimuli of line drawings (e.g., key, chair, shoe) from the original version of the task 
(Finger et al., 2008)
. The adapted 'socioemotionally-salient' version included 24 IAPS 
(Lang et al., 2005)
 stimuli of emotionally negative (e.g., neighborhood violence, couple fighting) and positive (e.g., happy family, money) images rated high in arousal (Mean arousal = 10.4) and positively and negatively valenced (Mean negative = 14.8; Mean positive = 6.1). Stimuli were presented electronically using E-Prime 2.0 software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA).
Across both versions, the task started with an acquisition phase where youth learned stimulus-outcome associations via reward (where points are gained) or punishment (where points are lost). Subsequently, the outcome associated with half of the stimuli switched to the opposite reinforcement value, forming the reversal learning phase. Each acquisition and reversal phase consisted of 8 blocks (96 trials) and together constituted one run (192 trials total per run). Each version of the task contained two runs.
For each run in each version, six stimuli (3 negative and 3 positive for the socioemotional version) were initially associated with reward: if a button press was made while the stimulus was displayed, the participant received positive feedback ("you WIN 100 points" paired with a pleasant "ding" sound) and a running point total was displayed. Another six images were associated with punishment and negative feedback ("you LOSE 100 points" paired with an aversive alarm noise). Each version of the task contained two runs, each with a new set of 12 stimuli presented in random order. Youth completed a total of 768 trials (384 per version) to learn a total of 48 stimulus-outcome pairs (24 each version). Each trial lasted 2300 ms, beginning with an image for 1100 ms followed by the feedback screen for 1000 ms and finally a fixation cross for 200 ms.
Performance on this task relied on the formation of stimulus-outcome associations in the acquisition phase and then the subsequent replacement of the original stimulus-outcome association with an updated association in a reversal phase. Correct hits (i.e., press on a reward stimulus) resulted in 100 points added, false alarms (i.e., press on a punishment stimulus) resulted in 100 points taken away, and a correct avoidance (i.e., correct miss on punishment stimulus) or miss (i.e., incorrect/accidental miss of reward stimulus) resulted in no points gained or lost. A summation of points across the three response types (for descriptives, see supplemental 
Figure S2
) was used to index overall performance, where higher scores indicate more 'optimal' performance. In other words, higher scores reflected more correct hits on reward trials, fewer false alarms on punishment trials, and fewer incorrect misses.

Autonomic psychophysiology
Electrocardiography was sampled at 1000 Hz from youth during a five-minute resting baseline (watching a nature video) and throughout the learning task using a BIOPAC MP150 system and a PC running AcqKnowledge 5.0 software. Wireless electrocardiography transmitters were applied to pre-gelled spot electrodes located on the adolescents' torso ( 
Figure S3
), using lead II (electrocardiography) configurations. A USB-TTL was used to send event markers from E-prime to BIOPAC. These markers were used to index the start/stop times of the phases and runs of the learning task. Inter-beat interval (IBI) measures, or the milliseconds between each successive heartbeat, were derived from the raw data using AcqKnowledge software and further segmented according to the extracted start/stop times of the runs for each version of the learning task. Research assistants trained and achieved research reliability on gold-standard electrocardiography artifact removal procedures (CardioEdit; Brain-Body Center for Psychophysiology and Bioengineering at the University of North Carolina) before visually inspecting and removing all artifacts that were likely due to recording error.
Temporal HRV complexity, a measure thought to reflect the dynamic of real-time organization of the autonomic system, was calculated from the raw artifact-free IBI data and used as an index of psychophysiological engagement (for details, see below).


Analytic strategy
All analyses were conducted in R using RStudio version 2022.7.2.576. Reproducible code can be found in the OSF link provided above (see Open Science Statement).
Substantive models for both aims were fit using a fully Bayesian approach (see Supplement for conceptual description comparing Bayesian with frequentist approaches). Specifically, multilevel Bayesian analysis was used as it is particularly amenable to the small sample size of the current study (see 
Lee & Song 2004;
Hox et al., 2012
 for simulation studies) and overcomes common limitations with maximum likelihood approaches by estimating the distribution of each free parameter over the group of participants and for each participant individually (van de Schoot et al., 2014). All models were fit using the brms package in R (Burkner, 2017). The syntax and steps to conduct Bayesian models using brms was based on the tutorials and resources by 
Fusaroli and Cox (2022)
, McElreath (2020), 
Kurz ( , 2023
, and 
Veenman et al. (2022)
. Priors in all models outlined in the sections below were defined via a principled approach that applies accessible knowledge about the realistic parameter space as a reasonable starting point. The implications of those choices were subsequently examined using prior sensitivity checks, making adjustments as needed to improve model convergence 
(Fusaroli & Cox 2022)
. 1 Additional specifics on priors can be found in the supplementary material.
Two methods common in Bayesian modeling were used to assess the level of support, uncertainty, and magnitude of effects of interest. First, formal hypothesis testing was conducted on the final best fitting model for each parameter of interest. "Statistically meaningful" associations between predictors and dependent variables in a Bayesian framework are defined as a 95% posterior credible interval (CrI) of the regression coefficient excluding 0, analogous to a frequentist alpha of .05. Evidence ratios (i.e., Bayes factors) and credible intervals were used to determine the support and levels of uncertainty for each hypothesis within a Bayesian framework. Given that evidence ratios can take on a wide range of numeric values and depend upon model constraints, ratios were twice log transformed as recommended by 
Kass and Raftery (1995)
 to draw more interpretable conclusions. On this scale, evidence for any hypothesis ranges from weak (0-2), modest (2-6), strong (6-10), and very strong (>10) and is used solely as a descriptive index. Second, reported standardized effect sizes were calculated and scaled on the square root of the unconditional variance, based on the most relevant level of analysis (i.e. between-person versus within-person). Cohen's d for task version were calculated as the difference in means between the two task conditions divided by the pooled standard deviation of the differences. Using this method, the effect size estimate reflects the magnitude of the difference between the two conditions relative to the variability within the subjects, which is appropriate for the within-person design of the current study.
All models including continuous variables were grand mean-centered. Additional specifics for the models used for each aim are described below.


Aim 1: Learning and cognitive processes across task versions


Aim 1a: Behavioral learning performance as a function of task context
To examine relations between learning context and performance, overall learning performance (total points sum score; see Measures above) was regressed on version (nonemotional vs. socioemotionally-salient) as fixed-effects, and a random intercept and slope for each participant. A second model was fit to total points with age as a fixed effect to examine how much variance in the outcome was explained by age. Model comparisons (described above) determined the final model.


Aim 1b: Cognitive learning processes as a function of task context
Reinforcement computational learning models were also fitted to Bayesian multilevel models using the hBayesDM R package 
(Ahn et al., 2017)
 to examine latent cognitive learning processes that are posited to underlie performance on each version of the task. Specifically, we applied the Reward-Punishment Model for Multiple-Block Probabilistic Reversal Learning (prl_rp_multipleB function using default parameters) where block = stimulus image, choice = press (1), no press (2), outcome = reward (1), neutral (0), punishment (-1). This model estimates three parameters: (1) punishment learning rate, (2) reward learning rate, and (3) inverse temperature. For details on how each parameter is estimated, see supplementary material.
Learning rates and inverse temperature parameters were fit separately for the nonemotional and socioemotionally-salient versions of the task. Individual-level estimates of each range of values and thus any effect becomes unlikely 
(Gelman, 2006;
Veenman et al., 2022)
. In turn, this negatively influences model comparisons such that the support for the null hypothesis becomes increasingly large 
(Veenman et al., 2022)
.
parameter were extracted, resulting in two sets of parameters for each person. Punishment learning rate, reward learning rate, and inverse temperature were then regressed separately on task version using the same model fitting procedures as Aim 1a.


Aim 2: Psychophysiological engagement as a function of cognitive strategy and task context
Psychophysiological engagement in response to contextual learning demands was quantified within individuals using techniques from complexity science. Specifically, an index of cardiac complexity was estimated using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA; 
Peng et al., 1995)
 fit to each subject's extracted IBI time-series measured during each version of the task. Broadly, DFA is a method used to analyze long-term correlations and scaling properties in time-series data. DFA is posited to capture the extent to which a system (e.g., physiology) exhibits temporal noise consistent with different levels of system organization.
Autonomic fractal organization was assessed using the RHRV package in R (Martinez et al., 2017). An alpha (α) score for each participant was generated for each version of the task, providing a summary index of levels of psychophysiological engagement via how organized or presumably 'fractal' their system was. To compute this score, the cleaned IBI time-series (see Measures) was converted to a random walk by subtracting the mean value and integrating a cumulative sum. Then, the time-series was divided into segments of different sizes, and each segment was detrended using a linear function. The root-mean-square fluctuation was calculated for each segment, and the log-log relation between the segment size and root-meansquare was used to estimate the scaling exponent (i.e., Hurst exponent). The alpha score was then calculated as the average of the scaling exponents across all segment sizes.
Continuous values of α fall between 0 to 2, which are purported to align with specific patterns of fluctuations described as colored noise 
(Coey et al., 2012)
. White noise values tend to fall near an α of 0.5 and are posited to reflect more random fluctuations. Pink noise values fall near an α of .7 to 1 and are posited to reflect greater self-similarity and flexible organization. Brown noise values fall near an α of 1.5 to 2 and are posited to reflect a more tightly organized or rigid structure.
In the context of the current study, alpha was calculated for each phase (i.e. acquisition and reversal phases) of the learning task separately, with a mean IBI length of 347 and standard deviation of 67. Based on recommendations 
(Ihlen, 2012;
Berry et al., 2019)
 and constraints of the current data, the following DFA parameters were defined: linear detrending, minimum segment size = 10, maximum segment size = 50, and total segment sizes = 10. The regression range (i.e. slope estimation indexing how fast the overall root-mean-square of local fluctuations grows with increasing segment sample size) was set to capture both short and long range fluctuations in the time series. The mean and standard deviations of the DFA-derived alpha scores for each phase of the task were used to descriptively examine the extent of stability and change across the task and inform subsequent modeling decisions.
Applying the same Bayesian multilevel modeling steps used in Aim 1, participants' alpha scores were regressed on task version and each computational-model parameter (reward and punishment learning rates, inverse temperature) as main effects. Interactions between computational parameters and version were examined in subsequent models and model comparisons determined the final model.


Deviations from pre-registration
We deviated from the analytic plan proposed in the pre-registration in two notable ways due to unanticipated constraints in the data as well as finding improved Bayesian modeling strategies. First, for Aim 1a, we originally proposed analyzing the percentage of correct hits in the task, separated by acquisition and reversal phases, to index task performance. Upon further reflection, this index arguably did not seem to capture "optimal" performance, and thus a more holistic scoring approach that leveraged all types of responses throughout the task was used. Second, the pre-registration described using uninformative priors for the Bayesian multilevel models. We later learned that a principled approach to establishing informative priors that account for uncertainty was more appropriate. We implemented these deviations before analyzing the data.


Results
The final sample for Aim 1 included behavioral data from 56 youth. Due to a BIOPAC device malfunction in data collection, all but one youth provided psychophysiological data for Aim 2. A correlation matrix containing variables used in analysis can be found in supplemental 
Figure S4
. Additional descriptives (Figures S2) and figures and tables referenced below can be found in supplementary material.
Bayesian prior and posterior sensitivity checks (Figures S5 -S7 for behavioral outcomes; Figures S8 -S16 for computational outcomes; Figures S17-S19 for psychophysiological outcomes) can also be found in supplementary material.


Aim 1: Learning behavior and underlying cognitive processes across task versions


Behavioral learning performance as a function of task context
Bayesian multilevel regression analyses showed that on average, youth performed (via summation of correct hits minus false alarms) slightly more optimally in the socioemotionallysalient version compared to the non-emotional version of the learning task (B = 6.42, 95% CrI = [-1.42, 14.22], d = 0.22) ( 
Figure 5
). Random effects of intercept and slope demonstrated individual heterogeneity around this average effect (sd intercept = 20.24, 95% CrI = 
[13.11, 27
.67]; sd slope = 13.47, 95% CrI = [6.72, 23.29]). In other words, on average, learning from socioemotional stimuli is likely to have an overall small positive effect on task performance for youth, with a mean increase of 6.42 points and a range of possible values from -1.42 to 14.22 reflective of substantial uncertainty. Hypothesis testing demonstrated moderately strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that the population average effect of task version is greater than 0, with a posterior probability of 95% (i.e., percentage of posterior distribution that crosses 0). Log-transformed evidence ratios (see Analytic Plan above) indicated that there was approximately four times more evidence (i.e., falling within the "modest" range of support) that the socioemotionally-salient version results in higher performance than the null hypothesis (i.e., no difference between task versions). The best fitting model included an interaction between version and age (B = 5.57, 95% CrI = [-2.93, 14.01]) ( 
Figure 5
), indicating that youth tended to perform slightly more optimally in the socioemotionally-salient condition than the non-emotional condition with increasing age. Examination of simple slopes via Bayesian hypothesis tests demonstrated greater certainty for the positive relation in the socioemotional condition (posterior slope = 9.38, [0.69, 17.93], 57% two-sided posterior probability) compared to the non-emotional condition (posterior slope = 3.81, 
[-3.89, 11.75
], 90% one-sided posterior probability). See 
Table 2
 for final model results.

Cognitive learning processes as a function of task context


Computational model results
The results of the reward-punishment reinforcement learning model are presented in 
Table 3
 (see 
Figure S20
 for convergence checks and S21 for descriptive histograms). Descriptively, average punishment and reward learning rates for this age group were in the moderate range 
(Eckstein et al., 2022)
, with slightly elevated rates in the socioemotional version indicating potential task-specific modulation. Within task version (non-emotional versus socioemotional), learning rates were slightly higher for reward than punishment learning rates, reflective of greater sensitivity and thus faster value-updating to learning from rewards. Inverse temperature was on the lower end and nearly identical across versions, indicating the difference in the value of the options (press versus not press) for a given stimulus was minimal. Thus, this resulted in values reflective of greater choice stochasticity irrespective of task version, on average. Models demonstrated good mixing and convergence, as indicated by trace plots ( 
Figure S20
) and Rhat values at or close to 1.

Bayesian multilevel models predicting computational parameters from task version
Models predicting punishment and reward learning rates showed similar patterns supporting initial hypotheses. On average, youth exhibited moderately higher punishment (B = 0.11, 95% CI = [0.04, 0.18], d = 0.46) and reward (B = 0.10, 95% CI = [0.03, 0.16], d = 0.52) learning rates in the socioemotionally-salient version compared to the non-emotional version of the learning task ( 
Figures 6 and 7)
. Random effects of intercept and slope showed individual heterogeneity around this average effect 
(Table 4)
. Hypothesis testing with each learning rate outcome demonstrated strong evidence (100% posterior probability) in support of the hypothesis that youth's value-updating tends to be more rapid in the context of learning from socioemotionally-salient stimuli. Specifically, log-transformed evidence ratios indicated about 14 times more evidence and 12 times more evidence (i.e., falling within the "very strong" range of support) than the null hypothesis that the socioemotionally-salient version resulted in higher punishment and reward learning rates, respectively.
In addition to main effects of task version, the best fitting model for punishment learning rate included an interaction between version and age (B = -0.07, 95% CrI = [-0.15, 0.01]) 
(Figure 7)
, indicating that younger youth tended to show higher punishment learning rates in the socioemotional condition than the non-emotional condition. Examination of simple slopes via Bayesian hypothesis tests showed a positive relation between age and punishment learning rates in the nonemotional condition (posterior slope = 0.03, 
[-0.04, 0.10]
, 95% one-sided posterior probability) whereas a negative relation was shown in the socioemotional condition (posterior slope = -0.04, 
[-0.11, 0
.04], 95% two-sided posterior probability). For reward learning rate, none of the models including age improved model fit.

. Main effect of learning task version from Bayesian multilevel models on punishment learning rate (left) and reward learning rate (right). Black line indicates the predicted average fixed effects of task version with 95% credible intervals, superimposed on the raw participant-level data for each outcome.
Contrary to hypotheses, models predicting inverse temperature did not show a statistically meaningful main effect of task version (B = 0.01, 95% CI = 
[-0.16, 0.18]
, d = 0.02). However, the best fitting model included an interaction between version and age (B = 0.25, 95% CI = [0.07, 0.43]) ( 
Figure 7)
, indicating that, with increasing age, youth tended toward relatively higher inverse temperatures, or more exploitative decision-making strategies, in the socioemotionally-salient condition. In contrast, youth showed lower inverse temperatures, or more exploratory strategies, in the non-emotional condition with increasing age. Examination of simple slopes via Bayesian hypothesis tests showed greater certainty for the negative relation in the non-emotional condition (posterior slope = -0.16, 
[-0.31, 0
.01], 61% two-sided posterior probability) compared to the socioemotionally-salient condition (posterior slope = 0.09, 
[-0.08, 0.26]
, 90% one-sided posterior probability).  


Aim 2: Psychophysiological engagement as a function of cognitive process and task context
Example IBI and DFA plots for randomly selected youth can be found in Supplement 
Figure S23
. While there were individual differences in the scores 
(Figure S24 and S25)
, average scores for each task phase were relatively stable and thus supported the pre-registered plan of modeling scores collapsed across time. Average scores were in the 'pink noise' range, indicating moderately flexible and organized physiology (mean range: .82 -.86; standard deviation range: .18 -.21). One participant showed very low alpha scores across the task (range .3 -.45) indicative of highly random, or 'white' noise; thus the multilevel model presented below was generated without this outlier as a sensitivity check. Sensitivity analyses indicated that estimates were nearly identical (i.e., within 0.01 or less difference) (see 
supplementary Table  S1
) and thus findings from models conducted on the full sample are presented.
The best fitting Bayesian multilevel model predicting average cardiac complexity (alpha) scores included main effects of version, computational parameters, and age 
(Table 6)
. However, only the main effect of reward learning rate showed a statistically meaningful effect with a high degree of certainty (B = 0.22, 95% CrI = [0.09, 0.35], β = .29). Specifically, increases in reward learning rate are associated with a 0.22 increase, on average, in cardiac complexity, with a range of possible values from 0.09 to 0.22. Hypothesis testing showed strong evidence in support of this moderately positive effect, with a posterior probability of 100% (i.e., percentage of posterior distribution that crosses 0). Log-transformed evidence ratios indicated that there was about 15 times more evidence (i.e., falling within the "very strong" range of support) in support of the hypothesis that higher reward learning rates resulted in greater cardiac complexity than for the null hypothesis (i.e., zero or negative association).
The degree of support for the average main effects of task version and the other computational model parameters were also examined. First, task version showed a small positive effect (B = 0.01, 95% CrI = [-0.03, 0.05]), with a 69% posterior probability of being above zero (compared to a 31% posterior probability of being below zero). In other words, cardiac complexity during learning was only somewhat likely to be higher in socioemotional condition compared to the non-emotional condition 
(Figure 9
). Scaling on their respective withinperson variances, cardiac complexity (as indexed by alpha) was about 0.07 standard deviations higher during the socioemotional condition than the non-emotional condition. This finding is minimal in absolute terms, but provides partial support for initial hypotheses; nonetheless, no strong conclusions can be drawn based on this level of uncertainty in the estimated effect.

. Main effect of learning task version from Bayesian multilevel models predicting psychophysiological (cardiac) complexity indexed via alpha (α). Black line indicates the predicted average fixed effects of task version with 95% credible intervals, superimposed on the raw participant-level data for each outcome. Note: this effect was not statistically meaningful but is presented for descriptive purposes (see text and 
Table 6
 for details on the level of support for this effect).
Second, with respect to the remaining computational parameters, a small negative effect was demonstrated for punishment learning rate (B = -0.02, 95% CrI = [-0.13, 0.10], β = -0.03), with a 63% posterior probability supporting this negative effect. In other words, contrary to reward learning rate, higher punishment learning rates (irrespective of socioemotional salience of the stimuli) were associated with small declines in cardiac complexity. Inverse temperature showed a small positive effect (77% posterior probability of being above zero) suggesting slight increases in cardiac complexity as decision-making becomes more exploitative (B = 0.02, 95% CrI = [-0.03, 0.07], β = 0.08). Of note, a model that included a quadratic effect of inverse temperature showed nearly identical model fit to the main effects model 
(Table 6)
, which provides preliminary support for the possibility of an inverted-U relation as initially hypothesized.
Lastly, age showed a small positive association with cardiac complexity (B = 0.04, 95% CrI = [-0.01, 0.08], β = 0.24) with a 96% posterior probability supporting this effect. In other words, increases in age may be matched with slight increases in cardiac complexity reflective of psychophysiological systems maturing over developmental time.

Discussion
Early adolescence is a formative developmental transition marked by increased engagement with novel socioemotional contexts that youth navigate using foundational valuebased reinforcement learning (RL) processes. A growing body of research has begun to clarify the neurocognitive and biological mechanisms that help explain how youth learn from environmental predictability and associated rewards and punishments to guide decision-making. While some studies have examined developmentally relevant modulatory processes in learning (e.g., volatility 
[Eckstein et al., 2022b]
), many remain untested. This pre-registered study aimed to advance understanding of these RL processes in youth aged 12-15. Grounded in a multilevel developmental framework, we examined how socioemotional salience influenced behavioral performance and the cognitive and psychophysiological mechanisms underlying learning. To do so, we used a within-person experimental design and leveraged recent methodological advances in neurocognitive and dynamic systems modeling to capture more theoretically informed RL processes.
Overall, results showed that learning from socioemotionally salient stimuli, compared to non-emotional stimuli, enhanced behavioral performance and increased sensitivity to rewards and punishments. Older youth also showed more exploitative decision-making strategies in the socioemotional learning context. Notably, youth psychophysiology was flexibly organized across task contexts and uniquely linked to enhanced value-updating in response to rewards. These findings build on existing research, offering new insights into the context-specific modulatory mechanisms shaping learning in early adolescence.


Socioemotional salience enhances youths' behavioral performance and underlying cognitive learning strategies (Aim 1)
Our first aim sought to determine whether stimulus content (non-emotional vs. socioemotionally salient) elicited differences in behavioral performance and computational model-derived learning processes. Consistent with hypotheses, youth performed slightly better-indexed by correct hits minus false alarms-in the socioemotional version of the learning task. Aligned with the priority state space framework (PSS; 
Todd & Manaligod, 2017)
, this finding suggests that youth attended to and learned more effectively from affectively salient stimulus-outcome associations. Prior within-person studies in adults have shown similar results, with greater accuracy for emotionally negative and positive stimuli compared to neutral stimuli 
(Everaert et al., 2020;
Plate et al., 2022)
. Together, this evidence suggests that, compared to benign or neutral information, socioemotionally salient stimuli may engage greater processing resources to facilitate learning 
(Todd et al., 2012;
Schwabe et al., 2008)
.
We also observed a small task version by age interaction, suggesting that enhanced learning from socioemotionally salient stimuli may increase in magnitude during later adolescence. Specifically, while total points increased with age across both task versions, the slope was steeper and showed a greater degree of certainty in the socioemotional version. Combined with adult findings 
(Everaert et al., 2020;
Plate et al., 2022)
, this suggests that context-specific performance enhancements emerge in mid-adolescence and may continue to increase or plateau into adulthood. Indeed, as adolescents become less reliant on caregiver scaffolding, they must increasingly navigate and make decisions across a wide range of novel social and emotional situations 
(Casey & Galvan, 2008)
.
Rapid neurodevelopmental changes in adolescence enable the recruitment of higherorder cognitive resources 
(Crone et al., 2007)
 and increasingly complex learning strategies 
(DePasque & Galvan, 2017)
, which may explain the behavioral performance advantage observed in the socioemotional task condition. To reveal these learning mechanisms thought to underlie behavior, we applied computational RL modeling that estimated parameters indexing value-updating and decision-making strategies 
(Ahn et al., 2017;
Nussenbaum & Hartley, 2019)
.
Youth showed moderately higher punishment and reward learning rates in the socioemotionally salient compared to the non-emotional task version. In other words, on average, they were more sensitive to-and exhibited faster value-based updates-when learning from socioemotional stimuli. Effects for punishment learning rate also varied with age, such that the difference across task versions decreased as age increased. These findings align with recent evidence showing that learning rates (both within and between individuals) tend to be task-specific 
(Eckstein et al., 2022)
. Moreover, tasks using emotional stimuli have been shown to elicit faster learning (i.e., more rapid asymptotic accuracy), likely due to emotional arousal aiding in resolving ambiguity or uncertainty in the learning environment 
(Wu et al., 2021;
Plate et al., 2022;
Walle et al., 2017)
. In our study, task demands (e.g., reward and reversal schedules) were identical across versions, with the primary difference being the affective and socioemotional salience of the stimuli. Since half of the reinforcement contingencies reversed every 96 trials, an optimal strategy required moderately fast learning from rewards, reflected in higher learning rates rather than lower ones 
(Zhang et al., 2020)
. This approach allows learners to reach asymptotic accuracy more quickly while maintaining flexibility in value updating when stimulus reward structures shift. Supporting our hypotheses, socioemotional cues in our study may have required greater attentional resources, leading to faster learning rates to achieve better performance 
(Todd & Manaligod, 2018)
.
Regarding how youth transform learned values into choices via the inverse temperature parameter, results showed increased exploitative (and decreased exploratory) decision-making in the socioemotional version with age, whereas the opposite pattern emerged in the nonemotional version. In other words, when stimuli were socioemotionally salient, youth's choices were more strongly guided by the potential for reward. When learning from neutral stimuli, they were less sensitive to value differences and adjusted their choices less. Notably, the slope for the non-emotional version was steeper and showed a greater degree of certainty than the socioemotional version. Surprisingly, the negative relation with age in the non-emotional version contrasts with prior work showing that inverse temperature generally increases with age 
(Eckstein et al., 2022;
Christakou et al., 2013;
Decker et al., 2015;
Giron et al., 2022;
Javadi et al., 2014;
Palminteri et al., 2016;
Rodriguez Buritica et al., 2019)
. Here, inverse temperature increased with age only in the socioemotional version. Given the uncertainty in these effects, future research is needed to replicate these findings. Nonetheless, this result challenges the assumption that inverse temperatures generalize across task demands 
(Eckstein et al., 2022;
Nussenbaum & Hartley, 2019)
, suggesting that socioemotional salience may elicit slightly more mature decision-making strategies. This could be driven by a greater attunement to maximizing rewards when decisions involve affective cues or prior experiential knowledge 
(Todd & Manaligod, 2018)
.
Descriptive analyses of the joint parameter space and behavioral performance provided further insights into the multilevel processes involved in learning across contexts. Specifically, optimal performance was associated with moderate punishment learning rates combined with high inverse temperature, regardless of task version. A slightly different pattern emerged for reward learning rate: higher reward learning rates combined with moderate inverse temperature aligned with more optimal performance. These distinct parameter combinations suggest that youth adjusted their cognitive strategies based on whether outcomes were negatively or positively reinforced. When faced with worse-than-expected outcomes, optimal performance was linked to slower value updating alongside more exploitative choices that avoided punishments. This suggests that youth may have exercised greater caution and relied more on past experience when evaluating negatively reinforced stimuli. In contrast, when outcomes were better than expected, optimal performance was associated with faster value updating and a more balanced explore-exploit strategy. Youth may have been more confident in their value estimates and relied more on recent experience when assessing positively reinforced stimuli. Notably, these descriptive patterns were observed across both task versions but showed greater variability in the socioemotional version-perhaps reflecting differences in prior lived experiences that shape how youth prioritize attention to real-world stimuli 
(Ciranka & van den Bos, 2019
, 2021
.


Youth psychophysiology is flexibly organized irrespective of task context and is linked with reward learning (Aim 2)
Notably, computational RL models effectively "carve cognition at its joints" to isolate specific components of cognitive processes underlying learning 
(Eckstein et al., 2022)
. Mapping the concurrent real-time dynamics of psychophysiological modulation onto value-based and decision-making RL parameters may reveal more nuanced multilevel processes supporting learning. Thus, our second aim examined whether psychophysiological engagement varied by task version and cognitive RL processes identified in Aim 1. This second aim was informed by emerging theory that the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system and interwoven autonomic neuromodulatory systems integrate and reconcile reinforcing sources of saliencesuch as rewards, punishments, and stimulus type-shaped by past experience 
(Todd & Manaligod, 2017;
Thayer et al., 2009)
. Given that early adolescence is marked by heightened sensitivity to socioemotionally salient situations 
(Fuhrmann et al., 2015)
, we speculated that LC-NE and autonomic system modulation would drive greater psychophysiological engagement in affective contexts compared to non-emotional or benign ones. To capture the complex and emergent psychophysiological dynamics across these neuromodulatory systems, we applied time-series modeling from the dynamic systems literature 
(Thelen, 2012)
. This allowed us to derive a person-specific summary index (alpha) of temporal cardiac organization and complexity across the learning task.
Contrary to our hypothesis that youth would show more moderate ranges of cardiac complexity in the socioemotional context-indicating greater arousal and engagement-cardiac complexity was only descriptively more temporally organized when learning from socioemotional compared to non-emotional stimuli. Instead, youth exhibited flexibly organized patterns of cardiac fractality regardless of stimulus content. Given prior research showing that psychophysiology in the fractal "pink" noise range reflects healthy system dynamics 
(Peng et al., 1995;
Wijnants, 2014)
 and greater behavioral self-regulation 
(Berry et al., 2019)
, we speculate that attentional arousal from socioemotional stimuli may not have been strong enough to significantly disrupt homeostatic levels of psychophysiological engagement. Alternatively, both stimulus types may have been equally arousing. Thus, psychophysiology likely did not meaningfully modulate behavior and cognition in our study. However, since most youth in our sample exhibited alpha scores in this "pink" noise range, the sociodemographic homogeneity of our convenience sample may limit the inferences we can draw. Another possibility is that learning in affective contexts relies on other neuromodulatory systems or processes not fully captured by our physiological index. For example, heart rate may have been too peripheral a measure, whereas brain imaging may have provided the necessary precision to detect meaningful differences across experimental contexts. Indeed, prior studies, primarily in adults, have shown distinct brain network activation patterns when learning stimuli are emotional 
(Nashiro et al., 2012)
 or when a pre-learning stressor precedes the task 
(Schwabe et al., 2008)
. More research is needed to better understand these neuromodulatory processes in youth and how they relate to learning across different contexts.
We further examined the relation between psychophysiological engagement and RL computational parameters from Aim 1 to assess whether cognitive processes, either broadly or in interaction with task stimulus content, were bi-directionally associated with neuromodulatory dynamics. Several exploratory hypotheses were proposed based on theory, but the only statistically meaningful effect (in Bayesian terms) showing a strong degree of certainty was the main effect of reward learning rate. Specifically, reward learning rate was associated with moderate increases in cardiac complexity, supporting the hypothesis that faster value-updating in the context of reward elicits greater attention and relies on higher psychophysiological engagement and coordination. This partially aligns with prior infant research showing greater attentional system complexity (i.e., alpha scores from eye-tracking data) in response to social stimuli relative to non-social stimuli 
(Stallworthy et al., 2020)
. Situating these findings developmentally, social interaction is highly rewarding in infancy, engaging physiological systems during experimental tasks. In adolescence, while social and emotional situations remain salient, youth's heightened sensitivity to rewards more broadly may be a stronger driver of the physiological engagement necessary for arousal and focused attention 
(Ciranka & van den Bos, 2019)
. Youth may also recruit greater psychophysiological resources when exerting cognitive effort to learn from rewards 
(Galvan, 2010;
. That is, updating and closely monitoring the value of reward-based associations may have been particularly challenging or motivating. This aligns with past work showing greater cardiac complexity when children are challenged by a cognitive task 
(Berry & Stallworthy, 2018)
 and with neurodevelopmental research highlighting the adaptive role of heightened striatal reactivity in reward learning 
(Cohen et al., 2010;
Telzer, 2016)
.


Limitations and future directions
Our study has several strengths, including its within-person design, the use of ecologically meaningful learning stimuli, and the adoption of novel computational and dynamic systems methods to better capture theoretically driven multilevel learning processes. Nonetheless, several limitations and potential directions for future research should be acknowledged. First, due to data collection occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study relied on a small convenience sample, limiting the types of models that could be used and the strength of between-person inferences. However, with over 700 observations per system (~768 task trials; ~800 cardiac observations) per individual and the use of Bayesian modelingpreviously shown to perform well in small samples 
(Hox et al., 2012;
van de Schoot et al., 2014
)-we were able to increase the robustness of our findings. Still, the characteristics of our sample limit generalizability as participants were predominantly White and upper middle class. Future studies with larger, more diverse samples are needed to replicate and expand upon these findings.
Our study also raises important questions about complex multilevel learning processes. Neurocognitive computational models are relatively new in developmental science, and it remains uncertain whether available model-derived parameters fully capture cognitive processes in youth 
(Nussenbaum & Hartley, 2019)
. In line with our pre-registration, we fitted a single, commonly used RL-based computational model, though other models with different parameter sets may better explain the observed behavior 
(Eckstein et al., 2022)
. Additionally, while age was included in all analytic models, our cross-sectional study design precluded examination of developmental changes in learning over time. To our knowledge, no empirical work has prospectively examined the stability and change in the cognitive and physiological learning processes assessed in our study, pointing to an important future direction. Existing cross-sectional studies with broader age ranges show mixed findings, though emerging evidence suggests that developmental effects on cognitive RL parameters may be nonlinear 
(Eckstein et al., 2022b;
Giron et al., 2022;
Master et al., 2020)
. More empirical research is needed to establish within-and between-person developmental patterns in the relationships observed here.
Finally, while the use of varied socioemotional stimuli in our study improved upon prior learning research, many experimental manipulations could further clarify key drivers of socioemotional salience in learning. Our reliance on static visual images, though normed for high arousal, may have limited the depth of attention and arousal elicited in the socioemotional task. Additionally, the images we used are subject to featural confounds that interact with prior life experience 
(Barrett et al., 2019;
Nussenbaum & Hartley, 2024)
. The socioemotional stimulus set included a broad range of positive and negative scenes and common objects, preventing examination of more fine-grained stimulus category effects (e.g., facial vs. non-facial scenes, positive vs. negative scenes). Given mixed prior findings on performance differences by stimulus category 
(Plate et al., 2022;
Pollak et al., 2009)
, an important future direction will be to further decompose the enhanced learning effects observed in this RL paradigm.
Beyond stimulus content, future research could manipulate the frequency of reinforcement contingency reversals 
(Weiss et al., 2021;
 to better understand how unpredictability affects learning in non-emotional versus socioemotional contexts. Another potential direction is the use of pre-task stress induction, as prior research suggests stress may enhance learning performance in emotional contexts, sometimes depending on the cognitive strategy employed 
(Schwabe et al., 2007;
.


Conclusions
Taken together, we demonstrated that youth exhibit enhanced performance when learning in a socioemotionally salient context, a key factor in the early adolescent transition to independence. This study leveraged recent advances in computational and dynamic systems methods to build on a rapidly growing area of inquiry, offering new multilevel insights into the complex processes that shape learning in early adolescence. Findings revealed that compared to traditionally used benign or non-emotional stimuli, socioemotionally arousing stimuli elicited a learning advantage. Computational modeling provided valuable insights into the differential cognitive processes and strategies youth recruited to achieve this advantage, showing that socioemotional salience may have prompted faster value-updating and shifts toward more exploitative decision-making. Underlying psychophysiological engagement appeared to be particularly modulated by heightened reward sensitivity, another key factor relevant to this developmental period. Despite noted limitations, our study takes an important step in clarifying the contexts and modulatory processes that enhance and support the unique ways youth learn and make decisions. Open questions remain about the adaptive utility of these behavioral, cognitive, and psychophysiological patterns across different learning contexts, how they are shaped by prior experiences, and how they predict later psychosocial adjustment. Addressing these questions will provide deeper insight into how youth learn from and adapt to changing contextual demands, with the potential to inform programs and policies that support their ability to navigate their dynamic social worlds.

This approach is preferred over the use of noninformative priors, which have been shown to lead to biased estimates, especially in small samples
(McNeish, 2016;
van de Schoot et al., 2014)
. This is because noninformative priors, such as a uniform distribution without bounds, assign equal probability density to a very large
