You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Do people offer fund managers a 'license' to invest unethically based on past ethical behavior? A growing literature suggests that the traits of fund managers influence perceptions of their investment behavior 
(Brown et al., 2018;
Furnham, 2020;
Hegde & Mishra, 2019;
ten Brinke et al., 2018)
. Past moral behavior signals that one holds moral values and goals and is willing to put in the effort to acting on these values, i.e., moral character, which people perceive as holistically reflective of an array of positive traits 
(Fleeson et al., 2014)
. People therefore infer others' traits from morally-relevant decisions (e.g., 
Rom & Conway, 2018)
, such that moral decisions imply moral character 
(Pizarro & Tannenbaum, 2012
). In the current work, we investigate how past manager moral behavior influences ethically questionable investment decisions, or sin stocks. Sin stocks are stocks issued by companies that engage in socially or morally objectionable activities, allowing investors to profit from problematic products, such as alcohol, tobacco, and gambling 
(Hong & Kacperczyk, 2009)
. There are theoretical reasons to expect that past manager moral behavior may increase either permission or condemnation of sin stock investments.
On the one hand, people may afford a license to managers who establish a past record of moral behavior to invest unethically. Past moral behavior can provide a moral license to engage in ethically questionable behavior, either via moral credits where people reduce condemnation of ethically questionable behavior balanced by past positive behavior, or by moral credentials, the assumption that morally questionable behavior likely reflects benign rather than malicious motives, reducing condemnation (e.g., 
Miller & Effron, 2010)
. In other words, the same questionable behavior may seem less immoral when performed by a saint because they presumably have noble motives or because their sins are washed away by past good deeds 
(Monin & Miller, 2001)
. Therefore, a manager who establishes a pattern of moral behavior before investing in sin stocks may plausibly have a good reason for doing so, or may be 'permitted' in light of their past ethicality. If people draw this inference they should afford greater license to ethical managers to invest in sin stocks. We call this the licensing hypothesis.
On the other hand, people may hold ethical managers to a higher moral standard than others. A key aspect to moral perceptions is honesty 
(Hofmann et al., 2014)
 and trustworthiness 
(Goodwin, 2015)
, as people infer they can rely on moral others to consistently make ethical decisions. Therefore, seemingly ethical managers who invest in sin stocks risk appearing to capitalize on both the benefits of a moral reputation (e.g., trust) and the benefits of violating such reputation (e.g., profit), implying that their apparent moral character was, in fact, a sham. The discrepancy between past ethical and current unethical behavior therefore risks perceptions of hypocrisy: pretends to be more ethical than they really are, which people strongly condemn 
Effron & Helgason, 2023;
Effron & Miller, 2015;
Huppert et al., 2023;
. Hence, perceivers might especially disapprove of fund managers who invest unethically after past ethical behavior. We call this the ethical commitment hypothesis.
We compared these predictions across four studies examining perceptions of investment in sin stocks by managers with or without evidence of past moral behavior in the same domain (Study 1) or a different domain 
(Study 2)
. We also examined whether people perceive ethical managers as licensed to bet against a sin stock (i.e., buying short-derivatives) rather than in favor of a stock (buying long-derivatives), as doing so would still make money on unethical companies, but in a way that rejects rather than endorses them 
(Studies 3 & 4)
. We summarize the key characteristics of each study in 
Table 1
.


Study 1
First, we tested whether a fund manager's past ethical investment provides license to invest in sin stocks. Consistent with the literature on moral licensing, we originally predicted that people would rate a fund manager known to invest in socially responsible companies ("saint stocks") as more permitted to invest in "sin stocks" that abandon social responsibility policies, but not control stocks that maintain such policies, compared to a neutral manager. We compared this to the ethical commitment hypothesis, positing that people would provide lower license for ethical managers to invest in sin stocks abandoning versus maintaining responsibility policies compared to a neutral manager.


Method
Participants. A power analysis suggested that we needed 690 participants to obtain ~95% power to detect an effect of f = .15 with α = .05 
(Faul et al., 2009)
. Anticipating excluding ~15%, we collected data from 812 participants (from Mechanical Turk), excluding 192 using the pre-registered criterion, leaving a final sample of 620 participants (Mage = 38.75, SD = 11.98; 43.6% female). We pre-registered the procedure at: https://aspredicted.org/AWS_LVJ; we report all manipulations, measures, and exclusions for this and all the other studies. In Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Materials, we present the number of participants in each cell, and the correlation between variables (for this and other studies).
Design. We employed a 2 (license: past socially responsible investment versus control) × 2 (decision: investment in sin stocks vs control stocks) between-subjects design. We focused on the main effect of license and the interaction between license and stock type to determine whether previously investing in saint stocks provides fund managers with more leeway to invest in sin stocks.
Procedure. We manipulated license by presenting participants with information that the fund manager previously invested in either companies that care about their employees (saint condition: "This fund manager is known to have invested heavily in the past in companies that care about their employees (e.g., by engaging in profit sharing, ensuring that employees have respectable retirement benefits)"; see Methodology file for more details), or a broad index (control condition). We manipulated the decision by presenting participants with information on either two companies that abandoned environmentally friendly or socially responsible policies (sin stocks condition: e.g., a company that will "lower levels of service quality, lower safety standards, and the use of potentially deceptive marketing practices"), or two companies that continued these policies (control stocks condition). Participants then rated the following items on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree):
1. I would be comfortable if this fund manager invested in these companies on my behalf. 2. It is appropriate for this fund manager to make such investments.
3. This fund manager should be forbidden from making these investments (reversed). We computed the mean (α = .83), which served as our dependent variable.


Results
Overall, participants rated investing in sin stocks less permissible than control stocks, Msin = 3.51, SD = 1.56 vs Mcontrol = 5.37, SD = 1.33; F(1, 616) = 254.53, p < .001, η 2 =.292, d = -1.28, 95% CI 
[-1.48, -1.11
].

 There was no main effect of the fund manager's past investment history, Msaint = 4.62, SD = 1.83 vs Mcontrol = 4.27, SD = 1.60; F(1, 616) = 3.04, p = .082, η 2 =.005, d = 0.202, 95% CI [0.04, 0.36]. However, there was a significant interaction, F(1, 616) = 14.29, p < .001, η 2 = .023. Participants rated it was similarly (im)permissible for the saintly and control fund manager to invest in sin stocks, Msaint = 3.38, SD = 1.70 vs Mcontrol = 3.62, SD = 1.43, t = -1.30, p = .193, d = -0.15, 95% CI 
[-0.39, 0
.07], but more permissible for the saintly than control fund manager to invest in control stocks, Msaint = 5.67, SD = 1.16 vs Mcontrol = 5.03, SD = 
1.44,
t = 4.26,
p < .001,
d = 0.49,
95% CI = [0.27,
0.71]
. Hence, 'saintly behavior' increased license to invest in companies that continued (but not abandoned) corporate social responsibility policies (see 
Figure 1
).


Discussion
These findings are inconsistent with our original hypothesis that investing in socially responsible stocks can license investing in sin stocks. However, these findings suggest that investing in socially responsible stocks can license investing in control companies that maintain socially responsible policies-i.e., continued ethical commitment.
Notably, the managers' past ethical behavior was in the same domain as the present investment decision. Some work suggests that people are more concerned about hypocrisy in the same domain than different domain 
(Effron & Miller, 2015)
. Hence, perhaps differentdomain ethical behavior may provide a license to invest in sin stocks, as some work suggests licensing can arise from prosocial activity in another domain 
(Miller & Effron, 2010)
. On the other hand, people tend to draw holistic inferences about moral character 
(Fleeson et al., 2014)
, suggesting that people would expect continued ethical action even when managers engage in different-domain ethical behavior. Therefore, in Study 2, we tested whether people license fund managers to invest in sin stocks based on ethical behavior in a different domain: military experience. Past investment in companies that care about their employees (e.g., by engaging in profit sharing, ensuring that employees have respectable retirement benefits)

Figure 1
. The moral permissibility of 'saint' and control fund managers to invest in stocks Study 2 Many people view military service as a sacrifice on behalf of a nation, and therefore laudatory (e.g., Jordan, 2012). 2 Accordingly, investors tend to trust and invest more in investment funds with managers with a military background 
(Cochardt et al., 2022)
. Indeed, research suggests that including military veterans on corporate boards increases ethical business decision-making 
(Simpson & Sariol, 2019)
, perhaps in part because veterans are less likely than other groups to engage in corporate fraud and tax evasion 
(Benmelech & Frydman, 2015;
Kim et al., 2017;
Koch-Bayram & Wernicke, 2018;
Law & Mills, 2017;
Shepherd et al., 2019)
. Therefore, we manipulated whether a fund manager had laudatory military experience or not as a proxy for different-domain moral licensing. We then tested perceived permission for this fund manager to engage in morally controversial behavior (e.g., invest in sin stocks), or whether people would hold the military manager to higher ethical standards than a control target, similar to Study 1. We pre-registered the procedure at: https://aspredicted.org/LTW_HGP.


Method
Participants. Similar to Study 1, we aimed for ~95% power to detect f = .15 with α = .05. Anticipating excluding ~25% (due to a higher-than-expected exclusion in Study 1), we collected data from 920 participants, excluding 183 using the pre-registered criterion, leaving a final sample of 737 (Mage = 39.7, SD = 11.9; 44.1% female). Participants' political orientation scores (M = 3.68, SD = 1.87) roughly corresponded to the midpoint of the scale (1 = liberal, 7 = conservative).
Design. We employed a 2 (license: military service versus control) × 2 (decision: investment in sin versus control stock) between-subjects design. We focused on the main effect of license and the interaction between license and stock type to determine whether laudatory military service provides fund managers with more leeway to invest in sin stocks.
Procedure. We manipulated license by presenting participants with information that the fund manager was either a distinguished veteran (saint condition: "Before his career in the financial sector, Major Coleman served with distinction as an officer in the United States Army. (…) During his military service, Major Coleman was awarded numerous honors, including the Bronze Star for valor (heroism) for rescuing some soldiers from a burning vehicle, and the Humanitarian Service Medal for evacuating refugees from conflict zones."; see Methodology file), or distinguished businessman (control: "Before his career in the financial sector, Mr. Coleman served as manager of a small chain of vacation resorts."). We manipulated decision type by presenting participants with either information on companies that abandoned environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) policies (sin stock condition; this was the same as one of the descriptions from Study 1), or continued these policies (control). Participants then rated the same three items as Study 1 (α = .86). We also measured political orientation from 1 (liberal) to 7 (conservative), and tested whether results held both for participants scoring below the midpoint (N = 404) and equal to or above the midpoint (N = 516).


Results
Results corroborated Study 1: overall, participants again rated investing in sin stocks less permissible than control stocks, Msin = 3.54, SD = 1.76 vs Mcontrol = 5.73, SD = 1.08, F(1, 733) = 416.55, p < .001, η 2 =.362, d = -0.15, 95% CI 
[-1.67, -1.34
]. There was again no main effect of fund manager's moral character, Msaint = 4.58, SD = 1.91 vs Mcontrol = 4.67, SD = 1.75, F(1, 733) = 1.22, p = .269, η 2 =.002, d = -0.05 
[-0.19, 0.08]
. However, there was again a significant interaction, F(1, 733) = 4.24, p = .040, η 2 = .006. Participants reported that it was less permissible for the veteran than control manager to invest in sin stocks, Msaint = 3.36, SD = 1.77 vs Mcontrol = 3.70, SD = 1.74, t = -1.87, p = .062, d = -0.20, 95% CI 
[-0.40, 0
.00], but not more permissible for the veteran fund manager than the control fund manager to invest in control stocks, Msaint = 5.78, SD = 1.11 vs Mcontrol = 5.68, SD = 1.05, t = 0.91, p = .365, d = 0.10, 95% CI 
[-0.10, 0.33]
.
Note that both studies point to a statistically significant interaction between saintliness and the type of stock, suggesting consistently that the effect of saintliness is different for sin and control stocks. However, some non-interactive effects (for sin stocks in Study 1 and control stocks in Study 2) were not statistically significant at conventional thresholds. To address the issue of an inability to detect some of the effects due to insufficient statistical power, we have pooled the data from Studies 1 and 2. This pooling has allowed us to answer two questions: 
(1)
 does our data overall support the finding that saintliness decreases permissibility to invest in sin stocks, and increases permissibility to invest in control stocks?; (2) is the effect of saintliness different for same-domain and cross-domain ethical behavior? Regression analyses in . 
Table 2
 use control stocks as the reference and thus the coefficient for Saint fund manager corresponds to the effect of saintliness in control stocks. Overall, results support the assertion that saintliness increases the permissibility to invest in control stocks while reducing the permissibility to invest in sin stocks (see Saint fund manager × Sin stock interaction). However, the lack of a Saint fund manager × Sin stock × Cross-domain interaction suggests that same-domain (i.e., investment-related) and cross-domain (i.e., ex-military-related) ethical behavior lead to similar outcomes. Thus, overall this supports the ethical commitment hypothesis in both domains of ethical behavior (see 
Figure 2A
 for an illustration of predictions from the regression model that pools same-domain and cross-domain behavior).  Together, the results of Study 2 disconfirmed the licensing hypothesis and supported the ethical commitment hypothesis: fund manager saintliness decreased the permissibility of investing in sin companies, and increased the permissibility to invest in control stocks, unlike Study 1 (see 
Figure 1
).
Furthermore, we tested whether this pattern would hold across the political spectrum, as conservatives may be more likely to view veterans as ethical than liberals (see 
Figure 3
). The interaction between fund manager type and political ideology was not significant, showing that people with a conservative versus liberal political ideology did not differ in the judgments of fund managers for either sin stocks (b = 0.29, SE = 0.36, t = 0.80, p = 0.427) or control stocks (b = -0.09, SE = 0.22, t = -0.39, p = 0.700). 


Discussion
Study 2 provided further evidence contrary to the licensing hypothesis: people rated it less permissible for the manager with distinguished military service than distinguished business career to invest in sin stocks. This finding suggests that people may hold ethical fund managers to higher moral standards than control managers, whether their implied moral character arises from the same domain (past ethical investment) or a different domain (distinguished military service). These results extend Study 1, but they also align with research by 
Cochardt and colleagues (2022)
 showing that people tend to view ex-military mutual fund managers as more ethical.
Yet, the question remains whether there may be ways for saintly fund managers to make money off sin stocks in a manner that appears acceptable. For example, by 'shorting' a sin stock, a manager essentially bets against a company and makes money off their downfall. Would people view it as permissible for saintly managers to make money by shorting sin stocks, implying disapproval of their sinful activities, or disapprove of saintly managers making money off sin stocks even through shorting? We examined this question in Study 3.


Study 3
Together, Studies 1 and 2 suggest that people provide ethical managers less license to invest in sin stocks, i.e., to benefit financially when unethical companies succeed. However, investors can also bet against companies, making money when they fail (short-selling or 'shorting' stocks). This raises the question of whether the perceived ethical problem of investing in sin stocks is that managers make money off unethical stocks, or whether the problem is betting in favor of sin stock success (implying motivation to want unethical companies to succeed, 
Pizarro & Tannenbaum, 2012)
. Is it acceptable for ethical managers to make money off the failure of sin stocks?
In Study 3, participants considered a manager who may invest in a sin stock via either a long-derivative (whose value increases if the stock price increases) or a short-derivative (whose value increases if the stock price decreases). Buying a short-derivative is essentially equivalent to short-selling ('shorting') a company, a practice made famous in the film The Big Short. Generally speaking, people consider shorting to be unethical , which -based on our earlier findings -would suggest that saint fund managers would not be more permitted to short such stocks. However, a counter-argument is that shorting a sin stock can be perceived as activist investment, where an investor bets against the company, with public justification for this decision 
(Paugam et al., 2021)
. For example, a fund manager may short stocks to inform the investment community that a company is likely engaging in fraud, leading to overvaluation. Similarly, a fund manager may believe that a company is overvalued because the stock price does not fully account for the social harm that the company causes, which should reduce the stock price in the future. Hence, shorting a stock may signal disapproval of a company.
Therefore, saintly fund managers may be more permitted to short sin stocks than regular fund managers if people perceive their short-selling as signaling moral disapproval. Consistent with this view, 
Pizarro and Tannenbaum (2012)
 found that people judged investors by the ethicality of what they appeared to hope would happen-for example, investors who made money when a disaster did not happen were viewed as more ethical than those who made money when a disaster did happen, because this implied they hoped the disaster would happen. Therefore, people may particularly license a saintly manager to short sin stocks because it implies an activist investor's desire to see sin stocks fail, consistent with their moral character. Alternatively, people may view any profit off sin stocks as unethical, even if obtained via shorting, and hence contrary to their moral character.
Furthermore, we measured perceived hypocrisy to test whether hypocrisy perceptions mediate the effect of saintliness on investing permissibility in short and long positions. Specifically, people may view the saintly manager as less permitted to invest long in sin stocks due in part to viewing this decision as hypocritical. Investing short in sin stocks, however, might be seen as hypocritical only if profiting off the misfortune of sin stocks is perceived as unethical.


Method
Participants. Once again, to obtain ~95% power to detect f = .15 with α = .05 which anticipating excluding ~25%, we recruited 920 MTurkers and excluded 177 using the preregistered criterion, leaving a final sample of 743 (Mage = 41.6, SD = 13.1; 41.7% female).
Design. We employed a 2 (license: past socially responsible investment versus control) × 2 (position: long versus short) between-subjects design. We focused on the main effect of license and the interaction between license and investment position to determine whether previously investing in saint stocks provides fund managers with more leeway to invest in favor or against sin stocks.
Procedure. Similar to Study 1, we manipulated the fund manager's license via past ethical investment behavior. We randomly assigned participants to read that the manager previously invested in either 'saintly' companies-here defined as industry leaders in topics rated in a pretest as ethically relevant, including product safety & quality, corporate behavior, and health & safety of its employees as rated by an independent agency (saint condition), or the manager previously invested in companies from a broad market index (control condition). 
3
 All participants considered a scenario where a company abandons its ESG policies (i.e., a sin stock by this definition). However, we manipulated which position the fund manager deliberated: either long, so they would profit if the company's stock increased, or short, so they would profit if the company's stock decreased. Participants then rated the same items as Study 1 (α = .84).
Participants also rated the moral hypocrisy of the fund manager using a five-item scale (e.g., "This fund manager is two-faced", α = .94; 
Effron & Miller, 2015;
. Finally, as manipulation checks, we checked whether people generally judge investing in short positions less favorably than long positions (3 items, e.g., "buying long/short derivatives is moral/immoral", αlong = .98, αshort = .98; , generally judge traders who make short (vs. long) investments less favorably (2 items, e.g., "people that buy long/short derivatives are good/bad people", αlong = .89, αshort = .83; , and are less willing to personally adopt a short than long position (2 items, "buying long/short derivatives is very attractive/very unattractive to you", αlong = .94, αshort = .94; . We conducted an analysis of variance and mediation analysis, as pre-registered at: https://aspredicted.org/RNE_RUW.


Results
ANOVA. We found no main effect of license on investment acceptability, Msaint = 3.85, SD = 1.69 vs Mcontrol = 3.64, SD = 1.73, F(1, 739) = 2.69, p = .102, η 2 =.004, d = 0.12, 95% CI 
[-0
.00, 0.27], nor a main effect of investment position: participants rated the permissibility of investing in a sin stock via long-derivatives and short-derivatives not significantly differently, Mlong = 3.70, SD = 1.63 vs Mshort = 3.79, SD = 1.79, F(1, 739) = 0.54, p = .461, η 2 < .001, d = -0.05, 95% CI 
[-0.19, 0.09]
. Moreover, there was no significant interaction, F(1, 739) = 0.06, p = .814, η 2 < .001. Results are illustrated in 
Figure 1
. The lack of a main effect of position was surprising, considering that people generally rated investing in short positions as less favorable than in long positions (Mlong-trade = 3.88, SD = 2.29 vs Mshort-trade = 5.46, SD = 2.37, t = 13.1, p < .001, d = 0.68, 95% CI 
[-0.80, -0
.57]), judged short-traders less favorably than long-traders Mlong-trader = 4.03, SD = 1.81 vs Mshort-trader = 5.76, SD = 1.87, t = 18.1, p < .001, d = 0.94, 95% CI = 
[-1.06, -0
.83]), and declared less interest in personally investing in short than long positions Mlong-interest = 3.96, SD = 2.32 vs Mshort-interest = 6.36, SD = 2.34, t = 19.8, p < .001, d = -1.03 
[-1.16, -0
.91]).
Mediation analysis. Despite a lack of main effects in the ANOVA, a mediation analysis 
(Hayes, 2017)
 supported the notion that judgments of fund managers' hypocrisy carried indirect variance from fund manager history to sin stock investment permissibility (see 
Figure 4A
). Specifically, people rated saintly managers higher in hypocrisy, Msaint = 4.10, SD = 1.70 vs Mcontrol = 3.79, SD = 1.67, t = 2.54, p = .011, d = 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.33], and hypocrisy furthermore predicted reduced investment acceptability ratings, as the indirect effect was outside the 95% CIs. Hence, there was a negative indirect effect of saintliness on investing in sin stocks overall via increased hypocrisy. Intriguingly, however, this analysis also revealed a positive direct effect, suggesting possible suppression (see below).
We next performed a moderated mediation analysis, with short versus long position entered as a moderator (of path a from manager character to hypocrisy, 
Hayes, 2017)
. This analysis suggested that hypocrisy mediated the effect of fund manager saintliness on reduced permissibility of long positions, blong = -0.37 
[-0.61, -0.15]
, as this effect fell outside the 95% CIs, but not short positions, bshort = -0.08 
[-0.34, 0.19]
, as this effect fell within the 95% CIs (see 
Figure 4B)
. That said, the interaction between fund manager type and position type on hypocrisy judgments was only trending towards statistical significance, failing below traditional thresholds, F(1, 739) = 2.73, p = .099). Hence, we interpret this pattern cautiously, but it suggests that people judge that saintly managers may not invest long in sin stocks due to hypocrisy, whereas saintly managers shorting sin stocks may not seem as hypocritical.
Together, these patterns suggest statistical suppression, a case where opposite effects statistically cancel out, resulting in a null total effect (e.g., 
Rucker et al., 2011)
. Hence, this pattern implies one or more unmeasured mediators carrying indirect variance from saintliness to increased sin stock investment acceptability (perhaps especially for long positions). For example, it could be that increased perceptions of moral credentials mediate increased investment acceptability for saintly managers simultaneously with hypocrisy perceptions reducing investment acceptability, simultaneously with hypocrisy reducing acceptability. Hence, the effect of saintliness on sin stock investment may be more complex than previously thought. Future work might profitably investigate this possibility. Notes: 95% bootstrapped CIs are reported in the square brackets. Panel A shows the main preregistered mediation analysis. Panel B shows moderated mediation analysis, with the position on the stock (short vs long) serving as the moderator. * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001


Discussion
In contrast to Studies 1 and 2, we did not replicate the effect that saintly fund managers were less permitted to invest in sin stocks; there was no significant effect of manager investment history or long versus short position on sin stock investment acceptability; nor did they interact. People rated saintly and control fund managers equally permitted to 'go long' and 'go short' on a sin stock. It is therefore possible that people view interacting with sin stocks in any professional capacity, whether using long or short positions, as morally questionable, regardless of one's 'saintly' investment history.
However, the null effect on the acceptability of investing in sin stocks is at odds with other findings: we replicated past work  showing that overall, people judged shorting less favorably than going long, rated short-sellers worse than people taking long positions, and were less interested in shorting than going long themselves. Hence, people may be sensitive to important differences between shorting and going long on a sin stock, yet not rate managers differently who do so (despite high statistical power). How can we resolve this apparent paradox? One possibility is that this case may tap a complex set of attributions that partially cancel out, i.e., statistical suppression.
The mediation and moderated mediation findings showed that perceptions of hypocrisy carried negative indirect variance from manager saintliness to investment acceptability (for long positions). In other words, a saintly manager hoping to profit off investments in unethical companies risks appearing more hypocritical than a control manager. The moderated mediation findings suggest that saintly fund managers who short sin stocks may not appear hypocritical, whereas saintly fund managers who go long may. Thus, it may be that people focus on the hypocrisy of saintly managers who want sin stock companies to succeed, suggesting unethical motivation inconsistent with supposed moral character (see 
Pizarro & Tannenbaum, 2012)
. Saintly managers who short sin stocks and therefore appear to want sin stock companies to fail appear less hypocritical, but no less permitted to invest. It may be that moral approbation for shorting sin stocks is offset by general negative attitudes towards short-sellers documented in the other measures and past work .
Moreover, the mediation analysis also revealed a positive direct effect of saintliness on investment permissibility once hypocrisy was included in the model, suggesting the presence of unmeasured mediators consistent with a moral credentials effect. In other words, people may view it as more acceptable for a saintly (than control) manager to invest (long) in a sin stock due to some mechanisms, while simultaneously viewing this as less acceptable due to other mechanisms (e.g., hypocrisy). The exact nature of these mechanisms remains unclear. Moral credential theory suggests that credentials reflect moral character perceptions, so measures of moral character may carry indirect variance. However, other potential mediators are also possible. Future work might profit from testing such mediators. Finally, it may be that the current sin stock manipulations were simply not clear enough for many participants to identify the stocks as unambiguously unethical. Therefore, we addressed this possibility in Study 4.


Study 4
In Study 4, we wanted to create the most favorable conditions for a possible licensing effect on shorting sin stocks to manifest. Therefore, we strengthened the sin stock manipulation by combining information that operates in a morally controversial industry (specifically tobacco; 
Hong & Kacperczyk, 2009)
, with information that was also assessed by a rating agency as using poor labor standards in its supply chain. This creates favorable conditions for possible construal effects, where people may infer that an ethical (versus control) fund manager who shorts such a sin stock is expressing moral disapproval of the company and is therefore permitted a license. Conversely, if people remain averse to ethical manager making any money off sin stocks, they should rate the ethical investor lower in permissibility to short the stock than a control manager.

Participants. We aimed for 250 participants per cell. Anticipating an exclusion rate of ~20%, we recruited 625 MTurk participants. Ultimately, we excluded 48 participants using the pre-registered criterion, leaving a final sample of 577 (Mage = 39.7, SD = 11.8; 47.5% female), providing 80% power to detect d = 0.23 (i.e., slightly larger than a small effect according to Cohen's (1988) guidelines.
Design. We employed a 2-cell between-subjects design to determine whether previously investing in saint stocks provides fund managers with more leeway to invest against (short) a 'super-sin' stock.
Procedure. We again manipulated license via past ethical investments: participants read that the fund manager previously invested in either 'saint' companies who cared about their employees from Study 1 (saint condition), or a broad market index (control condition). We also expanded the rating scale. Participants rated the following items on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree):
1. I would be comfortable if this fund manager made this investment on my behalf.
2. It is appropriate for this fund manager to make such an investment.
3. This fund manager should be forbidden from making such an investment (reversed). 4. It is perfectly fine for this fund manager to make this trade.
5. This fund manager should NOT make this trade (reversed). We computed the mean (α = .91). Participants also rated fund manager moral hypocrisy using the same five-item scale as Study 3 (α = .94), and judged the act of shorting a 'laggard' company (a tobacco manufacturer with lax corporate responsibility policies) using three items adapted from , such as "buying 'short' derivatives on a tobacco stock is moral/immoral" (α = .97).
We conducted t-tests to assess how fund manager saintliness impacted investment permissibility, hypocrisy, and shorting acceptability. We complemented this with a mediation analysis to examine whether fund manager hypocrisy might mediate the effect of saintliness on investment permissibility. We pre-registered the procedure at: https://aspredicted.org/W2Z_9HD.


Results
Main effect. Consistent with Study 3, participants rated the permissibility of saint and control fund managers shorting the super-sin stock as not significantly different (Msaint = 4.47, SD = 1.66 vs Mcontrol = 4.28, SD = 1.75, t = -1.32, p = .19, d = 0.11 
[-0.06, 0.27]
). Manager hypocrisy ratings were also similar across conditions (Msaint = 3.36, SD = 1.64 vs Mcontrol = 3.44, SD = 1.69, t = -0.51, p = .61, d = -0.04 
[-0.22, 0
.12]), as were judgments of shorting the tobacco super-sin stock (Msaint = 4.74, SD = 2.54 vs Mcontrol = 5.05, SD = 2.61, t = -1.46, p = .14, d = -0.12 
[-0.29, 0.04]
).
Mediation analysis. The mediation analysis corroborated the main analysis: there was no significant indirect effect via hypocrisy, b = 0.024, SE = 0.047, 95% CI 
[-0.068, 0.117]
, nor was there a significant direct effect, b = 0.052, SE = 0.085, 95% CI 
[-0.115, 0.218]
. Consistent with Study 3, participants did not rate shorting the sin stock more favorably in the saint fund manager condition due to reduced fund manager hypocrisy.


Discussion
These results do not clearly support either the licensing or ethical commitment hypothesis. The lack of effects is puzzling given the findings in Studies 1 and 2. That said, in this study we examined only perceptions of shorting a sin stock, which Study 3 suggested may reflect a complex set of competing perceptions that partially suppress one another: shorting a sin stock implies desiring it to fail, which may seem laudable, but participants reported that shorting in general is less ethical, and it may be these perceptions canceled out, resulting in a null effect. One interpretation might be that a licensing effect exists even for shorting sin stocks, but if so it is rather small (d = .11, based on our estimates), making it difficult to demonstrate as significant even with relatively large sample sizes. Therefore, we addressed this issue via a meta-regression analysis.


Meta-Regression
Our findings are largely inconsistent with the existence of a license to invest in morally controversial companies, following virtuous acts from the same domain (investment) or a different domain (distinguished military service). Instead, Studies 1 and 2 supported the ethical commitment hypothesis, where people expect ethical managers to continue their ethical commitment by rejecting sin stocks and embracing ethical stocks. Intriguingly, this ethical commitment implied a license to invest-but only in companies that continue corporate social responsibility policies.
However, effect sizes are mostly small and less clear in Studies 3 and 4 than in Studies 1 and 2, especially regarding the permissibility of shorting (betting against) sin stocks (see 
Figure 2B
).
It may be that a small net licensing effect emerges for shorting sin stocks, but this effect is challenging to cleanly detect without high power. Thus, to shed more light on this matter, we performed a meta-regression on the pooled dataset (N = 2,677), aimed at more precisely estimating the effect of saintliness and investing long vs short in sin stocks (see 
Table 3
). We illustrate predicted permissibility ratings from the meta-regression in 
Figure 2C
.
Findings demonstrated that, overall, people provided saintly managers with higher permissibility to invest long in control stocks than control managers. So people appear to trust saintly fund managers more to make investments in non-sin stocks-possibly because they infer that saintly managers select moral ethical stocks than control investors. In addition, conventional (control) fund managers investing in favor of or against sin stocks were rated less favorably than managers investing in favor of conventional (control) stocks, similar to past work.
However, these effects were moderated by interactions. Consistent with the ethical commitment but not licensing hypothesis, saintliness reduced permissibility ratings for investing in sin stocks, as evidenced by the Saint × Sin Stocks interaction. However, an analysis of conditions, in which participants judged the sin stocks (and not the control stocks) provides some evidence that saintly managers have a higher permissibility from conventional fund managers to short sin stocks (i.e., invest against them), as the Saint fund manager × Short position interaction is positive and (marginally) statistically significant.
See 
Table S3
 for a comparison of the effect of fund manager saintliness across the four studies, both excluding and including the effect of control variables. These suggest that our findings are robust to the inclusion of the control variables that we measured (subjective investment knowledge, objective investment knowledge, gender, and age). 


General Discussion
Information on fund managers (or corporate directors; 
Gow et al., 2018)
 is often publicly available and may guide investors' perceptions and decisions. People may infer fund manager moral character from past ethical behavior (e.g., ethical investment, distinguished military service), which then shapes expectations and reactions to current investment choices. We examined whether such moral character information provides managers a moral license to invest (long) in sin stocks (harmful or socially irresponsible companies), or to bet against them (to short-sell them), or whether instead people expect ethical consistency: that ethical managers should eschew sin stocks but are especially licensed to invest in ethical stocks that maintain corporate social responsibility policies.
Overall, results failed to support the licensing hypothesis, but to a large extent supported the ethical commitment hypothesis. This pattern emerged in two (out of three) manipulations of stock manager moral character, including both same-domain (investment-related) and crossdomain (non-investment-related) part moral behavior. Results in Study 2 held for both liberal and conservative participants who may disagree over the ethicality of military service. Results in Study 3 were less clear, but the effect of fund manager saintliness on investing long in sin stocks was partially mediated by hypocrisy: people rated it less permissible for ethical managers to invest long in sin stocks in part due to the hypocrisy this action would imply, suggesting their past ethical behavior was insincere and served only to mask their true less ethical aims.
That said, clear results primarily emerged for investing long; results for shorting (betting against) sin and conventional stocks were less clear. One reason for this may be statistical suppression, as people may view shorting sin stocks as good because it implies a desire to see sin stocks fail 
(Pizarro & Tannenbaum, 2012)
, but simultaneously rate shorting itself unethical, thereby largely canceling out clear effects of manager ethicality on shorting sin stocks.
As effect sizes were modest and findings from some studies were mixed, we conducted a meta-regression on results across all studies. This analysis revealed a main effect of saintliness, such that overall regular fund managers are less permitted to invest in favor of sin stocks, relative to regular stocks. Secondly, saintliness translates into greater permissibility to invest (long) in regular stocks (based on the results from the control groups). Thirdly, saintliness translates into a lower permissibility to invest long in sin stocks relative to regular fund managers, but their permissibility to invest short in sin stocks might be different from that of regular fund managers, albeit we only have very weak evidence for the latter, visible only in a meta-regression (and not in Study 4, which was specifically designed to produce the most favorable conditions for a potential licensing effect). Therefore, people seem to care about the ethicality of fund managers and evaluate their current investment decisions in light of inferences about moral character based on past ethical deeds. Fund managers should consider this influence.


Implications
We contribute to several literatures. First, we add to the literature on moral licensing 
(Miller & Effron, 2010)
, which rarely investigates economic decision-making (cf. 
List and Momeni, 2021)
. A meta-analysis performed by 
Blanken et al. (2015)
 found an overall effect of licensing in the literature, but effect sizes crossed the zero point, indicating important moderators where some studies demonstrate licensing and other studies the opposite: ethical consistency (e.g., see 
Conway & Peetz, 2012)
. Our studies generally support expectations of ethical consistency rather than licensing, regardless of whether past ethical behavior was samedomain or cross-domain. Our findings suggest that fund managers cannot earn a license to invest in morally controversial companies, partially due to such investments appearing hypocritical, consistent with a recent study that investigated an executive of a tobacco company (O'Connor et al., 2020)-at least under the conditions examined here.
Our findings make sense insofar as people view moral character as indicative of reliable, trustworthy decision-making in service of the public good which increases willingness to cooperate 
(Goodwin et al., 2014)
, which allows for maximizing mutual returns in non-zero-sum interactions 
(Gintis et al., 2003)
. Attempts to promote an ethical reputation while simultaneously aiming to benefit from unscrupulous action (investing long in sin stocks) suggest that supposed moral character information merely reflects hollow moral 
selfpresentation (Lönnqvist et al., 2014)
, which can lure unsuspecting victims into vulnerability in non-zero-sum interactions and then exploit-them-that one is a hypocritical 'wolf in sheep's clothing' (e.g., 
Krebs & Denton, 2013)
. Accordingly, people appear to expect ethical consistency out of ethical managers and refuse them license to invest in sin stocks. Intriguingly, however, we do find evidence that ethical managers may earn a license to invest in companies that continue corporate social responsibility policies. Such decisions are in line with ethical manager moral character, and the increased license may reflect the inference that ethical manager investments partly reflect expert estimates that such companies contribute to the public good rather than mere greed, and are therefore more palatable than equivalent investments by neutral managers. Future research might benefit from clarifying whether such license applies specifically to ethical companies or applies broadly to neutral companies as well.
Second, we contribute to the literature that links fund manager (or upper echelon manager) characteristics with the attractiveness or performance of investment funds (or corporations; e.g., 
Benmelech & Frydman, 2015;
Cochardt et al., 2022;
ten Brinke et al., 2018)
, or an instance where economic decisions are made for others 
(Ruessmann & Topolinski, 2020)
. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our findings suggest that acts in the same domain (investment) seem to be a more reliable indicator of character that is applicable to the investment world, than prior commendable acts in a different domain (such as in the military). Thus, in our studies, serving in the military did not increase the license to invest in regular stocks. However, there is tentative evidence that investments in sin stocks by ex-military are nonetheless judged relatively unfavorably, possibly due to such actions being perceived as hypocritical 
(Cochardt et al., 2022)
. However, we did not assess this mechanism in Study 2, and thus this assertion is speculative.
Third, we contribute to research on the psychology of short-selling stocks ('shorting'; . Our findings do not provide conclusive evidence suggesting that fund managers' socially responsible investments or virtuous behavior increases the legitimacy to short socially irresponsible companies. This could be the result of a conflict between the act of shorting-which is judged to be significantly less moral than making typical ('long') investments-and virtuous (moral) investment. Shorting a sin stock is in some ways analogous to sacrificial moral dilemmas where causing harm maximizes outcomes. Shorting a stock is analogous to a harmful act, but the fall of a sin stock may be the morally best outcome overall. Research shows that people view others who reject sacrificial harm-even to achieve positive outcomes-as typically warmer, more moral, and more trustworthy than people who accept such sacrifices, even though they also appear less competent and leaderlike (e.g., 
(Everett et al., 2016
(Everett et al., , 2018
Rom et al., 2017)
. Hence, people may view saintly fund managers who accept harm-shorting the stock-as hypocritical for inflicting such harm which seems immoral, even as they approve of intentions to see sinful stocks fall. Hence, effects may be mediated by multiple different perceptions tracking concerns about the manager's character and the outcomes they achieve; future work should examine this possibility. It may also be that ethical managers who do more work to explain and broadcast their shorting decision as an activist choice for moral reasons will short perceptions. In the current work there is not much evidence that people interpret shorting sin stocks by ethical managers as activist investments. One reason may be that the fund manager will profit from this activist investment, and people appear to see social good and profit as conflicting goals 
(Bhattacharjee et al., 2017)
.
Limitations and future directions. Like all studies, the current work has some limitations. First, we mostly operationalize sin stocks as companies that abandon environmental, social, or governance (ESG) policies (except in 
Study 4)
. Alternative approaches could be used, such as focusing on the industry in which the company operates in (e.g., gambling). However, past work suggests that alternative operationalizations of 'sin' produce similar findings as the current manipulations 
(Niszczota et al., 2022)
. We cannot rule out that the lack of direct support for the ethical commitment hypothesis -postulating that investment in sin stocks backfires for ethical fund managers -is due to a different operationalization of saintliness. In Study 1, saintliness was operationalized solely based on the way that employees are treated, whereas in Study 3, saintliness was determined through past investment in companies that jointly care for product safety & quality, corporate behavior, and the health & safety of its employees. Perhaps more importantly, the classification of a company as a violator of these issues was explicitly determined by an independent rating agency, i.e. did not require any assessment to be made by the fund manager, but merely to act on the assessment of others. Some research suggests 
(Niszczota & Kaszás, 2020)
 that the need for morally competent fund managers becomes less salient if the moral violations are clear-cut (i.e., there is no need for the fund manager to judge the company, as it has been already judged by others or doesn't require any judgment as it is unequivocally sinful). Overall, the effect of saintliness might be diluted if the past investment record of the fund manager was determined by some issues that were less relevant (or more murky) to a layperson (such as corporate behavior, e.g., violation of antitrust laws), or if the judgment of the companies is delegated to a third-party (e.g., a rating agency).
Second, we operationalized moral character via inferences based on past behavior; we did not assess moral character directly, which future work should do, and future work should generalize to a broader array of ethical domains than just two. 
Walker and Hennig (2004)
 described lay perceptions of three different moral exemplars: just, brave, and caring. Distinguished military veterans fit the brave archetype, and ethical fund managers arguably the just arc-type--it may be that people hold different expectations for investment decisions by caring exemplars such as kind nurses (perhaps especially for sin stocks related to health, such as junk food companies). Third, we examined only perceptions of fund managers themselves rather than other investors or corporate parties. It seems reasonable to expect that our findings should apply to related targets such as private investors, the upper echelon of management (such as CEOs), or partners in venture capital firms 
(Barber et al., 2021
), but we do not investigate this directly. Finally, we examined perceptions rather than behavior. Although moral judgments tend to powerfully motivate behavior 
(Skitka et al., 2005)
, it remains to be seen how well the moral judgments in the current work translate into behavior such as withdrawing funds from a manager who invests in sin stocks. Future work would benefit from measuring actual investment decisions.
The final limitation concerns generalizability. The analysis was conducted on people from one industrialized country with an extremely well-developed stock market (the United States), in which perceptions of what constitutes a 'sin' stock and a 'saintly' fund manager might be different than in other countries that have somewhat developed stock markets. For example, countries with larger Muslim populations might perceive investment in companies producing alcohol less favorably for religious reasons, and in countries outside of the US, military veterans (even distinguished ones) might be perceived less favorably, and not indicative of moral character. Future research might study different populations to aid the generalizability of findings on investments that have a moral component.


Conclusion
Four studies examined how perceptions of fund manager ethicality influence perceptions of current investment decisions. Results are inconsistent with licensing and instead generally support the ethical consistency hypothesis: people expect ethical managers to put their money where their mouth is and reject sin stocks in favor of neutral or socially responsible stocks, lest they appear hypocritical. There is little clear evidence that people endorse ethical managers even shorting sin stocks. This may explain in part why hedge fund manager Steve Eisman described in The Big Short (Lewis, 2011) reported that many of his investors were angry with him after he shorted unethical banks even after the 2008 economic crisis made a huge profit for his investors and proved him right. Consistent with our results, even though he was arguably an activist investor driven partially by ethical motives, he found that shorting sin stocks appears ethically fraught. Our work suggests that investing long in sin stocks is even more so. Instead, ethical investors may wish to invest long in ethical companies to avoid perceptions of hypocrisy.


Methodology file
Saintly fund managers cannot earn a license to make sinful investments
We conducted four experimental studies, in which the structure was as follows:
1. Participants were greeted and were presented with the Main task (see 'Main tasks' subsection). 2. They answered three items (Studies 
[1]
[2]
[3]
 or five items (Study 4) concerning judgments of the fund manager (see 'Dependent variable'). 3. In Studies 3-4 they were also asked about how hypocritical the fund manager was, as well as their judgments of the long/short trade, judgment of a long/short trader, and judgment of taking a long/short position on their own behalf (see 'Additional questions asked after main task'). 4. Participants provide basic demographic information and information on their subjective and subjective investment knowledge

 (see 'Additional questions asked after each study'). 5. Participants were given the opportunity to provide optional feedback and received the completion code.


Main tasks
Study 1: Past investment behavior (same-domain moral licensing) First between-subjects factor: sin vs non-sin companies Sin companies. Imagine two companies. The first company was committed to environmentally friendly policies. After the new chief executive officer (CEO) had taken over the company, he planned to scrap the eco-friendly policies in favor of more profit planned. The second company is Sigma Industries, a for-profit corporation that provides casual dining and catering services. Sigma is considering entering the market in a new region, which would involve changes to their current operations. Because this market entry is an opportunity for Sigma to reevaluate its current practices, an executive at the firm has submitted a proposal recommending changes. Relative to the firm's current practices, this proposal involves reduced investment in socially responsible practices. In particular, compared with Sigma's current practices, the proposal calls for lower levels of service quality, lower safety standards, and the use of potentially deceptive marketing practices. Under the new plan, Sigma would also decrease employee pay and worsen its impact on the environment. Though Sigma's current practices are around overall industry average, the new proposal recommends practices that would be less socially responsible than 82% of firms in the industry. Non-sin companies. Imagine the following two companies. The first company was committed to environmentally friendly policies. Although a new chief executive officer (CEO) had taken over the company, he planned to continue the eco-friendly policies. The second company is Sigma Industries, a for-profit corporation that provides casual dining and catering services. Sigma is considering entering the market in a new region, which would involve changes to their current operations. Because this market entry is an opportunity for Sigma to reevaluate its current practices, an executive at the firm has submitted a proposal recommending changes. Relative to the firm's current practices, this proposal involves continued investment in socially responsible practices. In particular, compared with Sigma's current practices, the proposal calls for the same levels of service quality, higher safety standards, and continue avoiding potentially deceptive marketing practices. Under the new plan, Sigma would also continue increasing employee pay and continue reducing its impact on the environment. Though Sigma's current practices are around overall industry average, the new proposal recommends practices that would be more socially responsible than 82% of firms in the industry. Second between-subjects factor: saint vs non-saint fund manager Saint fund manager. Now, imagine a fund manager that is contemplating which companies to currently invest in, and is considering investing heavily in the two companies listed on the last page. This fund manager is known to have invested heavily in the past in companies that care about their employees (e.g., by engaging in profit sharing, ensuring that employees have respectable retirement benefits), and in doing so try to do business in a socially responsible way. Please rate the extent to which you agree with the following statements, on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), which relate to investment in the two companies listed in the previous page and this particular fund manager. Non-saint fund manager. Now, imagine a fund manager that is contemplating which companies to currently invest in, and is considering investing heavily in the two companies listed on the last page. This fund manager that has no history of investing in any particular companies or industries, i.e. invests in a combination of stocks from the Russell 3000 that he finds fit. Please rate the extent to which you agree with the following statements, on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), which relate to investment in the two companies listed in the previous page and this particular fund manager.
Study 2: Distinguished veteran (cross-domain moral licensing) First between-subjects factor: sin vs non-sin company Sin company. Sigma Industries is a for-profit corporation that provides casual dining and catering services. Sigma is considering entering the market in a new region, which would involve changes to their current operations. Entry into this market is an opportunity for Sigma to reevaluate its current practices, so an executive at the firm has submitted a proposal recommending changes. Relative to the firm's current practices, this proposal involves reduced investment in socially responsible practices. Compared with Sigma's current practices, the proposal calls for reducing customer service quality, lowering safety standards, and using false and deceptive marketing practices. Under the new plan, Sigma would also decrease employee pay and increase pollution by using cheap disposable plastics instead of more expensive recyclable material. Hence, the new proposal recommends practices that would be less socially responsible than 82% of firms in the industry. Non-sin company. Sigma Industries is a for-profit corporation that provides casual dining and catering services.

During his management career, Mr. Coleman was awarded recognition for his successful negotiations with resort staff and his efforts to lobby governments to increase tourism. Study 3: Past investment behavior: long vs short position on sin stock Description of (morally controversial) company [same as the sin company condition in Study 2] Sigma Industries is a for-profit corporation that provides casual dining and catering services. Sigma is considering entering the market in a new region, which would involve changes to their current operations. Entry into this market is an opportunity for Sigma to reevaluate its current practices, so an executive at the firm has submitted a proposal recommending changes.

Description of fund manager
[first between-subjects factor: saint vs non-saint fund manager] Now, imagine the following situation. A fund manager, Mr. Coleman, is contemplating which investments to make to benefit his investors. Saint fund manager condition. Throughout his professional life, he has been investing in companies that were rated by independent rating agencies as industry-leaders in:
 Product safety & quality. In this category, the companies are evaluated on their exposure to possible recalls or product safety concerns, the strength of their supply chain and sourcing systems, their quality management efforts in manufacturing and their responsible marketing practices.  Corporate behavior. In this category, the companies are evaluated on the quality of oversight and management of business ethics issues such as fraud, executive misconduct, corrupt practices, money laundering, or anti-trust violations.  Health & safety of its employees. In this category, companies are evaluated on their management of workplace safety and the workplace safety standards in the industries and regions in which they operate. Non-saint fund manager condition. Throughout his professional life, he has invested in a combination of stocks from the Russell 3000 that he found fit.


Description of position
[second between-subjects factor: short vs long position] Recently, Mr. Coleman has started to focus on investing in complicated financial products, including derivatives such as options and futures. The fund manager has started to gather information on the company listed on the last page, that according to his information, faces a [severe risk of a downturn/strong upward potential] in future profits. Therefore, he decided to buy [short-derivatives/long-derivatives] on the company. This means that he is investing in financial products that will win him substantial profits if the company's stock price [crashes/increases]. Essentially, buying [short-derivatives/long-derivatives] means he is [betting against the company/betting in favor of the company]]. If his belief turns out to be right, Mr. Coleman would make a killing with this investment (a substantial profit for the fund).

d corresponds to Cohen's d computed via the cohens_d function from the rstatix package in R
(Kassambara, 2023)
, whereas analyses of variance was computed using the aov_car function from the afex package
(Singmann et al., 2023)
, which uses a Type III test.


Granted, due to moral complexities of war, some people may not view military service as especially moral (e.g., see
Watkins, 2020)
. Therefore, we clarified that this service was especially laudatory.


A pilot study suggested that people care about such topics when considering corporate ethicality.


In Studies 1 and 2 we did not collect data on risk tolerance. This was the sole deviation from the pre-registered analysis.

Study 4: Past investment behavior and short position on tobacco stock Description of (morally controversial) company [tobacco company] Company B is a large tobacco manufacturer, which has been rated as a "laggard" by an independent rating agency in the domain of supply chain labor standards. To arrive at how a company fares in the domain of supply chain labor standards, the rating agency evaluates the management and transparency of a company's supply chain, and the working standards in the regions in which their suppliers are located.


Description of fund manager
[between-subjects factor: saint vs non-saint fund manager] Now, imagine the following situation. A fund manager, Mr. Coleman, is contemplating which investments to make to benefit his investors. Saint fund manager. Mr. Coleman is known to have invested heavily in the past in companies that care about their employees (e.g., by engaging in profit sharing, ensuring that employees have respectable retirement benefits), and in doing so try to do business in a socially responsible way. Non-saint fund manager. Mr. Coleman has no history of investing in any particular companies or industries, i.e. invests in a combination of stocks from the Russell 3000 that he finds fit.


Description of position [short position]
Recently, Mr. Coleman has started to focus on investing in complicated financial products, including derivatives such as options and futures. The fund manager has started to gather information on the company listed on the last page, that according to his information, faces a severe risk of a downturn in future profits. Therefore, he decided to buy shortderivatives on the company. This means that he is investing in financial products that will win him substantial profits if the company's stock price crashes. Essentially, buying shortderivatives means he is betting against the company. If his belief turns out to be right, Mr. Coleman would make a killing with this investment (a substantial profit for the fund). Please rate the extent to which you agree with the following statements, on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), which relate to the proposed trade and this particular fund manager.
1. I would be comfortable if this fund manager made this trade on my behalf.
2. It is appropriate for this fund manager to make such a trade.
3. This fund manager should be forbidden from making such a trade.
Additional questions asked after main task Hypocrisy  Please rate the extent to which you agree with the following statements, on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), which relate to the fund manager described on the last page (Mr. Coleman):  This fund manager is hypocritical.  This fund manager is two-faced.
Additional questions asked after each study Items 
[5]
[6]
 were originally used in 
Agnew and Szykman (2005)
. The items were presented in random order. The minimum score in the investment knowledge test was 0 and the maximum was 6.  Considering a long time period (e.g., 10 or 20 years), which asset normally gives the highest return: savings accounts, bonds or stocks?  Normally, which asset displays the highest fluctuations over time: savings accounts, bonds or stocks?  Stocks are normally riskier than bonds -is this statement True or False?  When an investor spreads money among different unrelated assets, does the risk of losing money: increase, decrease or stay the same?  If you were to invest $1000 in a stock fund, would it be possible to have less than $1000 when you decide to withdraw or move it to another fund?  High yield bond funds are invested in bonds with strong credit ratings -is this statement True or False?
