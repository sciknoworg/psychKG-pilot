You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

system of values An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) As we will demonstrate, the temporal stability of all systems, from the earliest formed, simplest atoms onwards, is dependent on the cooperation of their components. We locate such systems in the conservative/cooperative quadrant of a universal motivational map (UMM) with a structure equivalent to that of Schwartz's system. In the anthropocentric terminology of the ten personal values 1 of  system, this is equivalent to the 'traditions' of all stable systems being dependent on the mutual 'benevolence' of their components. Sustainable internalized motivations for competition and change only emerged in the evolution of the complex adaptive systems of organisms. Of organismic systems, only that of the human mind would appear capable of generating change based on cooperative motivations associated with near universal, conscious appreciations of the greater systems of which it is part.
We consider the possibility that if human values evolved sequentially as components of an increasingly sophisticated decision-making mechanism, they may still exert a hierarchical pattern of influence on human cognition and decision-making. Comparing individual responses to a selection of decision-making tasks with corresponding personal values profiles, we present experimental evidence that suggest they do. Since we are not aware of any competing theory that would predict this, the plausible explanation we provide for these otherwise unexpected findings invites further investigation.


Theory in psychology
Borghi and Fini (2019) identify a lack of emphasis on theoretical contributions as a deficiency of modern psychological science. While acknowledging the importance of empirical investigation, they point out that without a broad-based theoretical framework, core principles that accelerate scientific progress are likely to be missed. Specifically, they state "complex phenomena such as mental and cognitive processes can be understood only starting from multiple perspectives" 
(Borghi & Fini, 2019, p.1)
, and "prioritizing empirical results over theory can instead lead to a growing tendency to obtain fragmented and conflicting evidence about a phenomenon" 
(Borghi & Fini, 2019, p2
).
Theories may be judged by the degree of informed consensus surrounding them. This tends to decrease as one moves up the hierarchy of sciences 
(Comte, 1854)
: from fundamental mathematics and physics, through the increasingly complex sciences of chemistry and biology, to the social sciences and psychology 
(Fanelli & Glanzel, 2013)
. Whatever the theoretical challenges of maths and physics, they are as nothing compared to those facing psychologists. Whereas the widely accepted theories of physics concern just 12 fundamental building blocks of nature and 4 forces 
(Fermilab, 2014)
, psychologists are tasked with making sense of the outputs of an unimaginably complex set of interactions between approximately 60 trillion neural network connections (e.g., 
Gulati, 2015)
.
The five-factor model, whether in its appended HEXACO form or not, is arguably one the best established in psychology, and the most widely adopted in the study of personality. Yet 
Block (2010)
 criticised it for being atheoretical; falling short because it is incomplete, non-systematic, and simply descriptive. He said that what is needed is "an adaptive paradigm … a model or point of view or productive principles that can, in Gell-Mann's memorable and guiding phrase, generate sufficient 'surface complexity arising out of deep simplicity'" 
(Block, 2010, p.22)
. He echoed 
McAdams & Pals (2006, p. 204
) statement that the aim for the study of personality is "to provide an integrative framework for understanding the whole person" 
(Block, 2010, p.19)
. Also saying "It is about time we recognized that heredity and environment are not simply additively related; their connection is complex and nonlinear, often synergistic" 
(Block, 2010, p.5)
.
We argue that the  values model replicates a motivational structure that delivers on all of 
Block's (2010)
 aspirations. It is systematic, complete, and, when considered in relation to fundamental principles and insights from physics, evolution by natural selection, and complexity theory, offers a simple, unifying perspective from which to explain all human psychological and social phenomena. 
Gell-Mann (1994)
 himself observed that traversing the layers of complexity between the fundamental mechanisms of physics and the high-level emergent phenomena of psychology requires computations of intractable complexity. However, he believed similarities among systems at different levels point toward connections between the fundamental and the emergent that could be used to approach a deeper understanding.
Evolution in this universe has been driven by the same fundamental motivational forces in accordance with the same physical laws for some 
13.8 billion years (Kolb, 1990;
Planck Collaboration, 2020)
. Countless, increasingly complex systems have emerged over this period. Of these, humanity, in the form of homo sapiens, emerged around 200-300,000 years ago 
(Brooks et al., 2018;
Marean et al., 2007)
: i.e., in the last forty-sixth-thousandth of this period. Yet, even evolutionary-and comparative-psychologists tend not to look beyond it when trying to build a clearer picture of why we are as we are (e.g., 
Bryer et al., 2020)
. That the psychological phenomenon of personality has been attributed to organisms as simple as bacteria , which evolved three billion years ago 
(Alegado & King, 2019)
, should draw attention to the possibility that such anthropocentric myopia may have inhibited our ability to achieve a deeper understanding.
In the following we traverse a vast scientific terrain: from quantum physics to social psychology through classical physics, chemistry, and evolutionary biology. In the interests of brevity and making the argument comprehensible to psychologists who may be unfamiliar with much of this terrain, we have endeavoured to offer explanations in the simplest possible terms while remaining true to the underlying science. The principles described are universal and apply at every layer of evolving complexity. Their simplicity contrasts with the numerous, complex, and diverse emergent mechanisms for which they are responsible. While examples of these are provided, they are intended as way-markers rather than contiguous steppingstones by which to traverse the terrain.


An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)
Aside from considerations of brevity, when describing the evolution of complex systems, analysis of such detail is considered counter-productive, since the computations required to fully account for the evolutionary process are intractable (e.g., 
Axelrod 1997;
Gell-Mann, 1994;
Holland, 1995)
. Of greater interest are repetitive patterns that emerge at different levels of complexity, as these provide our best clues as to the universality of the underlying mechanisms.
The theory we advance has been developed from a transdisciplinary perspective. It is anchored in fundamental and universal principles, linked to the structure of  values model. It is not based on other psychological theories. Accordingly, we have neither reviewed nor extensively referred to examples of these in the main text. We provide commentary on relationships with prominent theories and models that may be of interest in the supplementary materials. Our evolutionary theory offers the potential to contextualise all such theories within a parsimonious framework.


Core principles relevant to the evolution of the universe, and hence human psychology
It is beyond the scope of this article to fully describe the theories and well-established principles that drive the evolution of natural systems. In the supplementary materials (SM1) we provide brief descriptions and citations relating to selected core principles, namely: quantum uncertainty, the structure of atoms, gravitational and electromagnetic fields, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, energy transfer between systems, and evolution by natural selection. From these it follows that: (a) even the simplest, most stable atoms (from which all matter is made) are fundamentally dynamic systems; (b) all things in the universe are systematically connected such that they contribute to each other's environment, their influence on each other increasing exponentially with proximity, with gravity tending to draw systems together so they become entwined; (c) since energy cannot be destroyed or created, gains and losses to and from local systems must be compensated for in external systems -localised increases in order come at the expense of delocalised disorder; (d) all systems tend toward energetic equilibrium, with their components An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) displacing each other, so releasing kinetic energy (in the form of photons) to minimize their total potential energy (TPE); (e) since the electrons in atomic systems may only emit and absorb photons with energy levels particular to each atomic element, streams of photons pass between atomic systems, effectively transmitting information that is perceived and processed differently by different atomic systems; (f) systems (including organisms) evolve through a winnowing process akin to survival of the fittest, where fitness is derived from a system's ability to process (dissipate) energy more efficiently than competing systems in the context of its environment 
(England, 2015)
, so accelerating entropy (disorder) globally in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics 
(Kaila & Annila, 2008)
. Accordingly, the human brain may be considered a consequence of 13.8 billion years of evolution by natural selection producing increasingly complex and energy-efficient processing systems.


Complexity and complex adaptive systems.
The 
Schrodinger (1926)
 equation, which describes the wave functions 2 of quantum particles and their environmental interactions, represents a fundamental building block of quantum mechanical theory. Hence it may be regarded as key to explaining the existence and operation of all things in the universe. It can be used to accurately predict the permitted electron energy orbitals of atomic elements, and so their chemical properties. Armed with this and other equations and insights from quantum mechanics, one might consider it possible to accurately predict the behavior of all things from the behavior of their fundamental components. However, while the laws of physics enable us to predict the interactions of dynamic systems comprising just two bodies, the introduction of just a third gives rise to complex interactions that render systems chaotic and unpredictable, in the long term at least 
(Gowers et al., 2008)
. Poincare's proof of this in 1890 led to the development of chaos theory 
(Letellier et al., 2021)
, of which the butterfly effect 
(Lorenz, 1963)
 is possibly the best-known concept. This describes how very small changes in one part of a complex system may have very large 
Holland (1995)
 describes fitness as context dependent. 
Dawkins ( , 1982
 considers this at multiple levels of complexity: from the context of a gene within a chromosome, to the context of a cell within an organ, to the context of organisms within an environment of overlapping extended phenotypes, to the context of memes within a culture. 
Dawkins (1982)
 introduced the concept of the extended phenotype to include all the effects of a gene: i.e., those beyond physiology and behavioral traits. Termite mounds, spider's webs, and beaver dams are among the examples of physical structures that are as much consequences of gene-environment interactions as the physical and neurological traits facilitating their construction. The construction of dam lakes by beavers directly affects the environments of other organisms, so setting in motion a chain of complex interactions. In the case of humanity, where the actions of one individual can affect a world population of 8 billion 
(Dion, 2022)
, the potential for interacting extended phenotypes to trigger synchronized responses across the CAS of life on Earth is all too apparent. Because all things contribute to the environment of all other things, the interaction of extended phenotypes and other environmental interactions may generate feedback loops that contribute to reciprocal causations of evolution. The effects of these may be experienced at all levels of complexity, from the interaction of complex molecules in self-catalytic processes of the RNA world from which life may have emerged 
Rich, 1965)
 upwards. 
Hunter (2008)
 stresses the importance of 
Dawkins' (1982)
 idea of extended phenotypes in the development of the current extended evolutionary synthesis of 
Darwin's (1859)
 original theory of evolution.
The principles of natural selection are traditionally applied to biological evolution via reproduction.
However, just as organisms evolved from non-living complex molecules (e.g., Böttcher, 2018), the principles underlying evolution by natural selection pre-date the emergence of life. 
Pross (2005)
 considers fitness and natural selection to be representations of more fundamental concepts. Indeed, 
Dawkins (1989, p.12)
 suggested that 'survival of the fittest' might be reconsidered as a special case of 'survival of the most stable'. An equivalent of which may be used to explain the abundance of free stable atoms such as those of carbon and gold, and free molecules of water, oxygen, and cellulose, at the expense of more reactive (less stable) free atoms of potassium, sodium, and lithium. So, while potassium atoms are of themselves considered stable, and potassium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, its susceptibility to reacting with Earth's abundant oxygen and water molecules ensures its atoms never occur in their free form 
(Emsley, 2010)
.
Chemical reactions leading to the survival of the most stable tend to be settled relatively quickly, as atomic and molecular systems reconfigure into more energy-efficient states of equilibrium. By contrast, the fitness of organisms can only be determined over many generations. Rather than evolve through single interactions between stable states, organisms retain coherence by maintaining far-from-equilibrium states 
(Prignone & Nicolis, 1985)
 by continually absorbing and dissipating energy. Inanimate CAS, such as sand dunes and hurricanes, maintain far-from-equilibrium states by passively absorbing energy from their environment, whereas organisms actively orchestrate its acquisition.


Cooperation and competition
Consistent with quantum uncertainty , all stable systems in equilibrium are fundamentally dynamic, in that their constituent particles can never be at rest. Accordingly, their constituents cooperate to maintain system stability: literally, work together to the same end 
(Oxford Dictionaries, 2023)
. The scientific definition of work is to transfer energy. In a stable system that has minimized its TPE, such as an atom, energy may be transferred between components but must be conserved overall 
(Moskowitz, 2014)
. Systems become unstable when disequilibrium causes the displacement of components as they move to minimize their TPE, radiating kinetic energy as they do so.
In an ecological context, competition concerns interactions involved in attempting to gain a share of a limited resource 
(Oxford Dictionaries, 2023)
. In the context of physical systems, this limited resource is their minimum TPE. This is subject to localised environmental constraints. For example, while most atoms are stable in most environments, in high energy environments, such as those encountered in stars and supernovas, they may become unstable. In these environments lower minima of TPE become possible. Iron and Nickel atoms have the most energy-efficient, tightly bound nuclei, and so are the most stable atomic systems 
(Fewell, 1995)
. Given the abundance of elements in the universe tends to decline with mass, the relatively high abundance of iron and nickel in the solar system 
(Arnett, 1995)
 would appear to be an example of 
Dawkin's (1989)
 preferential 'survival of the most stable'.
Cooperation and competition are opposing factors in evolution, yet, due to the first law of thermodynamics, and the fact that systems can only be in equilibrium or not, they are also complementary. Their importance in evolution by natural selection, the functioning of organisms, and, more generally, in the study of CAS is widely acknowledged 
(Axelrod, 1997;
Bovaird 2008;
Holland, 1995;
Nowak & Highfield, 2012)
. The model most frequently refenced to illustrate the relationship between them (see 
Kaufmann, 1995;
Nowak & Highfield, 2012
) is game theory's The Prisoner's Dilemma, developed by Flood and Drechsler at the RAND corporation 
(Poundstone, 1993)
. Its wide-ranging utility may be appreciated by relating its basic premise and scoring system to energetic interactions between physical systems. In the game two players are faced with an identical binary choice: whether to seek to maximise their personal benefit at the cost of the other (defect/compete) or refuse to do so, preferring to share the same fate (cooperate). Each makes their decision without knowledge of what the other will do, yet their outcomes are co-dependent on these decisions. These can be scored as shown in 
fig. 2
.


Fig. 2 The Prisoner's Dilemma scoring matrix
Axelrod & 
Hamilton (1981)
 staged a competition for research purposes in which game theorists in economics, sociology, political science, and mathematics were invited to submit strategies for playing an iterated version of The Prisoners Dilemma. No limits were placed on the complexity or simplicity of the strategies. The winning strategy -'tit for tat' -was simple: to cooperate first and then, in all subsequent rounds, repeat what the other player did in the previous round. If both players cooperate, they maximise their joint returns. If the other player defects they will be punished for doing so in the next round. The strategy of 'always defect' may be considered rational, since it ensures a player cannot come off worse than their opponent and offers the potential of maximizing one's relative gain. 'Always defect' is considered an evolutionary stable strategy because it cannot be beaten by a single mutated alternative (Cowde,, 2012). However, when played by two rational players it is highly unlikely the other party will choose to continue cooperating, taking the 'sucker's payoff' 
(Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981)
 of 0 points while ceding 5 points to the other player. Accordingly, it is more likely they will get stuck with 1 point each. Evolution by natural selection may not be rational, but through extensive trial and error it tends toward optimal solutions. A version of Holland's genetic algorithm, when presented with the same challenge, arrived at an improved version of tit for tat by allowing for the possibility of bluffing one's opponent 
(Axelrod, 1987)
.
If points are taken to represent energy, a meeting of cooperative strategies maximises energy conservation by the conjoined physical system of the two 'players', whereas competitive encounters involve much loss of energy. For example, two oxygen atoms combine to form molecular oxygen with little loss of energy, whereas reactions between potassium and water are violent: resulting in much energy loss through physical movement, heat, and light. Given that, in nature, systems may retain and accrue energy so that 'points' accumulate between 'rounds of play', not only does cooperation maximise energy-efficiency it also has the potential to allow systems to gain power relative to those 'playing by' other strategies, and so outcompete them. In the case of organisms subject to competition from resistant prey, hostile predators, bacteria, viruses, etc., this gives them greater potential to sustain damage and prevail. In the case of human systems, organizations in which individuals cooperate may more efficiently direct their energies to corporate endeavour than those in which energy is consumed in internal competition (e.g., 
Deery & Iverson, 2005;
Spurny et al., 2022)
.
The evolution of robust, adaptive physical systems may be compared to that of similarly robust, adaptive information processing systems, such as the human brain. While potentially damaging, misleading information may gain a hold, abilities to seek out and reference an increasingly integrated (cooperative) knowledge base and intelligently process incongruous (competitive) information, potentiates humanity's accumulation and ability to access ever greater stores of useful information.


Phase transitions and punctuated equilibrium: emergent traits and motivations
Perfectly cooperative stable systems cannot evolve. Evolution requires some disruption: some competition. The evolutionary sequence leading from quantum particles to humanity can be considered in terms of transitions between stable systems in agreement with 
Novikoff's (1945)
 integrative levels of organization. In the beginning, competition between quantum particles resolved into the cooperative systems of hydrogen and helium atoms. In the more energetic environments of An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) supernovae the stability of these systems was disrupted again, sometimes repeatedly, before their components stabilized into a sequence of heavier elements. In turn, these collided, forming stable molecules. These were drawn together by gravitational attraction to form new stars, including our sun, and associated planetary systems. On Earth further transitions brought about the emergence and evolution of meteorological, geological, and geomorphic processes. Through these, a succession of increasingly complex molecular systems evolved, paving the way to life (e.g., 
Salthe, 2010;
Steffen et al. 2020)
.
While uncertainty remains concerning the precise origins of life, the 'RNA World' theory 
(Rich, 1965)
, which has ribonucleic acid as the immediate pre-cursor to the last common ancestor of life on Earth, remains one of the best supported (e.g., 
Rana & Ankri, 2016)
. Whatever the first living molecule, many evolutionary stages may have passed before prokaryotic cells established themselves as cooperating systems of previously independent replicators 
(Queller & Strassmann, 2009)
. Over approximately 4 billion years organismic evolution brought about the emergence of eukaryotes, archeans, algae, plants, fungi, and countless more, increasingly complex, organisms 
(Betts et al, 2018;
Dawkins, 2005)
.
The sequential emergence of increasingly complex and energy-efficient systems may be regarded in terms of phase transitions. In these, pre-existing components are reconfigured and recombined into new stable forms that best satisfy the second law of thermodynamics given localised environmental constraints. These emergent entities will most likely have different traits from their constituent parts. So, while, for example, the basic systematic building blocks of neutrons and atoms are neutrally charged, their constituents (respectively: up and down quarks, and protons and electrons) are positively and negatively charged. Consequently, they are motivated to behave differently with respect to electromagnetic fields. Different configurations of these atomic constituents endow the elements of the periodic table with different traits. For example, those of helium render it an inert, colorless gas in the Earth's environment, yet when those of three atoms of helium transition into single atoms of carbon, they manifest themselves as a chemically active, electrically conductive, black solid. The electron structure of helium renders its valence shell complete, and as such provides it with no motivation to react with other chemicals, whereas carbon is 'willing' to bond with itself and other atoms. This adaptability lending it to become an essential component of all organisms: representing 18.5% by mass of the human body 
(Shah, 2015)
.
The novel traits of emergent systems are particular to the local environment in which they emerge.
At room temperature, water is an electrically conductive liquid, in contrast to its non-conductive gaseous components of hydrogen and oxygen. Water becomes gaseous at 100 O C and solid as 0 O C, losing much of its conductivity. Even fundamental traits such as the mass of particles are determined by their interactions with the 
Higgs (1964)
 Field: an all-pervasive quantum field. As previously discussed, the fitness-enhancing potential of organismic traits are similarly context dependent.
Behavioral traits mediate between the needs of an organism and its environment (e.g., 
Sih et al., 2003)
. Genes that promote behaviors best adapted to satisfying an organism's survival and reproductive needs will be preferred by natural selection. As such, they may be considered products of interactions between the systems of organisms and the systems of their environment.
Consequently, in the sweep of millions of years of evolution, they may be considered transitory.
Therefore, if we are seeking fundamental truths about the nature of human psychology, including personality, behavioral traits can only provide indirect clues. They are ultimately products of interactions between fundamental motives (directly related to the second law of thermodynamics) and the environment in which they are expressed.
Previously stable non-living systems may be destabilized by inputs of energy that exceed their ability to maintain cooperative order through absorption and emission. Once this happens displaced components compete to establish new relationships that minimize their TPE in the context of their changed environment (see 
fig. 3
). In chemistry, the energy required to initiate these transitions is known as activation energy. 
Fig. 3
 shows a transition in which the TPE of an evolving local system is lowered. Previously stable systems may be broken into simpler components in certain environments, such as when water molecules are split into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis. However, in accordance with 
Novikoff's (1945)
 concept of integrative levels, the evolutionary history of the universe suggests a trend toward greater complexity and integration. The components of pre-existing stable systems with unique properties are recombined into newly emergent stable systems with their own characteristic properties. The distinctive properties of organisms, and in turn of humanity, being no different in this respect 
(Adami et al, 2000)
.


Fig. 3 Phase transition between stable cooperative states
Unlike atoms, which are mostly unbreakable in the environmental conditions found on Earth, molecules tend to be more easily destabilized. Those of carbon dioxide, for example, are decomposed as part of photosynthesis in plants 
(Singhal, 1999)
. The energies required to move more complex arrangements of unbound molecules of gas and sand in CAS of persistent weather and dune systems may be even lower. Consequently, while whole systems of loosely or unbound components may endure for extended periods, localised transitions involving the relocation/recycling of their constituents may be continuous.


An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)
The 
Briggs-Rauscher (1973)
 reaction between hydrogen peroxide and an iodate is an example of a chemical system capable of sustaining dynamic patterns of orderly behavior. Cycles of sudden color change between amber and dark blue take place as concentrations of the reactants rise and fall (see kviht, 2012). While the oscillating reactions may persist for many minutes, the reaction gradually comes to an end as the reactants are exhausted.


Fig. 4 Energy exchanges in far-from-equilibrium systems
Where previously stable systems undergo single phase transitions, such far-from-equilibrium systems may transition between multiple micro-states with near continuous energy exchanges (see 
fig.4
). In weather and sand dune systems the activating source of energy comes from the external environment, whereas in the Briggs-Rauscher (1973) it appears to come from within. However, from the perspective of each reactant, the other effectively defines its environment. Such dynamic systems may be said to comprise components pursuing competitive strategies, yet they maintain orderly structures. In the case of dunes, most of the sand grains cooperate in maintaining the structure of each dune. The management of change/evolution involves competition between a relatively small proportion of sand grains and the external environment. Functionally, organisms also manage the competitive processes of change while maintaining relatively stable cooperative systems of cellular components 
(Nowak & Highfield, 2012)
. Over many generations they evolve through relatively minor changes to their genetic code -consequences of competition between genesdeveloping upon, but largely maintaining, existing genetic building blocks 
(Holland, 1995;
.
In addition to the continuous changes and gradual evolution (gradualism) described above, equivalents of phase transitions are apparent in organismic evolution. Systemic organismenvironment interactions may tend toward equilibrium states that reduce variation and appear to slow the pace of evolution . However, when these larger systems are themselves subjected to disruptive events they too may undergo major evolutionary changes over relatively short periods. For example, the Chicxulub asteroid impact 66 million years ago destroyed three quarters of the planet's plant and animal species 
(Alvarez, 1983)
, clearing environmental niches that birds and mammals evolved to fill 
(Falkowski et al., 2005)
. Such events provide the equivalent of activation energy and trigger phase transitions in punctuated equilibrium 
(Eldridge & Gould, 1972)
 or quantum evolution 
(Simpson 1944)
. Even within twenty generations of an organism, environmental changes may give rise to quantum evolutionary leaps (Wineguard et al.


2017).


Universal motives for change
The foregoing suggests that competition and cooperation are important considerations in evolution.
Rather than proceeding smoothly toward maximum entropy, the universe evolves through localised oscillations between order and disorder: cooperation and competition. The evolution of increasingly complex systems, including organisms, humanity, and psychology, is a consequence of competition between cooperative strategies. The most efficient are those whose cooperative endeavours produce the most work per unit of energy input. These are preferred by natural selection and so become building blocks for greater systems.


An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)
CAS such as organisms, comprising many dynamically stable subsystems, represent multi-layered islands of relatively cooperative stability afloat in a sea of chaotic competition. Collisions between them threaten their stability yet provide opportunities to evolve.  describes them as existing near the edge of chaos: between stasis and chaos. Perfect cooperation may be associated with the former and unfettered competition with the latter. However, due to gravitational and electromagnetic attraction, competition tends to be resolved in localised equilibrium or, in the case of CAS, dynamic stability. Accordingly, the universe may be considered a dynamic system in which cooperative and competitive strategies are intimately and inextricably entwined. Considered in this way it is apparent cooperation and competition, and their relationships with change, could be considered components of a universal motivational fractal.   system of values  system of values is a well-established motivational model that explores the relationships between stability and change, and cooperation and competition.  named the poles of its orthogonal axes as conservation and openness to change, and selftranscendence and self-enhancement. 
Fig. 5
 shows this basic structure rendered as a universal motivational map. Justified by functional correspondence (e.g., Aelenei et al., 2020) competition replaces self-enhancement, change replaces openness to change, and cooperation replaces selftranscendence. Replacing anthropocentric terminology with terms applicable to any system makes it easier to bridge perceptual divisions between the motives of humanity, other organisms, and nonliving systems.
Prior to the emergence of organisms, all stable systems conserved energy through the cooperation of their components, and so can be said to have motives belonging to the conservation/cooperation quadrant. They change and evolve because of random collisions with other systems (or fundamental particles) moving chaotically through their shared environment. In this sense, the motivation for change comes from without.
Dynamic systems, such as storms and dunes, seem to have components exhibiting cooperative and competitive strategies. However, the latter are directly induced by involuntary interactions with their environment. Only with the emergence of living systems are motivations for competition and change internalised to facilitate sustainable dynamic stability.


Motives for competition and change
For some, the significant divides between humanity and our ape ancestors, between mammals and single celled organisms, and between life and inanimate matter, seem too great to be traversed by gradual evolution through chaotic collisions. However, that is the conclusion scientists are drawn to (e.g., 
Salthe, 2010;
Steffen et al. 2020)
. Therefore, rather than confine considerations of the evolution of human psychology within the framework of 300,000 years of homo sapiens, we might do well to embrace the more radical framework suggested by 
Gell-Mann (1994)
, 
Holland (1995)
, , and others. Until the emergence of life, it seems no sustainable local system could harness motivations to initiate competition, change, and innovate. Yet, as history attests, the universal system did. It would be consistent with the observations and models of those studying CAS (e.g., 
Gell-Mann, Holland, Kauffman, Simon, etc.)
 that smaller CAS should evolve within the greater CAS of which they are part An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) and replicate aspects of their structure. In so doing they betray something of the shared 'algorithm' that generated them by illuminating something of the relationship between traits and underlying motivations. Newly emergent systems may have novel traits, but these are derived from those of their constituents, which are in turn derived from the universal laws of physics as they play out in systemic interactions. So, while the neutral charge of the first hydrogen atoms was a novel trait that distinguished them from their proton and electron constituents, it derived from the sum of the positive and negative charges of their components, which were retained. The much later emergence of such novel traits as flight and consciousness in the complex systems of organisms can also be derived from pre-existing traits of pre-existing component systems.
Organisms first took flight approximately 400 million years ago 
(Dunning, 2014)
. Prior to this, as now, leaves, seeds, and inorganic matter would have been transported above the Earth's surface by air currents. The aerodynamic traits that facilitate flight were already in place. Evolution simply facilitated the emergence of mechanisms for flight from pre-existing interactions between systems.
It did so via many phase transitions, likely including mechanisms that assist gliding in modern species (e.g., 
Siddall et al., 2020)
. Flight appears to have evolved four times independently in insects, birds, bats, and pterosaurs 
(Dawkins, 2005;
Hunter, 2007)
. This suggests the building blocks of the mechanisms of flight were/are widely available.
Consciousness is difficult to define 
(Tononi & Koch, 2015)
, let alone date its emergence. 
Cabanac et al. (2009)
 contemplate evidence from neural correlates to suggest emergence in amniota (animals that produce embryos in amniotic sacks) about 340 million years ago 
(Benton & Donoghue, 2007)
.
However, 
Tononi's (2004)
 integrated information theory suggests it needn't be exclusively associated with organisms 
(Tononi & Koch, 2015)
. Consciousness involves modeling the internal and external environment to aid goal-directed activity (e.g., 
Pennartz et al., 2019)
. As such, it demands, at the very least, abilities to gather, process, store, and relay information. The simplest atomic systems can do this by absorbing and emitting streams of information in the form of photons and processing them by 'deciding' the energy levels and directions of each emission. It also demands abilities to register and respond to this information in ways that facilitate awareness of a discrete host system (a 'self') in relation to its environment. When considered in relation to the closed loops within the brain-body system described by 
Kotchoubey (2018)
 and the feedback loops of CAS, this suggests consciousness requires no more than complex rearrangements of pre-existing capabilities.
If so, the evolution of the full gamut of human psychology, including the traits associated with motives in the other three quadrants of our universal motivational map, and, by association, the values of  model, can be traced back to before the emergence of organisms.
Organisms are CAS (e.g., 
Adami et al., 2002;
Brown, 1995)
 comprising many chemical components with low activation energies, that maintain near equilibrium states that are highly responsive to environmental changes 
(Ross & Berry, 2008)
. As such, each component may be compared to a strategically placed grain of sand in a system of dunes, ready to fall into a location most advantageous to the system's orderly progression.
The first organism (like all subsequent lifeforms) would have been a molecular system that maintained a far-from-equilibirum state by absorbing and dissipating energy from and to its environment. Unlike inanimate systems, it had acquired the capacity to sustainably procure and process this energy (e.g., 
Mossel & Steel, 2005)
. Since the detail of how life emerged from non-life remains moot (e.g., 
Sousa et al., 2013)
, for the purposes of this discussion all that needs to be acknowledged is that the first organisms evolved almost 4 billion years ago 
(Betts et al, 2018)
. From then on, in accordance with the second law, natural selection preferred those able to process the greatest amount of energy most efficiently toward their own survival and reproduction 
(England, 2015)
. This effectively gave rise to an arms race in the battle for access to resources: initially sources of food/energy and then, two million years later, to sexual partners 
(Zimmer, 2009)
. The first organisms may have been relatively passive components in the game of life: more like hands of cards in poker than players. Over time, natural selection imbued organisms with increasingly complex mechanisms, enabling even bacteria and plants to initiate competitive behavior 
(Hibbing et
  comparing these with previously stored information (memory) 
(Bezdek, 1992)
. Even bacteriaamong the earliest evolved organisms -appear to have these capabilities 
(Jacob et al., 2004;
Stock & Zhang, 2013)
.
As stated previously, evolution through natural selection involves carrying forward and building upon high-fitness building blocks. Stable, cooperative atomic and molecular systems represent the most basic of these. Organisms, like all other stable systems, require cooperating components: organelles, cells, organs, and integrating systems that work together to sustain and reproduce their host. Yet, the dynamism of each relies on highly constrained, subordinated competition. An important example being the electrochemical disequilibrium responsible for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, which performs key functions in all cellular activity 
(Pfeiffer et al., 2001
).
Cooperation may be manifested externally between and with sexual partners, offspring, group/colony members, and even unrelated species in symbiotic relationships .
However, organismic interactions with the environment tend to be competitive: mechanisms that strip energy from other systems, including other organisms (e.g., digestion and metabolism), predatorial and defence mechanisms, and sexual reproductive strategies that seek to attract mates in competition with others. Such competitive strategies are outward facing and subordinated to serve the cooperative interests of the local systems of organisms. As such, they evolved to include An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) capacities for aggression, deception, and dishonesty (e.g., 
Bond & Robinson, 1988;
Hauser, 1992;
Proctor, 1991)
, and for being unforgiving and unhelpful (see 
, Hibbing et al., 2010
.
When unmoderated competitive strategies evolve within a local system, as happens when mutations cause cells to become cancerous, dynamic stability may be undermined by the unsustainable demands they impose 
(Nowak and Highfield, 2012)
. As in the Prisoners Dilemma, in the short-term, the competitive strategy of cancerous cells pays off, inflicting many rounds of 'sucker's pay-offs' on the greater system of the organism, but it ultimately accelerates their mutual demise.


Motivations for creativity and innovation
While natural selection facilitated organisms gaining traits better adapted to increasingly competitive environments, the primary motivation for change remained external in the earliest phases of their evolution. The genetic mutations responsible arose from random collisions between high energy particles and the DNA (or RNA) of organisms, or random copying errors 
(Pray, 2008
)possibly arising from random sub-atomic quantum fluctuations 
(Slocombe et al., 2022)
. Traits over which an organism has no executive control, such as those relating to basic physiology, are those most easily recognised as being directly programmed by genes. However, since all organisms are dynamic CAS that exist within dynamic and often unpredictable environmental CAS, some programmed allowance for localised executive control is also to be expected.
Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a fixed genotype to produce many phenotypes 
(Pigliucci et al., 2006)
. It arises from the equivalent of 
Holland's (1995)
 'if-then' genetic programming. It enables organisms to respond differently to different environmental stimuli. Accordingly, while some ability to instigate change is universal in organisms, this may amount to no more than automated selection from a relatively small, genetically determined menu in accordance with prescriptive criteria. Just as identical DNA in the nuclei of somatic cells facilitates their developing specialised forms and functions dependent on their relative locations (e.g., 
Holland, 1995)
, this does not require an internalized pro-change, creative, or innovative motivation.


An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)
To instigate change in ways that suggest a pro-change, competitive motivation associated with the competition/change quadrant of the motivational map requires an ability to deviate from a genetically determined menu. As the competitive traits of organisms evolved to become more sophisticated, they would have demanded more powerful and flexible mechanisms for gathering, processing, recording, and recalling information to inform decision-making.
Given that it can be argued freewill is an illusion (e.g., 
Dennett, 2015)
, the emergence of more sophisticated, flexible, and apparently self-directed decision-making mechanisms may be regarded simply a result of more layers of finely-tuned 'if-then' programming over which an organism has no effective control. An alternative perspective is that evolution equipped increasingly complex and individualized organisms with increasingly complex decision-making mechanisms able to adapt to the unpredictable, non-linear behavior of environmental CAS (e.g., 
Franch-Gras et al., 2017;
Heisenberg, 2009;
Wingfield, 2013)
 in ways that imparted some level of independent executive control. The conscious entity (the 'self') that makes such decisions is an emergent phenomena borne of complex interactions in the CAS of brain and body 
(Thompson & Varela, 2001)
. As with all other emergent phenomena, this evolved through many phase transitions.
All organisms must be able to tolerate at least short periods of unproductive activity 
(Grime, 1977)
.
The greater the resources available to them, the greater this tolerance is likely to be. However, because no activity is cost free, an organism's return on energy invested in 'unproductive' activity will inform judgement by natural selection. Accordingly, it may effectively be considered an organism's research and development budget. Apparently random search patterns such as 'Levy Flights' 
(Mandelbrot, 1982)
 that insects, birds, sharks, and turtles use to satisfy a goal have been genetically programmed to optimise the chances of doing so in uncertain environments 
(Guinard & Korman, 2021;
Humphries at al., 2012)
. Comparable exploratory behavior is witnessed in cells in the erection of microtubules in the construction of cytoskeletons 
(Kirschner & Mitchison, 1986)
. Natural selection has seemingly honed these behaviors to minimize risk in unavoidably risky situations. The greater the eventual return from any related discoveries and innovations, the greater the An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) competitive advantage bestowed, and the greater the selection pressure that can be expected to come to bear on facilitating genes.


Viewed within narrow temporal and spatial parameters, components of behaviors such as Levy
Flights may seem devoid of purpose due to the incomplete picture of the environment afforded. The same could be said for playful behavior. This may be described as not fully functional 
(Burghardt, 2005)
 because it seems to offer no immediate survival or reproductive benefit. Given natural selection tends to eliminate comparatively inefficient mechanisms and behaviors, an inherent motivation for such behavior could only evolve in organisms able to maintain sufficient energy reserves over periods long enough for delayed benefits to be revealed. While individuals in dominant species seem best placed to develop such reserves, dominance promotes population growth, and so increased competition between individuals, which will tend to erode surplus.
In complex ecosystems, it may be that certain factors limit population growth of a species while others preserve a surplus of resources on which they depend in environmental niches. Also, if organisms are sufficiently adaptive that their population may disperse to other environments, intraspecies competition may be diluted. Whatever the means, genes for increasingly playful and adventurous behavior are only likely to have evolved if the returns on related 'research and development' exceeded the opportunity costs of not investing in more direct need-satisfying activities.
That such behavior tends only to be exhibited by animals in the absence of threats to fitness (e.g., 
Burghardt, 2005;
Dawkins, 2006)
 seems to confirm its fitness-enhancing potential is served by motivations relating to less urgent needs: e.g., better preparing animals for future threats and opportunities 
(Held & Spinka, 2011)
. That such activity is not usually associated with organisms lacking intelligence, and seemingly becomes more frequent and pronounced with higher intelligence, suggests its fitness-enhancing potential is a function of intelligence. This fits with the case made for a link between playfulness and creativity, and between propensities for these and fitness (Bateson, 2014).
We humans are not alone in our capacity for playful and adventurous activity. Other apes 
(Pellegrini et al., 2007)
, dolphins 
(Kuczaj & Eskelinen, 2014)
, dogs (Bekoff, 2015), and octopi 
(Zylinski, 2015)
 exhibit similar behaviors. Most usually these are associated with vertebrates with brains large enough to support complex cognitive abilities 
(Graham & Burghardt, 2010;
Zylinski, 2015)
. For individual organisms, experimentation through playful and adventurous activity replicates the research and development function that mutation and natural selection performs for genomes, but within a single generation. If its purpose is to guide future action with reference to an internal reference model of an organism's environment, as with consciousness 
(Kotchoubey, 2018)
, it must be supported by memory and intelligence. Because, playful activity leaves no trace in the fossil record, and even simple organisms can build and update an internal model of their environment to aid decision-making (e.g., 
Wright, et al., 2023)
, it is difficult to determine exactly when internalised motivations for playfulness, adventurousness, and creativity emerged.
For the learnings of playful or adventurous experimentation to survive the death of the experimenting organism, they must be communicated to others and stored for onward transmission.
At what stage of evolution this became possible is also difficult to ascertain. Evidence suggests intelligent organisms such as dolphins learn to use tools 
(Krutzen et al., 2005)
, whales adapt their calls 
(Zandberg et al., 2021)
, rats adopt new feeding behaviors 
(Heyes & Galef, 1996)
, and blue tits learn new foraging techniques, such as pecking through foil milk bottle tops 
(Hinde & Fisher, 1951)
 by cultural transmission. The creativity that spawns such behavior relates to innovative problem solving, which is thought to be an evolved adaptation to deal with environmental variation 
(Griffin, 2016)
. 
Lefebvre (2013)
 reports that a domain general intelligence appears to promote innovativeness across species, and suggests that, while many factors including brain size relative to body size and the size of certain areas of the brain correlate positively with innovativeness and tool use, there are many other unidentified factors at work. However, if the creative intelligence of birds and mammals emerged in a shared ancestor, it would suggest a motivation for change within organisms began sometime after 120 million years ago (e.g., 
Dawkins, 2005;
Brusatte et al., 2015)
.


Motivations for progressive cooperation
Other animals' capabilities to explore, discover, and instigate change pale against those of humanity.
Equipped with brains capable of more sophisticated information storage (memory), processing (intelligence), and communication (language), humanity has a unique capacity to instigate change.
The human brain is a CAS that has evolved to become capable of modelling, and feeding back to affect, not only the somatic system of which it is part and its immediate environment, but, increasingly, the universal system beyond 
(Simon, 1995)
. No other organism has exhibited comparable capacities for innovation and technological advancement or knowledge of the universe.
Deutsche (2011, p.59) describes humans as universal constructors: "factories for transforming anything into anything". In creating a virtual representation of the sometimes-chaotic behavior of its environment, rather than evolving only in response to involuntary physical interactions, human consciousness has enabled us to initiate reliable virtual interactions in our heads. Abilities to visualise and distinguish between the characteristics of things, and base physical experiments on thought experiments, enable us to solve problems and innovate more efficiently. So efficiently, humanity effectively self-directs its own evolution in relation to an increasingly accurate internal model of the universal system of which it is part.
A key factor in humanity's comparatively rapid evolution from the emergence of homo sapiens a few hundred thousands of years ago appears to be our ability to cooperate 
(Fuentes, 2004)
. While cooperation is common in the animal kingdom, our capacity for it is unique 
(Melis & Semmann, 2010)
. Through international trade, the sharing of scientific knowledge, and multinational cultural and sporting organizations, we cooperate with peoples with whom we share no intimate connection, and devote time and money to those we perceive to be in situations less fortunate than ourselves.
An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) Symbiotic cooperative relations are common in nature, but these are explicable in terms of genetic co-evolution in exactly the same way as parasitically competitive relationships are .
The genes of ants and aphids have evolved in harmony with each other because of the benefits of inter-species cooperation . By contrast, the genes of British cuckoos and the parasitic fungus ophiocordyceps unilateralis have evolved to exploit the resources of the external systems of other birds 
(Glue & Morgan, 1972)
 and ants 
(Lu, 2019)
 respectively. Such competitive strategies are only sustainable when co-evolution constrains exploitation to avoid resource depletion 
(Papkou et al., 2016)
. The preparedness of humans to help other species is not confined to those we wish to raise for food or clothing. We gain pleasure and satisfaction from tending to all manner of plants and animals, even those with the potential to harm us. Our willingness to cooperate is driven by motivations that range from the personal gratification gained from keeping a pet to an awareness that we depend upon an ecosystem shared with eight billion other humans and countless other As humanity evolved greater experimental capabilities and developed more reliable and widely framed models of its environment, it would have been better able to innovate and better target its growing research and development budget. The feedback loop involved would have potentiated the type of exponential growth  describes in his law of accelerating returns. The demands and benefits accruing may have brought selection pressure to bear on genes for higher intelligence. Maybe this is reflected in the increases in intelligence reported as the 
Flynn (1987)
 effect.  defines values as beliefs linked inextricably to affect that refer to desirable goals. They serve as standards or criteria that transcend specific actions and situations, ordered by importance to motivate action. They are abstract concepts, not physical things, emotions, or actions.


Evolutionary equivalents of human values
We evaluate the worth of physical things with our values; emotions are aroused by environmental interactions with values, and, broadly speaking, we experience positive emotions when we live in accordance with our values, and negative emotions when they are frustrated . As such they appear to operate according to 
Holland's (1995)
 'if-then' programming: if positive emotions are aroused, approach; if negative emotions are aroused, avoid. This represents a complex aggregation of the binary 'perceptions' and actions of individual electrons described earlier 
3
 .
While other values models exist, the  system is the most widely adopted in psychological research. Its structure and values appear near universal and largely stable 
Sagiv & Schwartz, 2022)
. It has been used to reveal, for example, systematic influences on consumer behavior 
(Shaw et al., 2005)
, political choices 
(Caprara et al., 2006)
, and leadership style 
(Copeland, 2014)
, and systematic effects of upbringing 
(Griffiths et al., 2021)
, peer relations 
(Benish-Weisman et al., 2022)
, and migration 
(Lonngvist et al., 2011)
. It has also been found to be the best predictor of prosocial behavior, mental health, and pro-environmental behavior 
(Hanel et al., 2018)
.
However, as with any construct explored by self-reports, the detail capable of being revealed is subject to many human limitations (e.g., 
Garcia & Gustavson, 1997;
McDonald, 2008)
: not least of which is matching words and interpretations thereof to consciously inaccessible neurological mechanisms. Therefore, while the evidence suggests the  system of values broadly represents the human motivational system, it may be a low-resolution representation: more reliable in revealing its general structure than the detailed relationships between highly localised elements.
Accordingly, it is in this light that the broad correspondence we suggest between evolutionary expectations relating to the UMM and Schwartz's 10 values should be viewed.
The Schwartz model includes 56 to 58 universally accepted values, such as honesty, curiosity, and ambition, grouped under the 10 value headings shown in figs. 1 and 5. Correlations between the ranked importance and influences exerted by these values allows them to be mapped with respect to each other and two orthogonal axes representing their affinities with change: conservation to openness to change, and strategic purpose of change: self-enhancement to self-transcendence .
Values adjacent to each other tend to serve similar needs and promote similar behaviors, whereas opposing values tend to correlate negatively, both in the behaviors they promote and how they are prioritized by individuals 
(Bardi & Schwartz, 2003;
. Differences in the prioritization and relative importance individuals attach to values characterise them as individuals: influencing beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, and shaping personalities (e.g., 
Bardi & Schwartz, 2003;
Dobewall et al, 2014;
Griffiths et al, 2021
).   Research Form 
(Stumpf et al., 1985)
, concluding the    In 
fig. 5
 we allocate values to the four phases of evolution previously described in relation to the quadrants of the UMM shown in 
fig. 4
. Just as the values of the  system are arbitrary divisions of a motivational continuum, the phase boundaries are arbitrary divisions of an evolutionary continuum. Of greater importance is the progressive nature of the strategies that may be associated with the hierarchical sequencing of values.
In reading the following it should be borne in mind that, just as evolution proceeds by carrying forward and building upon what went before, the emergence of successive values (or equivalents thereof) should be considered an additive process. Therefore, while opposing values in the circular structure of Schwartz's system may correlate negatively in the behaviors and attitudes they promote, this is because 'higher' values promote alternatives, not necessarily replacements. For example, the desire for and practise of sex in an established relationship may be considered universal 'traditions', but sex outside such is more likely to arise in those with dominant permissive (openness to change) values than those with dominant conservative values 
(Lawson, 1988
).


An evolutionary hierarchy of human values or their equivalents Phase 1 -Cooperation/Conservation
The personal value of benevolence facilitates in-group cooperation through, for example, honesty, forgiveness, and helpfulness. The term in-group is used to define the local systems of greatest importance to an individual: their family, friends, or tribe. All stable physical systems, from atoms upwards, are 'honest' in that they have no ability to conditionally manipulate the gravitational and electromagnetic information they broadcast, 'forgiving' in that they respond only to current actions of components, and 'helpful' in that components accommodate each other in maintaining equilibrium. As a facilitator of cooperation, an equivalent of benevolence may be inferred in all stable systems.
The values of tradition and conformity facilitate the replication and continuity of beliefs and behaviors across time (particularly between generations) and space (particularly between individuals An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) and groups in a single current generation) respectively, so maintaining stability. Stable physical systems such as hydrogen and helium atoms have persisted in the same form for 13.8 billion years, and those in one location are indistinguishable from those in another. The traditions of organisms are primarily carried forward in their genes and passed on through meiosis (the formation of a zygote from gametes). In mitosis and cell division the copying of identical DNA to daughter cells ensures genetic conformity throughout the system of an organism. Reproduction encourages the proliferation of genes that conform to the fittest, most stable specifications in any given environment. Broad conformity of traits is evident among all animals belonging to the same species, and most clearly exemplified by the flocking behavior of bacteria, birds, fish, and wildebeest 
(Toner et al., 2005)
.
The value of security includes such components as cleanliness, family security, and national security.
These regulate change in relation to localised boundaries in the interests of safety and stability. The atomic systems of elements regulate the behavior of their components in relation to the prescriptive energy levels and capacities of electron orbitals 
(Bohr, 1913)
. Organisms have mechanisms that regulate change internally (e.g., metabolisms and immune systems) in relation to boundaries (e.g., cells and organs), and externally (e.g., nests and protected territories).


Phase 2 -Conservation/Competition
The power value relates to desires for status, influence, and control. All things passively exert power through the gravitational or electromagnetic fields surrounding them. However, evolution promotes physical and behavioral characteristics that serve to actively increase or protect the influence and control organisms have over their environment. These might include anything that enables them to evade detection, mislead, escape, overpower, impress, or attract. These attributes are aimed at conserving or improving survival and reproductive opportunities in competitive environments, thereby enhancing an organism's ability to satisfy goals associated with conservative motivations.


An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)
The achievement value relates to the pursuit and advertisement of success in relation to widely accepted standards. For genes and organisms, natural selection effectively sets these standards, favoring: genes that promote success in survival and reproduction; fitness indicators that advertise such capabilities; and capabilities to recognise, distinguish between, and act upon reliable indicators in others. By demonstrating such capabilities, and having them recognised and recorded, organisms may be spared effortful and risky conflict. Zahavi's handicap principle (see 
Grafen, 1990)
 explains the evolution of costly displays such as the Peacock's tail in terms of their ability to honestly demonstrate the fitness of their owner, since they are too costly for less fit organisms to bear. To give an equivalent behavioral example, once a male chimpanzee has demonstrated his dominance he may then be spared constant challenges from others 
(Waal, 1986)
. However, such mechanisms can be subverted. Organisms may evolve characteristics that falsely advertise qualities they do not possess, whether to deter or attract others (e.g., 
Bond & Robinson, 1988)
, so giving rise to an evolutionary arms race between genes for improved detection and discrimination and genes for better deception.


Phase 3 -Competition/Change
Hedonism promotes behavior that is fun, playful, and pleasureable in its own right. Behavior not directed at satisfying basic survival or reproductive needs may be less linear and more experimental. Accordingly, it offers greater potential for generating learning opportunities. Stimulation more directly promotes learning through a greater prepareness to take risks in the pursuit of variety and novelty.
Just as mutation and natural selection effectively enable successive generations of organisms to innovate, hedonism and stimulation potentiate this within the lifetime of an organism. Once innovations and learnings can be culturally transmitted to others, the effects may trickle down to better satisfy the goals associated with equivalents of 'lower' values; spreading through a population and down through generations to eventually replace long standing behavioral traditions. In stable An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) organism-environment systems, selection pressure may come to bear on enabling genes, so updating 'traditional' gene combinations as well as culturally inherited traits.


Phase 4 -Change/Cooperation
Self-direction promotes independent thought and action, curiosity and creativity. As such, it facilitates a more targeted approach to experimentation and learning, and the pursuit of discoveries that facilitate more effective courses of action. Universalism promotes a desire for wisdom, developing a greater understanding and affinity with nature, with concerns for the environment, social justice, and equality. Self-direction and universalism feed each other, potentiating greater selfreliance, inner harmony, an appreciation of one's place in the universe, and so an understanding of the virtues of cooperation. A likely consequence of this being a motivation for less constrained forms of benevolence.
In line with the previously described relationship between progressive and cooperative motivation and intelligence and knowledge, these values seem to have the greatest potential to promote better decision-making. The greater efficiency so potentiated should create trickle down benefits for satisfying the goals associated with lower values: more opportunities to learn and have fun, less need to devote energy to proving oneself, or asserting ones influence or control over others, and less need to cling to and protect what one already has.


Experimental evidence
Given their role in decision-making and how we suggest they evolved, it seems likely that values exert hierarchical influences to complement the known circular influences, and not just in relation to values laden propositions. To explore this, we tested a large group of individuals with a range of decision-making tasks, including Kahneman and Tversky type propositions intended to explore values-related heuristic biases, Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM;  and a 
Guilford et al.'s (1978)
 Alternative Uses Test (GAUT) of creativity. The size of the correlations between the relative importance given to individual values and performance in these tests underplays their influence. Because values operate as components of a system, even small, statistically insignificant differences in single value prioritization can promote large differences in the decision-making of differently motivated people. For example, when 1316 participants were divided into five motivational types 
4
 , those allocated to a group for whom hedonism and stimulation were the most important values were more than twice as likely to risk a £100 loss for a potential £200 win on the toss of a coin than those belonging to a group for whom the conservation values were the most important (40% compared to 18%), despite no single value accounting for more than 4% of the variance (see 
fig. SM7
). In respect of another challenge, concerning the allocation of healthcare budget, the largest single value/response correlation was responsible for little more than 0.5% of the variation in responses but contributed to a significant 28% difference in the average choices of two motivational types (see 
fig. SM8
).

Other supportive evidence
If good quality, independent decision-making promotes happiness, as would appear to be the case 
(Benz & Frey, 2004;
Chuang, 2007;
Kurtz, 2007)
, one might anticipate that nations in which the higher values of self-direction, universalism, and benevolence are more important would be among the happiest. Conversely, those in which conservative values are more important should be among the least happy. Comparison of the World Values Survey (WVS, 2023) 5 and the World Happiness Report (WHR, 2021) 6 supports this conjecture. Those nations having the most selfexpressive/secular-rational values -which correspond with self-direction and universalism values  -are found to rank amongst the happiest in the WHR: Sweden 7th, Norway 5th, Denmark 2nd, Finland 1st, and the Netherlands 6 th , whereas those with the most survival/traditional values ranked among the least happy: Jordan 119th (of 153), Yemen 146th, Zimbabwe 151st, Morocco 97th, and Ghana 91st.

Consistent findings also emerge from comparison of  values with  Hierarchy of Needs, and research carried out in relation to the latter. As shown in the supplementary materials (see 
fig.SM1
 and accompanying review), the values attributed by   Research supportive of Maslow's hierarchy (e.g., , when viewed through the lens of Schwartz's values, is perhaps supportive of the evolutionary theory of values advanced here. However, the lack of any widely accepted, valid, and reliable means of measuring Maslow's hierarchy of needs 
(Lester, 2013)
 makes it likely that An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) much of this could be lost in translation. More promising is the support provided by research into the effects of transformational leadership 
(Bass, 1985)
. This is a well-established leadership model based on  eupsychian management (management according to self-actualizing principles) 
(Burns, 2004)
. Transformational leadership has shown to be beneficial in many areas, including: engagement and preparedness to change

, team effectiveness 
(Özaralli, 2003)
, individual and team performance and helping behavior

, organizational performance, learning, and innovation (Para-González, 2018), improving organizational knowledge and related decision-making , and effective, satisfying, and effort-evoking leadership and parenting 
(Zacharatos et al., 2000)
.


Conclusion
The coincidence of experimental and other evidence consistent with there being a linear, hierarchical structure to human values that complements the known circular structure lends plausibility to our evolutionary theory of values. That this is predicted by no other theory we are aware of suggests it is worthy of further investigation.
It is suggested that any evolutionary theory should address 
Tinbergen's (1963)
 four questions relating to function (why), evolution (how), causation (what), and development (how). The function of values is to guide decision-making toward the satisfaction of needs ). As we have explained, all needs can be derived from the universal need for systems to move toward equilbrium in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. All decision-making mechanisms can be traced back to the binary 'choices' of atoms of whether to absorb and emit photons or not. The mechanism by which they operate has evolved through layers of increasing complexity such that values-based decisions represent aggregates of countless layers of these binary 'decisions': from those of atomic electrons to those of neurons. Equivalents of values-based decision-making have evolved through countless phase transitions in increasingly complex CAS and their constituents in An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) terms that can be related to the UMM. The dynamic relationship between cooperation, competition and change captured by the UMM, and reflected in the structure of  system, plays out at every emergent level of complexity.
Given the radical nature of this theory and its relevance to the evolution of all systems, its implications and applications are too numerous to discuss here. Other than those related to psychology, and through psychology to all human systems, it offers an opportunity to consider the evolution of other systems in relateable human terms. A summary of suggested areas of interest is provided in the supplementrary materials, along with the perspective it offers on established psychological theory, including personality theories other than the Big Five. Here we will confine ourselves to addressing the aspirations and concerns of 
Block (2010)
 mentioned at the beginning of this paper: those relating to the five factor model and the state of personality science.
We have argued that the structure of a UMM equivalent to that of Schwartz's system is comprehensive, universal, and inescapable, in that all systemic interactions cannot escape being considered in terms of their propensity to change, and the degrees of cooperation and competition between their components. It therefore fulfils the requirement of an adaptive paradigm capable of generating sufficient surface complexity from great simplicity.
Our research into the effects of upbringing on the personalities of only-children when compared to those on siblings 
(Griffiths et al., 2021)
 found significant effects on power and benevolence values consistent with the popular stereotype that has only-children as being more selfish. Previous research based on traits had concluded that either there was no such effect 
(Polit and Falbo, 1987)
, or any effect was too small to be noticeable 
(Stronge, et al., 2019
). An explanation for this, which may relate to many aspects of personality, is that the same value priorities may find expression in different behavioral traits in different environments. For example, an individual motivated most by power may be motivated to behave in any way they consider likely to maintain or increase their influence in the environment in which they find themselves. If this involves influencing perceived An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) superiors and others whose goodwill they wish to exploit, this may involve ingratiating, agreeable behavior. In other environments, involving others whose goodwill is considered unimportant, they may prefer dismissive, bullying, or other disagreeable behavior. Given that people who know each other well can read the values of others reliably 
(Dobewall et al.,, 2014)
, an individual showing such context dependent duality of personality is likely to be identifiable as being relatively strong on power motivation and relatively low on benevolence. Conversely, given value priorities are considered trans-situationally stable , an individual considered broadly agreeable or disagreeable seems less likely to become fundamentally more or less motivated by self-enhancing or self-transcending values in different environments.
The relationship between values and traits is complex, because both are rooted in genes 
(Schermer, et al., 2011)
 and are similarly stable, and subject to environmental change (see review in . Also, while values motivate action (and therefore behavioral traits), consequent behavior changes the environment to which values must adapt. So while they may influence each other 
2019)
, the basic principles of physics tell us that motivation precedes action, with the former arising from, and the latter proceeding in accordance with, the second law of thermodynamics. The behavioral traits of physical systems are particular to circumstantial interactions between proximate systems. They include radioactive emission, bursting into flame, and flight: none of which are easily reconciled with the personalty traits of humans. Yet all arise from competition between systems arising from energetic disequilbrium. Accordingly, at the very least, it seems rational to reconsider the relative roles of values (and their UMM equivalents and precursors) and traits in shaping personality.  


Introduction
The following information provides further background and expands upon the information provided in the main paper: An Evolutionary Theory of Values (EToV). In reading the following it should be borne in mind we are not suggesting perfect congruence between the UMM and Schwartz's model.
The structure of the UMM is theoretically ideal. That its orthogonal axes correspond with those of the Schwartz system justifies our comparison of the two. However, the Schwartz system, particularly its detailed structure, is not theoretically ideal because it is derived from self-reports (e.g., 
Baumeister et al., 2007;
Garcia & Gustavson, 1997)
.
Apart from issues regarding the construction of self-report questionnaires, the reliability of individual responses and interpretations thereof are subject to human error. In the following we will An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) identify potential issues relating to the measurement of self-direction and universalism, and the lack of allowance for systematic interactions between values in correlation studies. This is not to suggest we believe the Schwartz model is not fit for purpose. The number and quality of studies confirming its validity (see 
Schwartz, 2012)
 suggest it is 'good enough' for the purposes of exploring broad structural correspondence with the UMM, and broad sequential relationships between the emergence of evolutionary strategies and values. Accordingly, in these supplementary materials we have been sparing in our use of citations concerning correspondence between Schwartz's values and other models. We have used them illustratively, rather than relying on them, because the proposed structure of the UMM is independently justifiable.
Also, our research to date does not allow us to separate the influence of values from their UMM equivalents. If values operate consciously, pre-consciously, and unconsciously, it is likely the underlying neurological mechanisms are shared with deeper motivations related to the UMM.
Therefore, when we discuss the influence of values on mental health in SM4, it should be borne in mind that when considering yet to be explored relationships it would be better to infer no clear distinctions between values and unconscious UMM equivalents.


SM1 Selected core principles relevant to the evolution of the universe
(1) Quantum uncertainty. The fundamental constituents of all energy, and therefore of all matter and organisms, can be considered in terms of quantum particles (for overview see 
Peskin & Schroeder, 1995)
 that observe   prescriptive energy levels particular to each element, the configuration of which determines the chemical characteristics of each element: i.e., how they relate to and interact with one another (for summary see 
Bertsch et al., 2023)
.
(3) Gravitational and electromagnetic fields 7 effectively connect all sub-systems of the universe. They imbue them with potential energy: i.e., a motive for change. Gravitation exerts a relatively weak attractive force between massive objects. Electromagnetic attraction (between oppositely charged particles) and repulsion (between like charged particles) exerts a vastly greater force. However, repulsive and attractive forces tend to cancel each other out over large distances due to the likely proximity of differently charged particles. Hence electromagnetism tends to exert the greatest influence over proximate systems such as the nervous systems of organisms, whereas gravity is the dominant influence shaping the greater physical environments organisms inhabit. The influence of both declines in proportion to the square of the distance from their source. Nevertheless, due to the infinite reach of these fields, all things contribute to the environment of all other things, and therefore sub-systems evolve with respect to each other and the larger systems of which they are part (see 
Gupta, 1954
).
(4) The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be destroyed nor gained in a closed system, i.e., one isolated from all others such that no energy may flow in or out. The universe is a closed system. Therefore, any energy lost from or gained by its local subsystems (such as atoms, molecules, genes, organisms, and ecosystems) must be compensated by gains to or losses from their environment (i.e., the other sub-systems of the universe). The relevance of this to the evolution of systems, and therefore to natural selection, is that all costs and benefits experienced by or attributed to a local system are balanced out across the universal system. More colloquially, 'there's no such thing as a free lunch' (see 
Iwase, 2014)
. 
5
The second law of thermodynamics states that in a closed system 8 entropy (disorder) tends to increase. Energy flows from hot to cold, high concentrations to low, until equilibrium is reached. This is related to the minimum total potential energy principle, which states that local systems tend to deform until the potential energy of their components has been minimized. During the process of deformation (or reconfiguration) excess energy is lost from the system in the form of heat. Chemicals reactions are only potentiated when they lead to an increase in entropy. Mostly this arises when combinations of atoms and molecules deform into more energy-efficient configurations, giving off heat in the process (exothermic reactions). However, some reactions may be initiated by heating, such that highly localised, less energy-efficient configurations can be sustained by the absorption of energy (endothermic reactions). In such reactions, increases in the entropy of the external systems providing the heat exceed the decrease in the entropy of the local system of reactants. The second law also finds equivalence in the principle of least action, which dictates that particles and systems minimize their total potential energy by following the most energyefficient paths. This explains why objects are drawn directly down toward the earth's centre of gravity, light is deflected (refracted) when passing between media with different densities (e.g., water and air), and projectiles follow a parabolic path determined by balancing the downward force of gravity and their horizontal momentum. The second law is the principal motivation for change in any system (see 
Iwase, 2014)
. 
(6)
 Energy transfer between systems is facilitated by photons. Photons are indivisible quanta of energy, each with a specific energy level. As systems deform to minimise their total potential energy, photons are emitted as electrons move to more energy-efficient configurations. As electrons may only occupy atomic orbitals with prescriptive energy levels characteristic of each element, emitted photons have energy levels equal to the energy gaps between orbitals. The wavelengths of the lines in the emission spectra of elements correspond to the gaps between these orbitals. Correspondingly, electrons may only absorb photons if their energy levels match gaps between permitted orbitals. This gives rise to the reciprocal pattern of dark lines in the absorption spectra of elements. Photons with energies that fail to correspond with orbital energy gaps are not absorbed (see 
Podgoršak, 2014)
. This effectively means they are not 'perceived'. This is not only analogous to the ways in which humans and other organisms perceive visual information but is a fundamental component of the enabling mechanism: one that facilitates and governs communication between systems. The human eye perceives color across the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum by means of 6-7 million cone cells, each perhaps comprising c.100 trillion atoms (see 
Mustafi at al., 2009;
Spring et al. 2023)
. These cones are just one part of the complex system that processes visual information. The exchanges of photons convey information between atoms. They do so obeying probabilistic quantum mechanical rules related to the uncertainty principle  that prohibit knowing the exact direction and locations they will be emitted and absorbed. This and the incalculable number of atoms involved are important factors contributing to the intractable complexity of the interactions that underpin both how humans process information and, more generally, how evolution proceeds.
An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) (7) Evolution by natural selection proceeds in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics 
(Sabater, 2006)
. Organisms best adapted to their environment -i.e., those with characteristics most advantageous to survival and reproduction -i.e., those able to absorb, process, and invest energy most efficiently toward the satisfaction of their needswill tend to outcompete other organisms seeking to exploit the same resources. The most successful organisms will tend to pass more copies of their genes onto successive generations than others . The fitness of organisms is a function of both genes and environment. The fitness of genetically identical organisms depends on how well adapted to their respective environments they are. No two particles, atoms, or molecules, let alone organisms, may share the same space at the same time, even in otherwise 'shared'
environments. This alone ensures some variation upon which natural selection may act.
Directly imposed genetic variation comes from the mutation of genes. Whether by routine copying errors in DNA replication, or as a consequence of bombardment from high energy photons in their environment, the molecular structure of an organism's DNA is changed such that different chemical instructions are issued and acted upon. These may cause genes to become more or less well adapted to the environments of their genomes, and host organisms to become more or less well adapted to the environmental systems of which they are part ).  
Wininger & Norman, 2007)
. In common with all organisms, failure to satisfy physiological needs brings death. A failure to satisfy needs for safety and belonging brings greater risk of harm or death 
(Olcoń et al., 2017;
Van Orden et al., 2010)
, with attendant adverse effects on physiological and psychological well-being 
(Cacioppo et al., 2015;
Loades, et al., 2020;
Rohde et al. 2016)
, including self-esteem 
(Hall-Lande et al., 2007)
. Logically, given fixed resources of time and energy, the more a person invests in gaining the esteem of others, the less will be available for self-actualization. This fits with findings that children with unstable self-esteem exhibit less curiosity and preference for challenge 
(Waschull & Kernis, 1996)
.
Despite its popularity, the hierarchy has attracted criticism regarding: the generality of its categories and concepts, and associated difficulties of empirically testing its structural relationships 
(Schiffman & Kanuk 1997)
; levels of need appearing to operate independently from others 
(Wahba & Bridwell, 1976)
; and its lack of provision for heroic, altruistic, dominant, abasing, playful, and aggressive behavior 
(Schiffman & Kanuk 1997;
Witt & Wright 1992)
. As others (e.g., 
O'Connor & Yballe, 2007;
Wininger & Norman, 2007)
 have pointed out, some of this criticism has been misplaced. Maslow An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) (1943) explicitly stated that multiple levels of need could be active at any one time. As for its alleged omissions,  listed status and dominance (which would seem to allow for abasement and aggression) as esteem-need-related values, and playfulness and goodness as self-actualizing values. Self-transcendence is a broad term that would seem to cover heroism and altruism.
Desmet and Fokkinga (2020) believe subsequent research has shown Maslow's theory to have been correct insofar as: human needs are inborn and universal; a broad set of behaviors can be explained by relatively few needs; needs are responsible for motivating behavior; and their satisfaction contributes to well-being

Linking Maslow's needs to Schwartz's values
The terms needs and values were used interchangeably by 
Maslow (e.g., 1968, p. 153)
, and taken to mean goals people strive to achieve, which, if frustrated, diminish well-being. While he considered values a term so broad that, without tighter definition, it would likely become obsolete, he expressed the belief that values were an intrinsic, structural component of human nature that were genetically as well as culturally derived 
(Maslow, 1968, p. 167)
. 
Rokeach (1973)
 and  went on to provide the required definition and, using the latter's system, values have since been shown to be heritable 
(Twito & Knafo-Noam, 2020;
Zacharopoulos et al., 2016)
.
Associations between Schwartz's values and Maslow's needs have previously been made (e.g., 
Bilsky & Schwartz, 1994;
Gau & James, 2003;
Kluger et al. 2004
). Schwartz (2012) categorises achievement, An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) power, security, conformity, and tradition values as being prevention of loss (deficiency) orientated (i.e., associated with needs below self-actualization), and benevolence, universalism, self-direction, stimulation, and hedonism as growth values (i.e., associated with self-actualizing needs). However, comparisons tend to fall short of claiming a comprehensive overlap, perhaps because of difficulties in reconciling the circularity of the Schwartz system and the linearity of Maslow's hierarchy.
Nevertheless, when the terminology used in each is compared, (see 
fig. SM2
) sequential correspondence is readily apparent. Maslow links mastery to achievement and esteem related needs. While Schwartz (2012) associates mastery with self-direction, there is no explicit mention of mastery in the PVQ-40 
(Schwartz et al., 2001
) we used in our research. Perhaps the two descriptions used to assess the importance of selfdirection that most closely relate to it are: 'they like to be curious and to try to understand all sorts of things' and 'they like to rely on themselves'. A desire to become self-reliant and understand many things may be sympathetic to gaining some level of mastery, however, the concepts are not inextricably linked. A similar case could be made for linking the descriptions used to evaluate the importance of achievement, i.e.: 'they want to show how capable they are'; 'they strive to do better than others'; 'being very successful is important to them'; 'they like to impress other people'; 'it is very important to them to show their abilities' and 'they want people to admire what they do'. If the purpose of mastery is to please oneself without reference to others or external benchmarks, or to enable one to complete a task for the same reason, then it relates more to self-direction than achievement. However, if the gratification comes from demonstrating one's capabilities such that others may be impressed, then it better relates to achievement. A third interpretation of mastery is 'control or superiority over someone or something' (Oxford Dictionaries, 2023), which directly relates to power values.
Aside from such quibbles, broad alignment between the two models is apparent. Considering this in the context of the argument presented in the main paper, we are drawn to believe Maslow was prescient in devising his hierarchy. Despite a lack of clarity concerning the precise nature of its operation and how its needs could be assessed, its correspondence with the Schwartz system, especially our hierarchical interpretation of it, suggests it provides a useful description of the human motivational system. By using well established methodology relating to the measurement of Schwartz's values and interpreting findings in accordance with the methodology described in Self-actualization was removed from atop of the pyramid because they considered that "although self-actualization may be of considerable psychological importance, it is unlikely to be a functionally distinct human need" 
(Kenrick et al., 2010, p. 293)
. If they are correct in believing Maslow justified the placement of self-actualization on the grounds that it was a functionally distinct human need detached from biological needs, we can agree he was wrong to do so. It is a truism to say no genetic disposition can be separated from its biological root. Also, based on the alignment between Schwartz's self-direction values and Maslow's self-actualization needs, it is apparent that dolphins and chimpanzees are among the intelligent organisms capable of exhibiting self-directing aspects of self-actualization 
(Morrison & Reiss, 2018)
. However, neither of these reasons justifies its removal.
While all organisms have some capacity for autonomous action -i.e., their dynamism is not simply reliant on linear reactions to external motivating forces -it is apparent a capacity for self-direction (as well as for generating and referencing reliable models of their environment) increases with intelligence (e.g., 
McFarland et al., 1993)
 and is uniquely expressed in humans.
Their suggestion that self-actualization is subsumed within status/esteem related needs appears to arise from a conflagration of distinct aspects of mastery and learning. As they point out, high status is useful because "it is much more efficient to learn by modeling the behaviors of successful others than by using trial and error 
(Boyd & Richerson, 1985;
Henrich & Boyd, 1998)
, so people are willing to defer to, and perform favors for, others who have acquired skills" 
(Kenrick et al., 2010, p. 297)
.
Indeed, the motivation for replicating successful strategies and behaviors replicates the function of natural selection, which we consider to be functionally equivalent to the motivation provided by the value of achievement. However, this form of mastery is limited to replicating what already exists. Therefore, while it may serve a progressive function in raising the average performance/fitness of a population, it does little to drive progress by innovation. Without the introduction of novel components and combinations thereof systems tend to evolve toward equilibrium and stasis .
The type of mastery they describe as being non-specific to status or esteem is that related to curiosity and play. They refer to 
Deci and Ryan's (2000, p. 252)
 linkage of these to a domain-general need ''to engage optimal challenges and experience mastery or effectance in the physical and social worlds'' as a problem-solving mechanism. We agree that curiosity and play, motivated by the values of hedonism, stimulation, and self-direction, serve problem-solving functions. However, unlike mastering an already established practise, play and curiosity are more concerned with selfexpression and self-directed discovery. They may lead to the discovery of behaviors and knowledge that one goes on to master, which may then serve as markers of achievement and status, but the initial motivation cannot be for mastery: mastery of something unknown? Self-direction and universalism in their promotion of curiosity, independent thought and action, and a desire to understand a broad range of things encourage mastery in a more general sense. By encouraging innovative thinking, they may push individuals into levels of understanding that make them more capable than those driven to achieve on more constrained terms. If so, they will have achieved higher levels of mastery, albeit they are more likely to realize that complete mastery is an unrealizable goal, in that their state of knowledge can always be improved upon. In common with all motivations, the ultimate 'problem' to be 'solved' is how to best satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. The hierarchical structure of evolving values we present simply represents an increasingly efficient suite of strategies for doing so.


An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)
They suggest that self-actualization, like complex psychological phenomena such as religion and morality, may not serve specific fitness-relevant functions, and may be by-products or nonadaptive effects of other psychological mechanisms. We describe in the main paper the fitness-relevant function of self-actualization through the values of self-direction and universalism, however, it is perhaps worth addressing their treatment of religion and morality, since these would appear similarly rooted in values-based motivation.
Religion provides explanations for why things are as they are. For example: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And God said, 'Let there be light' and there was light." (Genesis 1:1-3). It also offers related guidance as to how one should go about one's life. The ten commandments of the Christian Bible being an example. In this respect it is little different to science. For religious believers and scientists alike, religion and science offer the most appealing explanations for why things are as they are and provide the most compelling guidance for how to proceed. What separates religious believers from others is their lower preparedness to change/adapt to new information. Humans and other organisms are prone to habit forming because it is generally more efficient to automatically repeat established patterns of behavior than to effortfully select and replicate them, or invest energy in inventing new ones 
(Neal et al, 2006;
Smith & Graybiel, 2016)
. This makes us susceptible to carrying forward pre-existing beliefs and behaviors when novel alternatives would be objectively superior. We may do so because we are not aware of alternatives or because we are not otherwise motivated to change. Both are encouraged by conservative values: lack of awareness being more likely if one's motivations oppose change-promoting, self-directed curiosity, and stimulation related adventurousness.
In accordance with  law of accelerating returns, the rate of technological and scientific advancement was several orders of magnitude slower at the time when most of the world's major religions were first established. Therefore, the fitness-related costs of failing to adopt new ideas and practices in those times were relatively very small. Having taken hold, these beliefs and related practices serve purposes related to Maslow's belonging and safety needs. The conservative values of tradition, conformity, and security relate to these basic psychological needs.
They serve to bind people together in cooperative social groups. From the perspective of group members, new ideas and practices, and those propounding and practising them, may represent potentially destabilizing competition. This may encourage greater resources being devoted to protecting and reinforcing the boundaries and practices of their religions. This has the potential to isolate religious believers from outsiders, so facilitating intellectual stasis and increasing polarization of views with respect to differently and more progressively minded outsiders. 


An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)
As in all dynamically stable systems, the cooperative strategies that, in human terms, correspond with high-morality will tend to dominate in accordance with the evolutionary rationale described in the main paper in relation to the Prisoner's Dilemma. Competitive strategies can only be tolerated if they are subordinated to serve greater cooperative interests, or if the parasitism they promote is constrained so as not to catastrophically deplete the resources of the cooperative systems on which they prey. Consequently, as with a genetic predisposition for parasitism in certain organisms, the motivation for immoral behavior associated with the competitive values of power and achievement can be tolerated insofar as it does not catastrophically undermine the cooperative integrity of society or the functioning of an individual.
The other changes to the hierarchy proposed by 
Kenrick et al. (2010)
 involve the renaming of safety with self-protection, affection and belonging with affiliation, and the introduction of mate acquisition, mate retention, and parenting related needs above status/esteem related needs. The renaming is of little consequence but fails to address Maslow's misconception that safety (stability) is a function of cooperation (benevolence, including love), not the other way around. They justify the introduction of new needs with reference to life-history theory. This is not the place to conduct a review of this, nor attempt to contextualise the role of parenting within it. However, our observation would be that motives for mate-acquisition, mate-retention, and parenting are covered by the conservation half of the UMM, and so can be related to existing levels of need in Maslow's hierarchy. As described in the main paper, most sexually reproducing organisms rely on mechanisms related to the equivalent of power and achievement motivations to attract mates. These are rooted in genetic mechanisms that seek to maximise cooperative efficiency, albeit that these are susceptible to corruption 
(Miller, 2000)
. Mate retention (whether temporary or monogamous) represents a higher, more complex manifestation of the basic cooperation between two related genomes, but is not restricted to humanity, or even highly intelligent organisms (e.g., 
Mock & Fujioka, 1990;
Whiteman & Côté, 2004)
. Yes, the considerable and extended investment of two parents in human offspring is related to the biological consequences of giving birth to and raising highly intelligent offspring that acquire much of the information they need to flourish from cultural interactions. And yes, this intelligence can be related to values at the top of our hierarchy, i.e., selfdirection, universalism, and benevolence (see SM3). However, in line with the trickle-down relationship we describe in the main paper, all evolutionary adaptations, genetic and cultural, have the potential to become rooted in motivations related to values (or their equivalents) at the base of the hierarchy, i.e., tradition and conformity. Given that co-parenting is a cooperative act, it would seem reasonable to anticipate that individuals motivated most by cooperative values at both ends of the hierarchy of values would be the most likely to commit fully to it, and those motivated by competitive values the least. Also, in terms of the quality of parenting they provide, it would seem reasonable to anticipate that parenting styles consistent with transformational leadership qualities (see 
Zacharatos et al., 2000)
 would have advantages over styles more consistent with transactional leadership. The former leaning more heavily on encouraging independence and creativity through support and challenge (associated with the self-actualizing values of self-direction, universalism, and benevolence); the latter more on command and control, extrinsic reward, and punishment (strategies more aligned with the self-enhancing values of power and achievement).  values model concerns the motivations of individuals. 
Schwartz (2004)
   primarily to the power value. The final dimension of harmony-mastery is described in terms of an opposition between universalism values and mainly achievement values. However, harmony is described as a cultural tendency for fitting into the world rather than changing it, and therefore appears to blend universalism and conservative values.


Cultural and Organizational Values
One description used to measure universalism in the PVQ-40 
(Schwartz et al., 2001
) is worded as follows: 'It is important to them/him/her to adapt to nature and to fit into it. They/he/she believe that people should not change nature'. In our consideration, this is problematic in the context of universalism being a description of motivations for being sympathetic to others, open to the opinions of others, and desirous of accumulating knowledge toward a more complete understanding of people and nature. Scientific progress is reliant on better understanding nature and using what we learn to improve the lives of individuals and society. For example, while genetic engineering and nuclear power may be regarded as interfering with nature, they are replications of naturally occurring processes 
(Mervine, 2011;
Shapiro, 1992)
. One can argue that all technological and scientific progress is reliant on the identification, understanding, and replication of natural mechanisms. While it is suggested the wheel is one of a few uniquely human inventions 
(Gambino, 2009)
, given there are naturally occurring cylindrical objects that roll, such as tree trunks and the stems of plants, and wheels are simply cylinders with comparatively small third dimensions, the invention of the wheel is perhaps an achievement equivalent to Columbus's 'discovery' of the Americas. Therefore, we are of the view that associating universalism with an antipathy to change is inappropriate.
In the context of the PVQ-40, it is possible to interpret the aforementioned descriptive statement as not being obstructive of progress. If one takes the view that all technology changes nature, the statement may appear so extremely demanding that it is better interpreted differently. If one takes the view that it is impossible to change nature, because all human inventions simply exploit what nature has to offer, then the statement similarly requires an alternative interpretation. A possible interpretation would be to consider the proposition as a means to measure how much the respondent cares for the natural world. However, Schwartz's more conservative cultural interpretation of harmony leans heavily toward a radically conservative interpretation.
As it happens, this is not the only problem with this interpretation of universalism. Another statement used to measure the importance of universalism is "They/he/she want everyone to be treated justly, even people they don't know. It is important to them to protect the weak in society."
To agree with these statements and to believe that people should not change nature requires the respondent to believe humanity's capacities for treating others unjustly and exploiting the weak are unnatural. Given that nature (including that relating to humanity) is, as Tennyson poetically An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) observed, 'red in tooth and claw', it is difficult to claim a desire to exploit the weak, rather than protect them, is unnatural. If it is natural, then it would follow that it would be inconsistent with universalism to seek to change this. This inconsistency may not be problematic if respondents don't think too deeply about the implications of the statements. They may simply recognize broad themes that enable them to interpret the statements as being aligned with allegiances for environmentalism and social justice.
While Schwartz's cultural orientations are broadly aligned with his system of personal values, any ambiguity in translation is problematic. This may have contributed to correspondence between the two constructs falling short of isomorphism 
(Fischer et al., 2010)
. Given the apparent universality of the structure of the UMM, it is arguable that Schwartz's cultural orientations would be better reconsidered and mapped in relation to the UMM's orthogonal axes.
The cultural model used in the World Values Survey ( 
fig. 6
 in the main paper) is that of Inglehart-Welzel (WVS, 2020), which maps survival values versus self-expression values on the x-axis and traditional values versus secular-rational values on the y-axis. As stated in the main paper, survival and traditional values correspond with Schwartz's conservation values, and self-expression and secular-rational values with self-direction and universalism . Accordingly, diagonal movement across the map is equivalent to vertical movement up our hierarchy from conservation values to self-transcending values.


Hofstede's (1980) cultural dimensions theory describes cultural values in terms of six dimensions:
power distance, individualism-collectivism, masculinity-femininity, uncertainty avoidance, longterm-short-term, and indulgence-restraint. 
Kaasa (2021)
 was able to demonstrate how these cultural dimensions could be merged with 
Schwartz's (2004)
 orientations. Power distance is like Schwartz's hierarchy-egalitarianism, and so maps with equivalents of power-universalism in value equivalents to the UMM, individualism-collectivism correlates strongly with embeddedness-autonomy 
Dobewall & Strack, 2014)
  The extent to which these different cultural models yield results aligned with expectations raised by our evolutionary theory can currently only be estimated by indirect comparison through Schwartz's personal values. Ambiguity in interpretation, of the type discussed in relation to universalism, and failure to make allowance for the inevitable complexities of measuring the culture of CAS comprising millions of individuals (each of which is a CAS) present considerable difficulties for those seeking confirmation of the coverage we suggest. However, given the impossibility of escaping (or defying being mapped on) the UMM, the UMM must also provide a parsimonious model for mapping cultural values, however they are described.


Personality Traits: The Big Five and HEXACO, The Big Two, and the Big One
It is said that traits describe what people are like, while values describe what people want from life (e.g., 
Parks-Leduc, et al., 2015)
. 
Vecchione et al. (2019, p.414)
 relate the five key differences between them identified by 
Roccas, et al. (2002)
 
Fig. SM4
 NEO-PI-R Five Factor Model 
(Costa & McCrae, 1992)
 of Big Five dimensions and facets supplemented by HEXACO 
(Ashton, et al, 2004)
 dimension of honesty/humility Big Five and HEXACO traits relate to behavioral characteristics: either directly, when the trait is immediately observable, or indirectly, when evaluated or inferred from observed patterns of behavior (e.g., 
Borkenau & Bielefeld, 1995
 McCrae 
& Costa, (1999)
 contend the Big Five traits represent a set of basic tendencies with biological bases upon which dynamic processes give rise to characteristic adaptations, such as (they contend)
values, through interactions with the external environment. Such a perspective is consistent with traits being partially heritable (e.g., 
Plomin, 2018)
, broadly stable 
(Terracciano, et al, 2010)
, subject to change as people grow older 
(Roberts, et al., 2006)
, and responsive to the environmental effects of life events such as leaving the parental home or the death of a spouse 
(Specht, at al, 2011)
.
Values, like traits, are relatively stable (see review in , but may change as an individual's needs, physical state, or environment changes (e.g., 
Bardi et al, 2014;
). For example, as people grow older, openness to change values tend to become less important and conservation values more important 
(Gouveia, et al., 2015)
. Life-events as varied as being exposed to war 
(Daniel et al., 2013)
 or going to university 
(Bardi et al., 2014)
 also affect values.
Rather than simply being characteristic adaptations of underlying traits, shaped by environmental interactions, as suggested by 
McCrae and Costa (1999)
, values, like traits, have been found to be heritable 
(Twito & Knafo-Noam, 2020;
Zacharopoulos et al., 2016)
 and to share a common genetic root with traits 
(Schermer et al., 2011)
.


Known Relationships Between Traits and Values
There are systematic correlations between values and all trait dimensions apart from neuroticism 
(Parks-Leduc, et al. 2015
). These are mirrored in similar terminology: e.g., curiosity, excitementseeking, self-discipline, and achievement-striving (traits), and curiosity, excitement, self-discipline, and achievement (values).
According to 
McCrae and Costa (1999)
, individuals are predisposed to exhibit traits such as curiosity and self-discipline without necessarily considering the corresponding values important. However, individuals tend to exhibit behaviour consistent with their most important values (e.g., 
Bardi & Schwartz, 2003;
Skimina et al., 2018)
.  found that values did not predict traits, but high levels of agreeableness and openness exerted an influence over the development of benevolence and self-direction respectively. However, in a previous study,  found the values of children more predictive of behavior than traits were of values; albeit that a reciprocal relationship between the two seemed to be operating.
As acknowledged by , the interaction of personality traits and values is complex. There are 30 facets underlying the Big Five traits of NEO-PI-R 
(Costa & McCrae, 1992)
   , whereas traits are partially correlated and partially orthogonal 
(De Young et al., 2002)
. The frequency and intensity with which all traits are expressed, and the relative importance attached to each value may be infinitely variable. While some genes affecting personality seem to have been identified (e.g., 
Sanchez-Roige, et al., 2018)
, exactly how genes inform traits or values remains a mystery. Without the ability to identify and measure the genetic, physiological, and neurological processes underlying them, the challenges presented to those seeking to understand how each contributes to personality are considerable.
Personality has been described as 'the dynamic organization within the individual of the psychobiological systems that modulate … adaptations to a changing internal and external environment' 
(Cloninger, 2004, p.374)
. It is invoked to describe consistent differences in behaviour between all animals 
(Wolf & Weissing, 2012)
, even single celled bacteria 
(AMOLF, 2017;
. It is apparent that personality is inferred when categorically similar individuals consistently behave differently in the same environment, suggesting the presence of hidden internal mechanisms or motivations. For example, the bacteria investigated by  had identical DNA yet behaved differently in the same environment due to differences in their protein network (i.e., in the physical connections between cellular proteins).
The hidden mechanisms of human personality include thoughts and feelings, which may be expressed through actions, statements, and facial and bodily movements (e.g., 
Doherty, 2008)
. In common with all other organisms, such behavioral traits mediate the interaction of individuals with their environment 
(Sih et al., 2011)
 toward meeting their needs 
(McEwen & Wingfield, 2003)
. Given continual environmental change, it might be expected that characteristic patterns of behavior will change too.
However, individuals are inclined toward avoiding environments unsuited to their needs and values as well as being attracted to those to which they are better suited 
(Schwartz, 2012
 (see SM3) would score higher on neuroticism than those belonging to other types. 
Digman (1997)
 suggested the Big Five traits could be further grouped into the 'alpha' and 'beta'
factors of social desirability/communion and growth-restriction/agency respectively. It is apparent these factors have at least some superficial similarity with the cooperation/competition and conservation/change axes of the UMM/Schwartz system. However, the lack of orthogonality between the Big Five traits 
(Block, 2010)
  In relation to the single general factor of personality (GFP) proposed by 
Musek (2007)
, Block considered ego-resiliency (ER) to be a personality catch-all that encapsulates social-effectiveness and emotional intelligence. In their summary of research into ER, 
Farkas and Orosz (2015)
 describe ER as encompassing traits orientated toward flexibility, resiliency, and general resourcefulness in a variety of changing situations. Ego-resilient individuals tend to be being more intelligent, resourceful, and adaptive than others, finding positive meaning in addressing problems, less likely to be orientated toward self-enhancement, and more able to delay gratification 
(Farkas & Orosz, 2015)
. These attributes suggest broad alignment between degrees of ER and the anticipated characteristics of An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) individuals belonging to the four hierarchical motivational types described in SM3. In the case of intelligence and delayed gratification, our research findings already support this (see SM3, .
Research into the relationships between traits and values will doubtless reveal more information concerning their interaction. However, that human values are in themselves a CAS, existing within the CAS of the human brain, within the CAS of the individual, within the CAS of family and social groupings, within the CAS of humanity, that is itself part of the CAS of the global ecosystem, the challenge of controlling for or isolating all genetic and environmental effects is daunting.


A few examples of prominent evolutionary theories and perspectives
Carol Dweck (2017, p. 690) lays the foundations for a unified theory of motivation, personality, and development with the following: "I start with the assumption that psychological needs drive goals that support psychological life and health in much the way that physical needs drive goals that support physical life and health". Citing 
Baumeister and Leary (1995)
 she adds "to qualify as a basic need, it cannot be derivative of other needs". While the first statement may be true, to 'start' a theory that seeks to unify motivation, personality and development with an assumption that can only relate to organisms with brains sufficiently complex to warrant consideration in terms of psychology seems strange given, as we have argued, they have much deeper roots. If the second statement is correct, no psychological need can be considered 'basic' because, as our account of evolving complexity shows, psychological needs are derived from more fundamental physiological needs, and all of these are ultimately derived from the universe's 'need' to maximise entropy and minimize the total potential energy of its sub-systems. Considered in this light, all theories strictly bounded by the evolutionary history of our closest animal relatives, let alone those focusing only on homo sapiens, leave themselves open to criticisms of parochialism.
Having allowed that any psychological need could be considered basic, 
Dweck (2017)
 identifies three basic psychological needs: acceptance, optimal predictability, and competence, that are present An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) from birth. From these emerge four compound needs of trust, control, self-esteem/status, and selfcoherence.
Dweck's (2017) basic need for acceptance can be derived from the UMM's cooperation/conservation quadrant and Schwartz's conformity values. Competitive/self-enhancing values (and their equivalents) may then build upon, exploit, and subvert this. Power and achievement values promote the demonstration of qualities that promote acceptance (and by extension, trustworthiness and group membership) and the influence this buys, whether honestly or by deception.
In evolving CAS, such as organisms, optimal predictability derives from cooperative, equilibriumseeking mechanisms that have evolved and operate similarly to  problem-solving genetic algorithm. These facilitate the evolution of ever more sensitive pattern recognizing adaptations that enable organisms to synchronize behavioral change in response to early signs of change in their environment.
Dweck distinguishes competence from prediction by saying prediction concerns understanding whereas competence concerns action. Ultimately both share the same root in cooperation, which provides the foundation of stability that subordinate, dynamic competitive strategies supplement. In evolutionary terms, prediction and competence are co-dependent: the understanding that facilitates prediction only serves an evolutionary purpose if it enables improved courses of action. There could be no selection pressure on genes for understanding if such understanding could not find expression through action. The authors of Moral Foundations Theory (MFT; 
Graham et al., 2013)
 preface their proposition by quoting 
Einstein (1934, p. 165)
 -"The supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience" -before identifying care-harm, fairness-cheating, loyalty-betrayal, authority-subversion, and sanctity-degradation as five fundamental dimensions of morality.
However, one barely need step outside the realm of psychology before these constructs are seen to lack parsimony.
MFT's care-harm, fairness-cheating, and loyalty-betrayal dimensions all transparently relate to the UMM's cooperative-competitive axis and Schwartz's self-transcendence-self-enhancement axes.
Authority-subversion may be considered from different perspectives, prompting different valuesrelated considerations. Insofar as authority concerns status, influence, and control, it is directly related to competitive power values. However, as previously described, these may all be more efficiently achieved in dynamic environments through higher values. Subversion involves one individual/group/system competing with another, either by direct action or through ideas and arguments. As such, it may arise from competitive power-related motivations. However, subversion may also arise involuntarily from progressive hedonism and stimulation values, or voluntarily through self-direction, supported by universalism. In a tightly regulated environment, the expression of desires to have fun and be adventurous may be perceived as wilful acts of subversion. However, when such non-conformist behavior subverts norms and defies authority, these may be considered An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)
by-products of a motivation for self-expression more than a purposeful assault on authority.
However, when a self-directed motivation for independent thought and action (informed by universalism's drive for understanding) leads to a conflict with authority -whether it's the perceived authority of an argument, received wisdom, or an individual, group, or larger system -while any resultant action will be competitive, the ultimate motivation relates to a desire for greater cooperation: explanations and strategies that make better sense, promote more efficient actions, and lead to greater cooperative benefits. Sanctity-degradation again relates to the cooperationcompetition axis of the UMM. Sanctity promotes stability-enhancing cooperation through ideas and/or behaviors being given a protected status. This is the desired function of traditional customs and security related rules and boundaries. In dynamic environments, such fixed attitudes are likely to promote conflict between groups and cultures, irrespective of their intended purpose of promoting localised cooperation. Any idea or behavior that conflicts with those held to be sacred threatens their degradation, and so is likely to prompt defensive or aggressive action.
Rather than review further theoretical perspectives within psychology, since those we are aware of seem to share a common limitation, we will conclude this section with a more generalized commentary on studies in evolutionary psychology. According to 
Kurzban (2007;
Scholarpedia, 2023
) "evolutionary psychology begins with the idea that the source of organized functional complexity observed in all living organisms is evolution by natural selection. In its application to psychology, it entails the further uncontroversial assumption that the brain causes behavior.
Researchers in the discipline generally assume the basic principles of evolution by natural selection as articulated by 
Darwin (1859)
 and subsequent important developments, such as sexual selection 
(Darwin, 1871)
, the modern synthesis (e.g., 
Fisher, 1930)
 and inclusive fitness theory 
(Hamilton, 1964)
. They also tend to assume some form of the computational theory of mind (e.g., 
Fodor, 1975)
:
that what the brain does is process information (Pinker 1997)." It acknowledges the brain responds to external and internal inputs, evolving to become a problem-solving device, with specialized An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials) components attuned to solving ancestral problems, most of which operate unconsciously 
(Cosmides & Tooby, 1997)
.
A tendency for psychological theories to be developed as if humans were fundamentally different from other animals has been noted by others (e.g., 
Jonason and Dane, 2014)
. 
Jonason (2017)
 describes evolutionary psychology as a field of study that attempts to remedy this misconception.
However, our principal criticism of evolutionary psychology (as it most often presented) is that the context for considering the ancestral problems the brain evolved to solve is provided by savannadwelling homo-sapiens of a few hundred thousand years ago. While parallels are drawn and lessons learned through comparisons with other animals, this is the equivalent of trying to understand a story from its closing passages. The universe has been evolving for approximately 13.8 billion years in accordance with the same fundamental principles. If the story of evolution took 24 hours to read, and reading began at midnight, homo sapiens wouldn't come into it until less than two seconds before the following midnight. If, instead of starting at the beginning of the universe, we had 24
hours to read the story from when life first emerged on Earth, homo sapiens would be introduced at around 7 seconds to midnight. If we started with the emergence of multi-cellular life, we would still have only around 12 seconds to review the awe-inspiring complexity of homo sapiens and consider what makes us tick.
Concentrating on this small period of evolution has yielded many interesting findings. However, just as archaeology has revealed much that allows us to trace the evolution of human culture yet offers us little concerning the fundamental mechanisms responsible for it, in our opinion, evolutionary psychology has been too limited in its frame of reference to afford us a comprehensive view of the bigger picture. Our aim has been to frame our evolutionary theory of values in the broadest context possible. In finding congruence between the structure of the UMM and Schwartz's (1992) system we have been able to contextualise humanity's psychological evolution in relation to the laws of physics and the localised oscillating patterns of order and disorder that emerge in a universe seeking to maximize entropy. In so doing we have offered a means to better contextualize the detailed findings An Evolutionary Theory of Values (with supplementary materials)
emerging from specialised fields within psychology. The use of functional equivalents to Schwartz's values affords us relatable points of access through which we might gain a better understanding of the evolution of humanity and its many component and derived systems.


SM3 Method, Results and Discussion of Griffiths, Thomas, & Dyer (2022)
Amended and numbered to fit with these supplementary materials. This research into the influence of values on decision-making biases was not pre-registered. However, the rationale for researching the linear effects anticipated were previously set out by 
Griffiths (2013)
.


SM3 (a) (i) Procedure
Approval was granted by the ethical committees of Royal Holloway University of London 
(Phases 1 &
 2) and Bournemouth University (Phase 3). Through a combination of personal invitations sent to organizations and advertisements placed on psychological research platforms (Psychological Research on the Net and Social Psychology Network) and at Bournemouth University psychology department, participants were recruited to complete online questionnaires in which they were presented with a values-related questionnaire followed by a series of decision-making challenges.
No financial inducements were involved. Some participating students received psychology course credits and all participants were offered a free personal values profile based on their responses accompanied by interpretative guidance notes.
Data was collected in three phases from 2014 to 2021. The same values questions were presented in all cases, but the decision-making challenges were modified between phases. From 1588 responses, after the pre-planned removal of data from: (1) 116 individuals declaring that English was neither their first language nor a language in which they had acquired naturalized proficiency, to a previous values question for a total of 12 times or more, including a sequential run of 5 or more.
