You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a devastating and ubiquitous global catastrophe. As of early 2021, ( 
Figure 1
) the pandemic had triggered tremendous societal upheaval in the United States with over 400,000 COVID-19-related deaths, an economic downturn not seen since the Great Depression 
1,
2
 and prolonged social-isolation, the detrimental effects of which will take years to understand. In mid-March of 2020, it was already clear that the societal effects of COVID-19 would be extreme, idiosyncratic, and highly dynamic, providing a unique opportunity to better understand the human psychological response to crisis. To capture this psychological moment in extensive detail, we developed the COVID-Dynamic longitudinal study (www.coviddynamic.caltech.edu): a multifaceted set of survey-and task-based measures 
(Table 1
; see also https://osf.io/sb6qx for pre-registration), designed to characterize and quantify the dynamics of psychological, emotional, moral, attitudinal, and behavioral change over the COVID-19 pandemic. We were motivated by the following specific goals:


1)
Characterizing within-participant psychological dynamics. To what extent do individual characteristics (e.g., states, traits, attitudes, etc.) change in the face of severe environmental stress? This question has clear clinical relevance and also addresses more basic questions about the stability of psychological characteristics.


2)
Breadth of assessment. It was clear that, in addition to mental health, the pandemic would impact many other aspects of personal and social life in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, we were inclusive in our selection of measures. We assessed mental and physical health, behavior, personality, emotion, racial and political attitudes (implicit and explicit), social and moral decision-making, along with demographic detail, and more (see 
Table 1
). To situate these data in context, we compiled a variety of state-and county-level measures (e.g., COVID-19-and restriction-related metrics, unemployment numbers, antiracism-protest counts).


3)
Methodological diversity. Recent work 
3
 highlights the importance of methodological diversity for psychological studies. We therefore balanced standardized self-report psychological measures (clinical and basic), with novel targeted surveys, implicit measures, consequential social decision-making tasks, free response measures, and behavioral reports. As such, the dataset also provides a rare opportunity to explore within-subject differences related to measurement modality.


4)
Sample representativeness. We tailored the survey recruitment to balance logistical feasibility with the goal of enrolling a representative sample. Recruitment was limited to the United States to optimize sampling density across geographic areas given funding constraints and researcher sensitivity to societal context. Recognizing that an exact representative sample was unattainable, we conducted a thorough audit of biases in our sample and calculated 'raking' weights, a post-stratification method to 'correct' for biases in sample demographics.


5)
Rigor, Transparency, and Open Science. We strongly value scientific rigor, openness, and transparency. Extensive data quality metrics obtained during and after data collection are provided alongside the raw data. All materials pertaining to the study are archived with the study preregistration (https://osf.io/sb6qx). Because urgency rendered full preregistration of specific hypotheses impossible, we implemented a formal system to propose and register analyses prior to data access (see https://osf.io/sb6qx). Finally, after a 1-year period of embargo, these data will be publicly available.
The resulting COVID-Dynamic dataset is a unique, exceptionally rich, and inclusive longitudinal inventory ( 
Figure 2
) of the psychological, emotional, moral, attitudinal, and behavioral changes, as well as the personal experiences, of a large (1000+) cohort of U.S. residents from all 50 states during this unparalleled time. Here we describe the study design and methodology, detail the demographic composition of the sample, assess data quality, and characterize participant loss. We also showcase example data to demonstrate the promise of the dataset 
(Figure 4
; and http://coviddynamicdash.caltech.edu/shiny/coviddash/). These data will greatly improve our understanding of how traits, states, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors are influenced by a year of profound individual, societal, and global events, and will be a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers.

: Summary of 376 COVID-Related Psychological Studies. Snapshot of COVID-19related psychological studies publicly available as of August 11 th , 2020 (see Methods for details on study identification) along 5 dimensions: (1) average follow-up frequency (y-axis; 'cross-sectional' denotes studies with a single time-point), (2) number of domains assessed (x-axis), (3) sample size (circle size; log-scale), (4) study location (circle color; within US in orange, non-US based in grey), and (5) inclusion of task-based (as opposed to survey-only) measures (circle opacity; opaque = tasks included, transparent = no tasks). Each circle represents an individual study; the COVID-Dynamic study is highlighted with a star. Note that in contrast to the COVID-Dynamic study consisting of 16 discrete waves spread across 10 months, the vast majority of all summarized studies were conducted cross sectional, i.e., include only a single time point, or with very few repetitions, e.g., half or quarter-yearly. A dynamic interactive figure with detailed study information is available at https://coviddynamic.caltech.edu/documents/16453/summary_jittered.html.


Methods


Participants
Participant inclusion criteria: participants were recruited and screened through Prolific (www.prolific.co) based on the following inclusion criteria: aged 18-100, English fluency, United States residency (50 states), Prolific approval rating of 98% or higher, and minimum of 5 Prolific studies completed. To avoid drawing heavily from one geographic location, recruitment from the 50 states was spread equally across 3 areas (East Coast, Middle US, West Coast). To counteract a bias towards younger adults, present in online studies, a portion of the recruitment specifically targeted individuals aged 45-100. In total, 1797 participants completed Wave 1 of the study (of the 1831 study openings made available on Prolific).
Participant exclusion criteria: To ensure study efficiency and data quality, for Waves 1-5 those participants who showed low levels of commitment and/or for whom data were deemed of poor quality, were excluded from continued recruitment following each wave. The exclusion criteria were as follows: unable to fully complete the experimental tasks in Wave 1 (27 participants), flagged on quality measures provided by Prolific (6 participants), missed >1 attention-check questions (15 participants); responded with less than 90% commitment to participation in future waves (94 participants; queried at beginning and end of each wave); and overall completion time below our minimum threshold (25, 30 or 35 minutes as determined for each wave through visual inspection of the study duration distribution and consensus among the COVID-Dynamic group) (94 participants). Two participants requested to be excluded from further data collection after Wave 3. From Wave 5 on, no participants were excluded. Application of these criteria resulted in the reduction of the study invitation list from 1797 to 1576 by the end of Wave 5.
Core participants: To provide an overview of the data from the 16 waves presented here, a core sample was created containing only those participants who had completed at least 50% of the waves and who had not met any of the exclusion criteria described above. This core sample consisted of 1177 participants (51.2 % female, median age = 39.4, age range = 18-77). Detailed demographic information for the Core sample is presented in 
Figure 3
. Information about participants excluded from the Core Sample (i.e., the excluded and low-completion rate groups) is presented in the Results section. Sub-sample specific counts (core, exclude and low completion rate sample) are shown in Figure SI-1.


Measures
Self-Report Questionnaires The full battery of questionnaires and tasks administered across the 16 waves is presented in 
Table 1
 along with frequency of administration (see 
Table SI
-1 for detailed descriptions of each measure). The self-report questionnaire battery included commonly used, published psychological assessment instruments and race-related surveys in addition to 2 publicly-available COVID19-specific instruments (Epidemic -Pandemic Impacts Inventory 
6
 , Scales from the Social Psychological Measurements of COVID-19 
7
 ). We also administered a variety of self-report questionnaires created specifically for this study to characterize experiences and attitudes related to COVID-19 and the BLM protests 
(Table 1, COVID & Protest Questionnaires), as well as   demographic surveys and experimental questionnaires related to new and ongoing research   (Table 1
, Experimental Measures). A sample survey (including a randomly selected subset of items from the questionnaires and tasks) is also available for exploration (https://emotioncaltech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ctBqoufCi2MKnbv). 
Table SI-1 contains   detailed descriptions of each measure and Table SI
-2 contains a data dictionary of all survey items including possible responses for each item and scores generated for each measure. A continuously updated data dictionary for this study and an overview of measures included in ongoing data collection are presented on our website (https://coviddynamic.caltech.edu/researchprojects).


Tasks
In addition to questionnaires, participants completed a series of computer-based tasks designed to assess implicit social attitudes towards race (specifically Black/White/Asian) and pro-sociality, as well as estimations of COVID-related trustworthiness, and social decisions related to prosociality, group-cohesion, and altruism. The specific tasks included were:
â€¢ Pro-social Implicit Association Task (IAT): a version of the standard implicit association test 8 that assesses implicit associations between self-identity (ME/THEY words) and prosociality (SERVICE/PROFIT words).
â€¢ Multi-category Brief Implicit Association Task (BIAT): a brief form of the implicit association test 
9
 that assesses implicit associations in 3 subtests (administered in random order): 1) self-identity (ME/THEY words) and pro-sociality (SERVICE/PROFIT words); 2) evaluative (GOOD/BAD words) and White/Black People (WHITE/BLACK faces); and 3) evaluative (GOOD/BAD words) and White/Asian People (WHITE/ASIAN faces)
â€¢ Multi-race Affective Misattribution Procedure (AMP): this adaptation of the Multi-race Affect Misattribution Procedure 10 assesses evaluative (PLEASANT/UNPLEASANT) implicit associations with different races (Asian, Black, and White).
â€¢ COVID-related Trustworthiness Rating Task: in this adaptation of the Trustworthiness Rating Task 11 , participants are shown pictures of Asian/Black/White/other race faces and are asked to rate "How much do you trust this person to act responsibly with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic?" on a scale from 1 (not-at-all) to 9 (completely).
â€¢ Altruism Task: in this adaptation of the Altruism Task 12 , participants make monetary decisions to distribute money equally or unequally (generous/selfish) amongst themselves and partners who vary with regard to age, race, occupation, and political identity.
â€¢ Public Goods Game 13 : a standard task from behavioral economics that assesses the tension between self-interest and group cohesion in an anonymous group fund-sharing scenario. Instructions for the public goods game were adapted from Wills et al 
14
 .

External Measures
In addition to data collected from participants, we have aggregated data from a variety of external sources that can be used to understand the participant data in context. This includes:
1. State-wide coronavirus-related legal restrictions imposed to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. These included stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, limits on gathering size, mask mandates, restrictions on business or retail, and closures of public parks and playgrounds. We gathered this data by evaluating the language in executive orders, public health orders, and official statements by parks departments in place during each wave. Specifically, we measured whether the restrictions were mandatory (often indicated by the imposition of fines or punishments or language stating that citizens "shall" or "must" comply) or suggested (often indicated by language stating that the restrictions were "recommended"). All were coded at the state level. If different counties imposed different restrictions, we noted the predominant restrictions in the state for that wave. Where these statements were uninformative, we supplemented with contemporaneous news headlines and by checking live resources maintained by the New York Times 
45
 or National Public Radio 46 . Masks and stay-at-home orders were coded as mandatory if an official executive or public health order required them or imposed a fine for violation and recommended if that state's governor or public health department encouraged compliance, either in an official order or in a press conference or online but did not formally impose the restriction. Size restrictions of gatherings were coded on a scale of 1 to 11, borrowing aspects of MultiState's methodology 
47
 . We assigned larger scores to states that recommended rather than mandated the restriction, as assessed by language used in the executive order; instituted larger actual gathering sizes; or opted to delegate gathering restrictions to municipalities rather than setting a statewide limit. 3. Anti-racism political crowd data from the Crowd Counting Consortium (CCC), which collates publicly reported occurrences of political crowds in the United States (e.g., marches, protests, riots, or demonstrations) 
5
 . The CCC provides pre-sorted anti-racism crowd data from May 2020 through July 2020. Additionally, we extracted anti-racism crowd data for August 2020 through December 2020: Crowds whose description contained 'raci' were taken from the raw crowd data from the CCC database for these months and then counter-protest crowds with 'against anti-racism' in their descriptions (22 crowds) were removed.
Figure provides an overview of COVID cases, key events in the US, stay-at-home restrictions, anti-racist crowd data, and other pertinent information.


Procedures
The study procedures were preregistered on the Open Science Framework website (https://osf.io/sb6qx) to ensure transparency. Participants were paid at a standard rate of approximately $10/h. Additionally, to reduce attrition, from Wave 5 onwards, 50 participants were randomly selected to receive a bonus of $10 times the proportion of total waves they had completed. After each completed month, all participants were entered into a lottery for ten $50 bonuses. Odds were determined by their choices in the public goods game and the altruism task.
A researcher monitored the data collection in real time on Saturdays and Sundays between 10am EDT and midnight EDT and Mondays from 8am EDT until the closing of the wave. Monitors provided feedback to participants through Prolific's anonymous messaging system and addressed any technical difficulties as they arose. From Wave 3 on, participants received two reminders to complete the wave during data collection (morning and afternoon on Sunday).
Waves 1 through 4 were conducted weekly (April 4, 11, 18, and 25 2020), followed by bi-weekly administration of Waves 5 through 7 (May 9 and 23, June 6, 2020) and Wave 8, 3-weeks later (June 27, 2020) (see 
Table 1
). Subsequent waves have been administered at tri-weekly intervals and then once every 4 weeks.
Testing was administered using a combination of the Qualtrics survey platform (questionnaires) and Pavlovia 48 (tasks). While the specific content varied from wave to wave (see 
Table 1
), the general sequence remained consistent. Participants first consented to participate and endorsed a level of commitment to the ongoing study. Next, they completed questionnaires regarding background, COVID experiences & mask use, experiences related to protests and racial discrimination, and the Emotion-Space experimental measure. This was followed by the COVID Vignettes (implicit assessment of COVID norms), then the experimental tasks (in randomized order with the BIAT always last), the Responsibility Vignettes, and then various standardized and experimental questionnaires in randomized order. Toward the end, the participants answered 3 questions about explicit norms related to COVID-19. In some waves, they also answered questions about how and where they believed COVID-19 originated. Finally, they were presented with the debriefing and a list of resources to aid with mental health issues, acute mental health crises and food shortages. Participants were also provided with a PDF file containing a resource list at the beginning of the survey.
To provide a comparison between our COVID-DYNAMIC project and other COVID-related psychological studies, we compiled information 
(Table SI-
 We identified 565 psychological studies that collected, or are collecting, data from human participants. 
Table SI
-3 provides a summary of the 376 studies which met these criteria: a) an Englishlanguage website was available with additional information, b) sample size was clear, and c) follow-up frequency was clear. The table includes the following information for each study, if applicable: study name; authors and affiliations; short summary; country of data collection; sample size (we tried to distinguish between planned sample size, sample size currently tested and core sample size across sessions for longitudinal studies whenever possible); characteristics about the population; psychological measures (which were further divided into several domains: demographics and background information; daily life impact; attitudes and beliefs; emotion and mental health; physical health; social behaviors; decision making tasks; implicit attitude tasks and other tasks); timeline of data collection; duration/follow up frequency; recruitment method; nature of participation (voluntary/paid/existing cohort); data availability and additional notes if not covered already. The visualization together with the summary list allows researchers to quickly identify and locate studies of interest.


Analysis
All data processing, analysis and visualization was conducted in Python 3.7 
53,
54
 and R 
55
 .


Data Quality
To characterize the data quality, 15 quality indices (described below; 16 in Wave 1) were calculated for each wave and each participant and then compared to index-specific thresholds. A summary score for each participant of the percentage of quality indices deemed 'passed' was then calculated. Results for each individual index (both index value and the binary pass/fail outcome; 1=fail) are provided in the data release. Note, these quality metrics were not used for participant exclusion. Participant exclusion was based solely on the criteria detailed in
Participants and applied only to the first 5 waves. All quality metrics described below are provided with the data and researchers can apply those metrics for exclusion at their own discretion.
Several data quality indices were based on the mean number of consecutive identical responses in questionnaires and tasks (i.e., the mean response-string length). Each participant's mean response-string length was computed for each questionnaire/task in each wave. Participants with mean response-string length outside the range defined by the 1st quartile-3*IQR and the 3rd quartile+3*IQR were deemed outliers. The same criterion was applied to identify outliers in response consistency (see data quality index 9: "Response consistency" below). Data quality indices for each participant and each wave included:
1.
[Wave 1 only] Mismatch between the age the participant provided to Prolific when registering with the platform (continuously updated based on year of birth) and the age they indicated in Wave 1 of our study.
2. Completed less than 50% of waves (i.e., <8 waves). a. Valid responses present in less than 50% of the questions asking participants to list stressors in their life.
b. Valid responses present in less than 50% of the questions asking participants to list memorable news items.
8. Frequency of missing (i.e., NA) responses greater than 50% in questions that include NA response options (e.g., "does not apply", "prefer not to disclose", or similar).
9. Response consistency: Response consistency was quantified via the mean difference score between regular and reverse scored items in STAI, SEE, and the Disgust Scale-Revised (DS-R) and mean score differences between PANAS positive and negative items and PANAS positive and PSS scores. Participants that were deemed an outlier (defined via the IQR, see above) in less than 50% of included comparisons are considered to pass this quality measure. Survey responses, calculated scores, task performance indices, and data quality measures are available for data request.


Identification of Distinct Individual Participants for Visualization:
A key strength of this longitudinal dataset is that it facilitates studying individual differences in temporal variation of responses. To illustrate this potential, data from 5 individual participants from the core sample were selected for visualization in 
Figure 4
. The particular set of 5 participants was selected using a maximum variation sampling procedure 
58
 , which sampled participants by maximizing the sum of Euclidean distances between their scores on the five NEO-FFI subscales reflecting their personality traits. Specifically, the first participant in a set was one from the core sample. Subsequent participants were selected so that each new participant maximized the Euclidean distances from the previously selected participants in the 5-dimensional personality vector space. We repeated the sampling process for all possible initializations and selected the specific sample with the maximum sum of Euclidean distances. The patterns of each of the selected 5 participants' NEO-FFI scores are illustrated in 
Figure 4A
.


Sample Loss
To understand the factors that contributed to sample loss, we characterized participants that did not continue with the longitudinal study by comparing three participant sub-samples: (1) excluded participants -those who were excluded from further participation (Waves 1-5 only) based on the exclusion criteria listed in the participants section above; (2) participants with a low-completion rate -individuals that were not excluded, but completed less than 8 out of 16 waves; and (3) the core sample of participants -those who do not fall within the excluded or low-completion rate categories.
To assess if the participants in the excluded (N = 221) and low-completion rate (N = 399) groups differed in meaningful ways from the core sample (N = 1117), we compared the two omitted groups to the core sample on a number of demographic and psychological variables.
Demographic measures include age, birth sex, political party self-identification, highest education, weekly income bracket, and race and ethnicity. Psychological variables comprise STAI-trait, Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and NEO-FFI scores.
For each of the omitted groups (excluded and low-completion rate), we quantified the difference between that group and the core sample by calculating the Euclidean distance between the samples using vectors representing the categories of each demographic factor and the difference in mean scores for each psychological factor. The true Euclidean distances and mean difference scores between the omitted groups and the core sample were compared against bootstrapped distributions of distances and mean scores of sub-samples drawn from the core sample (N samples = 10,000, N participants in bootstrapped samples 
[
 Data Raking Data raking is a common post-stratification method used by survey researchers to "correct" for biases in sample demographics to make the sample more representative of the relevant population-the US population in this case. For researchers who wish to correct the sample in this manner, we provide raking weights for sex, age bracket, race and ethnicity for the core sample (N = 1177) according to their marginal distributions as given in the American Community Survey 5-Year Data 
59
 . Weights were computed in R 55 using the anesrake package 
60
 with a 5% discrepancy limit and no trimming cap. Following the recommendations of Battaglia et al. 
61
 , we collapsed variable categories with less than 5% in the sample (race: American Indian/Alaska Native (0.09%), Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (0.09%), Multiracial (3.14%), Other (0.42%) and Prefer not to disclose (0.33%); age: 18-19 (3.2%; collapsed with 20-24) 1 ) and all age brackets â‰§65 (summing to 5.3%). Further, we imputed missing ethnicity data (0.99% Prefer not to disclose) by randomly sampling from the two variable categories (Hispanic or Latinx and Not Hispanic or Latinx).


Results


Overall Data Quality
To summarize overall data quality, we calculated the number of participants that passed increasing percentages of our 15 data quality indices (16 indices in Wave 1; see Methods) per wave 
(Table 2)
. In all waves, the majority of participants (mean70.59%; min=60.01%) passed all data quality metrics. Pass rates increased as the percentage threshold decreased, plateauing between 80% and 70% thresholds. Across all waves all participants passed at least 50% of all data quality metrics. Participant-and wave-wise scores for all quality measures as well as flags for missing task data are provided in the data release.  
Table 2
: Summary of Participant Performance on Data Quality Metrics. For each wave (table rows) the count of participants that completed that wave is displayed in the "Total Completed" column. The remaining columns show the percentage of participants in that wave that passed increasing percentages (50% to 100% in increments of 5%) of our 15 data quality indices. In each wave, more than half of all participants passed all quality measures and all participants passed at least 50% of our quality measures. From Wave 1 to 4, the proportion of participants that contributed high quality data monotonically increased. This can be attributed to the exclusion of participants based on three control measures in the first five waves (see Methods).  
(Table SI-7)
. As expected, likely due to age-related differences in internet usage, older participants (>45) are systematically under-represented in our sample, despite our efforts during recruitment (see Methods) 
(Table SI-
 
8)
. With regards to political party affiliation, our sample contains an overrepresentation of Democrats with corresponding under-representation of Republicans and Independents. Political leanings (liberal/conservative) were skewed according to party affiliation, i.e., Democrats leaned more liberal and Republicans more conservative, with Independents endorsing a more balanced range of leanings. Finally, regarding race and ethnicity, White, Asian, and non-Hispanic/Latinx participants were over-represented in our core sample relative to the US population, whereas Black, Multiracial and Hispanic/Latinx participants were under-represented 
(Table SI-
  . At the top left, the state-wise population proportion is shown sorted in descending order according to the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) estimate (blue) together with the proportions of state representation in the core sample (orange). On the map inset, zip-code data (collected in Wave 8) are displayed which, due to attrition, comprise only 77% of the core sample. At the top right, the age distribution for males and females in the core sample is displayed along with that of the US population. Age brackets follow the ACS brackets (Note: all study participants were over 18). On the bottom row, pie charts of Political Affiliation and Political Leaning (left), Race (middle), and Ethnicity (right) are displayed for the US population (inner circle) and for our core sample (outer ring; except for bottom left panel, where the outermost ring designates political leaning in our core sample in grayscale).

Assessed A) NEO-FFI scores (five-factor personality inventory -N: Neuroticism, E: Extraversion, O: openness to experience, A: Agreeableness, C: Conscientiousness) from five participants with maximally distant personality profiles (see Methods). B-H) Results at the individual-(5 exemplary participants; left) and group-(entire participant sample; right) levels for a single measure from each of the study domains. Measure scores are represented on the y-axis, time since beginning of data collection (in weeks) is represented on the x-axis). Orange triangles indicate weeks in which data were collected. In "Individuals' Scores" graphs, shaded violin plots show the distribution of all 1000+ participant's responses in each wave, overlaid colored lines indicate the individual scores from each of the five participants described in panel A. In "Average Scores" graphs, the black line indicates the mean response across all 1000+ participants in each wave, with 95% confidence intervals denoted by the shaded region. Panels B-H present one example measure from each domain. In each panel description below, the meaning of higher values for the presented score is given in parentheses: B) implicit attitudes, Asian/White + Good/Bad brief implicit association test (IAT), IAT D score (higher anti-Asian attitudes); C) daily life impact, COVID-19 related changes in daily behaviors, sum total of 9 items (greater changes in behavior); D) explicit attitudes and beliefs, very short authoritarianism (VSA) scale, VSA raw summary score (higher authoritarian tendencies); E) emotion and mental health, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory state scale (STAI-state), STAI-state raw summary score (higher state anxiety); F) social behaviors -National institutes of Health Loneliness scale, T-score (increased loneliness); G) decision making, Public Goods Game group-investments, tokens (amount invested with the group);H) physical health -Epidemic-Pandemic Inventory (EPII) physical health total, sum of 8 items (higher number of non-COVID health problems endorsed).
To illustrate the richness of these data, and in particular the breadth of included measures and the variation over time and across individuals, we selected a subset of representative measures for visualization. 
Figure 4
 depicts results for the entire sample of 1000+ participants and for five participants with maximally divergent personality profiles (see Methods) for one representative measure (i.e., item or summary score) from each measurement domain assessed in the study (i.e. daily life impact, attitudes and beliefs, emotion and mental health, physical health, social behaviors, decision making tasks, and implicit attitudes; note: demographics are omitted as these are visualized in detail in 
Figure 3
). For each measure ( 
Figure 4B-4H
) and wave (x-axis), the distribution of individual scores (left panels) is depicted in a violin plot with the individual scores from the five exemplary participants superimposed (NEO-FFI profiles for each of the five individuals are shown in 
Figure 4A)
. The group-level plot for each measure (right panels) shows the mean response across all participants in each wave. Note: not all measures were collected every wave. Collectively, the data in 
Figure 4
 demonstrate there exist substantial and meaningful variations in the data across the waves, both on average across participants and for individual participants. Hence, each measure has a clear pattern of evolution on average across participants over the time period displayed. Moreover, individual participants with distinct personalities and life situations had distinct trajectories within each measure.


Shiny App
This online visualization tool (http://coviddynamicdash.caltech.edu/shiny/coviddash/) aims to provide researchers with a firsthand glimpse at the dataset. This tool was built using the Shinyapp framework 
63
 in R. It. Users have the option to filter the sample using demographic variables, visualize group mean temporal trends on a subset of measures included in this study, and examine within-wave Pearson correlations of any two measures in a selected wave. We encourage all users of the data to explicitly detail any data-exploration using this tool preceding formal analyses and hypothesis testing in their pre-registrations and publications.


Characterization of Excluded and Low-Completion Rate Participants
To understand what might distinguish the excluded and low-completion rate groups from the core sample, we examined their demographic (i.e., age, birth sex, race/ethnicity, political affiliation, education, and weekly income) and psychological (STAI-Trait and NEO-FFI acquired in Wave 1; BDI-II acquired in Wave 2) characteristics (see 
Figures SI-1, SI-2
 and Tables SI-4 and SI-5 for detailed results). The analyses of the demographic data (see Methods for details) revealed that both male and female participants in the excluded and the low-completion group differed significantly from the core sample in age, with the core sample including significantly less participants in the lowest age brackets (18-29) than the other two groups. Excluded participants further differed from the core sample in racial and ethnical composition. The excluded group contained more Asian and American Indian/ Alaskan Native individuals than the core sample. Participants that completed less than 8 out of 16 waves further differed from the core sample in highest education level and weekly income: The proportion of participants with some college education was significantly higher than in the core sample; and more participants from the low completion group fell in the lowest income bracket ($250-499 per week) while in the core sample a larger proportion of participants fell in the second lowest income bracket ($500-999 per week). With respect to psychological characteristics, the low completion group scored higher values of depressive symptoms (BDI-II) than the core sample, as well as lower levels of conscientiousness and agreeableness, and higher levels of Neuroticism in the NEO-FFI. The excluded group endorsed less openness to experience, conscientiousness and agreeableness, and higher levels of neuroticism and on the NEO-FFI than the core sample, but no evidence of significant difference was found on any of the other tested psychological variables (see 
Figure SI-3
 and Table SI-5).


Data Raking
For comparison with US population parameters and to facilitate post-hoc stratification, we determined summary raking weights for birth sex, age bracket, race, and ethnicity of the core sample according to their marginal proportions as given in the American Community Survey 5-Year Data 
59
 (see Methods). In addition to enabling us to account for sampling bias by 'adjusting' our data, this analysis also allowed us to quantify the areas in which representation in our core sample deviated most from the American population 
(Table SI-6
 to SI-9). Raking weights revealed considerable age differences between our core sample and the US population. While 45 to 49year-old individuals are most overrepresented in the sample (+11.8%), over 60-year-old residents are most underrepresented (-17.8%). Across races, sample-Census differences were largest in the Asian (-5.4%) and Black (+5.5%) groups. Ethnicity (Hispanic or Latinx/ not Hispanic pr Latinx) was misrepresented by (+/-7.9%). The US-population's female/male proportion was well represented in the sample (+/-1.7% female/male). Participant-specific raking weights (mean = 1; SD = 0.89; min = 0.3; max = 5) are provided with the data release for those researchers who wish to utilize this.


Discussion
By mid-March of 2020, epidemiological predictions indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic would alter-if not define-our lives for years to come. Realizing that the psychological effects of this would be complex and far-reaching, but also highly dynamic and long-lasting, we launched a large, within-participant longitudinal study of the human psychological response to COVID-19. Many other studies have queried the psychological effects of the pandemic but, to our knowledge, none have captured a comparable breadth, sample size, testing frequency, and duration as the COVID-Dynamic study (see 
Figure 2
, 
Tables 1 & SI-3)
. As such, the COVID-Dynamic dataset constitutes a unique resource for probing individual variation across many psychological constructs and relating that variation to a trove of information, ranging from individuals' demographic and psychological contexts to their personal-and societal-level pandemic experiences. The pandemic was also not the sole stressor of 2020. Sharp racial and ethnic disparities in pandemic-related health and economic outcomes 
64,
65
 , the horrific killing of George Floyd 
66
 , and increased Anti-Asian harassment 67 , both highlighted and likely exacerbated long-existing societal fissures, fueling large anti-racism protests. Partisanship greatly increased during the 2020 presidential election culminating in an attack on the US capitol. From its inception the COVID-Dynamic study cast a wide net, assessing political beliefs, racial attitudes, social and moral norms, and social biases. The dataset documents individual variation in these highly societally relevant domains not only as the pandemic evolved, but also as racial and political tensions mounted across 2020. A good illustration of the dataset's potential for relating real world events to temporal variation in psychological measures can be found in mean state anxiety (STAI-state; 
Figure 4E right panel)
. State anxiety peaked around Wave 2, shortly after the initial peak of new United States COVID-19 case-counts (see 
Figure 1
). However, despite consistently elevated COVID-19 rates, mean anxiety scores decreased from Wave 2 to 5, perhaps reflecting overall psychological adjustment (e.g., coping and/or numbing). A second spike comes at Wave 7, following the killing of George Floyd. The qualitative relationship between this exemplary psychological variable and concurrent societal events speaks to the general value of this dataset. Second, on top of sample-level temporal variation, the dataset reveals large inter-individual differences, as illustrated across seven exemplary measures across five distinct individuals 
(Figure 4)
. Differences across measures in initial value and response trajectories from these five participants indicate substantial variation in their subjective experience of 2020. Once again state anxiety scores (STAI-state; 
Figure 4E
 left panel) reveal distinct individual patterns across time, with none resembling the sample trajectories. These individual patterns suggest that, in addition to societal-level events, individuals were influenced by a multitude of personal factors. Given the sample size and breadth of measures in this longitudinal dataset, the inclusion of self-reported personal experiences at each wave, as well as external data on collective events (e.g., COVID-case-rates, unemployment), researchers can explore these inter-individual differences and relate them to both personal and collective experiences. The COVID-Dynamic project has prioritized scientific rigor throughout study design and data collection and has engaged multiple practices to ensure statistically sound and transparent analysis (see Methods and Results, SI-4 to SI-9, and https://osf.io/uenc5/). The data, procedures and preprocessing protocols have been carefully documented to facilitate data-sharing, and a formal proposal-based system for requesting access to subsets of the data was implemented (osf.io/uenc5). To-date more than 16 distinct projects have been approved by the COVID-Dynamic Team including: a published law essay on anti-masking laws and their contribution to racial disparities in usage of personal protective equipment 
68
 , a longitudinal assessment of emotional experience across the pandemic (osf.io/t9p25), a characterization of change in attitudes towards Black-and Asian-Americans across 2020 (osf.io/q5jpb), a basic research study of the characteristics of states versus traits (osf.io/fhqp2), and an investigation of substance use trajectories and their relation to mental health (osf.io/5hbws). While the strengths of these data are numerous, we also note limitations. The dataset does not contain within-participant pre-pandemic baseline measures apart from retrospective self-reports. Thus, some initial effects (e.g., acute initial increases in anxiety) are likely not captured by these data. However, the period of coverage includes multiple devastating local and national peaks of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and restrictions, as well as many national events (e.g., BLM protests, US-presidential elections), and extensive documentation of personal experiences, yielding ample subjective variance to probe. Second, due to practical constraints, the data were sampled at irregular expanding intervals and a number of measures were not sampled every wave, posing unique analysis challenges. There are multiple methods for addressing these issues (e.g., data imputation 
69,
70
 and advanced linear modeling methods 
71,
72
 ) which should be applied cautiously by individual researchers analyzing the data. Additional limitations, particularly prevalent in anonymous online and longitudinal studies, include poor data-quality and spurious results driven by inattentive or fraudulent responders 
73,
74
 , as well as recruitment and retention biases. To ensure high data-quality, participants who were obviously inattentive or responded fraudulently in early waves were expelled. Further, we conducted detailed data quality assessments, provided with the dataset (see Methods and Results). Additional biases resulted from non-random, self-selected sampling and attrition (see Methods and Supplement). While these limit the generalizability of the COVID-Dynamic data to a broader population they have less impact on analyses addressing within-participant variation over time and relations between variables and psychological constructs. Nevertheless, we took steps to reduce recruitment and retention biases, including pseudo-stratification of recruitment (age and location), above-average study compensation, bonuses for continued participation, and continuous participant support during data-collection. Additionally, we compared our sample to the US census (see 
Tables SI-6
 and SI-9) identifying recruitment biases in location, age, racial, ethnic, and political composition of the sample (see 
Figure 3
 and Results), as well as retention biases with regards to age and race. For researchers wishing to conduct post-stratification adjustments on the sample we provide "raking" weights. We encourage researchers to take these factors into consideration during data analysis and interpretation. Finally, as the declared goal of this study was to track psychological change across the pandemic, it is important to consider psychological biases in the sample. In accordance with previous research 75 , we found the low completion rate group to be more anxious and depressed than the core sample. Furthermore, excluded and low completion rate samples were less conscientious and agreeable, and more neurotic than the core sample ( 
Figure SI-3
, Table SI-5). However, it is noteworthy that, relative to the community-based norms, the NEO personality factors 
29
 , trait anxiety (STAI 
38
 ) and depression index (BDI-II 
16
 ) averages for all groups (attrition and core) were within the normal range. By providing this detailed characterization of our sample, we aim to constrain interpretation as well as to situate our study in context and thereby provide a basis on which to integrate it with other valuable COVID-19-related psychological datasets (e.g. the APS Global Collaboration on COVID-19 76 ). In the face of the extraordinary events of 2020, it is crucial that we, as a society, document the objective and subjective experiences of those affected-both to understand what happened and to plan for the future. The COVID-Dynamic dataset facilitates exactly that and is uniquely positioned to tackle myriad exciting and unanswered questions across many distinct psychological and social domains. Moreover, the insights gained-both across our participant population and within individual participants-may provide a knowledge base upon which to form policy and organize action. Hence, on top of its contributions to basic psychological science, this dataset may also contribute to two clear goals of applied psychological research: mitigation of the impact of trauma and promotion of resilience in the face of adversity.

Sample Loss
To characterize the factors that contributed to sample loss we compared three groups: (1) participants excluded due to poor data quality, (2) participants with a low-completion rate, and (3) the core sample of participants (see Methods section Analysis -Sample Loss for details). This section illustrates and summarizes the difference between the excluded and the core sample, and the low-completion-rate and the core sample, respectively. Two groups of participants were not included in the analyses of the Core Sample: individuals excluded (excluded) due to data quality indices in Waves 1-5 (NOTE: after Wave 5 no more participants were excluded), and participants that did not return for repeated testing (low-completion rate, <8 out of 16 waves). To test for sample selection biases in age and sex (A, B), political affiliation (C, D), highest education (E, F), weekly income (G, H), and race and ethnicity (I, J), we compared the excluded (left column) and low-completion rate (right column) groups to the core sample. Histograms show the Euclidean distance between bootstrapped excluded and low completion samples and the core sample. Black vertical dotted lines mark the 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentile of the differences between the bootstrapped samples and the core sample, respectively. Vertical red lines mark true Euclideandistances between the excluded or low-completion sample and the core sample, respectively. Butterfly charts superimpose age and sex in the core sample with the excluded (A) and low-completion rate (B) samples. Nested pie charts show all other demographic variables (C-J) with the core sample's proportions presented in the center and the comparison group (excluded on left, low-completion-rate on right) in the outer circles.  
Table SI-
 For all demographic features that differed significantly between the core and low completion or the core and excluded sample, respectively (see 
Figure SI
-2), we compared the proportion of participants in each feature bracket between the groups using post-hoc two-proportion z-tests (critical p-value Bonferroni corrected for each feature). Each table lists the within group (core, excluded, low completion) distribution of participants across the respective feature brackets (proportion of sample per bracket), absolute proportion differences per bracket between the core and excluded, and core and low-completion group, and lastly the z-and p-scores for twoproportion z-tests comparing the core sample against excluded and low completion sample. Significant differences between samples are highlighted in bold. NOTE: prop. = proportion; excl. = excluded; compl. = completion; abs. diff. = absolute difference 
Figure SI-3


: Psychological Characteristic Comparison of Excluded and Low-Completion
Rate Samples to Core Sample. The core sample was compared to the excluded and the lowcompletion rate samples using seven psychological variables: trait anxiety (STAI trait; top left), depression (BDI-II; top right), and personality (NEO-FFI subscales N=neuroticism, E=extraversion, O=openness, A=agreeableness, C=conscientiousness; bottom). Violin and strip plots show mean scores bootstrapped from the core sample for the low-completion rate (left, blue) and the excluded sample (right, green). NOTE: the only difference in bootstrapped distributions for the low completion rate and the excluded sample is the size of the bootstrapped samples. Black horizontal lines mark the 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentile of the bootstrapped distributions, respectively. Orange circles mark the true mean scores in the excluded and low-completion rate samples. Compared to the core sample, excluded participants did not differ from the core sample on trait anxiety scores or depression symptomscores but differed in four personality subscales: lower on agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience; higher on neuroticism. The low-completion-rate sample showed higher trait anxiety, depression symptoms, and neuroticism scores on the NEO and were lower on the agreeableness and conscientiousness personality scores than the core sample. Importantly, despite differing from the core sample on select factors, average personality scores for both comparison groups and the core sample were within the normal range (1 SD from the mean of a community sample on the NEO 
37,
38
 ) and both STAI trait 
47
 and BDI-II 25 scores were below the cut-off for clinical significance. Some of the differences from the core group are not surprising (e.g., that those scoring low on conscientiousness and agreeableness were more likely to be excluded due to poor data quality or low completion rate). 


Data Raking
A common post-stratification technique to account for biases in sample demographics is dataraking. Here, we provide raking weight for sex, age, race, and ethnicity to make the core sample more comparable to the US-population. Summary weights for each demographic variable are presented in

Description of Conte Sample


Methods


Participants
Currently active Caltech Conte Center participants (n = 105) were notified of this study on April 14 via email and 62 expressed interest in participating; of those, 58 had completed at least one testing wave by the end of June 2020. Conte Center participants were 18-50 years old, fluent in English, and had Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) >=90. Exclusion criteria at Conte Center enrollment included a first-degree relative with schizophrenia or ASD, currently taking psychotropic medication, uncorrected vision or hearing impairment, and moderate-severe depression on the Beck Depression Inventory. Additional exclusionary criteria included history of any of the following: premature birth, epilepsy, major medical condition, metabolic disorder, chemotherapy or radiation, brain surgery, head injury, eating disorder, neurological condition, psychosis, bipolar disorder, autism, suicide attempt, substance dependence or abuse, alcoholism, color blindness or strabismus. In addition to the data collected in this study, Conte participants have been tested in a large variety of behavioral and fMRI studies. During the seven years prior to this study, all Conte Center participants completed a battery of psychological questionnaires (see 
Table SI
-10 for full list). Previously collected Conte Data is available on request. For the COVID-Dynamic study, the Conte Center sample completed 13 waves of testing (labeled A -M) which correspond to Waves 3 and 5-16 of the Prolific data. Unlike the Prolific sample, Conte participants completed only one wave during April (on the 15th). Table SI-10 provides a full list of measures administered each wave. The data reported here are from a core group of 45 participants who completed at least 50% (7 out of 13) of these waves. This Core Conte Sample is 50% female, with mean age = 33.7, and age range = 25-48. Details about demographics of the Core Conte Sample are presented in

Results
To summarize overall data quality, we calculated the number of participants in the Conte Sample that passed increasing percentages of our 15 data quality indices per wave 
(Table SI-
 
12)
. Overall, in all waves the majority of participants (mean=65%; min=51%) passed all data quality metrics. Pass rates increased as the percentage threshold decreased, plateauing between 80% and 70% thresholds. Except for Wave K, all participants passed at least 50% of all data quality metrics across all waves. Participant-and wave-wise scores for all quality measures, as well as flags for missing task data, are provided in the data release.  To illustrate the richness of these data, including variation over time and across individuals and similarity to the Prolific sample,

Collectively, the data in

Orange triangles indicate weeks in which data were collected. Small triangles indicate that in the respective wave we collected data from the Prolific sample only. Large triangles indicate data collection in the Prolific and the Conte sample. Prolific waves are designated 1-16 and Conte are A-M. Line plots indicate the mean response across subjects in each wave, with 95% confidence intervals denoted by the shaded

Mean response-string length deemed an outlier in greater than 50% of "core" questionnaires: Positive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, state and trait), NEO Five-Factor Personality Inventory (NEO- FFI), Very Short Authoritarianism (VSA), and Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy (SEE) c. Mean response-string length deemed an outlier in the Multi-race Affective Misattribution Procedure d. Mean response-string length was deemed an outlier in the Altruism Task (from Wave 4 on, prior to Wave 4 response key associations were not randomized and long response strings were considered plausible behavior).5. Response speed: a. More than 10% of RTs < 300ms in COVID-related Trust Rating Task b. More than 10% of RTs < 300ms in Altruism Task c. More than 10% of RTs < 300ms in Multi-race Affective Misattribution Procedure 6. Task data quality: a.

Note that the US-census age data is provided in 5-year age brackets. That means our youngest participants
(18)
(19)
 fall within the 15-19 bracket but cover only a small subset of that bracket. To account for the large mismatch between target and sample variable we used the census 20-24 bracket as target for the collapsed 18-24 age bracket in the sample.














Positive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS) -a 20-item self-report measure designed to assess the subjects' current affective state. 
26,
33
 -a self-report questionnaire which asks about the degree to which 20 posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were experienced during the prior month.


Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)
Primary Care-PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD) 
34
 -a brief self-report questionnaire in which participants are asked to report the presence of five post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms during the past month. Scores of 4 or 5 indicate probable PTSD. 
35
 -a 32-item, self-report measure of how strongly one empathizes with people of other racial and ethnic backgrounds. It provides 4 indices: Empathic Feeling and Expression, Empathic Perspective Taking, Acceptance of Cultural Differences, and Empathic Awareness.


Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy (SEE)


Scales from the Social Psychological Measurements of COVID-19: City, State and Federal Government
Response to Coronavirus Questionnaire 7 -self-report surveys of beliefs and opinions regarding how city, state, and federal government is, and should be, addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes items related to personal restrictions, punishment for violating restrictions, emotional reactions, advocating for research, economic stimulus, and distrust of public information.
Social Dominance Orientation 36 -a 16-item self-report index of preference for social inequality vs. hierarch attenuation. 
37
 -a self-report questionnaire used to quantify the extent of one's social connections during a specific timeframe. Outcome variables include: a) Number of High-Contact Roles / Network Diversity (number of social roles in which the respondent has contact with one person or more at least once every 2 weeks; maximum is 12 including spouse, parent, child, child-in-law, close relative, close friend, church/temple member, student, employee, neighbor, volunteer, and group member), b) Number of People in Social Network (measures the total number of people which whom respondent maintains contact at least once every 2 weeks --reflecting overall network size), and c) Number of Embedded Networks (measures the number of different groups these contacts belong to, reflecting network complexity; maximum is 8., including family, friends, church/temple, school, work, neighbors, volunteering, and groups). 
38
 -a self-report questionnaire that differentiates between the temporary condition of "state anxiety" and the more general and long-standing quality of "trait anxiety." State anxiety is characterized by feelings of apprehension, tension, nervousness, and worry. Elevated trait anxiety is characterized by an overall pattern of increased arousal response to physical danger and psychological stress. Trait anxiety is typically high in people with depression or other psychiatric conditions. Very Short Authoritarianism Scale (VSA) 39 -a six-item self-report questionnaire that assesses right-wing authoritarianism. VSA scores have been shown to predict other factors including nationalism, ethnocentrism, political orientation, political party/candidate support, attitudes towards ingroups or outgroups and anti-minority bias. The measure addresses three facets of authoritarianism: authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression and conventionalism.

COVID & Protest Questionnaires
COVID Disgust & Fear -brief questionnaires regarding strength of current disgust (9 items) and fear (7 items) responses when faced with various COVID-related events.
COVID Expectation Bias -instrument that aims to identify bias in predicting 3 COVID-related outcomes (diagnosis of COVID-19, severe illness from COVID-19 and severe financial distress). For each outcome, the participant is asked to rate how likely this is for a randomly selected group. Groups are designated according to race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other factors (elderly, immigrants, healthcare workers, etc â€¦).
COVID Experiences -questionnaire used to identify COVID-related experiences (e.g., diagnosis, illness, treatment), impact of pandemic on daily activities, engagement with news media, and judgment of leadership responses to the pandemic.
COVID Explicit Norms -participants rate the importance of 3 specific COVID=19 prevention tactics (social isolation, social distancing and use of personal protective equipment).

Discussion
Here, we include concurrently collected data from the 13 waves (A-M; April 15 to January 23, 2021) of a smaller (N=45), but extremely well-characterized, group of participants from the Caltech Conte Center. During the seven years prior to this study, these participants completed a battery of psychological questionnaires; many experimental tasks assessing social processing and decision-making; as well as structural, resting, and task-based MRI data. Many of the psychological measures previously acquired overlap with those collected in the current study, including personality and social measures (SNI), trait emotional measures (STAI-trait, BDI-II) and state emotional measures (PSS, STAI-state, PANAS). As such, these data can serve as valuable pre-COVID-19 baseline measures to which we can compare the distinct ways in which these individuals have responded to the pandemic and other events of 2020. In addition, the availability of brain imaging data for the individuals in this cohort adds another dimension to our data set, enabling us to link neurobiological mechanisms to 2020-related psychological outcomes.
