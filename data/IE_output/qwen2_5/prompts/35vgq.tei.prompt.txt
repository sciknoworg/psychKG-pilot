I. INTRODUCTION
The early detection of depression has become a key focus in the scientific and medical communities, as this mental health condition affects over 350 million people worldwide-a number that continues to rise due to factors such as age 
(Shorey et al., 2021;
Racine et al., 2021)
 gender 
(Li et al., 2023)
, and global events e.g., 
war
 
(Greenberg et al., 2021)
. Depression is a complex heterogenous psychiatric disorder with multiple contributing factors, including genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological influences (for review; 
Alshaya, 2022;
Cui et al., 2024)
. It is classified in the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR, 2022)
 into several distinct categories, such as major depressive disorder (MDD), postpartum depression, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and depressive disorder caused by another medical condition.
MDD is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that go beyond just feeling sad or down. Individuals with MDD often experience a persistent low mood, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, and a loss of interest or pleasure in activities they once enjoyed (anhedonia) 
(Malhi & Mann, 2018;
Kennedy, 2022)
. Cognitive difficulties such as trouble concentrating or making decisions, poor working memory and slowed information processing are common in children and adolescents, along with physical symptoms like disrupted sleep patterns, chronic fatigue, and changes in appetite 
(Wagner et al., 2014;
Wang et al., 2023;
Bienek et al., 2024;
Schumacher et al., 2024)
. These major symptoms are strongly correlated with brain and physiological activities which emphasize multidimensionality and complexity of the disorder 
(Lam et al., 2014;
Tian et al.,2025;
Mullen, 2018;
Mendoza, 2019)
.
Additionally, MDD can cause significant emotional distress, leading to suicidal thoughts or behaviors in severe cases (for review; 
Oboubi-Donkor et al., 2021;
Oliver et al., 2019;
Lam et al., 2014)
. Recent studies (e.g., 
Oliver et al., 2019;
Cai et al., 2021)
 indicated that adolescents experiencing depression often have difficulty directing or shifting their attention when processing emotional stimuli. They are also more likely to perceive situations negatively and recall past experiences in a broad, less detailed manner. However, there is limited evidence to suggest a widespread decline in overall executive function. In addition, while the biological roots of suicide in MDD are still being explored, research suggests that it's likely the result of a combination of different influences. These include genetic vulnerability, environmental and internal stress factors-like relationship issues, work or financial problems, and co-occurring mental health conditions. Other contributing elements may involve changes at the epigenetic level, dysfunction in the brain's stress response system (the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis), imbalances in key neurotransmitters-especially serotonin-as well as alterations in cholesterol levels, immune system markers, and brain chemicals like brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other neuromodulators (e.g., for review; 
Orsolini et al., 2020)
.
Research consistently highlights irregularities in various brain networks linked to adolescent depression, particularly involving the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral striatum, along with disruptions in their connectivity. Moreover, as reported by 
Bienek et al. (2024)
 the neurocognitive deficits linked to the first episode of MDD (recent-onset depression) in adolescents compared to adults. Results of their study indicated that the impact of recent-onset depression on neurocognitive functioning is similar in both age groups, as lower scores in adolescents can be attributed to differences in age and education suggesting that neurocognitive impairment remains an overlooked aspect in clinical treatment guidelines for adolescent 
MDD (for review;
Bienek et al., 2024)
. 
Schumacher et al. (2024)
 further reported that lower performance in areas like working memory, long-term memory, attention, executive function, and language in children and adolescents with depression. Their results underscore the importance of evaluating cognitive functioning in depressed young age population and the need for further research into how treatment affects these cognitive skills. Due to its complexity and diverse presentation, diagnosing and treating MDD remains challenging, necessitating a comprehensive and personalized approach to care 
(Whitton et al., 2018;
Mullen, 2018;
Thapar et al., 2012;
McCulloch et al., 2022;
Beirão et al., 2020)
.
In this chapter, we focus specifically on an Amercian children and adolescents diagnosed with MDD, one of the most severe and debilitating forms of depression. Unlike short-term or situational depressive episodes, MDD is a chronic condition that profoundly affects an individual's ability to function in daily life. It is classified as a unipolar disorder, meaning it does not involve manic or hypomanic episodes. Due to its persistent nature, MDD requires prediction, early diagnoses, long-term clinical care, often involving individualized treatment plans that may include psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of both (e.g., 
Karrouri et al., 2021;
Vairavan et al., 2023)
. While pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy remain the primary treatment approaches in many cases, they are not universally effective. Research indicates that nearly one-third of individuals diagnosed with MDD do not respond to these standard treatments, highlighting the urgent need for alternative or supplementary therapeutic strategies (for review e.g., 
Karyotaki et al., 2016;
Dupuy et al., 2011;
Kamenov et al., 2016;
Keefe et al., 2014;
Cuijpers et al., 2014;
. The challenge becomes even more complex when diagnosing and treating MDD in children and adolescents 
(Masi et al., 2010;
Cuijpers et al., 2023)
. While the prevalence of MDD in children and adolescents are major concern (e.g., see 
Lipari & Park-Lee, 2019)
, unlike adults, younger individuals undergo continuous cognitive, emotional, and physiological development, making it difficult to distinguish typical developmental changes from early signs of depression 
(Feeney et al., 2022)
. Factors such as hormonal fluctuations, puberty, and varying stages of emotional maturity further complicate the diagnostic process, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis or delayed intervention 
(Ambrosini, 2000)
. It is worth noticing that these mental health changes will later lead to further challenges as those prevent them from many typical experiences.
Given these challenges and health concerns, it is essential to develop advanced tools that complement existing diagnostic methods, allowing for more precise and reliable clinical evaluations. Enhancing diagnostic accuracy in younger populations will not only improve early intervention efforts but also contribute to more effective, personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes and long-term well-being and other individuals' functionality.


The Rising Economic and Healthcare Impact of Major Depressive Disorder
Using the U.S. as a case study, the economic impact of MDD has increased significantly over the past 25 years. In 2000, the total financial burden of the disorder was estimated at $83.1 billion (based on year 2000 values), increasing to $173.2 billion by 2005 and reaching $210.5 billion in 2010 (also in 2012 values). The 2010 cost breakdown showed that 47% was attributed to direct medical expenses, 5% to suicide-related costs, and 48% to workplace-related losses 
(Greenberg et al., 2015)
. Prior research 
(Greenberg et al., 2021)
 has reported that between 2010 and 2018, the number of adults in the U.S. diagnosed with MDD increased by 12.9%, rising from 15.5 million to 17.5 million. During this time, the proportion of MDD cases among adults aged 18-34 grew significantly, jumping from 34.6% to 47.5% 
(Greenberg et al., 2003)
. This rise in MDD cases was accompanied by a substantial increase in its economic burden. The total cost associated with MDD in adults increased by 37.9%, climbing from $236.6 billion to $326.2 billion (adjusted to 2020 values). All components of this financial burden-direct medical costs, suicide-related costs, and workplace-related expenses-experienced growth, with workplace costs showing the most dramatic rise at 73.2% 
(Greenberg et al., 2003)
. As a result, the distribution of costs shifted by 2018. Direct medical expenses accounted for 35% of the total cost (down from 47% in 2010), while suicide-related costs made up 4% (a slight decrease from 5% in 2010). Workplace costs, on the other hand, rose to 61% of the total financial burden, up from 48% in 2010. This increase in workplace-related costs reflects improved employment opportunities for individuals with MDD. Despite these shifts, the proportion of overall costs directly attributed to MDD, rather than coexisting health conditions, remained relatively stable at 37%, compared to 38% in 2010 
(Greenberg et al., 2023)
. The significant economic burden of MDD has far-reaching effects on policy decisions, society, and overall well-being. This growing impact highlights the urgent need for scientists and healthcare professionals to develop effective solutions. Their efforts should focus on prevention, early detection, public education, and personalized treatment strategies. By improving monitoring and tailoring therapeutic plans to individual needs, scientists can help enhance productivity, quality of life, and overall mental well-being.
Over the past two decades, researchers have increasingly turned to computational modeling and advanced algorithms to identify neuro-biomarkers of MDD using Electroencephalography (EEG). These efforts aim to improve diagnostic models and tools, either as standalone methods or in combination with traditional psychiatric evaluations, which typically rely on reported symptoms, life events, and psychological assessments . These include instruments such as the Beck Depression Inventory 
(BDI;
Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961;
Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988;
Park et al., 2020)
, the Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL; Pirani et al., 2021), the Self-Disgust Questionnaire 
(SDS;
Olatunju et al., 2007)
, and the 17item Hamilton Rating Scale, which is the most frequently used observer-rated measure for depression 
(Nixon et al., 2020;
Rohan et al., 2016)
. These tools are used in accordance with DSM/ICD criteria 
(Lee & Park, 2021;
Stockings et al., 2015)
.
To enhance these computational diagnostic models, in this chapter, we present the latest advancements in our research as well as comparison with prior studies conducted by colleagues in literature, which is dedicated to the classification of MDD in children and adolescents. Our study specifically compares U.S individuals diagnosed with MDD to sex and age-matched healthy controls, utilizing a multidimensional analytical approach. By applying advanced techniques to resting-state EEG data alongside detailed patient phenotypic and depression index information, we aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDD classification and shed light for further research and implementation. This comprehensive analysis not only deepens our understanding of the neural and behavioral markers of MDD but also contributes to the development of more effective diagnostic tools for early intervention and personalized treatment strategies.
This chapter further builds upon our previous large-scale EEG studies aimed at enhancing classification-based models for identifying neuropsychiatric disorders, including MDD, in children and adolescents 
(Jahanian Najafabadi & Bagh, 2023
. Understanding the neurobiomarkers linked to MDD is crucial for improving both diagnosis and treatment, as these biological markers can provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of the disorder. By integrating neurophysiological data with clinical assessments, medical professionals can use these biomarkers as a complementary or confirmatory tool alongside traditional diagnostic methods. This approach not only refines current diagnostic models but also paves the way for future applications in personalized and precision medicine, early intervention strategies, and more targeted therapeutic approaches for individuals affected by MDD (Jahanian 
Najafabadi & Bagh, 2023)
.


II. BACKGROUND


II-A. Resting-state Electroencephalography in Major Depressive Disorder
EEG is a widely used, non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures electrical activity in the brain with exceptional temporal resolution. Due to its ability to track brain activity in real time, EEG has become an essential tool in both clinical and research settings, aiding in the diagnosis and study of various neurological, developmental, and psychiatric disorders. It plays a crucial role in understanding brain function by detecting patterns of electrical activity associated with different mental states, cognitive and motor processes in healthy and none-healthy individuals 
(Jahanian Najafabadi et al., 2023
, 2025
Imani & Godde, 2024a, b)
.
One of the key advantages of EEG is its sensitivity to subtle changes in brain activity, allowing researchers and clinicians to differentiate between typical and abnormal neural functioning. By analyzing EEG recordings under specific conditions-such as at rest, with eyes closed, with eyes open, or during cognitive tasks-it is possible to identify distinctive neural signatures associated with various disorders. This makes EEG particularly useful in exploring neuro-biomarkers for conditions like epilepsy, ADHD, schizophrenia, and depression, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches 
(Bhaskarachary et al., 2020;
Ciodaro et al., 2020;
Lopez et al., 2015;
Shah et al., 2017;
Liu et al., 2022)
. Previous studies have shown that EEG activities at rest, analyzed using Fast Fourier Transform (including delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies), are closely associated with the symptoms of MDD.
For example, increased delta activity has been suggested to indicate a shift towards internal mental processing, especially during tasks that demand sustained cognitive effort 
(Harmony et al., 1996)
. Resting state Delta is often associated with the brain's DMN, which plays a role in regulating cognitive control 
(Karamacoska et al., 2017
(Karamacoska et al., , 2018
(Karamacoska et al., , 2019
. Some research has shown that delta rhythms can aid in internal monitoring and regulating attention, particularly when external stimuli are minimal 
(Barry & De Blasio, 2017)
. For instance, studies involving meditation have demonstrated that delta activity increases during the suppression of distracting thoughts and external interference. Elevated delta power, especially in the medial prefrontal cortex during eyesclosed resting states, has been linked to reduced emotional and cognitive engagement 
(Tei et al., 2009)
. Increased delta power has also been observed in children while performing semantic tasks suggesting that the rise in delta activity during mental tasks may be linked to a decrease in sensory input to the cortex, helping to reduce distractions and allowing for better focus on internal processes 
(Harmony, 2013)
. This pattern is particularly relevant to MDD, where individuals often experience heightened internal focus, such as rumination, and struggle with cognitive control 
(Alderman et al., 2015;
Jones et al., 2010)
. Abnormal delta activity may, therefore, reflect a brain that is less responsive to external stimuli, contributing to the cognitive and emotional disengagement frequently observed in depressive states 
(Moretta & Benvenuti, 2023;
Chao et al., 2022)
.

A recent study by 
McVoy et al. (2019)
 revealed that in comparison with adults diagnosed with MDD, adolescents with depression exhibited lower overall brain coherence in the theta frequency band when compared to healthy controls. Additionally, researchers observed a reduction in functional connectivity within the frontal cortex at the theta frequency in the depressed adolescents group. Furthermore, certain brain regions, such as the right prefrontal cortex and left parietal cortex, showed reduced connectivity across multiple frequency bands (delta, theta, and alpha) in individuals with MDD compared to healthy controls. Theta activity, as a slow brain wave, is closely linked to emotional responses and cognitive functions such as attention and memory. In individuals with MDD, disruptions in theta rhythms are often observed, as these patients frequently experience difficulties in regulating emotions and struggle with cognitive tasks, including attention and memory 
(Fernández-Palleiro, et al., 2019)
. Over time, these deficits can worsen, making it more challenging for individuals diagnosed with MDD, especially children and adolescents, to manage emotions and maintain focus when learning, which are essential for daily functioning. The altered theta activity in MDD may reflect underlying neural mechanisms that contribute to these cognitive and emotional struggles 
(Gold et al., 2012;
Newson & Thiagarajan, 2019)
.
Alpha waves have been a fundamental focus in EEG research ever since Hans Berger first identified them in 1929 
(Babiloni et al., 2025)
. These rhythmic patterns are most commonly seen when a person is awake but relaxed, especially with their eyes closed, and they remain one of the most easily recognizable features in EEG readings 
(Barry et al., 2007;
Barry et al., 2009;
Barry & De Blasio, 2017;
Lin et al., 2024;
Zikereya et al., 2024;
Zhang et al., 2024a)
. Alpha activity is often used as an indicator of cortical excitability and is thought to reflect how well the brain maintains a healthy balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals 
(Kim & Lee, 2020)
.
Functionally, alpha rhythms have been tied to a range of mental processes. Studies have consistently linked them to attention, memory, and learning 
(Deiber et al., 2020;
Mattar & Talmi, 2019;
Brickwedde et al., 2019)
. Alpha oscillations also seem to play a role in how emotional memories are stored and recalled 
(Sghirripa et al., 2021)
. In particular, alpha activity in the prefrontal brain regions has been associated with key cognitive abilities like emotional regulation, decision-making, and overall executive function-all of which are often disrupted in mood-related disorders. When it comes to MDD, changes in alpha wave patterns have been proposed as a potential neurophysiological marker. One area that's received a lot of attention is alpha asymmetry, which refers to the uneven distribution of alpha power between the two hemispheres of the brain. This imbalance, especially between the left and right frontal lobes, has been linked to emotional processing and is thought to reflect a vulnerability to depressed mood 
(Smith et al., 2017)
. In individuals with depression, alpha activity tends to be elevated in regions tied to internal thought and self-reflection. This may interfere with the brain's ability to redirect attention away from negative thoughts, which could contribute to persistent rumination and emotional "stuckness" 
(Zhang et al., 2024b;
Mitiureva et al., 2024)
. Some researchers believe that this might be partly explained by increased activity in the default mode network (DMN)-a brain system involved in self-referential thinking-which is often more active than usual in people with MDD 
(Chao et al., 2022)
. Although similar DMN disruptions have been noted in bipolar disorder 
(Gong et al., 2021)
, the nature of alpha oscillations in bipolar patients appears to be more inconsistent, suggesting that the underlying brain mechanisms differ somewhat from those seen in unipolar depression 
(Su et al., 2024)
. This distinction highlights the potential of Alpha wave research not just in understanding depression, but also in helping differentiate between various mood disorders. Altogether, alpha oscillations offer a valuable perspective on the brain's role in depression. Their involvement in attention, emotion, and cognitive regulation makes them a meaningful area of study for both understanding symptoms and developing new clinical tools.
Beta oscillations are sensitive to motor task components related to top-down processing and sensorimotor behavior 
(Barone & Rossiter., 2021;
Engel & Fries, 2010;
Jahanian Najafabadi et al., 2023)
. Also, Beta oscillations are integral to motor learning, particularly through its involvement in the primary motor area (M1) and their functional connectivity with other brain regions. Additionally, beta activity is associated with active thinking, problem-solving, and focused mental tasks, all of which individuals with MDD often struggle with. When people engage in these types of activities, beta waves become particularly prominent in the brain. Reduction of beta power may reflect cognitive slowing, difficulties in attention and increased beta activity in certain brain regions can be indicative of overactive brain states that may contribute to anxiety or hyperarousal 
(Newson & Thiagarajan, 2019)
. Prior research revealed lower beta activity linked with MDD may indicate a compromised ability for cortical inhibition. Furthermore, the abnormal increase in beta phase synchronization seen in MDD might represent the brain's attempt to establish a new functional network to compensate for deficits in attention control, memory retention, and executive processing that are crucial during demanding working memory tasks 
(Li et al., 2017)
. Supporting this, another study 
(Roh et al., 2016)
 found that beta (12-30 Hz) and low gamma (30-50 Hz) activity in the fronto-central regions of the brain was inversely related to inattention. In simple terms, higher power in these frequency bands was associated with lower inattention scores. Additionally, overall symptom severity emerged as a strong predictor of inattention, with the BDI accounting for 23.9% of the variability in both inattention and anxiety scores.
Gamma rhythms are closely linked to heightened neuronal activity, particularly during the processing of sensory stimuli and the generation of action potentials 
(Watson et al., 2018;
Kim et al., 2016)
. These oscillations are particularly important in the hippocampus, where they are strongly associated with moments of information encoding 
(Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2017)
. Gamma activity is integral to various cognitive and emotional processes 
(Li et al., 2015)
, and disruptions in these rhythms may contribute to conditions like MDD, where altered neural processing is often observed. Research has highlighted the importance of gamma activity in the context of MDD. When comparing MDD patients to healthy controls, significant reductions in gamma power were observed in the left temporal and both occipital regions of the brain. Additionally, gamma connectivity between the left hemisphere and the right frontal region was weakened in MDD patients. In the left temporal regions, there was also a noticeable decrease in beta-gamma phaseamplitude coupling. Furthermore, lower gamma activity in the left occipital region was found to be negatively correlated with sleep disturbances, while disruptions in beta-mid-gamma and betahigh gamma phase-amplitude coupling in the left temporal regions were associated with cognitive difficulties. These findings suggest a crucial link between gamma activity and the neural dysfunctions observed in MDD 
(Liu et al., 2022
). An EEG study by 
Pizzagali et al. (2005)
 found that individuals with higher depression scores, as measured by the BDI and the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire, had reduced resting gamma activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, another study reported an increase in gamma activity in the frontal and temporal regions when individuals with depression performed spatial and arithmetic tasks 
(Strelets et al., 2007)
.
To our knowledge there are a limited number of studies focusing on the differences in PSD and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in childhood and adolescents diagnosed with MDD. Due to the heterogeneity of MDD and the nonlinear, dynamic nature of EEG signals, capturing their complex, constantly shifting, and chaotic patterns using simple linear methods is highly challenging 
(Acharya et al., 2015a;
Acharya et al., 2015b)
. Moreover, in many cases MDD symptoms overlap with other psychological disorders e.g., anxiety 
(Mathew et al., 2011;
Zedbozinek et al., 2012)
 and sleep disorder 
(Nutt et al., 2008;
Murphy & Peterson, 2014)
. In this study, we aim to build upon previous research to better understand the neural signatures underlying MDD in children and adolescents, comparing these findings to those of healthy controls.


II-B. Resting-state Functional Connectivity in Major Depressive Disorder
In recent years, researchers have increasingly turned to rsFC analysis using EEG to investigate how depression impacts brain networks 
(Bigdely-Shamlo et al., 2015;
Gómez-Herrero et al., 2008;
Ghiasi et al., 2021;
Gallo et al., 2023)
. Unlike traditional EEG methods that concentrate on individual brain regions or specific event-related responses, rsFC examines how neural activity synchronizes across various brain areas over time. This broader approach offers a more complete picture of the brain's functional networks and helps identify the disruptions associated with MDD. By detecting patterns of either increased or decreased connectivity, rsFC has the potential to uncover EEG biomarkers that can distinguish individuals with MDD from healthy controls, ultimately enhancing diagnostic accuracy and paving the way for more personalized treatment options.
Previous research has identified distinct connectivity patterns associated with depression. For instance, a study by 
Ghiasi et al., (2021)
 demonstrated that combining spectral and functional connectivity measures yields the highest classification accuracy (83.91%), emphasizing the value of integrating multiple data sources to assess neural dynamics. However, the most reliable model balances accuracy and generalization, with functional connectivity in the theta frequency band revealed as a key role in improving robustness. Moreover, Prior research 
(Fingelkurts et al., 2007)
 revealed that in individuals diagnosed with depression, there was a noticeable imbalance in brain connectivity between the two hemispheres. Specifically, the left hemisphere showed a greater number and stronger short-range cortical connections, whereas the right hemisphere had more and stronger long-range connections. Some of these neural connections-particularly those in the alpha frequency range located in the front, back, and left regions of the brain, as well as shortrange frontal connections in the theta range-were found to be positively linked to how severe the depressive symptoms were. This suggests they could potentially serve as indicators of depression severity. Overall, the study found that people with MDD showed a unique pattern of brain connectivity, especially in the right front and left back areas of the brain. Increased theta-band connectivity was also observed in frontal brain regions, with the right frontal and left posterior areas being the most affected in individuals with MDD. Similarly, 
Whitton et al. (2018)
 reported stronger beta-band connectivity (12.5-18 Hz and 18.5-21 Hz) between the default mode network and the fronto-parietal network, suggesting that elevated high-frequency connectivity between these regions may serve as a neural marker for recurrent depression.
Using high-density EEG, 
Damborská et al (2020)
 reported that patients with moderate to severe depression showed significant neural alterations compared to healthy controls. Directed functional connectivity was notably higher in the right amygdala and caudate, suggesting increased neural communication in regions linked to emotional regulation and cognition. The study also reported elevated theta and alpha power across all examined brain structures, which may reflect disrupted neural oscillations associated with mood disturbances, potentially indicating compensatory or maladaptive brain activity.
There has also been significant work on analyzing the type of connectivity neurobiomarkers important for MDD 
(Greicius et al., 2007)
. Their study demonstrates that MDD is associated with stable, abnormal functional connectivity patterns. This was also corroborated by later research 
(Kaiser et al., 2015)
, where meta-analysis identified consistent, large-scale network dysfunctions in MDD. Moreover, this was agreed upon by later research 
(Hamilton et al., 2012)
, where the meta-analysis identified stable neural activation and connectivity patterns in MDD. These findings suggest that MDD is characterized by enduring neural alterations.
Connectivity and brain oscillation patterns, providing valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the disorder. Recent research employed the phase lag index to construct functional connectivity matrices and used an altered Kendall rank correlation coefficient to select features with high discriminative power 
(Peng et al., 2019)
. A range of classifiers were applied to distinguish between 27 patients with depression and 28 demographically matched healthy controls. Permutation tests were utilized to evaluate the performance of these classifiers. The binary linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier achieved the highest classification accuracy, correctly classifying over 92% of participants using leave-one-out cross-validation for the full frequency band, with an impressive area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98. This strong classification performance suggests that functional connectivity features, combined with the appropriate machine learning models, hold significant potential for distinguishing individuals with depression from healthy controls. Additionally, the study revealed that depression leads to widespread alterations in brain activity, affecting nearly the entire cortex. The most significant changes in brain oscillation patterns were found in the delta, theta, and beta frequency bands, while changes in the alpha frequency band were less pronounced. These findings indicated that depression is associated with complex, widespread dysregulation in neural oscillations, with specific frequency bands playing a more prominent role in these alterations.
Despite numerous studies, including our own, a reliable, multidimensional, and optimized model for accurately identifying abnormal biomarkers that distinguish MDD from healthy individuals-especially in children and adolescents-remains elusive. Variations in analytical methods, participant age groups, and especially sample sizes and challenges in generalizability and interpretation of results contribute to inconsistencies in the literature. To address this gap, we integrate rsFC analysis with deep learning models to classify normal and abnormal neurobiomarkers using EEG data from young individuals diagnosed with MDD. By detecting abnormal rsFC patterns in specific frequency bands, our findings offer deeper insights into the neurophysiological disruptions associated with MDD, paving the way for improved diagnostic and clinical applications. rsFC is typically derived from EEG or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to quantify statistical dependencies between different brain regions. Among various rsFC estimation methods, Auto-Regressive (AR) models have gained prominence for their ability to capture temporal dependencies and provide interpretable connectivity measures. AR models describe the current value of a signal as a linear combination of its past values. For multivariate data, such as multi-channel EEG recordings, a MultiVariate Auto-Regressive (MVAR) model is used, The MVAR model for a system of time series is defined as:
( ) = ∑ ( ) ( − ) =1 + ( )
Where 
( )
 is an N-dimensional vector representing the observed signal at time, ( ) is an x matrix of AR coefficients at lag , is the model order (number of past time points used for prediction), ( ) is the residual error vector, assumed to be white noise.
The AR coefficients ( ) are typically estimated using methods such as Yule-Walker equations or lease squares optimization 
(Lütkepohl et.al., 2005)
. These coefficients encode the temporal dependencies between the signals and serve as the foundation for computing connectivity measures.
A significant advancement in the application of MVAR models is the Multi-Variate Auto-Regressive Independent Component Analysis (MVARICA) framework 
(Gómez-Herrero et.al., 2008)
, MVARICA integrates MVAR modeling with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to address the issue of the volume conduction in the EEG data, which can lead to spurious connectivity estimates due to the mixing of the of signals from different brain sources. MVARICA decomposes the observed EEG signal into statistically independent components, which are then modeled using an MVAR process. This approach allows for the estimation of connectivity between underlying brain sources rather than sensor-level signals, providing more accurate representation of true brain interactions. The MVARICA model can be expressed as:
( ) = ∑ ( ) ( − ) =1 + ( )
Where ( ) represents the independent components at times , ( ) is the matrix of AR coefficients of the independent components, ( ) is the residual error. By separating the mixing effects of volume conduction, MVARICA provides a more robust framework for estimating directed connectivity between brain regions.
Once the MVARICA model is fitted to the data and the matrix ( ) is computed, its coefficients can be used to compute various connectivity measures in the frequency domain. These measures differ in their sensitivity to directionality, frequency specificity, and robustness to noise. In this work, we focused on three different measures: Partial Directed Coherence (PDC), fullfrequency PDC (ffPDC), and PDC factor. Where PDC and its related measures proved to be the most compatible with ML models (Jahanian 
Najafabadi & Bagh, 2023
.
Where PDC quantifies the directed influence of one signal on another while accounting for the influence of all other signals in the system 
(Baccalá et.al., 2001)
. It is defined as:
( ) = | ( )| √∑ | ( )| 2 =1
Where and are two EEG channels, is the number of signals (EEG channels or brain regions) in the multivariate system being analyzed, ( ) is the Fourier transform of the AR coefficients:
( ) = − ∑ ( ) − 2 =1
PDC is normalized to range between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating stronger directed connectivity. However, PDC is sensitive to the scale of the signal, which can limit its interpretability. To address the scale sensitivity of PDC, the ffPDC was introduced, ffPDC normalizes the PDC scale across all frequencies, making it scale-invariant:
( ) = | ( )| √∑ | ( ′ )|
Where ′ represent all possible frequency combinations.
The PDC factor incorporates the residual error covariance matrix Σ to account for the noise structure in the system, providing a more robust estimate of the directed connectivity:
( ) = | ( )| √ ( )Σ ( )
Where ( ) is the j-th column of ( ), and Σ is the covariance matrix of the residuals ( ). The PDC factor is less sensitive to noise correlations and provides a more accurate representation of true connectivity.


III. METRIAL AND METHODS


III-A. Dataset
For this study, we analyzed resting-state EEG data from 329 children and adolescents aged 5 to 21. Of these, 88 had been diagnosed with MDD, while the remaining 241 were not given any diagnosis, classified as healthy and labeled as HBN by Child Mind Institute. The data came from the publicly available Healthy Brain Network (HBN) dataset 
(Alexander et.al., 2017)
. The recordings were taken using a 128-channel EEG (cf., 
Table 1
) HydroCel Geodesic system (Electrical Geodesics Inc.), with a sampling rate of 500 Hz and a frequency range of 0.1 to 100 Hz. However, after removing the outer channels, only 109 channels were kept for analysis (cf., 
Table 2
). The arrangement of EEG electrodes on the scalp is shown in 
Figure 1 (A)
, divided based on Regions of Interest (ROI, cf., 
Figure 1 B)
, and a summary of the dataset is depicted in 
Table 3
.  Dropped Datasets 12 (5 MDD, 7 HBN), after pre-processing
The demographic data of the participants were also provided by the HBN institute, as shown in  


III-B. Pre-processing
The data pre-processing was divided into two main stages: (1) EEG data pre-processing and 
2
computation of the connectivity model and connectivity measurements. The EEG pre-processing steps are illustrated in 
Figure 2
. The process begins with loading the raw EEG data using the MNE library in Python, applying the GSN-HydroCel-128 montage. Outer channels and any zeroed channels-resulting from poor recording quality or filtering during data acquisition-are removed.
A zero-phase band-pass filter is then applied, with a low-pass cutoff at 70 Hz and a high-pass cutoff at 1 Hz. Additionally, a notch filter at 60 Hz is used to eliminate power line noise, which is common in data recorded in the USA. The data is subsequently resampled to 256 Hz.
To detect bad channels, we employ the PyPREP pipeline, which integrates multiple methods for identifying problematic channels, including:
• Missing Values: Channels with missing values.
• Flat Lines: Channels with no signal variation.
• Deviation: Channels with unusually high or low deviations.
• High-Frequency Noise: Channels with excessive high-frequency activity.
• Correlation: Channels with low correlation to other channels, indicating poor contact or malfunction.
• Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): Channels with low SNR.
• Dropouts: Channels with intermittent signal loss. i.e. channels that frequently lose signal are marked as bad.  Where is the number of possible components, ℎ is the number of channels and ℎ is the number of bad channels that could not be interpolated. The ICA model is then fitted to the EEG data and used to identify and remove bad artifacts. Where bad artifacts in this context refer to unwanted signals that can distort the EEG signal. These can include signals from muscle movements, heartbeats (ECG), eye movement (EOG), and technical or environmental noise (e.g. poor electrode contact). These artifacts are considered 'bad' because they can obscure the true EEG signal and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Artifacts related to EOG were detected by MNE detection methods 
(Gramfort et.al., 2013)
, using Pearson correlation, based on adaptive z-scoring in the frequency range of 1-10 Hz. ECG related artifacts were also detected using MNE based function for detecting such artifacts, through Cross-Trial Phase Statistics, between frequencies 8-16 Hz.


III-C. Power Spectral Density
Following the preprocessing and artifact removal steps, we performed Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis on the cleaned EEG data to examine the distribution of signal power across different frequency bands, across ROIs. PSD was computed using Welch's method 
(Welch et.al., 1967)
, as implemented in MNE library. The number of points for the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is 4096, which gives a frequency resolution of 0.0625 Hz. with segments overlap of 50%.
The PSD computation is then used to compute the absolute and relative power, for the different frequency bands (Delta: 1-4 Hz, Theta: 4-8 Hz, Alpha: 8-12 Hz, Beta: 12-30, Gamma: 30-70 Hz), with the absolute power defined as
= ∑ ℎ ( ) = 0
Where ℎ ( ) is the PSD Welch power, computed on time series EEG data , with 0 and being the border of the frequency range.


Relative power is computed as
= ∑ ℎ ( ) = 0 ∑ ℎ ( ) 70 =1
Which is the ratio of PSD of the specific frequency range over the full frequency range (0-70 Hz).
The absolute and relative power is then averaged across channels, to compute the ROI-based PSD values. The PSD values then undergo statistical analysis; using R-based Jamovi (v 2.3.28) software. A Linear Mixed Model (LMM) is fitted into the data, with relative power as the dependent variable, and with frequency band, disorder label (HBN/MDD) and ROI as independent variables and participants (cf., section IV-C).


III-D. Resting-state Functional Connectivity
After preprocessing and cleaning the EEG data, we segmented it into non-overlapping intervals using distinct time thresholds of 15 seconds. For each segment, a MVARICA model was applied to estimate connectivity patterns. The model coefficients derived from these segments were then used to calculate functional connectivity measures.
The hyperparameters of the connectivity model were first optimized to ensure robust performance. To achieve this, the segmented EEG data was further divided into one-second epochs, resulting in 15 epochs per segment. The model order parameter was optimized by minimizing the mean squared generalization error using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The search range for the model order was set between 10 and 50, where this range allows MVARICA to focus more on capturing longer and more stable connectivity patterns. Another parameter of interest is the delta parameter, used in ridge regularization 
(Patil et.al., 2024)
, as MVAR models fitting is ill-posed with high-dimensional/colinear data (e.g., EEG), leading to unstable coefficient estimates. Where the regularization method adds Tikhonov (L2) regularization to the MVAR coefficient matrix to prevent overfitting. The delta parameter was optimized using the bisection search method 
(van de Wiel et.al., 2021)
. This optimization process was performed independently for each EEG segment to account for the non-stationary nature of the EEG signal. Once optimized, the MVARICA model was fitted to the original EEG segments 
(Gómez-Herrero et.al., 2008)
, and a variety of connectivity measures were computed from the fitted model 
(Faes et.al., 2012)
. These measures included PDC, ffPDC and PDC factor, all calculated bidirectionally between all channel pairs. The connectivity measures were computed with a frequency resolution of 0.1024 Hz, i.e. 2500 points, covering the range from 0 Hz to half the sampling rate (0-128 Hz), as shown in 
Figure  3
.A. The results were then divided into the frequency bands: Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Each connectivity measure in a frequency band was used to generate an image (as shown in 
Figure 3.B)
, where rows and columns correspond to different EEG channels, and their intersections represent the connectivity strength between those channels. Channels were organized according to ROIs: FL, FR, TL, TR, OL, OR, and Center. The 15-second threshold, which is relatively long compared to the more commonly used 2-5 second segments, was selected based on findings from our prior research 
(Bagh & Jahanian Najafabadi, 2024;
Jahanian Najafabadi & Bagh, 2024)
. These findings indicated that longer segments enhance the performance of rsFC and auto-regressive models in classifying MDD; since the longer segments provide more data for the MVARICA model, it enhances the resolution, which is necessary when focusing on lower frequency bands (e.g. delta).
Additionally, we opted for non-overlapping segments to ensure the independence of the connectivity measurements 
(Chiarion et.al., 2023;
Miljevic et.al., 2022)
. This approach is particularly advantageous for machine learning applications, as it reduces redundancy and enhances the generalizability of the derived features. That's especially the case when talking about CNNs, which are designed to learn hierarchical features from the data, and highly correlated inputs may hinder the model's ability to identify distinct biomarkers.


III-E. Architecture of CNN
The CNN models utilized here are based on VGG16, pretrained on ImageNet dataset, the model setup and hyper-parameter are based on our previous work (Jahanian 
Najafabadi & Bagh, 2024)
, which is a basic VGG16 model, similar to the architecture illustrated in 
Figure 4
, with top layers removed (up to block L.11). The input of the model is of shape 
(218, 327, 3)
, with the image duplicated across the three channels. The top layers are replaced with a flattening layer, followed by a batch normalization layer, then two fully connected layers with 512 units and ReLU used as activation function. Then a dropout layer of 0.2 was added, followed by another fully connected layer of 512 units, finally, a decision layer with sigmoid as activation function.  
(Hasan et.al., 2021)
 


III-F. ROI analysis
When it comes to extracting features importance from the models, a method that focuses on global feature and another that focuses on instance-level explanations were utilized, mainly Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) 
(Altmann at.al., 2010)
 and Integrated Gradient 
(Sundararajan at.al., 2017)
.
PFI quantifies the contribution of each feature in a trained machine learning model by assessing the impact of feature perturbation on model performance. In this context, the values of a single ROI interaction are randomly shuffled while all other features remain unchanged. The resulting decrease in model performance-measured using the F1-score-indicates the importance of the shuffled feature. This procedure is repeated ten times to ensure robustness and reliability in the estimation of feature importance.
Integrated Gradients is a popular explainability method, which was used in this work to interpret the predictions of a CNN model on the test data. The method computes the gradients of the model's predictions with respect to interpolated inputs between a baseline (zero tensor here) and the actual input. Where the integrated gradient is defined as:
( ) = ( − ′ ) 1 ∑ ( ′ + ( − ′ )) =1
Where ( )is the integrated gradient of input , is the value of input , ′ is the value of input in the baseline input ′ , 
(. )
 is the model output function, is the number of steps used to approximate the integral (50 steps). The gradients are averaged across interpolation steps and multiplied by the input to produce attribution maps, which quantify the contribution of each input feature to the model's output. The results are aggregated across test data used to produce a single score, that expresses the average importance of a single pixel (connectivity channel interaction), this is then averaged across channels to get a score for each ROI, in each frequency band.
Both techniques provide insights into the model's decision-making process, with PFI focusing on global feature rankings (e.g., for feature selection), which is also a model agnostic method. Meanwhile, Integrated Gradients quantify the contribution of specific channels to the model's predictions. The advantage of using such method is that it also provides information on the influence direction, where a positive score of a specific feature, indicates that higher value of the feature pushes the model decision making process toward the positive class, while a negative score, indicates the opposite. This method, however, is limited to differentiable models, as it relies on computing gradients to attribute feature importance.


IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS


IV-A. Setup
The training dataset was segmented, resulting in an expanded dataset of up to 7783 samples (MDD + HBN) for threshold of 15 seconds, for each connectivity measurement. The training method was 5 K-fold cross-validation training. The fold split was based on subjects, while maintaining an equal distribution of demographics. Five different models were trained for each fold. The training was set to 100 epochs with early stopping triggered when the F1-Score hit 0.8, batch size was set to 90, and the learning rate was set to 0.000004. The average training time per epoch is 20 seconds. Additionally, the training of CNN was done in Python 3.10.12, Tensorflow 2.18.0, Keras 2.18.0, scipy 1.10.1. Weights for each class were added according to the equation below:
= .
Where is the weight of class , is the number of training samples available in the data, is the number of classes (2 classes), is the number of samples in the dataset, belonging to class .


IV-B. Results
The results of training the CNN module are presented in 
Table 5
, with the best test performance achieved using FFPDC, yielding an F1-score of 0.815, an MCC of 0.753, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.746. These results indicate that the model was successfully learned despite the dataset's imbalanced nature. The high performance of FFPDC aligns with our previous findings (Jahanian 
Najafabadi & Bagh, 2024)
, where FFPDC effectively preserves relative amplitude differences across frequencies-features that the CNN can leverage for classification. Additionally, FFPDC is robust to scale, making it particularly suitable for resting-state EEG, where low brain activity produces low connectivity values. PDC Factor emerged as the second-best performing metric, with an F1-score of 0.782, an MCC of 0.713, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.703. This performance can be attributed to PDC Factor's ability to suppress noise effectively. Notably, the fact that PDC Factor outperformed PDC suggests that the MVARICA model did not overfit, even with an increased model order optimization search range of 10-50, instead of restricting it to lower values. For our further analysis, we primarily focus on testing the model based on FFPDC. 
Table 6
 presents the CNN module's performance across demographic groups of males and females, where test scores are expected to remain largely consistent. However, we opted not to conduct testing based on age groups, as only 10 MDD datasets belonged to children. This limited sample size could prevent the model from detecting potential biomarkers and would also provide insufficient data for the explanation method to effectively highlight relevant biomarkers.  
Figure 5
.A presents heatmaps of the ROIs derived from the Integrated Gradients method across different frequency bands. The importance score for each ROI was calculated by summing the Integrated Gradients scores for all connectivity interactions involving that ROI across frequencies. Higher scores in the heatmap (red) indicate that an increase in FFPDC values in the corresponding ROI contributes more to the positive class (MDD), whereas lower scores (blue) suggest that an increase in FFPDC values contributes to the negative class (HBN). The heatmap reveals that MDD exhibits higher FFPDC values in the Center and OL ROIs, while HBN shows higher connectivity values in the FR ROI. Other ROIs display a slight bias toward HBN, with higher FFPDC connectivity values.
In 
Figure 5
.B, a heatmap generated using the PFI method illustrates the impact of each ROI on model performance. The importance score for each ROI was determined by computing the mean drop in the F1-score across all interactions in which the ROI was involved across different frequencies. The heatmap clearly highlights that the Center ROI had the most significant impact on the F1-score, indicating its crucial role in classification performance.

 provides a detailed visualization of the normalized inter-ROI interactions across frequencies using the integrated gradient method. The results reveal distinct frequency and ROIdependent patterns: Delta is characterized by Center-FL and Center-OR HBN biased interactions, with Center-FR, Center-TL interactions, that are MDD biased. Theta has the highest inter-ROI interaction, with the strongest interaction being OR-TL, followed by OR-FR, which are HBN biased. While OL-FL, FR-FL and FL-Center being MDD biased. Alpha shows OR-FR and OR-FL interactions that are HBN biased, with FL-TL, FL-OL, FL-FR, FL-Center and Center-TL interactions that are MDD biased. While Beta does not exhibit any strong bias, except for FL-FR interaction, which is HBN biased. Gamma also shows no strong interaction, except for FL-TL toward the MDD class. Finally, in the combined frequency range, no strong bias is detected, with the strongest being OL-FR with MDD bias.

 illustrates the normalized inter-ROI interactions using the PFI method across different frequency bands. Notably, within each frequency band, certain ROI interactions prominently contribute to the drop in the F1-score, indicating that the CNN model assigns particular importance to these specific ROIs. Additionally, interactions involving the Center ROI consistently appear across all frequency bands, highlighting its critical role in the model's decision-making process. In Delta, Center-TR, Center-OL, Center-OR, Center-FL, TL-OR and TR-FR. In Theta, Center-TL, Center-OL, Center-OR, OR-FR, OR-TR, OR-FL. In Alpha, only TR-OL and Center-OL are highlighted. In Beta, Center-TL, Center-TR and TL-FR are highlighted. In Gamma, Center-TL, Center-TR, Center-FR, TR-FL and OR-OL are highlighted. In the combined frequency bands, Center-OL, OR-TL and TR-FL are highlighted.   


IV-C. Power Spectra Density in Major Depressive Disorder Compared to Healthy Children and Adolescents
We began by investigating whether relative PSD differed by gender (male vs. female). The analysis revealed no significant differences in PSD between the two groups (cf., 
Figure 9
). Given the absence of gender-related effects, all participants were combined into a single dataset for subsequent analyses. To examine differences in relative power between participants with MDD and HBN, we employed a LMM, with relative power as the dependent variable. Group (MDD vs. HBN), ROI, and frequency band were entered as fixed effects, while participant ID was included as a random effect to account for inter-individual variability. The model was estimated using restricted maximum likelihood and incorporated all main effects and interaction terms. Model fit was acceptable, with an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of -23320.48 and a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of -22231.93. The marginal R², representing the variance explained by fixed effects, was 52.2%, while the conditional R², accounting for both fixed and random effects, was 57.7%. When we looked at how participants varied individually, we noticed some differences in relative power. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.052, meaning that only a small amount of the variation in relative power could be explained by differences between participants. The variance for the intercept was 0.0005, showing that there were small differences in baseline relative power between individuals. The residual variance, which captures the unexplained variation, was 0.009, suggesting that most of the differences in relative power are due to factors not related to individual differences. This analysis included 7783 data points from 362 participants (see Appendix for MDD vs HBN Relative Power PSD).
In the random effect analysis, we tested the variability due to participant differences (ID) using a likelihood ratio test. The model had 71 parameters, and the AIC for the model was -22,481. The likelihood ratio test statistic was 288 (df = 1; p < 0.001) indicating that there is a significant amount of variation in the data that can be attributed to individual differences between participants. Omnibus F-tests (using the Satterthwaite approximation for degrees of freedom) revealed significant main effects of ROI, F(6, 12,240) = 9.314, p < .001, and frequency band, F(4, 12,240) = 2648.025, p < .001. No significant main effect was observed for group, F(1, 360) = 0.413, p = .521, suggesting that relative power alone may not differentiate MDD from HBN participants. Significant interactions were found between group and frequency band, F(4, 12,240) = 7.070, p < .001, and between ROI and frequency band, F(24, 12,240) = 6.454, p < .001. However, the group × ROI interaction, F(6, 12,240) = 0.314, p = .930, and the three-way interaction among group, ROI, and frequency band, F(24, 12,240) = 0.103, p = 1.000, were not statistically significant. These results suggest that while overall relative power is not significantly different between diagnostic groups, specific frequency-band interactions may carry relevant information regarding group differences.
The results showed that, on average, there was no significant difference between the MDD and HBN groups in terms of relative power, as the group variable itself did not produce any notable effects. However, significant differences were found in the ROI and frequency bands. For example, the regions FL (frontal left), FR (frontal right), TL (temporal left), and TR (temporal right) exhibited varying levels of relative power, with the frontal regions showing negative effects, meaning less power, while temporal regions had some negative effects as well but to a lesser degree. Importantly, the temporal right region (TR -Center) and temporal left region (TL -Center) showed significant differences, with power levels significantly lower compared to other regions. In contrast, the occipital regions did not show significant effects, suggesting these areas might not be as relevant in distinguishing between MDD and HBN in terms of relative power.
Frequency bands also played an important role in explaining the differences in brain activity. The frequency bands Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma all exhibited significant effects. The Theta and Gamma bands showed particularly large differences, with both bands having a negative association with relative power, indicating lower brain activity in these frequencies. The Alpha and Beta bands also showed significant differences but with smaller effects compared to Theta and Gamma.
When looking at the interactions between group, brain region, and frequency band, no significant three-way interactions were observed. This suggests that the combination of group (MDD or HBN), ROI, and frequency band did not create any additional complex patterns of activity. However, there were significant two-way interactions between the regions and frequency bands. For example, the interaction between the frontal left region and the Theta frequency band showed a significant reduction in relative power, and similar patterns were observed for the other frequency bands in the frontal and frontal right regions. Overall, these findings suggest that although the MDD and HBN groups did not show major differences in overall brain power, there are specific regions and frequency bands that play a key role in distinguishing between the groups.

Discussion
In this chapter, we explored how deep learning techniques-specifically CNNs-can be used to identify neurological markers associated with MDD in children and adolescents. Building on earlier research and recent advancements in the field, we focused on rsFC derived from EEG data to distinguish between participants diagnosed with MDD and healthy controls. We implemented a CNN model based on the VGG16 architecture, following a detailed preprocessing pipeline. Brain connectivity was estimated using the MVARICA model, which helped us identify meaningful biomarkers across different frequency bands and brain ROIs.
We also examined how the CNN made its decisions and compared these insights with results from traditional statistical methods based on PSD. Additionally, we assessed the model's potential as a diagnostic tool by evaluating its performance in classifying participants using short segments of resting-state EEG recordings. To improve performance, we applied advanced validation strategies, including robust cross-validation, early stopping, dropout layers, class weighting, and multiple performance metrics to guard against overfitting. This study placed particular emphasis on PDC and its related variants, with a focus on ffPDC, which demonstrated the highest compatibility with CNN-based analysis.
The CNN model achieved strong performance using ffPDC features, with an F1-Score of 0.815, a MCC of 0.753, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.746. Based on these results, subsequent analyses primarily focused on FFPDC. Importantly, the model's performance remained stable when tested on sex-specific subsets of the data. However, we were unable to analyze age-related effects due to the limited availability of MDD data for children (n=10 datasets). To interpret the model's predictions, we used Integrated Gradients and PFI. By averaging pixel scores across all connections involving a given ROI, we identified the most influential brain regions independent of frequency band. The Center and OL ROIs showed stronger connectivity in MDD participants, while the FR ROI had higher values in the HBN group. PFI also highlighted the Center ROI as particularly important.
We then extracted the most important features per method across different frequency bands, as shown in 
Figures 6 and 7
. Connection strengths were normalized across bands. One might argue that the prominence of the Center ROI is partly due to its peripheral placement on frequency band maps. However, its consistent salience in the gamma and combined frequency bands-where edge effects are minimal-supports its significance. These findings are consistent with previous work (Jahanian 
Najafabadi & Bagh, 2024)
, which also identified the Center ROI as a key feature across multiple frequency bands.
The differences in highlighted features between Integrated Gradients and PFI stem from their methodological principles. Integrated Gradients measure how sensitive the model is to changes in a specific feature, indicating how much predictions shift when a feature's value is modified. This can reveal model dependencies on features that may not be causally important but are strongly correlated with the outcome. In contrast, PFI assesses global feature importance by measuring how much performance drops when a feature is randomized. This can overlook redundant features if others compensate. As such, the two methods complement each other-Integrated Gradients show how the model uses features, while PFI reveals which features are statistically critical to performance.
On average, the model classified 45% (±7.6) of segments from MDD participants as MDD, while 24% (±8.3) of segments from HBN participants were incorrectly classified as MDD. While this distinction is clear, identifying an optimal classification threshold at the participant level (e.g., via F1-score optimization) could improve the model's practical application as a diagnostic tool.
However, further refinement is needed.
Another key consideration is the temporal variability of MDD-related neuro-biomarkers. Although MDD is generally associated with persistent changes in brain function, rsFC patterns can fluctuate over time. Given the 15-second segment duration, some MDD segments may not display distinguishable abnormalities, appearing instead as healthy-like patterns. This could explain why the HBN group-whose connectivity is likely more consistent-had a higher correct classification rate. This finding aligns with 
Kaiser et al. (2016)
, who reported that rsFC abnormalities in MDD tend to fluctuate. As such, our CNN may only detect MDD in segments where those abnormalities are momentarily active.
A statistical analysis of relative PSD values revealed no significant differences by sex or age. However, differences were observed in terms of ROIs and frequency bands, particularly through two-way interactions (e.g., group differences by ROI or frequency band alone). These results align somewhat with the CNN connectivity analyses, though the machine learning explanations were more detailed. Interestingly, when comparing Integrated Gradient explanations with results from LMM, the two methods did not always agree on the direction of effect. For example, LMM found higher relative power in the FL and Center ROIs for HBN participants, while Integrated Gradients typically associated higher FFPDC connectivity values with MDD. These discrepancies are expected, as the underlying metrics capture different aspects of brain activity-PSD focuses on local activity, while PDC-based connectivity captures directional interactions.
In summary, this study demonstrates that deep learning applied to EEG-based rsFC can offer valuable insights into the neurobiology of MDD in young individuals. It also highlights the importance of feature interpretation and the complementary nature of different explanation and validation methods in model development. Of course, this is to be expected, as the measurements are different in nature. In our study, we found that multiple brain regions were involved in MDD, rather than a single localized area corroborating prior research 
(Hamilton et al., 2010;
Su et al., 2025;
Kerestes et al., 2013;
Filatova et al., 2021;
Young et al., 2023)
. This supports the understanding that depression impacts the brain as a complex, interconnected network. Notably, we observed alterations in both alpha and beta brainwave activity in the right and left frontal regions-areas associated with attention, memory, and emotional regulation. These disruptions may help explain common depressive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and poor sleep quality.
Interestingly, supporting prior findings (e.g., 
Li et al., 2016)
, we observed increased delta activity between the centro-frontal right and centro-temporal left regions, while theta activity was elevated in the left occipito-frontal, frontal left-to-right, and frontal left-to-center connections in individuals with MDD compared to those with HBN. Notably, the frontal left region plays a key role in theta band increases, whereas the central region is more involved in delta increases. Increased delta activity is often linked to cortical hypoactivation or dysfunction during rest, which may disrupt executive control and emotional regulation networks (e.g., 
Passynkova & Volf, 2001;
Ding et al., 2019)
. These changes can contribute to slower information processing, potentially impacting learning and development in children and adolescents. Over time, this may manifest as increased rumination, reduced motivation, and impaired decision-making-hallmark symptoms of MDD. Elevated theta activity, particularly in centro-frontal regions, may reflect a dysregulation of top-down control, where the frontal cortex struggles to effectively manage emotional responses driven by limbic structures. This imbalance is also associated with a greater tendency toward negative thinking or bias, commonly observed in individuals with e.g., depression 
(Park et al., 2025;
Babaeeghazvini et al., 2021;
He et al., 2017;
Li et al., 2021)
.
Alpha suppression in the frontal cortex has been linked to increased emotional reactivity and persistent negative thinking. In children and adolescents, this often manifests as heightened rumination and difficulty disengaging from negative thoughts, contributing to emotional distress 
(Weissman et al., 2019;
Wenzlaff & Luxton, 2003)
. At the same time, abnormal beta activity in the frontal regions may reflect the brain's effort to compensate for deficits in attention and cognitive control. However, this can lead to overactivation in areas involved in executive function and mood regulation, which may hinder active thinking, motor planning, and behavioral response 
(Margoni et al., 2023;
Li et al., 2017;
Newson & Thiagarajan, 2019)
.
We also observed a general reduction in gamma activity in participants with MDD compared to healthy individuals. In our study, this decrease was most prominent in the left and frontal regions, suggesting impaired global brain communication. These findings align with previous research linking reduced gamma activity to decreased cognitive flexibility and increased anhedonia in individuals with depression 
(Li et al., 2017;
Strelets et al., 2007;
Liu et al., 2022)
. Such impairments in information integration and higher-order cognitive function may disrupt typical developmental trajectories in children and adolescents, leading to lower motivation, emotional numbness, slowed thinking, and repetitive negative thought patterns (e.g., 
Jones et al., 2024;
Huberty, 2012)
. Overall, our results show children and adolescents with diagnosed with MDD show stronger low-frequency brain connections, especially between frontal and temporal areas. This may point to difficulties in how the brain handles thoughts and emotions, slower mental processing, and a tendency to focus inward-patterns that fit with common depression symptoms like overthinking, trouble concentrating, and emotional imbalance 
(Straub et al., 2019;
Villalobos et al., 2021;

In line with findings from adult studies-and reinforcing our previous work on classifying children and adolescents with MDD versus HBN (Jahanian Najafabadi & Bagh, 2023, 2024a, b, c)-our analysis of larger datasets showed promising accuracy. These results suggest that FC patterns could be valuable diagnostic markers for MDD in younger populations. Given that MDD is widely recognized as a disorder involving disrupted brain network connectivity, it's not surprising that models based on rsFC perform well. This is especially relevant as coherence-based measures continue to gain traction in the development of classification models.


V.A. Future Direction
For future work, we recommend replicating this study using a larger dataset to ensure the findings are robust and generalizable. Additionally, it would be beneficial to evaluate and compare this method with various machine learning models across different connectivity frameworks, as this could help identify the most effective approach for capturing the complex neural patterns associated with MDD. Another promising direction is to explore the relationship between the model's classification performance at both the segment level and the participant level. By doing so, we may gain valuable insights into the potential of these models to serve as reliable diagnostic tools in clinical settings. Moreover, further investigation into how machine learning modelsespecially deep learning models-handle, learn, and detect the temporal properties of MDD could enhance our understanding of the disorder's dynamic nature. Such studies could reveal how these models capture changes over time in brain activity, which may be crucial for developing more precise and individualized treatment strategies.


VI. CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, this chapter demonstrates that CNN models, when paired with functional connectivity measures, are capable of effectively identifying potential neurobiological markers of MDD in both children and adolescents. Notably, the model achieved its strongest performance using the FFPDC metric, highlighting its suitability for such classification tasks. While these results are promising and suggest meaningful applications in clinical diagnostics, additional research is essential. This should include larger and more diverse participant samples, along with a thorough consideration of the various subtypes of depression and the influence of ongoing medication use. Such efforts are essential to better contextualize the identified neurobiological markers, moving beyond technical validation toward meaningful clinical interpretation. Ultimately, this approach can contribute to bridging the gap between research findings and practical applications-laying the groundwork for more personalized and precision-based approaches in neuropsychiatric diagnosis and treatment.

Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC): RANSAC is a robust method for detecting outliers. It identifies channels that consistently deviate from the expected signal pattern based on a consensus of other channels.The PyPREP pipeline is run with three iterations of RANSAC sample-wise. Detected bad channels are then interpolated and re-referenced based on the average of the remaining channels.

Figure 6 provides a detailed visualization of the normalized inter-ROI interactions across frequencies using the integrated gradient method. The results reveal distinct frequency and ROIdependent patterns: Delta is characterized by Center-FL and Center-OR HBN biased interactions, with Center-FR, Center-TL interactions, that are MDD biased. Theta has the highest inter-ROI interaction, with the strongest interaction being OR-TL, followed by OR-FR, which are HBN biased. While OL-FL, FR-FL and FL-Center being MDD biased. Alpha shows OR-FR and OR-FL interactions that are HBN biased, with FL-TL, FL-OL, FL-FR, FL-Center and Center-TL interactions that are MDD biased. While Beta does not exhibit any strong bias, except for FL-FR interaction, which is HBN biased. Gamma also shows no strong interaction, except for FL-TL toward the MDD class. Finally, in the combined frequency range, no strong bias is detected, with the strongest being OL-FR with MDD bias.

Figure
Figure 7 illustrates the normalized inter-ROI interactions using the PFI method across different frequency bands. Notably, within each frequency band, certain ROI interactions prominently contribute to the drop in the F1-score, indicating that the CNN model assigns particular importance to these specific ROIs. Additionally, interactions involving the Center ROI consistently appear across all frequency bands, highlighting its critical role in the model's decision-making process. In Delta, Center-TR, Center-OL, Center-OR, Center-FL, TL-OR and TR-FR. In Theta, Center-TL, Center-OL, Center-OR, OR-FR, OR-TR, OR-FL. In Alpha, only TR-OL and Center-OL are highlighted. In Beta, Center-TL, Center-TR and TL-FR are highlighted. In Gamma, Center-TL, Center-TR, Center-FR, TR-FL and OR-OL are highlighted. In the combined frequency bands, Center-OL, OR-TL and TR-FL are highlighted.
