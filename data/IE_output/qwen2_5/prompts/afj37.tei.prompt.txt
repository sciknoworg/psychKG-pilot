INTRODUCTION
Individuals who experience mathematics anxiety, or negative feelings and apprehension toward math, are hypothesized to engage in math avoidance behaviors, such as taking fewer mathrelated courses and pursuing fewer STEM-related occupations than their less-math-anxious peers 
(Ashcraft, 2002;
Hembree, 1990;
Maloney & Beilock, 2012)
. This theoretical link between math anxiety and math avoidance has significant implications for math performance, as it has been suggested to create a vicious cycle that results in limited math practice, poor math performance, increased math anxiety, and additional math avoidance 
(Ma & Xu, 2004)
. Despite the theoretical importance of math avoidance, however, there is little direct experimental evidence for the math anxiety-avoidance link.
One potential reason for the dearth in experimental research on math anxiety and avoidance is the absence of an empirical behavioral measure of math avoidance. Previous studies have used math course enrollment 
(Hembree, 1990;
Meece, Wigfield, & Eccles, 1990
) and testtaking strategies in math tests 
(D'Ailly & Bergering, 1992;
Dew, Galassi, & Galassi, 1984)
 as proxies for math avoidance but have yielded mixed results regarding the math anxiety and avoidance relation. Moreover, those proxies for math avoidance are confounded by math ability (i.e., it may be that math-anxious individuals avoid difficult math classes because they have low math ability rather than because they have high math anxiety), hampering the ability of those proxies to speak to the math anxiety-avoidance link. In this study, we developed a novel math avoidance paradigm that allows us to control for math ability and other confounds to experimentally investigate the direct relation between math anxiety and avoidance as well as explore potential mechanisms that underlie this relationship.
We hypothesize that math avoidance is related to individuals' perceptions of the costs and benefits associated with effortful math engagement, and that this perception depends on individual differences in math anxiety. This hypothesis is grounded in research on motivated behavior, which suggests that individuals make decisions based on a series of cost-benefit evaluations regarding task-related effort 
(Padoa-Schioppa, 2011)
. From this perspective, avoidance behavior can be theorized to emerge when an individual perceives the effort-based costs of an action to outweigh the benefits 
(Chong, Bonnelle, & Husain, 2016)
. Specifically, we hypothesize that math anxiety leads individuals to perceive math to be more effortful and/or less rewarding, thus making them avoid effortful math even when it is incentivized with a high reward. We also hypothesize that the relationship between math anxiety and effort avoidance would be exclusive to the context of math since math anxiety should not affect the perception of effort costs and benefits in non-math contexts. Taken together, these predictions create our mathspecific effort avoidance hypothesis. We preregistered our hypothesis at https://osf.io/9vpgm/ before conducting the confirmatory study.
To test our hypothesis, we measured individuals' effort avoidance in math and non-math contexts by using a novel effort-based decision-making task, in which cognitive, effort-based costs for solving math and word spelling problems were pitted against monetary benefits. Recent studies have used effort-based decision-making tasks to quantify human motivation and examine its relationship to disorders of motivation 
(Chong et al., 2016;
Green, Horan, Barch, & Gold, 2015;
Shenhav et al., 2017)
, which suggests that this type of paradigm may be particularly advantageous for studying the motivational patterns of individuals who experience math anxiety.
Through multiple experiments, we found evidence in support of our math-specific effort avoidance hypothesis: higher levels of math anxiety were selectively associated with higher levels of effort avoidance in the math conditionbut not the word conditioneven after adjusting for individual differences in math ability and controlling for related variables such as test anxiety and trait anxiety, which are known to be confounded with math anxiety 
(D'Ailly & Bergering, 1992;
Hembree, 1990)
.
Our paradigm provides a reliable behavioral measure of math avoidance, which fills a major void in the math anxiety literature. Our paradigm can also be used to facilitate the development of effective interventions to break the math anxiety-avoidance link. Addressing math avoidance behaviors can help break the vicious cycle of math anxiety and increase interest and success in STEM fields, and is therefore an important topic for future research.


RESULTS


Behavioral task and hypothesis
We collected data across a series of experiments in which participants performed our effortbased decision-making task, the choose-and-solve task (CAST; see 
Tables S1-2 for descriptive
 statistics and correlation matrix of the self-report and behavioral measures). Each CAST trial was either a math or word trial comprised of a "choose", "solve", and "feedback" phase. In the choose phase ( 
Fig. 1A
), participants were given 3 seconds to choose between two choice cards, one labeled "easy" and the other labeled "hard." "Easy" choice cards always offered a 2 cent reward for a correct response in the subsequent solve phase. "Hard" choice cards offered one of five possible reward amounts (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 cents) so that we could obtain a psychometric curve for choosing the hard option as a function of reward and decrease habituation to repeated conditions. After making a selection in the choose phase, participants progressed to the solve phase in which they were given 7 seconds to solve the corresponding easy or hard math/word problem ( 
Fig 1B)
. Participants then progressed to the feedback phase in which they received accuracy feedback on their problem-solving (i.e., correct vs incorrect) and were informed of the reward amount they earned for the problem.

The choose phase of the choose-and-solve task (CAST). In each CAST trial, participants were asked to choose between "easy" (i.e., low-effort) choice cards, which always offered 2 cents, and "hard" (i.e., high-effort) choice cards, which offered one of five possible reward amounts (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 cents). The domain (either math or word) of the choice cards was kept the same within a trial. (B) Four example problems in the solve phase of the CAST. Participants were asked to fill the blue square to make a correct equation (math) or an English word by selecting one of three options below. In word problems, '~' is used to in place of some characters to make problems harder. The problems were sorted by seven difficulty levels through a validation study (Supplementary Materials).

The dashed horizontal line represents the expected reward (the left vertical axis) of the easy option given the expected accuracy of 95%, and the black open circles represent the expected reward of the hard options, given the expected accuracy of 70%. The blue filled circles indicate the optimal choice probability of the hard options in each reward condition to maximize monetary reward based on expected reward values. (D) Math-specific effort avoidance hypothesis. The hard choice probability (HCP; the vertical axis) was defined by averaging the individual HCPs in the 4, 5, 6 cent conditions (panel C). We predicted that math anxiety would be negatively correlated with the math HCP (the red thick line) but not with word HCP (the black line).

In the CAST, we reasoned that a rational participant who is trying to maximize earnings would make choices based on the expected values of the easy and hard choice cards (i.e., choosing the option with higher expected value), which are determined by the reward at stake and expected accuracy. However, it is possible that less competent participants might avoid hard options because of their poor accuracy in solving hard problems. Thus, we aimed to maintain experienced accuracy at a constant level across participants to minimize the possibility that any observed differences in the choice behavior is driven by the variability in problem-solving accuracy arising from differences in participants' competence. To do so, we sorted a set of 1,999 math problems and a set of 1,858 word problems based on their solving difficulty (Supplementary Materials) and used an adaptive staircase procedure ( 
Fig. 2A
; Materials and Methods) to ensure that the difficulty of the hard problems was continuously adjusted in our task to target an accuracy of 70% regardless of participants' competence. As a result, the accuracy of the difficulty-adapted hard problems was around 70% (Study 1, math: 64.3±17.5%, M±SD, word: 68.8±9.3%; Study 2, math: 65.3±12.4%, word: 68.5±6.1%; 
Fig. 2B
), and the accuracy of the easy problems, which were all drawn from the easiest level of our sorting paradigm, was above 90% (Study 1, math: 95.4±6.0%, M±SD, word: 93.7±6.3%; Study 2, math: 93.2±6.9%, word: 92.5±7.2%).

Each circle represents a correct trial, and each x represents an incorrect trial. The difficulty trajectory around trial 120 (indicated with a dashed rectangle) is magnified in the top panel to illustrate the 2-up-1-down staircase procedure. The filled triangle and square symbols on the right indicate the average difficulty level (ADL). (B) Relationships between math/word ADL and resulting accuracy in the hard problems. Each circle represents a participant, and the horizontal dotted line at 70% indicates the target accuracy. The filled triangle and square symbols indicate the representative participants in (A). The histograms of the hard accuracy are plotted on the right vertical axes. (C) Relationship between math anxiety and math ADL. Each circle represents a participant, the solid lines are the significant regression lines (Study 1 (top): Pearson's r(134) = -.30, 95% CI 
[-.45, -.14]
, p < .001; Study 2 (bottom): r(330) = -.16, 95% CI 
[-.27, -.06]
, p = .003), and the gray shades represent the 95% confidence bands.
Given these accuracy levels, the hard choice cards that offered more than 3 cents warranted a higher expected value that that of the easy choice cards, which always offered 2 cents (e.g., a hard choice card offering 4 cents with a 70% accuracy rate would hold the expected value of 2.8 cents since 4 x .7 = 2.8; the open black circles in 
Fig. 1C
). Therefore, to maximize reward in the CAST one should choose the hard option when it offers more than 3 cents (the filled blue circles in 
Fig. 1C
). Based on this rationale, we merged trials in which the hard choice card offered 4, 5, and 6 cents and indexed the proportion of these trials in which participants chose the hard option. The proportion of hard choice card selection was also highly correlated across trials that offered 4, 5, and 6 cents (r > .9), further justifying our decision to merge these three trial types to form one index. This index serves as our dependent variable, which is referred to as participants' hard choice probability (HCP) and represents the proportion of trials in which participants selected the hard choice card when it was advantageous to do so. We obtained both math and word HCPs from each participant as the CAST included both math and word trials.
We hypothesized that math anxiety would be negatively correlated with the math HCP (the red thick line in 
Fig. 1D
), but would not be significantly correlated with word HCP (the black line in 
Fig. 1D
), leading to a significant interaction between the math and word conditions.
Findings in line with our hypotheses would suggest that math anxiety leads individuals to avoid effortful math even when it is incentivized with a high reward. Such findings would also suggest the relationship between math anxiety and effort avoidance is exclusive to the context of math.
Taken together, these predictions create our math-specific effort avoidance hypothesis 
(Fig. 1D
).


Assessing task validity and reliability
Before testing our hypotheses, we assessed the validity and reliability of the CAST-derived variables. Through the adaptive difficulty manipulation ( 
Fig. 2A)
, we obtained the average difficulty level (ADL) of the hard problems that each participant encountered, which might closely track their performance. Thus, we used math ADL to test the well-known negative association between math anxiety and math performance 
(Ashcraft & Kirk, 2001;
Dowker, Sarkar, & Looi, 2016;
Foley et al., 2017)
. Consistently, we found that math anxiety was significantly negatively correlated with math ADL ( suggesting that ADL is a good proxy for one's performance. Next, we examined the temporal stability of ADL and HCP within session to assess whether the CAST led to participant fatigue.
We reasoned that fatigue would lead to decreased performance and increased effort avoidance, resulting in the decrease in ADL and HCP across blocks and thus negative slopes. In contrast, however, the observed slopes of math/word ADL and HCP were significantly positive across blocks ( 
Fig. S1
; with an exception of Study 1 math HCP, which showed a nonsignificant positive slope), suggesting against participant fatigue. Finally, we examined the test-retest reliability of ADL and HCP between sessions that were 4-months apart (Studies 1 and 1R; Materials and Methods). We found significant positive test-retest correlations in all math/word ADL and HCP  
[.56, .78
], all ps < .001). Note that many cognitive tests that are widely used clinically and for research (e.g., working memory tasks) have test-retest correlations that are in the 0.3-0.7 range 
(Lowe & Rabbitt, 1998;
Piper et al., 2015)
. Together, these results show that the CAST provides reliable measures of performance and choice behavior.


Testing the math-specific effort avoidance hypothesis
To test the math-specific effort avoidance hypothesis, we conducted an exploratory study (Study 1) and examined the relationships between math anxiety and math/word HCP. We found that participants' HCP generally increased as the reward value for choosing the hard option increased in both the math and non-math conditions ( 
Fig 3A)
. We also found that math anxiety was negatively correlated with math HCP (the top left panel in 
Fig. 3B
; Pearson's r(140) = -.34, 95%
CI 
[-.48, -.19]
, p < .001) but not with word HCP (the top right panel in 
Fig. 3B
; r(140) = -.01, 95%
CI 
[-.18, .15]
, p = .86).

The circles and squares specify the HCP in each reward condition averaged across participants, and especially, the squares represent the conditions in which the hard choice is optimal (see 
Fig. 1C
). Filled red symbols specify the math condition, and open black symbols the word condition. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean (SEM) across participants. (B) Relationships between math anxiety, math HCP (left), and word HCP (right). Each circle represents a participant, the solid lines are the significant regression lines (the left Math panels; Study 1: r(140) = -.34, 95% CI 
[-.48, -.19]
, p < .001; Study 2: r(330) = -.15, 95% CI 
[-.26, -.05]
, p = .005), the dashed lines are the nonsignificant regression lines (the right Word panels; Study 1: r(140) = -.01, 95% CI 
[-.18, .15]
, p = .86; Study 2: r(330) = -.03, 95% CI [-.14, .08], p = .60), and the gray shades represent the 95% confidence bands. The histograms of HCP are plotted on the right vertical axes.
To examine whether the relationship between math anxiety and effort avoidance is exclusive to the context of math, we conducted a linear mixed-effect model (LMM) analysis to test the interaction between domain (math/word) and math anxiety on HCP ( 
Fig. 1D
). We controlled for variables related to individual differences in problem-solving such as hard vs. easy accuracy and response time (RT) since they were correlated with math anxiety 
(Table S1
) and could have confounded participants' choice behavior (see next section for more thorough explanation). In this model, the dependent variable was participants' HCP, and the fixed effects were domain, math anxiety, and their interaction. Also, participants' accuracy and RT of easy problems, accuracy and RT of hard problems, and ADL were added as fixed effects for the math and word conditions, respectively. The model (df = 267) explained 62.6% of the variance (adjusted R 2 ); the full results are presented in 
Table S3
. We found a significant effect of math anxiety (β = -0.12, 95% CI [-0.19, -0.05], p < .001) and a significant interaction between domain and math anxiety on HCP (interaction β = 0.11, 95% CI [0.04, 0.18], p = .001), confirming that the relationship between math anxiety and math HCP significantly differed compared to that between math anxiety and word HCP.
To replicate the findings from Study 1, we conducted a confirmatory study with a larger, age-restricted, and gender-balanced sample (Study 2) after pre-registration, https://osf.io/9vpgm. Again, we found that math anxiety was negatively correlated with math HCP (the bottom left panel in 
Fig. 3B
; r(330) = -.15, 95% CI 
[-.26, -.05]
, p = .005) but not with word HCP (the bottom right panel in 
Fig. 3B
; r(330) = -.03, 95% CI [-.14, .08], p = .60). Since the problem-solving variables in Study 2, such as hard vs. easy accuracy and RT, were also correlated with math anxiety, even in the word condition 
(Table S2)
, we conducted a LMM analysis in the same manner as in Study 1 to test the math-specific effort avoidance while controlling for the problemsolving variables. The model (df = 655) explained 71.6% of the variance (adjusted R 2 ), and the full results are presented in 
Table S4
. Again, we confirmed a significant effect of math anxiety (β = -0.05, 95% CI [-0.09, -0.00], p = .03) and a significant interaction between domain and math anxiety on HCP (interaction β = 0.06, 95% CI [0.02, 0.10], p = .003). These results demonstrate that individuals who experience math anxiety choose to avoid exerting greater levels of effort in math, even when it is highly rewarded, and provide a strong evidence for the math-specific effort avoidance hypothesis.


Examining potential problem-solving confounds on the math-specific effort avoidance
Our finding of the math-specific effort avoidance may have been confounded by at least two problem-solving behaviors that are less related to math anxiety. First, participants only received rewards when they solved problems correctly, so their problem-solving accuracy may have affected their perceived value of the hard options and their choice behavior. Despite our efforts to hold the accuracy constant with a computer-adaptive paradigm, we observed a significant negative correlation between math anxiety and hard math accuracy (i.e., the higher the math anxiety, the lower the math accuracy; Tables S1-2, see 
Fig. S3A
 for Study 2 results). Based on this correlation, one could argue that participants with math anxiety avoided hard math because they experienced lower hard math accuracy than their less-math-anxious peers. However, we also observed a significant negative correlation between math anxiety and hard word accuracy in Study 2, r(330) = -.21, 95% CI 
[-.31, -.11]
, p < .001 ( 
Fig. S3B
), but did not observe word effort avoidance 
(Fig. 3B
). Moreover, we confirmed a significant association between math anxiety and math HCP even after controlling for problem-solving variables (Tables S3-4). These results suggest that the math-specific effort avoidance cannot be explained by differences in problemsolving accuracy.
Second, participants with math anxiety may have avoided hard math problems because they did not expect to solve these problems within the 7-second time limit. We examined math anxiety in relation to the proportion of hard trials in which participants ran out of time while solving problems ( 
Fig. S3C
) and found that all participants provided responses to most of the hard math problems within the time limit (the proportion of hard math timeout: 4.4±5.4%, M±SD, range [0%, 36.4%]) and that the proportion was not significantly correlated with math anxiety in Study 2, r(328) = -.05, 95% CI 
[-.16, .06]
, p = .39, ruling out this possibility.
Moreover, we found that math anxiety was negatively correlated with the amount of time spent on solving hard math problems (i.e, the higher the math anxiety, the shorter the problem-solving time for hard math), r(330) = -.18, 95% CI [-.29, -.07], p = .001 ( 
Fig. S3C
). This suggests that participants with higher levels of math anxiety may have been engaging in even greater math effort avoidance by "guessing" on hard math problems, a speculation which is also supported by the significant negative correlation between math anxiety and hard math accuracy (Tables S1-2).


Linking math-specific component of math anxiety and math effort avoidance
Previous research 
(Hembree, 1990)
 reported that math anxiety is correlated with other types of anxiety, such as test anxiety and trait anxiety. Similarly, we found that math anxiety was positively correlated with test anxiety, trait anxiety, and reading anxiety in our samples 
(Tables   S1-2
). Thus, it is possible that the observed association between math anxiety and math effort avoidance could be driven by the non-math-specific, general component of anxiety that is shared across math anxiety and other types of anxiety as suggested by previous research (D 
'Ailly & Bergering, 1992
).
Therefore, we tested whether the association between math anxiety and math effort avoidance holds after controlling for other types of anxiety by conducting comprehensive LMM analyses on Study 1 (df = 116, adjusted R 2 =41.6%; see 
Table S5
 for details) and Study 2 (df = 321, adjusted R 2 =47.0%; see 
Table 1
 for details). The variables related to problem-solving, such as math ADL and accuracy/RT of easy and hard math, were added as fixed effects, as those were correlated with both math anxiety and math HCP (Tables S1-2). We confirmed a significant effect of math anxiety on math HCP (Study 1: β = -0.19, 95% CI [-0.30, -0.09], Study 2: β = -0.09, 95% CI [-0.14, -0.04], both ps < .001) after controlling for these variables, suggesting that math effort avoidance is driven by the math-specific component of math anxiety. We also ran generalized binomial regression analyses in order to address the non-normal distribution of math HCP (see the histogram of math HCP in the right vertical axes in 
Fig. 3B
), and confirmed a significant effect of math anxiety on math HCP (Study 1: β = -1.22, 95% CI [-2.23, -0.20], p = .02; Study 2: β = -0.49, 95% CI [-0.92, -0.03], p = .03; see Tables S6-7 for the full results).
Taken together, these findings establish a robust link between math anxiety and math effort avoidance. Notes. Dependent variable: math HCP. Independent variables were not transformed. Random effects: the random intercepts for age, gender, education level, highest level of math taken, current math-taking, ethnicity, race, and income. All 332 rows (participants) were entered into the model. The maximum likelihood estimation method was used to fit the model. df = 321. Adjusted R 2 = 47.04%. 95% confidence intervals are stated beside the βs.


DISCUSSION
Math anxiety has long been hypothesized to be associated with math avoidance 
(Ashcraft, 2002;
Dutton, 1951;
Hembree, 1990;
Richardson & Suinn, 1972)
. However, little research has directly investigated this relationship and potential underlying mechanisms, most likely due to the absence of a reliable avoidance measure. We aimed to fill this void in the literature with our novel effort-based decision-making paradigm, the "Choose-and-Solve" task (CAST; 
Figs. 1-2
).
By developing a paradigm in which one can manipulate the levels of effort and reward associated with solving math and non-math problems, we demonstrated that math anxiety is associated with math-specific effort avoidance over and above math performance 
(Fig. 3)
.
Moreover, the association between math anxiety and math effort avoidance remained significant after controlling for other types of anxiety 
(Table 1
), suggesting that the math-specific component of math anxiety drives math-specific effort avoidance. Together, these results experimentally establish a robust math anxiety-avoidance link.
Why do individuals with math anxiety avoid exerting effort in math even when it is highly rewarded? Theories of economic decision-making suggest that such avoidance may relate to individuals' subjective valuation of the effort-based costs and rewards associated with a given task 
(Chong et al., 2016;
Padoa-Schioppa, 2011)
. Based on our findings, we argue that individuals with math anxiety avoid the high-reward, high-effort math options because they perceive the costs of effortful math engagement to outweigh its benefits. Unfortunately, however, this behavioral study cannot differentiate whether math effort avoidance is due to decreased valuation of math-related rewards, greater anticipation of math effort costs, or both.
How could math anxiety lead to less valuation of reward and/or greater anticipation of cognitive effort in math contexts? Recent research using functional magnetic resonance imaging shows that math anxiety activates the pain network in anticipation of doing math 
(Lyons & Beilock, 2012b)
 and the fear network while either performing math 
(Supekar, Iuculano, Chen, & Menon, 2015;
Young, Wu, & Menon, 2012)
 or simply viewing mathematical symbols for a brief period 
(Pizzie & Kraemer, 2017)
. These pain and fear-related neural activations suggest that math anxiety may lead individuals to experience a concrete, visceral sensation of pain and/or fear in math situations, the sensation which may heavily discount the reward associated with math.
This speculation is supported by previous research 
(Talmi, Dayan, Kiebel, Frith, & Dolan, 2009)
 demonstrating that pain-associated monetary reward evokes attenuated neural activation in the ventral striatum, the brain region which encodes expected reward 
(Preuschoff, Bossaerts, & Quartz, 2006)
. Simultaneously, regulating such visceral sensation requires substantial cognitive effort 
(Gyurak, Gross, & Etkin, 2011)
, so it is highly likely that individuals with math anxiety would have to exert cognitive effort in math-related situations 
(Ashcraft & Kirk, 2001
).
Interestingly, math-anxious individuals who are able to employ greater cognitive control may be able to overcome the adverse effects of math anxiety 
(Lyons & Beilock, 2012a)
.
Among a few differences between Studies 1 and 2, it is worth nothing that the observed correlation between math anxiety and math HCP was smaller in Study 2 (r = -.15 vs. -.37 in Study 1 
; Fig 3)
, although both correlations were significant. Why are the correlation values different? In our analysis of the data from Study 1, we found that a few participants completely avoided solving hard problems by always choosing easy options. Realizing that calculating math/word ADL requires participants to solve a minimum number of hard problems, we introduced no-choice trials in Study 2 so that participants had to solve at least 10 hard math and 10 hard word problems. It is possible that this forced exposure to hard math problems during the task reduced math effort avoidance in Study 2. Consistently, exposure therapy is known to be effective at reversing avoidance behavior in other forms of anxiety and phobia 
(Abramowitz, Deacon, & Whiteside, 2012)
, and increasing math exposure through computer games 
(Jansen et al., 2013)
 or intensive tutoring 
(Supekar et al., 2015)
 has been shown to improve math performance in students with math anxiety. Thus, future research should investigate whether and how math exposure can reverse math effort avoidance and counteract math anxiety. In doing so, the CAST paradigm can be used to provide an objective measure of math avoidance behavior.
Choosing to avoid challenging math can start a vicious cycle of math anxiety that results in limited math practice, poor math performance, increased math anxiety, and additional math avoidance 
(Ma & Xu, 2004)
. Students with math anxiety often choose to take fewer math-related courses and consequently pursue fewer STEM-related occupations than their less-anxious peers 
(Ashcraft, 2002;
Hembree, 1990;
Maloney & Beilock, 2012)
. By tackling math avoidance early, we may be able to break this vicious cycle before critical academic and occupational choices are made. We envision that our novel task, the CAST, will be used to identify young children and adolescents who have trouble putting effort into math so that targeted interventions can be introduced to reduce their math avoidance and math anxiety. Future research should therefore explore the utility of the CAST in more naturalistic settings in order to validate and optimize its effectiveness for early identification of math effort avoidance.


MATERIALS AND METHODS


Experimental design
To assess the relationship between math anxiety and willingness to exert effort in a math and non-math context, we utilized questionnaires and a novel effort-based decision-making task, the choose-and-solve task (CAST). Here we report all experimental conditions, measures, and data exclusion criteria. Studies 1 and 1R were not formally preregistered. The preregistration for Study 2 can be accessed at the Center for Open Science (https://osf.io/9vpgm/). The materials, de-identified data, and analysis scripts are openly available at https://osf.io/t4wju/. They were compensated with a combination of base amount and a performance-based bonus in the CAST (described in the Experimental Procedure section). We limited the analyses to those who passed the problem-solving accuracy criteria (described in the Choose-And-Solve Task section). Outliers were not excluded. 


Participants


Questionnaires
To measure math anxiety, we administered the short Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (sMARS; 
(Alexander & Martray, 1989)
). Participants responded to questions about how anxious they would feel in different math-related situations (e.g., "signing up for a math course", "studying for a math test") on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = a fair amount, 4 = much, 5 = very much). All analyses were conducted on the average of the 25 items for each participant. (Cronbach's αs = .97 for both Studies 1 and 2). To isolate math-specific component of math anxiety, we also used an adaptation of the sMARS designed to measure anxiety about reading (e.g., "signing up for an English course" and "studying for an English test"), dubbed the short Reading Anxiety Rating Scale (sRARS; αs = .97 for both studies).
To control for other forms of anxiety, we also measured participant's trait anxiety, test anxiety, and social desirability. Trait anxiety was assessed using the trait component of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 
(Spielberger, 1983)
, in which participants rated how frequently they experienced feelings of anxiety and calmness (e.g., "I feel nervous and restless" and "I make decisions easily"). Test anxiety was assessed using the Test Anxiety Inventory 
(Spielberger, 1980)
, in which participants rated how anxious they feel in 20 test-related situations.(e.g., "during tests I feel very tense" and "I feel confident and relaxed while taking tests"). In both measures, items were scored on a 1-4 scale and reverse coded where appropriate. Scores were summed for a composite measure of 20-80 (trait anxiety: αs = .96 for both Studies 1 and 2; test anxiety: αs = .96), with a higher value indicating higher level of trait or test anxiety. Social desirability was measured using the Marlowe-Crowne social desirability scale ( 
(Crowne & Marlowe, 1960)
; α = .89 for Study 1 and α = .88 for Study 2) to check the underreporting of anxiety 
(Weinberger, Schwartz, & Davidson, 1979)
.
We also administered the single-item math/reading anxiety scale (Núñez-Peña, Guilera, & Suárez-Pellicioni, 2014), and the self-math/reading overlap 
(Necka, Moriah Sokolowski, & Lyons, 2015)
, the results of which are not reported here. Summary statistics and correlation matrix of self-report and behavioral measures are reported in Tables S1-2.


The choose-and-solve task
In the CAST, participants were asked to make a series of binary choices on their willingness to put effort into solving a math or word problem for varying monetary reward. Each CAST trial comprised a "choose", "solve", and "feedback" phase.
Choose phase. Participants first entered the choose phase and were shown a screen containing two choice cards on the left and right sides of the screen (e.g., 
Fig. 1A)
; "easy" choice cards always offered 2 cents and "hard" choice cards offered one of five possible reward amounts (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 cents). The domain (i.e., math or word) of the choice cards was kept the same within a trial. Participants were given 3 seconds to select a card by pressing one of two designated keys (the "i" key for the choice card seen on the left side of the screen and the "p" key for the choice card seen on the right side of the screen). If they did not make a selection within 3 seconds, they were automatically directed to an easy problem with 1 cent. The critical dependent measures in the CAST were the hard math and word choice probabilities (math and word HCPs; i.e., probability of choosing the hard choice cards that offer more than 3 cents) because choosing the hard choice cards that offer more than 3 cents was always in the participants' best financial interest (see 
Fig. 1C
).
Solve and feedback phases. Participants then entered the solve phase, in which they were
given 7 seconds to solve a 3-alternative problem (e.g., 
Fig. 1B
) based on their selection of the choice card in the choose phase (i.e., easy or hard). The problem was drawn from a large pool of problems that were sorted by seven difficulty levels through a prior validation study (see the Supplementary Materials for details). When participants chose the easy card, problems in the easiest level were given. The difficulty of hard problems was continuously calibrated to a target accuracy of 70% regardless of participants' competence using a 2-up-1-down staircase method;
the difficulty level increased after two successive correct trials, with the maximum level of 7 (the hardest level), and decreased after one incorrect trial, with the minimum level of 2 (see 
Fig. S1A
 for two exemplar participants). Capitalizing on the adaptive difficulty calibration, the math and word difficulty levels (ADLs) were defined as the average level of the hard problems that one encountered.
In math trials, participants were presented with a multi-digit multiplication problem whose solution was missing one digit. They were provided with an answer bank of three digits and were given 7 seconds to select the missing digit from the three options. In word trials, participants were provided with common English words with one letter removed. Again, they were provided with an answer bank of three letters and were given 7 seconds to select the missing letter from the three options to complete the word. Participants made their selection by pressing one of three designated keys ("i", "o", and "p" for the left, middle, and right options, respectively). To discourage participants from making quick guesses, key responses were not registered by the paradigm until 1.5 seconds after problem onset. After participants entered their selection or the time was up, the correct answer was displayed along with the number of remaining trials, and if correct, the reward offered was added to the total reward. Participants then proceeded to the next trial at their own pace by pressing the enter or space key.
The problem-solving accuracy criteria were based on participants' performance in easy math and word problems, which were expected to yield over 90% accuracy; participants whose accuracy was below 70% in either easy math or word problems were excluded from the analysis because their perception of expected rewards was assumed to be very different to the majority of participants, whose accuracy was over 90%. We preregistered this exclusion criteria in Study 2.
No-choice trials. Calculating the math/word competence and easy problem accuracy requires participants to solve a minimum number of both hard and easy problems. However, in Study 1 seven participants never chose the hard choice card, and two participants never chose the easy choice card. To address this issue in Study 2, we introduced the no-choice trials in which only one choice card was presented during the choose phase. In these trials, participants were instructed to accept the single choice card by pressing the key corresponding to the side of the screen that the card was presented on (i.e., "i" for left and "p" for right); unlike in the choice trials, the solve phase of these no-choice trials did not begin until they pressed the corresponding key. In Study 2, forty no-choice trials were included (ten easy math, ten hard math, ten easy word, ten hard word); easy choice cards were always valued at 2 cents, and hard choice cards were always valued at 5 cents. These no-choice trials ensured that participants encountered a minimum number of both easy and hard problems throughout the task that could be used to calculate their math/word competence and easy problem accuracy.


Experimental procedure
Each study was uploaded as a human intelligence task (HIT) on Amazon Mechanical Turk to be completed in one session. After providing informed consent, participants first completed a series of questionnaires in the following order: math anxiety (sMARS), reading anxiety (sRARS), reading motivation questions, math motivation questions, self-math/reading overlap, single-item math/reading anxiety, trait anxiety, test anxiety, and social desirability. Ten attention check questions were embedded throughout the questionnaires; if participants missed more than two attention checks, the study session was terminated. Demographics such as gender, age, and race were collected after participants completed questionnaires and the CAST.
Participants then performed the CAST, which started with practice blocks to train them on the problem format, button keys, and time restrictions. The first two practice blocks were designed to familiarize participants with the solve phase of task: all participants solved the same 12 math problems in the first block and the same 12 word problems in the second block (with presentation order fixed in ascending difficulty). The third practice block mirrored the design of the main CAST blocks (20 trials in Studies 1 and 1R; 28 trials in Study 2), though no monetary reward was given for performance during practice. In the main portion of the CAST, in which the performance-based bonus was determined, participants in Study 1 completed two blocks that each contained 50 math choice trials and 50 word choice trials (200 trials total), participants in Study 1R completed five blocks that each contained ten math choice trials and ten word choice trials (100 trials total), and participants in Study 2 completed five blocks that each contained ten math choice trials, ten word choice trials, four no-choice math trials, and four no-choice word trials (140 trials total). The location of the choice cards (left vs. right) was counterbalanced within each block. The difficulty calibration for hard problems began in the the practice CAST block and continued through the main blocks. The initial difficulty level was set at level four and was adjusted on a trial-by-trial basis according to one's performance; as a result, each participant may have encountered different problems during the practice CAST block and afterward. The CAST was implemented in jsPsych (de Leeuw, 2014), so that it could be administered over the Internet and run on participants' web browsers. A working version of the CAST used in Study 2
(including the practice blocks) is at https://kywch.github.io/CAST_jsPsych/choose-and-solvetask.html.
Compensation for each study is as follows. Each Study 1 session comprised the questionnaires, the practice blocks, 200 trials of the CAST without the no-choice trials, post-task questions, a perceptual metacognition task ( 
(Fleming, Weil, Nagy, Dolan, & Rees, 2010)
; not reported here), and demographic questions. Participants were paid the base of $1.50 plus performance-based bonus of up to $8.00 (total: M = $7.55, SD = $0.62). Each Study 1R (i.e., the retest of Study 1) session comprised the CAST and post-task questions only: 100 trials of the CAST without the no-choice trials and 100 trials of the pilot version of modified CAST (not reported here). Participants were paid the base of $3.00 plus performance-based bonus of up to $8.80 (total: M = $9.56, SD = $0.74) Each Study 2 session comprised the questionnaires, 140 trials (including 40 no-choice trials) of the CAST, post-task questions, and demographic questions. Participants were paid the base of $2.00 plus performance-based bonus of up to $5.40
(total: M = $5.46, SD = $0.58). The pdf version of Study 2 Qualtrics survey is available at https://osf.io/t4wju/.


Statistical analysis
All statistical tests were performed using MATLAB R2015b. The corrcoef function was used to calculate the effect size (95% CI) of Pearson's correlation, the polyfit and polyconf functions were used to calculate the 95% confidence band of a regression, and the anova1 function was used to calculate F statistics. Cronbach alpha was calculated using the CronbachAlpha function, which can be obtained from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38320. To perform the participant-level linear regression analyses, the fitlme function in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox was used, which allows incorporating random effects. The regression results were replicated using the fitglm function when the binomial distribution was specified for the math HCP. The independent variables were not transformed.


SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS


Section S1. Participants: Recruitment details
As indicated in the main text, participants were recruited using TurkPrime to complete the online study via the online labor market Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), in which workers perform human intelligence tasks (HITs) for requesters. The study was conducted during weekdays only;
participation was allowed only between 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. CST. When participants failed more than two (out of ten) attention check questions embedded in the questionnaires that preceded the choose-and-solve task (CAST), the study session was terminated.
In Study 1, AMT worker qualifications included location in the United States, a HIT approval rate greater than or equal to 98%, and the number of HITs approved greater than or equal to 5,000. Sample size of 194 was set to detect an expected correlation of .2 between selfreported and behavioral measures with 80% power at a 5% significance level. However, only 154 participants were able to completed the study due to computer errors; demographic information from 9 (out of 154) participants were also lost due to computer errors.
In Study 2, TurkPrime Panel Options was used to recruit specific demographic groups without asking demographic information before the questionnaires and CAST, which may trigger stereotype threats and affect affect the self-report and behavioral measures. Specifically, we targeted 188 female and 188 male participants who speak English as their first language and are between the ages of 18 and 35, together with the AMT worker qualifications of location in the United States, a HIT approval rate greater than or equal to 90%, and the number of HITs approved greater than or equal to 500.


Section S2. The Choose-And-Solve Task: Creation and validation of the problem set
Math problems: To create a large pool of 3-alternative choice math problems, candidate math problems were first generated by multiplying a list of 3-digit numbers (100-999) with a list of 1digit numbers (2-9), and by multiplying a different list of 3-digit numbers (100-299) with a list of 2-digit numbers 
(11)
(12)
(13)
(14)
(15)
(16)

(19)
. A new list of 3x1-digit problems whose solutions did not exceed 3000 and 3x2-digit problems whose solutions did not exceed 6000 were compiled, and 1500 problems from this set were randomly selected for further validation. The set of 1500 problems was adapted to fit our paradigm by removing one digit from the solution of each problem. The missing digit, which could be the 1 st , 2 nd , or 3 rd digit in the solution, was then used as one of the 3 alternative choices participants could select to solve the problem. An attempt was made to balance the frequency with which digits 0-9 were removed across problems. The other two alternative choices were always one unit higher and one unit lower than the removed digit (i.e. if "2" was the removed digit, the 3-alternative choice options would be "1, 2, 3").
Word problems: A list of candidate word-spelling problems were first generated from a list of 350,000 English words downloaded from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words; all words that were 4-13 characters long that had the letters a, e, i, n, r, or t as their third letter were selected for testing. Words with common prefixes 
(i.e., tra-, cha-, gra-, pre-, ove-, uni-, con-, thr-, per-, for-, str-, par-, mar-, sur-, int-, ret-, aut-, ent-, out-. ext-, and ant-)
 were removed from the list. Word-spelling problems were then created by replacing the third letter of each word with a blank space. Additional letters of some words were replaced by a tilde (~) to make it harder to determine which letter should go in the blank space. Tildes replaced the second letter of words that were 5-7 characters long (e.g., EVENTS → E~☐NTS), both the second letter and the sixth letter of words that were 8-10 characters long (e.g., EVIDENCE → E~☐DE~CE), and the sixth and ninth letters of words that were 11-13 characters long (e.g., ANNOUNCEMENTS → A~☐OU~CE~ENTS). Words that became the same after having letters replaced with tildes were removed from the testing set. The solution to the word-spelling problem, which was always the third letter of the word (which we replaced by the blank space), was included as one of the three alternative choices participants could select to solve the problem; the 3-alternative choice sets were always either (a, e, and i; if the solution was either a, e, or i) or (n, r, t; if the solution was either n, r, or t), presented in this order. All letters in the word-spelling problems were presented in capital letters.
Problem set validation: Candidate math and word problems were grouped into sets of 60
to create 25 sets of math problems and 31 sets of word problems. Word problems were grouped so that 10 problems for each letter solution 
(a, e, i, n, r, and t)
 were included in the set. The positioning (left, middle, right) of the problem's solution in the solution bank was balanced across the problems in each math and word set. Each problem had to be solved within 8 seconds, however, key responses were not registered by the paradigm until 2 seconds after problem onset to discourage participants from making quick guesses. These sets were then uploaded to AMT as 56 separate HITs (25 math and 31 word HITs) that paid $1.50 each. The maximum of two math HITs and two word HITs were uploaded per day.
50 AMT workers were recruited to complete first ten of the math and word HITs, and 30 workers were recruited to complete the remaining 15 math HITS and 21 word HITs. AMT worker qualifications included location in the United States, a HIT approval rate greater than or equal to 98%, and number of HITs approved greater than or equal to 5,000. Workers provided informed consent before completing the HITs. Data from workers who got less than 28 (out of 60) problems were discarded. 692 unique workers completed at least one HIT (333 unique math workers, 545 unique word workers); 24 workers completed 10 or more math HITs, and 14 workers completed 14 or more word HITs. Workers' response time and accuracy were used to sort 1,999 math problems and 1,858 word problems into seven difficulty levels, which are available at https://osf.io/t4wju/.
