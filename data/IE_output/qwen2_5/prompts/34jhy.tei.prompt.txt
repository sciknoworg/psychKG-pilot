You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

overwhelmed, making decision-making more difficult and less satisfying (choice overload; 
Chernev et al., 2012;
Iyengar & Lepper, 2000)
. The SIV phenomenon suggests that when simultaneous comparison of all options is not required, participants can make choices that align with their intrinsic preferences in situations where there are sufficient options and opportunities for making choices, even when influenced by extrinsically learned values. Importantly, SIV does not manifest in all individuals, while its degree varies among participants. One analysis using open data from 
Zhu et al. (2024a)
 revealed that 23.68% of participants chose HP stimuli more frequently than N1, highlighting the existence of individual differences in the extent to which extrinsically and intrinsically learned values are distinguished. In other words, variations in SIV reflect individual differences in whether extrinsically or intrinsically learned values are prioritized in


IDM.
The factors underlying these individual differences in whether people prioritize extrinsically learned values or intrinsically learned values remain poorly understood. One potential factor is the long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) of intrinsic brain activity. The LRTC reflects the slow decay of the autocorrelation in neural activity 
(Hardstone et al., 2012;
Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001;
Poil et al., 2012)
, and arises from a critical brain state. This state is characterized by a balanced condition of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections 
(Avramiea et al., 2022;
Poil et al., 2012)
, that optimizes the brain's ability to balance change and stability 
(Avramiea et al., 2022;
Bak et al., 1987;
Chialvo, 2010;
Liang et al., 2018;
Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001;
Meisel et al., 2017;
Shew and Plenz, 2013)
.
The relationship between SIV and LRTC can be inferred from the results of previous research, which showed that a higher LRTC was associated with behaviors reflecting both changes and the stability of preferences as intrinsically learned values.
SIV arises during the process of intrinsic value learning through the CIPC in the IDM (see 
Figure 1
(b)). 
Colosio et al. (2017)
 previously reported that participants with a higher alpha-range LRTC exhibited greater CIPC. Similarly, 
Nakao et al. (2019)
 showed that participants with higher LRTC demonstrated more autocorrelated choice behavior in the IDM, where stimuli chosen once were more likely to be chosen again.
This autocorrelated behavior occurs because of CIPC in IDM tasks involving repeated presentations of the same stimulus, and is more clearly observed when the intrinsically learned value is consistently reflected in the IDM without being contaminated by noise, -that is, by influences unrelated to the intrinsically learned value 
(Nakao et al., 2019
(Nakao et al., , 2016
. Collectively, these findings indicate that individuals with higher LRTC are more susceptible to value changes through CIPC, and reflect these values more consistently in the IDM because of the reduced influence of noise. Because the intrinsically learned values of new stimuli in the IDM are formed through CIPC, individuals with higher LRTC could be expected to have higher intrinsically learned values for new stimuli, including N1. Moreover, since individuals with higher LRTC are less influenced by noise in IDM 
(Nakao et al., 2019)
, thus, it can be predicted that extrinsically learned values are less reflected in IDM, leading to HP stimuli being chosen less frequently.
Because SIV arises when N1 is chosen more frequently than HP, individuals with a higher LRTC are expected to exhibit a greater SIV. However, the relationship between LRTC and the balance between extrinsically and intrinsically learned values in IDM has yet to be demonstrated.
Although 
Colosio et al. (2017)
 and 
Nakao et al. (2019)
 explored the relationship between LRTC and CIPC or autocorrelated behavior in IDM, they did not investigate the influence of extrinsically learned values in IDM. Clarifying this relationship will be essential to understand how the brain balances external and internal criteria in everyday decision-making processes.
The present study aimed to clarify the relationship between LRTC and the balance of two value criteria in the IDM, as reflected by the individual differences in the SIV phenomenon. Specifically, this study tested whether individuals with greater alpha-range LRTC exhibited more SIV, as indicated by a higher N1 value and lower HP value in the IDM. We report the results of the SIV, calculated from the final value at the end of the IDM task 
(Figure 1(b)
), estimated by the computational model implemented with CIPC. The results for the chosen frequency are also provided in the Supplemental Materials. Although the differences in the final value of the stimuli reflect variations in the chosen frequency, the final value is estimated by tracking value changes across trials, taking into account the order of presentation of stimulus pairs. Therefore, the final value serves as a more detailed indicator than the chosen frequency.
In addition to the SIV, we calculate the ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials of IDM, which involve a combination of old stimuli from EDM and new stimuli for IDM, as an additional index of the balance between intrinsically and extrinsically learned values. We subsequently examined whether a higher LRTC was associated with a higher ratio of new stimuli chosen in the old-new trials.
We applied the paradigm used in the prior study of 
Zhu et al. (2024a)
, in which participants first performed the EDM task, followed by the IDM task (see 
Figure 1
(c)).
In contrast to the study by 
Zhu et al. (2024a)
, we performed electroencephalography (EEG) during the eyes-closed (EC) resting state three times: before the EDM task (EC1), between the EDM and IDM tasks (EC2), and after the IDM task (EC3). EC1, compared to EC2 and EC3, reflects relatively pure intrinsic brain activity, and is unaffected by task-related influences. If the intrinsic brain activity is associated with SIV, we would expect to observe a positive correlation between SIV and EC1. Furthermore, if this intrinsic activity remains consistent before and after decision-making tasks and correlates with SIV, we would expect to observe a common positive correlation across all three resting states. (left) and IDM (right), the influence of EDM on IDM (blue dashed arrow), and the SIV phenomenon (far right). In EDM, the value of a chosen stimulus increases in the presence of a reward feedback, and decreases when feedback is absent. HP stimuli, which have a high reward probability, acquire high extrinsically learned value. The high value is carried over to IDM as the initial value of HP stimuli (blue dashed arrow 
;
Zhu et al., 2024a)
. In IDM, the value of a stimulus increases when chosen, and decreases when not (CIPC). Although HP stimuli are selected in IDM due to their high initial value, they are less preferred compared to N1, the most preferred new stimulus. This phenomenon is referred to as SIV 
(Zhu et al., 2024a)
. LP represents a stimulus with a low probability of reward in EDM, while N11 denotes the least preferred new stimulus in IDM. In 
Zhu et al. (2024a)
, as well as the present study, two sets of four stimuli were used in EDM, and the four stimuli plus 11 new stimuli were used in IDM. This figure only displays the value changes for four stimuli. The values presented are examples estimated using a computational model based on the participants' behavioral data in this study. (c) Schematic diagram of the experimental procedure. EC stands for eyes closed resting state and RT stands for reaction time.

Materials and methods


Participants
A power test for correlation analysis (statistical power = 0.80, type I error probability = 0.05, effect size = 0.30) was conducted to determine the required sample size. Considering a potential reduction in sample size due to data recording and EEG preprocessing issues, the experiment was conducted in 94 healthy Japanese university students (49 male, 43 female, 2 other; 91 right-handed; mean age = 20.35, age range = 18-31 years). All participants were native speakers of Japanese with either normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Graduate School of Education at the University of Hiroshima. All participants provided written informed consent prior to study participation, in line with the guidelines set by the Hiroshima University Research Ethics Committee. Participants were compensated for their participation in the study.
EEG data from five participants and behavioral data from one participant were unavailable due to recording issues. After resting EEG automatized preprocessing, one participant was excluded because of the removal of 19 EEG channels (the mean number of channels removed for the included participants was 0.225), while two others were excluded because they retained fewer than 10 independent components (ICs; the mean retained ICs for the included participants was 21.513). Additionally, four participants excluded from further analysis due to a correct response rate in the EDM task below the mean minus two standard deviations (SD; range was 0.49-0.59), as they were deemed to lack sufficient task engagement and extrinsic value learning in EDM. The correct response rates for the remaining participants ranged from 0.67-1.00. In total, 81 participants were included in the final analysis (40 males, 39 female, two other; 78 right-handed; mean age = 20.37, age range = 18-31).


Stimuli
The same 15 stimuli used in 
Zhu et al. (2024a)
, derived from the novel contour shapes created in 
Endo et al. (2003)
, were utilized. These shapes are identified by the numbers 
29,

45,

, and 92 in the study by 
Endo et al. (2003)
. The 15 selected stimuli exhibited moderate width (mean = 5.5, SD = 1.8), complexity (mean = 5.1, SD = 1.4), symmetry (mean = 3.7, SD = 1.7), smoothness (mean = 4.6, SD = 1.7), and orientations (mean = 5.0, SD = 2.1), as quantified on a 1 to 9-point rating scale by 
Endo et al. (2003)
. Additionally, the shapes showed a relatively low association score (mean = 65.71, SD = 6.84), defined as the percentage of respondents who could not name a particular object, but could describe how it resembled something when asked for the name of the shape 
(Endo et al., 2003)
.
The size of the images was 800 Ã— 600 pixels, while the participants viewed the image pairs at a 30-degree angle of view. PsychoPy software 
(Peirce et al., 2019)
 running on the Windows 10 operating system was used to present each stimulus pair on a white background on a 1920 Ã— 1080 monitor. The stimuli were presented side-by-side on the left and right sides of the screen.
The presentation order of the shapes and trial sequences were randomized across participants.


Task
All participants first completed the EDM task, followed by the IDM task 
(Figure 1(c)
), to examine SIV, which reflects the influence of extrinsically learned values acquired in EDM on IDM. In the EDM task, which is a reward learning task, four novel contour shapes were randomly selected from 15 shapes, and two shape pairs were randomly created for each participant. Participants completed two blocks of 50 trials, yielding 100 trials in total. Each trial was initiated with the presentation of a fixation cross for a randomly selected duration of 5,000 ms, 5,500 ms, or 6,000 ms.
These pre-stimulus durations were longer than those employed in 
Zhu et al. (2024a)
 to explore the relationship between pre-stimulus neural activity complexity and poststimulus trial-to-trial variability of neural activity, as observed in 
Wolff et al., (2019)
, although this was not the subject of the present study. Two shapes were presented on either side of the fixation cross. Stimulus sets and positions were randomized for each trial. Participants were instructed to press the "F" (left) or "J" (right) keys on a standard keyboard to select the shape they believed to be correct, responding as quickly and accurately as possible. Participants received feedback on their choice 1,500 ms after they provided the choice response; this feedback, which indicated whether their response was correct (+1) or incorrect (0), was displayed for 1,000 ms.
Participants were informed that a result of +1 would earn more points and receive a higher reward after the experiment. Participants were instructed to maximize their rewards during the EDM task. One of the two stimuli had a 90% probability of yielding a reward, whereas the other had a 10% probability. The probability of earning a point for each stimulus was determined independently for each trial, implying that earning a point for one stimulus does not preclude earning a point for another. Before starting the EDM task, participants were informed that each stimulus had a specific probability of earning points; however, the exact probabilities were not disclosed.
In the preference judgment task (IDM task), pairs were created from all possible combinations of the shapes, including the four shapes from the EDM task (i.e., each stimulus was presented 14 times). Each stimulus pair was presented once.
Three types of stimuli were used in the IDM task: new (N), high-probability (HP) from the EDM task, and low-probability (LP) from the EDM task. Participants completed three blocks of 35 preference judgment trials and were asked to choose their preferred shape based on their own criteria. They were informed that there were no objectively correct answers for the IDM task. The stimuli were presented in the same manner as in the EDM task; however, no feedback was provided following this choice.


Computational model analysis
To estimate the values of each stimulus on a trial-by-trial basis, including the final values at the end of the task, CIPC-implemented computational models were fitted to the choice behavior data in IDM. The model used in this study, outlined below, is identical to that validated by 
Zhu et al. (2024a)
. The learning process at time t increases the value of the chosen items and decreases that of the rejected items.
Equation 1 ( + 1) = { ( ) + (1 âˆ’ ( )) â„Ž ( ) + (0 âˆ’ ( ))
The value ( ) of the model was updated according to the participants' selection or rejection of the stimulus. Once updated, the was maintained at a constant value, until the next stimulus presentation trial. The magnitude of the value change following a choice was determined by the learning rate ( ). If item i was chosen, the learning rate was multiplied by 1 âˆ’ ( ) and added to the value of trial t. Conversely, if item i was rejected, the learning rate was multiplied by âˆ’ ( ) and added to the value at trial t.
The initial value for the HP stimulus was estimated as free parameters based on 
Zhu et al. (2024a)
, and the validity of this model was also confirmed by the goodness of fit to the behavioral data of the present study (see Supplemental materials). The initial values of the LP and N stimuli were fixed at 0.5.
Using this model, the probability of stimulus choice in each trial was calculated from the estimated values of the two stimuli using the softmax function with the free parameter Î², which represents the slope of the function (see 
Equation 2
 in Supplemental Materials).
Hierarchical Bayesian methods were employed for parameter estimation. For further details on the computational models and analysis methods, please refer to the Supplemental Materials.


Correct response rate, ratio of new stimuli chosen in the old-new trials, and reaction time.
We evaluated the correct response rate for each stimulus pair to ascertain whether participants acquired extrinsic values from the EDM task.
To assess the extent to which extrinsically or intrinsically learned values influenced for trials where a combination of an old stimulus (from the EDM task) and
a new stimulus was presented (old-new trials, 44 trials), we calculated the ratio of new stimuli chosen in these trials.
For the reaction time (RT), in the IDM, trials were categorized into three types:
old-new trials, old trials (combinations of two stimuli presented in the EDM, six trials),
and new trials (combinations of two new stimuli, 55 trials). The differences in RTs across these trial types were examined.


EEG recording and preprocessing
Sixty-three silver-silver chloride cup electrodes with active wet electrodes (actiCAP; Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) were used to record EEG signals.
The electrodes were positioned according to the extended International 10-20 system.
Electrode impedance was measured after placement, and was maintained below 20 kÎ©, as recommended by the Brain Products 
(Emmerling, 2017)
. The EEG signals were amplified using a Brain Amp DC-EEG recorder (BP-01110; Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany), with a low-pass filter of 250 Hz and digitized at a 1000 Hz sampling rate.
EEG data were further preprocessed using the EEGLAB toolbox (ver.2024.0; 
Delorme & Makeig, 2004)
 in MATLAB R 2022b (Mathworks Inc.). Automatic artifact rejection methods based on previous studies 
(Kobayashi et al., 2020;
Nakao et al., 2019;
Sugimura et al., 2020)
 were applied to three sessions of 5-minute continuous resting-state EEG (eyes closed). To remove bad channels and non-stationary artifacts, the Artifact Subspace Reconstruction method (ASR; Mullen et al., 2015) was applied using the 'clean_rawdata' (version 2.9.1) EEGLAB plugin. The EEG data were referenced to an average reference. Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to eliminate stationary artifacts (e.g., eye movements). An Adaptive Mixture ICA (AMICA version 1.7; Palmer et al., 2011) was applied to the data of each participant. The equivalent current dipole of each IC was estimated using DIPFIT (version 5.4 EEGLAB plugin, utilizing the Fieldtrip toolbox), and bilateral dipole fitting was performed with the fitTwoDipole EEGLAB plugin (version 1.00; Piazza et al., 2016). IC selection was carried out using the ICLabel (version 1.6) EEGLAB plugin (Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019) with a brain activity probability greater than 70% and residual variance of less than 0.15. The remaining ICs were projected back onto the scalp electrodes to generate artifact-free EEG data.
The supplementary materials provide further details on the EEG recording and preprocessing procedures.


DFAe calculation
To quantify LRTC, we performed detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) 
Hardstone et al., 2012;
Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001;
Peng et al., 1994;
Zhigalov et al., 2015)
 using the Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox (NBT ver. 0.5.5;
Hardstone et al., 2012) The Hurst exponent from the DFA (DFAe), which ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, indicates the degree of the LRTC, with higher values indicating a stronger LRTC. An 8-13Hz finite impulse response (FIR) filter was applied to extract the EEG time series within the alpha range. The Hilbert transform was used to compute the amplitude envelope and its cumulative sum. In total, 24 time windows, ranging from 0.1 to 30 seconds, were extracted with a 75% overlap, and each window was linearly detrended using least-squares fitting. The SD of the detrended data was subsequently computed for each time window, and the average SD across all windows of the same size was set as the fluctuation function, F(t). F(t) was plotted on a logarithmic scale for all window sizes, and DFAe (the linear slope of the trend line in the 2 to 16 seconds range) was subsequently calculated, as described in previous studies 
(Meisel et al., 2017;
Sugimura et al., 2020
; see 
Figure S11
).
Additionally, a surrogate data analysis was conducted to verify whether the observed DFAe results reflected the temporal structure of the phase. Surrogate data, which maintained the same amplitude distribution as the original series, but lacked exact temporal correlations, were generated using the Chaotic Systems Toolbox 
(Leontitsis, 2014)
 via the amplitude-adjusted Fourier transform (AAFT)
algorithm 
(Theiler et al., 1992)
. Surrogates were generated 1,000 times for each participant's data. Two types of mean surrogated DFAe were calculated using methods described in prior studies 
(Nakao et al., 2019;
Sugimura et al., 2020)
. The first was the mean surrogated DFAe, averaged across participants for each set of 1,000 surrogates.
This value was applied to calculate the critical value, corresponding to the upper 99th percentile of the mean-surrogated DFAe 
(Theiler et al., 1992)
. The second was the mean surrogated DFAe for each participant, calculated by averaging the DFAe across 1,000 surrogates, which was used to examine the relationship with the behavioral data. To assess the reliability of DFAe, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC (2, k)) 
Shrout & Fleiss, 1979)
 and three resting-state measurements (EC1, EC2, and EC3)
were calculated using JASP 0.18.1.0.


Correlation analyses
Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for correlation analyses.
One-tailed tests were conducted for the relationships in which positive and negative correlations were predicted. For example, we predicted positive correlations between LRTC and SIV or the final value for N1, and negative correlations between LRTC and the final value for HP. When the partial correlation coefficients were calculated, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using 1,000 bootstrap samples.
To correlate SIV with LRTC, the difference between the N1 and HP1 values was calculated as an SIV index. HP1 represented the HP stimulus selected most frequently in the IDM and, as a result, had the higher final value of the two HP stimuli for each participant. In this study, SIV was operationally defined as the difference between N1 and HP1 to avoid overestimating SIV by comparing N1 with the average of the two HP stimuli, including HP2, which had a smaller final value in the IDM.
In addition to examining the correlation between SIV and LRTC, we investigated the association between LRTC and an individual's tendency to increase the N1 value and decrease the HP1 value, both of which are known to contribute to SIV.
When analyzing the correlation with N1, the value of HP1 was controlled for and vice versa. This is because the values of N1 and HP1 are measured as relative values in the IDM, which involves two alternative choices (i.e., relative value judgments between stimuli). Consequently, variations in one value are likely to include variations in the other, suggesting that N1 and HP1 are expected to be correlated.
Further, we examined the correlation between LRTC and the ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials, calculated as an indicator of the extent to which extrinsic or intrinsic values influenced decision-making. A positive correlation is predicted between this index and the LRTC.


Results


Correct response rate in EDM
To confirm that the participants learned the value of the stimuli in the EDM task, we examined the correct response rate 
(Figure 2(a)
). As noted in the Methods section, four participants had correct response rates lower than two SD below the mean (range: 0.49-0.59). These participants were excluded from the analysis, as they
were not considered to have taken the task seriously, having failed to sufficiently learn the extrinsically assigned values in EDM. Following this exclusion, the mean correct response rate was 0.837 (SD = 0.073), ranging from 0.67-1.00. The mean correct response rate was significantly higher than chance (0.  For more details on the statistical results, refer to 
Table S1
. The solid line between HP1
and N1, or N2 at the top left, represents the comparisons related to the superiority of intrinsically learned value (SIV). For the results of the chosen frequency, see 
Figure S1
 in the Supplemental Materials. (c) The SIV, the final value of N1 minus that of HP1 in IDM, is shown. The red dots indicate the mean value. In a box plot, the lower bound of the box represents the first quartile, the horizontal line in the middle represents the median, the upper bound represents the third quartile, while the vertical lines indicate the range of the data. Orange dots indicate participants for whom N1 was larger than HP1, gray dots indicate participants for whom the two were chosen equally, and blue dots indicate participants for whom N1 was smaller than HP1. The regression lines for significant correlations are colored red and blue to indicate positive and negative correlations, respectively. Detailed statistics are summarized in

Model Estimated initial and final values of the IDM
The values of the stimuli in the IDM were primarily indexed using the final value for each stimulus 
(Figure 2(b)
), estimated by using a CIPC-implemented computational model validated by 
Zhu et al. (2024a)
 and the present study (see the 
Supplementary Materials)
. Although we also used chosen frequency as an index of stimulus value in IDM, the results were consistent with those of the final value, and are presented in the Supplementary Materials.
We investigated whether the high values learned in EDM were reflected in the initial IDM values, as reported by 
Zhu et al. (2024)
. The model estimated a higher initial value for HP stimuli (M = 0.546, SD = 0.082) than the fixed initial value (0.  
Supplemental Table S1
. The distribution of SIV is shown in 
Figure 2
(c).
In summary, similar to the findings of Zhu et al. (2024a), we found that highprobability reward stimuli in the EDM were reflected to the initial value of the IDM, and these stimuli exhibited higher initial values compared to new stimuli. However, in the final value of IDM, HP stimuli were not preferred over N1, and SIV was noted.


Ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials and RTs
To assess whether extrinsically or intrinsically learned values had a greater influence on IDM, we calculated the new stimulus chosen ratio in the old-new trials 
(Figure 2(d)
 Additionally, the mean RT for the three trial types 
(old, old, new, and new)
 were calculated. The old-old trials involved two stimuli from the EDM (6 trials),
whereas the new trials involved two new stimuli (55 trials). Given the skewness of the RT data (old-old, 3.033; old-new, 3.064; new-new, 3.452), multiple comparisons were performed on the inverse-transformed RT data 
(Figure 2(e
 


Correlations among indices of the balance between extrinsically and intrinsically learned values
We further confirmed the presence of correlations between indices of the balance between extrinsically and intrinsically learned values, that is, SIV, N1 and HP1 final values, and the ratio of new stimuli chosen in the old-new trials 
(Figure 2 (f)
). All combinations of correlations were significant 
(Table S2
). As expected, combinations involving HP1 and the other indices showed negative correlations, whereas other combinations displayed positive correlations. Strong correlations were observed between SIV, HP1, and the ratio of new stimuli chosen in the old-new trials, whereas correlations between N1 and the other indices were moderate. These results indicate that, SIV, HP1, and the ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials particularly reflect the balance between extrinsically and intrinsically learned values.
As the exploratory analysis, the correlations between the final values of the stimuli are reported in 
Table S7
. The correlation between N1 and HP1 was moderate (r = -0.337, p = 0.002), and HP1 showed a stronger correlation with moderately preferred stimuli (e.g., N7, r = -0.656, p < 0.001). The mean surrogate channel-averaged DFAe values for EC1, EC2, and EC3


Channel DFAe
were 0.594 (SD = 0.033), 0.588 (SD = 0.040), and 0.586 (SD =0.033), respectively.
The critical values corresponding to the upper first percentile of the surrogated DFAe mean were 0.595, 0.589, and 0.588, respectively. These values were smaller than the observed original mean DFAe, confirming that the DFAe in the present data reflected a non-random temporal structure, rather than random amplitude variability.


Correlation between DFAe and behavioral data in EDM
The correct response rate in EDM showed marginally significant negative correlations with the channel-averaged alpha range DFAe in EC1 (r = âˆ’0.215, p = 0.053, 95% CI = âˆ’0.414, 0.003) and EC3 (r = âˆ’0.194, p = 0.083, 95% CI = âˆ’0.395, 0.026).
However, no significant correlation was observed for EC2 (r = âˆ’0.154, p = 0.171, 95% CI = âˆ’0.360, 0.067).
Because a weak correlation was found between LRTC and correct response rates in EDM, further correlation analyses between LRTC and SIV should consider whether the correct response rate in EDM might explain this relationship.


Correlation between channel averaged DFAe and SIV
Figure 3 presents scatter plots and topographic maps illustrating the correlation between the channel-averaged alpha-range DFAe across three resting states, and indices related to the balance between extrinsically and intrinsically learned values in IDM.
SIV was positively correlated with the channel-averaged DFAe in the alpha band across all three EC conditions (EC1 and SIV in final value, r = 0.247, one-tailed p = 0.013, 95% lower CL = 0.066; EC2 and SIV in final value, r = 0.229, one-tailed p = 0.020, 95% lower CL = 0.047; EC3 and SIV in final value, r = 0.267, one-tailed p = 0.008, 95% lower CL = 0.087, see also 
Table S3
).
Given the negative correlations observed between the correct response rates in the EDM and DFAe, it is possible that a higher DFAe is associated with less effective learning of EDM values, resulting in stronger correlations with SIV. To investigate this, partial correlation analyses were conducted, controlling for the correct response rates in the EDM. The correlation between DFAe and SIV remained significant even after controlling for EDM performance (see 
Table S4
 for statistics).
The mean surrogate channel-averaged DFAe for each participant showed no significant correlation with the SIV 
(Table S5)
 
(Table S5)
.
When controlling for EC1, the correlation between SIV and both EC2 and EC3
disappeared (EC2, r = 0.086, one-tailed p = 0.225, 95% CI = âˆ’0.131, 0.281; EC3, r = 0.147, one-tailed p = 0.097, 95% CI = âˆ’0.061 0.341), suggesting that individual differences in intrinsic brain activity, as reflected by the DFAe across EC1, EC2, and EC3, were associated with SIV.
Overall, these results indicate that a higher intrinsic alpha range LRTC, which was consistently reflected in the resting-state EEG before and after the task, is associated with a higher SIV. Further, these correlations were not confounded by the high correct response rates in the EDM. averaged alpha-range DFAe in the three eyes-closed resting states and the model estimated final value in the IDM task for the N1 and HP1 stimuli, the SIV calculated from their differences, and the ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new IDM trials. For correlations with N1, the final value of HP1 was controlled, while for correlations with HP1, the final value of N1 was controlled. * One-tailed p < 0.05, ** one-tailed p < 0.01.

Correlations between DFAe and N1, HP1, or moderately chosen new stimuli
Individual differences in SIV can be attributed to two distinct tendencies: a tendency to increase the value of N1 and/or a tendency to decrease the value of HP1 in the IDM. To investigate this further, we conducted correlation analyses between each of these values and DFAe 
(Figure 3)
. The final values of the stimuli, including N1 and HP1 final values, were measured and estimated as the relative values among the stimuli.
Therefore, the variation in each stimulus final value is expected to include the variations in the others. The correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation between N1 and HP1 (r = âˆ’0.337, p = 0.002, 95% CI = âˆ’0.518, âˆ’0.128). Therefore, HP1 was controlled for when examining the correlation with N1 and vice versa.
Significant negative correlations were observed between HP1 and channelaveraged DFAe in all three resting states (EC1, r = âˆ’0.330, one-tailed p = 0.001, 95% CI = âˆ’0.514, âˆ’0.128; EC2, r = âˆ’0.304, one-tailed p = 0.003, 95% CI = âˆ’0.475, âˆ’0.079;
EC3, r = âˆ’0.306, one-tailed p = 0.003, 95% CI = âˆ’0.480, -0.097). In contrast, no significant correlations were identified between the N1 and channel-averaged DFAe in the three resting states 
(Table S3
). The correlation between DFAe and HP1 remained significant, even after controlling for the correct response rate in EDM (see 
Table S4
 for statistics). When controlling for EC1, the correlation between HP1 and EC2 or EC3 disappeared (EC2, r = âˆ’0.103, one-tailed p = 0.181, 95% CI = âˆ’0.317, 0.123; EC3, r = âˆ’0.147, one-tailed p = 0.096, 95% CI = âˆ’0.348, 0.081). These results indicate that the relatively pure intrinsic brain activity reflected in EC1 is also consistently mirrored in EC2 and EC3, and that this variation correlates with the HP1 final value. Overall, these results indicate that the positive correlation between SIV and DFAe reflects individual differences in the tendency to reduce the HP1 value in the IDM.
We found that the higher the LRTC was associated with the smaller final value of HP stimuli; however, there was no correlation with the final value of the N1 stimuli.
To explore which stimuli had higher final values as HP1's final value decreased, we subsequently conducted an exploratory analysis to examine the correlations between the LRTC and the final value of all stimuli. The correlations between the channelaveraged DFAe and all stimuli are presented in 
Supplemental Table S8
. The final value for HP1 was negatively correlated with moderate final value of new stimuli such as N7
(r = âˆ’0.656, p < 0.01, 95% CI = âˆ’0.765 , âˆ’ 0.511) which, in contrast to HP1, was positively correlated with channel-averaged DFAe (e.g., EC1 and N7, r = 0.338 , p = 0.002, 95% CI = 0.129, 0.518; see 
Table S8
 for the other correlations).
In summary, we observed correlations between the LRTC and SIV, with results showing that a higher LRTC was associated with a lower HP1 final value.
Conversely, a higher LRTC was associated with a higher final value of new stimuli with moderate preference.


Correlations between DFAe and ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials
The correlation between the ratio of new stimuli chosen in the old-new trials and DFAe was further examined, revealing significant positivity across all three resting-state DFAe 
(Figure 3
; EC1, r = 0.245, one-tailed p = 0.014, 95% lower CL = 0.063; EC2, r = 0.278, one-tailed p = 0.006, 95% lower CL = 0.099; EC3, r = 0.275, one-tailed p = 0.007, 95% lower CL = 0.095).
The correlations remained significant even after controlling for the correct response rate in EDM (see 
, Table S4
 for statistics).
When controlling for EC1, the correlation between the ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials and EC2 or EC3 disappeared (EC2, r = 0.157, one-tailed p = 0.082, 95% CI = âˆ’0.061, 0.350; EC3, r = 0.159, one-tailed p = 0.079, 95% CI = âˆ’0.092, 0.375). These results indicate that the relatively pure intrinsic brain activity reflected in EC1 is also consistently mirrored in EC2 and EC3, and that this variation correlates with the ratio of new stimuli chosen in the old-new trials.
Overall, these results indicate that individuals with greater intrinsic LRTC were more likely to choose new stimuli in the old-new trials of IDM, which is consistent with the correlation between LRTC and both SIV and HP1.


Discussion
This study aimed to investigate whether LRTC was associated with the balance between extrinsically and intrinsically learned values in IDM. The relationship between LRTC and SIV, as well as related indicesincluding N1 and HP1 final values, and the ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trialswas examined.


Behavioral indices of balance of extrinsically and intrinsically learned value
We observed SIV, confirming that intrinsically and extrinsically learned values are distinct and operate on different criteria 
(Figure 2
(b)(c)). We further confirmed that extrinsically learned values carry over to IDM. These findings were consistent with those of 
Zhu et al. (2024a)
, and were further supported by the ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials 
(Figure 2(d)
). These results indicate that IDM is not solely guided by either extrinsically or intrinsically learned values, but rather that both are referenced in IDM.
Strong correlations were observed among SIV, the final value of HP1, and the ratio of new stimuli chosen in the old-new trials 
(Figure 2(f)
), confirming that all of these reflect the balance between extrinsically and intrinsically learned values in IDM.
From the exploratory analysis, we observed that a lower final value of HP1
was associated with a higher final value of moderately preferred new stimuli 
(Table S7
).
This suggests that the lower frequency of choosing HP1 was the opposite of the higher frequency of choosing the moderately preferred new stimuli.


Relationship between LRTC and the values that guide IDM
A positive correlation was identified between DFAe and both SIV and the ratio of new stimuli chosen in the old-new trials 
(Figure 3)
, supporting the hypothesis that individuals with higher LRTC exhibit more SIV and indicate that individuals with higher LRTC prioritize intrinsically learned values over extrinsically learned values in the IDM.
For the individual values of N1 and HP1 used to calculate SIV, only a negative correlation between HP1 and DFAe was identified. In other words, the higher the LRTC, the less the extrinsically learned value from EDM influenced IDM. No correlation was found between the N1 stimulus and LRTC.
Instead, individuals with higher LRTC exhibited a higher value for moderately preferred new stimuli (e.g., N7; 
Table S8
), which was negatively correlated with HP1 
(Table S7
). These findings indicate that individuals with higher LRTC are less influenced by extrinsically learned values (represented by the right side of the blue area in 
Figure 4
), while simultaneously assigning more intrinsic value to moderately preferred stimuli (represented by the right side of the orange area in 
Figure 4
) in IDM. A neural network in a critical state with balanced excitatory and inhibitory connections exhibits a high LRTC, which enables both susceptibility to change and stability 
(Avramiea et al., 2022;
Poil et al., 2012)
. The results of the present study suggest that individuals with such critical intrinsic brain activity tend to learn intrinsic values through IDM susceptibility and stably reflect those values, while being less influenced by extrinsically learned values. 
Nakao et al. (2019)
 suggested that individuals with higher LRTC are less influenced by noise unrelated to the internal criteria in the IDM. In the present study, we found that extrinsically learned values, similar to noise, had less influence on IDM in individuals with higher LRTC.
Although the correlations between LRTC and the correct response rate in EDM were marginally significant, the correlations between LRTC and indices of the balance between intrinsically and extrinsically learned values (i.e., SIV, HP1 and the ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials) remained significant even when controlling for the correct response rate in EDM 
(Table S4
). This indicates that the ability to learn values based on external criteria, as reflected by the correct response rate in EDM, does not confound the relationship between LRTC and the balance of intrinsically and extrinsically learned values.
Correlations between the LRTC and balance indices were consistently observed across EC1, EC2, and EC3 ( 
Figure 3
 and S12 and Tables S3). Furthermore, the correlations between EC2 and EC3 and the balance indices disappeared when EC1
was controlled, indicating that the correlations reflect the influence of intrinsic brain activity, which remains relatively pure and stable even after decision-making.


Potential explanations: Inhibition of task-irrelevant information or selfspecificity of intrinsic brain activity
It is unclear which underlying processes contribute to the observed reduction in the effect of extrinsically learned values on IDM in participants with higher LRTC in intrinsic brain activity. However, one possible explanation could be derived from the information-gating function of alpha-band oscillations, which inhibits task-irrelevant information 
(Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010;
Klimesch, 2012;
Klimesch et al., 2007)
.
Individuals with a high resting alpha-band LRTC tend to exhibit greater flexibility in switching between tasks, and can adapt quickly to changing task demands, indicating a superior ability to inhibit task-irrelevant information 
(Golemme et al., 2021;
Mahjoory et al., 2019)
. The distinction between the EDM and IDM lies in their respective task demands-decisions based on externally provided value criteria versus self-determined value criteria. Thus, according to the gating function of the alpha band, individuals with higher LRTC may inhibit judgments based on extrinsically learned values when HP stimuli are presented in the IDM task. Conversely, individuals with lower LRTC may struggle to inhibit the influence of easily accessible extrinsically learned values, thereby resulting in insufficient switching between EDM and IDM task demands. Thus, in this context, SIV is thought to reflect the extent to which internally learned values are distinguished from externally learned values in IDM.
Another possible explanation is that self-specificity is a fundamental feature of the intrinsic brain activity 
(Northoff, 2016;
Zhang et al., 2023)
; this perspective posits that the self is embedded in and continuously maintained by intrinsic brain activity 
(Northoff, 2016)
, which is closely related to the efficient processing of self-relevant stimuli, known as the self-prioritization effect 
(Zhang et al., 2023)
. Additionally, research has indicated a relationship between LRTC and self-related traits, with higher LRTC associated with greater private self-consciousness 
(Huang et al., 2016;
Wolff et al., 2018)
 and lower identity confusion 
(Sugimura et al., 2020)
. Stimuli repeatedly chosen based on personal preferences, rather than rewards provided by the external environment, are likely to increase self-relevance. In other words, a higher intrinsically learned value indicates a higher degree of self-relevance. Consequently, participants with higher LRTC may process self-relevant stimuli more efficiently, and consistently reflect intrinsically learned values in their decision-making, while being less influenced by extrinsically learned values in IDM. Thus, in this context, SIV is understood to reflect the extent to which intrinsically learned values are prioritized in decision-making.
Currently, which of these two explanations better accounts for the observed relationship between LRTC and the balance of extrinsically and intrinsically learned values in IDM remains unclear. However, this question could be addressed by measuring the extent to which intrinsically learned values affect the EDM 
(Zhu et al., 2024b
) and examining their relationship with the LRTC. If a higher LRTC corresponds to a reduced influence of IDM-learned values on the EDM, it would suggest that individuals with a high LRTC can clearly distinguish between the two value systems by inhibiting task-irrelevant information. However, if intrinsically learned values play a stronger role in the EDM for individuals with a higher LRTC, this suggests that these individuals are more likely to prioritize self-relevant information in their decisionmaking. Further research is required to determine which explanation is more appropriate, or whether other processes better explain the distinction between the two value systems and their relationship with LRTC.


Limitations
This study has several limitations. Firstly, although the mean SIV and the mean ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials across participants confirmed that both extrinsically and intrinsically learned values are referenced in IDM 
(Figure 2
 (b)(c)(d)),
individual differences in these indices may not be solely driven by the balance between the extrinsically and intrinsically learned values. That is, variations in participants' preferences for the shapes of the HP1 (and HP2) stimuli may be contaminated by the individual differences observed in these indices. Given the significant correlations of intrinsic brain activity with SIV, HP1 final value, and the ratio of new stimuli, it is unlikely that chance preference alone would explain the individual differences in these balance indices. However, this confounding factor may have weakened the correlation.
Therefore, developing methods to control for this variable will be essential for future research.
Secondly, this study found that individuals with high LRTC were less influenced by extrinsically learned values in IDM, as indicated by their reduced likelihood of choosing HP stimuli. However, the results further showed a stronger preference for moderately preferred stimuli, such as N7, suggesting more frequent selection in the IDM. Due to the nature of the experimental paradigm used, it is difficult to discern whether the inhibition of extrinsically learned values or the dominance of moderately preferred values is more closely associated with LRTC.
Finally, the reinforcement of intrinsically learned values in the present study remains unclear. CIPC is associated with activity in reward-related brain regions,
including the striatum 
(Izuma et al., 2010;
Jarcho et al., 2011;
Kitayama et al., 2013;
Nakao et al., 2016;
Schonberg and Katz, 2020)
. Prior studies have commonly used stimuli likely to induce rewarding activities, such as food, whereas the stimuli in this study were novel contour shapes. It is challenging to assert that selecting simple shapes activates reward-related brain areas in the same way as food. It is known that novel stimuli were preferred 
(Sehl et al., 2022)
, and hence the novelty effect may have contributed to the intrinsically learned value correlated with LRTC in this study.
However, there was no evidence that new stimuli were preferred over old 
(HP and LP)
 stimuli on average, and that new stimuli were chosen less frequently than old ones in old-new trials 
(Figure 2 (d)
). Additionally, Simulation 3 in the Supplementary Material indicates that the novelty effect was insufficient to explain the SIV in the current data.
The reinforcement of intrinsically learned values in preference judgments of simple
shapes remains an open question for future investigation.


Conclusion
In summary, in the present study, we found that in the IDM, individuals with higher LRTC were less likely to prefer stimuli associated with a high probability of reward in the EDM, and were more likely to prefer new stimuli whose values were learned purely intrinsically. In other words, individuals with lower LRTC were more inclined to base their decisions on external criteria learned through rewards in the EDM, while those with higher LRTC tended to rely more on internal criteria. The reasons for the association between the LRTC and individual differences in the value criteria referenced in the IDM remain unclear. Two possibilities may be considered: firstly, individuals with a high alpha-band LRTC may possess a heightened ability to suppress task-irrelevant information, thereby enabling them to adapt their value criteria based on task demands in the EDM and IDM, and individuals with high LRTC may prioritize self-relevant information, such as intrinsically learned values, in their decision-making.
These possibilities require further investigation.

5) for LP and new stimuli (t(80) = 5.046, one-tailed p < 0.001, d = 0.560, 95% lower CL of d = 0.362). To confirm the replication of the SIV using the estimated final values, we compared the final values in the IDM for three stimuli: N1, HP1, and HP2 (Figure 2(b)). Multiple comparisons revealed that the mean value of N1 (M = 0.788, SD = 0.071) was significantly higher than that of HP1 (M = 0.653, SD = 0.208; t(80) = 5.048, one-tailed pHolm < 0.001, d = 0.561, 95% lower CL of d = 0.363) and HP2 (M = 0.489, SD = 0.219; t(80) = 10.657, one-tailed pHolm < 0.001, d = 1.184, 95% lower CL of d = 0.942). These results replicated the SIV indexed by the estimated final values in this study. The statistics (t, p, d values, and 95% CIs of d) are presented in


)). This skewness improved after the inverse transformation(old-old, 0.197; old-new, âˆ’0.376; new-new, âˆ’0.137).Multiple comparisons revealed that the RTs for old-new(M = 1946(M =  .881 ms, SD =    1704 t(80)  = 2.817, pHolm = 0.012, d = 0.313, 95% CI of d = 0.089, 0.535) and new-new trials (M = 1884.602 ms, SD = 1477.942; t(80) = 2.976, pHolm = 0.012, d = 0.331, 95% CI of d = 0.106, 0.553) were significantly longer than those for old-old trials (M = 1728.389 ms, SD = 1262.045). Conversely, no significant difference was found between old-new and new-new trials (t(80) = 0.752, pHolm = 0.454, d = 0.084, 95% CI of d = âˆ’0.135, 0.301). Combined with the finding that the mean chosen frequency of HP stimuli (M = 0.570, SD = 0.220; t(80) = 2.859, pHolm = 0.005, d = 0.318, 95% CI of d = 0.093, 0.540) was higher than that of LP stimuli (M = 0.430, SD = 0.220) in old-old trials, the shorter RTs in the old-old trials indicate that the values learned in EDM influenced IDM. In summary, the analysis of the ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials confirmed that both extrinsically and intrinsically learned values influenced IDM. The RT analysis across the three trial types (old-old, old-new, and new-new) further demonstrated that extrinsically learned values were influenced IDM.


LRTC was indexed by the Hurst exponent from the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFAe;
Hardstone et al., 2012)
, with higher DFAe values (ranging from 0.5 to 1.0), indicating a greater degree of LRTC. The channel-averaged DFAe values for EC1, EC2, and EC3 were 0.771 (SD = 0.117), 0.812 (SD = 0.121), and 0.834 (SD = 0.118), respectively. Previous studies using large sample sizes have reported alpha-band DFA indices in adults ranging from 0.55 to just below 1.10 (Smit et al., 2011), which is consistent with the present study. Plots of the scalp channel-averaged fluctuation function (F(t)) are presented inFigure S11of the Supplemental Materials. To assess the reliability of the DFAe, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC (2, k)) Shrout & Fleiss, 1979) was calculated for EC1, EC2, and EC3. The ICC for channel-averaged DFAe was deemed to be acceptable (ICC(2,3) = 0.849, 95%CI = 0.754-0.905). Oneway repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to compare the DFAe across the three EC resting states, revealing significant differences between the three conditions (F(2,160) = 19.181, p < 0.001, Î·p 2 = 0.193). Post hoc comparisons using the Holm method further showed significant differences across the three conditions (pHolm < 0.039).
