You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Humans are adept at predicting others' actions and adapting their behaviour accordingly 
1
 . Such processes are complex and likely depend upon more task-general mechanisms that permit flexible, goaldirected decision-making 
2,
3
 . Our remarkable ability to navigate interactive environments, however, is a breaking point in many mental health problems and neurodevelopmental conditions, with social inference behaviours so often linked to the symptoms of many mental health problems 
4
 . Such challenges span traditional psychiatric diagnostic categories, ranging from social anxiety 
5
 to psychosis 
6
 , but also characterise neurodevelopmental conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
7
 and autism 
8
 . It remains an open question to what extent these difficulties reflect a general alteration in flexible, goal-directed decision-making processes that support inferences about others.
A prevalent theme within prior research into the role of decision-making within computational psychiatry is the importance of internal world models 
9
 , which allow for flexible, prospective, and goal-directed planning. The use of this general "model-based" decision-making strategy has been linked across multiple studies to transdiagnostic symptom dimensions 
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
[14]
 . Further work has identified links between anxiety and model-based planning when seeking protection from danger specifically 
15
 , suggesting that task context may influence the nature of such symptom-behaviour relationships.
However, it is unclear to what extent model-based decision-making in interactive environments specifically plays a role in the genesis of symptoms. Instead, these processes are typically assessed using behavioural tasks with very simple task structures and no requirement to consider the actions of others. In recent years, efforts have been made to incorporate elements of naturalism into the study of human decision-making 
16
 , and developments in task design and computational modelling have allowed elements of naturalistic complexity, including multi-step social interactions 
2,
17,
18
 , to be embedded within behavioural tasks. This approach has the potential to clarify the role of interactive decision-making processes in mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions.
Moreover, it is important to consider how symptoms themselves are assessed. Research within computational psychiatry has frequently exploited a transdiagnostic approach, identifying mechanisms that underpin largely independent symptom dimensions across diagnostic categories 
19
 . However, an emerging view, exemplified by the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) system 
20,21 ,
 argues that mental health should be treated as a hierarchy of related symptom dimensions (for example, anxiety and mood symptoms nested within internalising symptoms), accounting for the presence of similarities across dimensions. Importantly, neurodevelopmental conditions, such as ADHD and autism, can be integrated into this framework, accounting for their comorbidity and overlap with mental health problems 
22
 .
Here, we explore the role of interactive model-based decision-making in transdiagnostic mental health and neurodevelopmental symptoms, using a more naturalistic approach that better approximates the complexity of real-world social decision-making. We exploit a recently-developed predator-prey task 2 in which participants must infer a virtual predator's behaviour and predict its goal-directed actions. This enables us to assess how participants used a model of the task to predict another agent's behaviour.
We link behaviour in this task to hierarchically structured mental health and neurodevelopmental dimensions, enabling us to determine the specificity of such relationships to fine-grained symptom dimensions versus broader dimensions.


Results


Participants successfully seek reward and avoid punishment
A total of 1025 participants (Sample 1; mean (SD) age = 36.23 
(12.31)
; 509 male, 507 female, 7 other, 3 did not report gender) recruited through Prolific completed the predator-prey task online alongside a battery of questionnaires measuring aspects of mental health problems and neurodevelopmental conditions. After removing 9 participants with incomplete data and 20 subjects who failed questionnairebased attention checks (see Methods), the final sample for analyses consisted of 996 subjects (mean (SD) age = 36.26 
(12.28)
; 495 male, 494 female, 4 other, 3 did not report gender).
The task ( 
Figure 1A & 1B)
 is described fully in the Methods and in our prior work 2 . Briefly, this task involves navigating a character (a robot) around a large grid environment, collecting rewards while avoiding being caught by a predator which behaved according to a preference for a given feature in the environment (this preference was always for the trees). Participants were tasked with inferring the predator's preference and predicting how it would behave, while only having to plan their actions two steps at a time.
As expected, participants performed the task well, accumulating reward tokens (number) while avoiding being caught by the predator (number). To confirm that participants were motivated to perform the task, we asked them to report how scared they were of getting caught by the predator and how motivated they were overall to perform well. Mean ratings for both questions were high (scared mean (SD) = 55.66 
(28.38)
, 
Figure 1C
; motivated mean (SD) = 86.33 (15.73), Figure1D; 0-100 scales), indicating that the task induced the expected affective state and that subjects were highly motivated to perform well. Notably, as found in prior work 
25
 , ratings of task-induced anxiety were positively correlated with both trait (β = 0.38 [0.22, 0.54], p < .001, 
Figure 1E
) and state (β = 0.86 [0.25, 1.48], p = .006, 
Figure 1F
) anxiety. A) An overview of the task setup, where participants controlled a character (the robot) seeking rewards (the gold coins) while avoiding getting caught by a predator (a blob monster). The environment included two additional features: trees, shown in purple, and patches of red ground. Some areas of the environment were not accessible (areas with no pale hexagonal cells), providing barriers between different sections. B) On each trial, subjects first moved the robot character. They were then asked to predict where they expected the predator to move, and were subsequently asked to report their confidence in this prediction. This repeated 10 times, before they were finally asked to report estimates of the predator's preferences, along with their confidence in these estimates. After this the game ended, with subjects playing 4 games in total. C) Responses to the question: "How scared were you of getting caught by the blob monster?". D) Responses to the question: "How motivated were you to avoid getting caught by the blob monster?". E) Correlation between trait anxiety (STICSA-T) scores and fear ratings in the game. E) Correlation between state anxiety (GAD-7) and fear ratings.


Mental health and neurodevelopmental measures are structured hierarchically
We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to reveal the hierarchical structure of a range of measures used to assess features of mental health problems and neurodevelopmental conditions, chosen purposefully to cover a variety of dimensions proposed in treatments of hierarchical structure within psychopathology 
21
 . To increase robustness of the EFA results, we additionally included data from a further 283 subjects who had completed these measures as part of a separate study (Sample 2; mean (SD) age = 27.78 (9.92); 76 male, 200 female, 7 other). This resulted in a total sample of 1279 subjects for EFA. The hierarchical EFA procedure involved repeating the EFA procedure with increasing numbers of factors, up to a point determined by visual inspection of the scree plot and interpretability of resulting factors.
There were strong corelations both within and between measures ( 
Figure 2A
). The EFA procedure resulted in up to four factors being retained ( 
Figure 2B
), which were related to one another hierarchically as determined according cross-level correlations ( 
Figure 2D)
. At the highest level was a general psychopathology factor (akin to the p-factor), which split into internalising and externalising dimensions at the second level. At the third level, the internalising dimension split into an internalising dimension and an inattentive/neurodevelopmental dimension. Finally, at the fourth level, the internalising dimension split into a narrower internalising dimension focused on mood and anxiety and a withdrawal dimension. Levels beyond this resulted in solutions with uninterpretable factors. Loadings for each of these factors were clustered on relevant measures to an extent (for example, trait anxiety for the internalising dimension), but included strong loadings across a range of measures ( 
Figure 2C
). Externalising and inattentive/neurodevelopmental dimensions are differentially linked to inferences about the predator
We next sought to understand how subjects' behaviour in the task related to these symptom dimensions.
To determine whether these behaviours represent general or specific mechanisms, we performed sequential regression analyses predicting the behaviour of interest from each level of the hierarchy, comparing model fit across levels. Better fit of models with more granular dimensions would indicate that the behaviour is linked to more specific symptom dimensions, whereas a better fit of simpler models would indicate that behaviour is linked to more general dimensions.
Results showed that participants were accurate in predicting the predator's movements and performed significantly better than would be expected by chance (mean (SD) correct = 54% (10%), t(998) = 113.99, p < .001, d = 7.21, 
Figure 3A
). Regression models including only lower levels of the hierarchy did not explain variance in prediction accuracy significantly better than a base model including only covariates. However, including the fourth level of the hierarchy (internalising, externalising, withdrawal, inattentive/neurodevelopmental) resulted in a significant increase in variance explained (adjusted R 2 = 0.061 vs 0.043, F(1, 975) = 19.64, p < .001, 
Figure 3B
). Examining the coefficients of this model revealed that internalising was linked to less accurate predictions (β = -0.07 [-0.14, -0.004], p = 0.04, 
Figure 3C
), while the inattentive/neurodevelopmental dimension was linked to more accurate predictions (β = 0.19
[0.12, 0.28], p < .001, 
Figure 3C
). When turning to reaction times for predictions, we found that no model performed significantly better than the covariate-only model.
We followed this by examining how these dimensions related to reported confidence in predictions about the predator's behaviour ( 
Figure 3D
). We also included accuracy of predictions in the model, to ensure that effects on confidence were not confounded by performance. This again revealed that variation in behaviour was best explained by level 4 of the hierarchy, with this model explaining significantly more variable than the level 3 model (adjusted R 2 = 0.061 vs 0.043, F(1, 974) = 15.75, p < .001, 
Figure 3E
), although simpler models also explained more variable than covariates alone 
(Table S3)
 
Figure 3F
), demonstrating a divergence between objective and subjective performance.
Withdrawal also showed a negative relationship with confidence (β = -0.12 [-0.20, -0.05], p = .001, 
Figure   3F
), while there were positive associations with internalising (β = 0.13 [0.07, 0.20], p < .001, 
Figure 3F
), and externalising (β = 0.12 [0.04, 0.20], p = .005, 
Figure 3F
).
Participants were also asked to estimate the predator's preference for each of the three features in the environment (trees, red ground, the robot). On average, participants were significantly more accurate in predicting the predator's true preference for the trees than would be expected by chance (t(998) = 113.99, p < .001, d = 7.21, 
Figure 3G
). Using the sequential modelling approach described above, level 4 of the hierarchy best explained the error of these reports (adjusted R 2 = 0.01 vs 0.00, F(1, 975) = 12.95, p < .001, 
Figure 3H
) and confidence in their accuracy (adjusted R 2 = 0.34 vs 0.33, F(1, 975) = 13.99, p < .001, 
Figures 3J & 3K)
 . We again observed a divergence in objective and subjective performance linked to inattentive/neurodevelopmental symptoms, whereby higher scores on this dimension were linked to reduced error (β = -0.13 [-0.21, -0.4], p = .002, 
Figure 3I
) but lower confidence (β = -0.12 [-0.19, -0.06], p < .001, 
Figure 3L
). We also found that higher levels of internalising symptoms were linked to greater error (β = 0.12 [0.04, 0.21], p = .005, 
Figure 3I
), while externalising symptoms were linked to greater confidence in these ratings (β = 0.11 [0.05, 0.17], p < .001, 
Figure 3L
). We further investigated biases in these reports, focusing on ratings of the predator's preferences for the prey, to explore whether certain dimensions may be associated with a tendency to overestimate the predator's preference for the participant's character specifically. However, this was not significantly linked to any level of the hierarchy. Greater accuracy associated with inattentive/neurodevelopmental characteristics is explained by preferential use of model-based inference
We next sought to uncover the mechanisms underpinning variation in task performance. To this end, we used a modelling approach developed in our prior work 2 , and inspired by similar approaches contrasting the use of model-based and model-free decision-making 
3,
11,
26
 . This involved building computational models to explain participants' predictions of the predator's behaviour based on either model-free learning or model-based planning. The model-free strategies assumed that participants learned the predator's tendency to choose a particular action (e.g., moving left) using prediction error-driven incremental learning, while the model-based strategy assumed participants solved the decision problem using knowledge of the predator's goal and the structure of the task (i.e., a cognitive map of the task).
We also evaluated combinations of these strategies, where the two strategies were weighted according to an estimated weighting parameter W.
Model comparison revealed that a combination of model-based planning and model-free learning with generalisation (i.e., allowing the learned value of each action to generalise to adjacent actions) provided the best fit to the data, accounting for model complexity using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, 
Figure 4A
). Parameter estimates from this model showed that the balance was skewed in favour of model-based planning, as indicated by high W values (mean (SD) = 0.78 (0.23), higher = more modelbased). Higher accuracy in the task was associated with both better relative fit of the model-based strategy (ρ(982) = 0.40, p < .001, 
Figure 4B
 This suggested that the observed association between the inattentive/neurodevelopmental dimension and improved accuracy in the task may have been mediated by greater use of a model-based strategy.
To test this formally, we conducted mediation analyses with both indices of model-based decisionmaking (the W parameter value and the difference in model fit between model-free and model-based implementations). This demonstrated that in both cases, both the indirect and direct paths were significant, suggesting that the link between the inattentiveness was partially mediated by using modelbased strategies in the task ( 
Figure 4F & 4I
, Tables S16 & S17). We also observed a similar pattern when performing mediation analysis with the externalising dimension, although here the relationship between externalising and poorer predictions was fully mediated by the use of model-based strategies 
(Tables   S18 & S19
). 


Discussion
The use of model-based decision-making is key to our ability to navigate complex, interactive environments in the real world, and represents a promising candidate for understanding how these processes are affected by mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions. We sought to determine its specific role using a validated predator-prey task combined with computational modelling of the mechanisms underlying behaviour.
One of the most consistent findings to emerge was that people higher in inattentive/neurodevelopmental symptoms performed better in predicting the predator's behaviour and inferring its goals, despite
showing reduced confidence in their ability to do so. Computational modelling revealed that this was explained by the greater use of more demanding model-based strategies to predict the predator's next moves, suggesting that people scoring higher on this dimension are either more able to use these strategies or simply do so more readily. Importantly, while it is necessary to be cautious in interpreting any result that could be influenced simply by an inability to attend to the task as required, the fact that greater inattentive/neurodevelopmental traits were linked to higher accuracy indicates that this is not an artifact of inattention within the task. Our use of hierarchical transdiagnostic dimensions also enabled us to show that this is not an effect of general psychopathology, or a higher order internalising/externalising dimension, but is instead specific to lower-level dimensions.
While perhaps counterintuitive on the surface, this finding may reflect neglected characteristics of individuals who may typically be described as "inattentive". Some evidence suggests that inattentive symptoms, as commonly seen within attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), may reflect a more selective deployment of demanding cognitive resources towards motivationally salient tasks rather than a general deficit in attention 
27
 . Our results are in line with this proposal, suggesting that people higher in these traits may be more likely to use computationally complex, model-based strategies to inform decision-making in complex environments. While links between model-based planning and inattentive traits are not a well-reported phenomenon, these neurodevelopmental traits are often not assessed in transdiagnostic symptom batteries 
19,
28
 , meaning that this may simply be due to their omission from prior studies. More generally, aspects of decision-making behaviour have been found to be impaired in ADHD, where inattentive/neurodevelopmental characteristics are most prominent 
[29]
[30]
[31]
 . However, these processes are typically assessed using highly artificial tasks (e.g., go/no-go tasks) 
32
 , and there is evidence that goal-directed behaviour may be enhanced in more real-world situations 
33
 .
We also found that externalising symptoms were consistently associated with an opposite pattern of behaviour, with those scoring higher on this dimension making more errors when predicting behaviour.
Contrasting with the inattentive/neurodevelopmental dimension, this was explained by a reduced tendency to use model-based strategies and a reliance on simpler but less accurate error-driven learning. This may suggest that individuals higher in this dimension are more likely to draw false inferences about others' behaviour, but be overly confident in these incorrect inferences. This is reminiscent of findings demonstrating impairments in social inference skills, such as facial emotion recognition 
34
 and a general reduction in attention to socially-relevant cues 
35
 , in people with externalising disorders, but extends these findings to more complex interactive decision problems. Intriguingly, we also found a similar pattern of results with regard to internalising symptoms in predicting the predator's preferences, where people scoring higher on this dimension made more errors but were more confident about their ratings. This may suggest that people higher in this dimension are more likely to draw false, but certain, inferences about others' intentions, and is in line with prior observations of impaired theory of mind in depression 
36
 and social anxiety 
37
 .
One question raised by these findings is why the use of model-based strategies varies according to these transdiagnostic dimensions. It is possible that this may reflect variability in the neural systems underpinning these processes given that regions known to be involved in prospective planning, such as the hippocampus 
[38]
[39]
[40]
 , are implicated in various mental health and neurodevelopmental problems 
41,
42
 .
However, a tendency to adopt a model-based approach may also be influenced by perceptions of the benefit of doing so 
13
 , or from other ongoing states related to mental health such as stress 
43
 or cognitive impairment 
44
 . It is also possible that such individual differences emerge due to experiences, whether challenging or positive, during developmental periods where model-based decision processes are coming online 
45,
46
 .
While our task has advantages in that it is more naturalistic and promotes the use of more complex decision-making strategies than traditional tasks 
11,
26
 , there are also limitations. The task was highly structured, following a turn-based format, which is less reflective of naturalistic decision problems.
Furthermore, the predator had a simple goal and there was relatively little unpredictability in its behaviour assuming this goal was known; this is important given the proposed role of uncertainty-related computational in conditions such as anxiety 
25,
47,
48
 . Its goal also did not change over time, and it did not perform any higher-order planning operations accounting for its own beliefs about the subjects' beliefs.
Nonetheless, we believe that the task is capable of evoking decision processes that better approximate those deployed in the real world than many simpler tasks 
49
 .
Likewise, our assessment of mental health symptoms and neurodevelopmental characteristics has limitations, despite our efforts to provide a broad characterisation of transdiagnostic dimensions and their hierarchical structure. Most notably, our sample was recruited online from the general population. 


Methods


Ethical approval
The primary study (Sample 1) was approved by the King's College London research ethics committee (LRS-21/22-31704). The study from which Sample 2 was drawn was approved by the California Institute of Technology institutional review board.


Sample
Participants were recruited through Prolific 
24
 , and were selected based on having a 95% approval rate and being aged 18 or over. For Sample 1, participants were required to be located in the United Kingdom, while for Sample 2, participants were required to be located in the United States.


Task
Participants completed a variant of the task described in our previous work 2 . In summary, the task involved navigating a character (a robot) around a 21x10 2D hexagonal grid environment while avoiding being caught by a predator (represented as a "blob monster"). The task was created using Svelte (https://svelte.dev/) and presented in the web browser. Participants were told that each gold coin they collected was worth 100 points, and 1000 points was worth a £0.20 bonus payment at the end of the task. Getting caught by the predator (i.e., occupying the same cell on the grid as the predator) would end the game, and all the points accumulated in that game would be lost.
Participants played 4 games, within which they made 10 moves (1 per turn) while the predator made 20
(2 per turn). Each game was played in a different environment, but participants were told that the predator was consistent across games. In Block 1, participants were not informed of the predator's preference and instead were asked to report their estimate of its preference for each of the three features (trees, red ground, robot) using sliding scales at the end of each game, alongside reporting their confidence in these ratings. We also asked participants to predict where they thought the predator would move before each of its turns, and were also asked to rate their confidence in their predictions. Correct predictions also influenced the bonus payment, with 5 predictions being selected at random at the end of the task and an additional £0.20 paid for each correct prediction. They were also informed that their confidence ratings would influence the calculation of their bonus payment, with predictions in which they were more confident being more likely to be selected for the bonus payment.
The predator was programmed to behave according to a given set of preferences, seeking out the feature it preferred. A full description of the methods used to determine the predator's actions is provided in our prior work 2 , but in brief, the predator selected actions according to their value as estimated using value iteration. One difference from our prior work is that here we introduced a degree of noise in the predator's action selection, achieved by setting the temperature parameter of the softmax rule used to choose actions to a value of 0.5. This was done to increase the difficulty of the task, making it more challenging for participants to infer the predator's preferences and plan their own actions.


Questionnaire measures Symptom measures
We administered a battery of measures assessing various aspects of mental health problems and neurodevelopmental conditions. For consistency, we selected measures targeting trait-level characteristics of these conditions. Specifically, we used the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ10), ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS 
50
 


Attention checks
We also included a number of items designed to ensure that participants were paying attention to the questions. These included both explicit attention checks (e.g., "Please select strongly agree in response to this question") and infrequency items 
55
 (e.g., "I have single-handedly sailed around the worldagree/disagree"). For the explicit attention checks, any response other than the one requested was treated as a failure. For the infrequency items, we treated the 1 st and 2 nd most "correct" responses as correct and any others were classed as failures.


Statistical analysis Exclusions
In order to minimise the influence of inattentive responding, we excluded participants who failed any attention checks or more than one infrequency item. We also excluded participants for whom we did not have a full dataset, whether due to failure to complete or due to technical failure. Finally, for analyses including gender as a covariate, we excluded any participants reporting gender other than male or female as there were insufficient numbers to estimate effects related to other categories.


Exploratory factor analysis
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed on data from Sample 1 and Sample 2 combined, using Oblimin rotation to allow for correlation between factors. This was conducted using the Factor Analyzer package for Python (https://factor-analyzer.readthedocs.io). The number of factors to retain was determined based on visual inspection of the scree plot and interpretability of resulting factors. Having determined the optimal number of factors, we repeated the process for simpler solutions to provide dimensions with increasing levels of granularity. Scores on each of the factors were extracted for each subject, and these were used as variables of interest in further analyses. We also used these scores to determine the hierarchical structure of our factors, calculating correlations between factors at adjacent levels of the hierarchy. Correlations approaching 1 suggested that a factor was retained when moving to a lower level of the hierarchy, while high correlations (between .5 and .9) indicated that the factor was not present in the higher level but displayed some relation to a factor that was present (i.e., could be viewed as related hierarchically to this higher-level factor).


Sequential regression analysis
To determine whether behavioural characteristics were related to the transdiagnostic dimensions, we performed sequential regression analyses 
56,
57
 . These models were run using the statsmodels package for Python (https://www.statsmodels.org). In each model, we included age, gender, and self-reported motivation for the task as covariates. For models of confidence in movement predictions, we additionally included the proportion of correct responses as a covariate to control for effects of accuracy. For models of confidence in preference ratings, we included absolute error (again to control for accuracy effects), alongside the average rating and the average rating squared as we observed a correlation between confidence and rating extremity (whereby more extreme ratings attracted higher confidence ratings).
For analyses of computational model parameters, we transformed the weighting parameter using a cubic transform due to the values being heavily skewed. All continuous variables were subsequently scaled to have zero mean and unit variance.
The sequential regression procedure began by predicting the behavioural measure of interest from covariates alone (information on covariates is provided below). The simplest models therefore took the form: y = β0 + β1 × Age + β2 × Gender + ϵ 
(1)
 We then added in the dimensions derived through factor analysis one level at a time, so the next model became: y = β0 + β1 × Age + β2 × Gender + β3 × General + ϵ
And these models increased in complexity up to the full model with all factors included: y = β0 + β1 × Age + β2 × Gender + β3 × Ext + β4 × Int + β5 × Withdr + β6 × Inatt + ϵ
We compared the relative model fit of each iteration using a combination of the adjusted 2 of the models and an ANOVA comparing models sequentially. A significant ANOVA result combined with an increase in adjusted 2 was taken as evidence that the more granular model explained a significantly greater proportion of the variance in behaviour than the preceding model. Using the adjusted 2 ensured that increasing model complexity was accounted for. We estimated confidence intervals and significance for individual coefficients using bootstrapping with 20,000 samples.


Mediation analysis
To further understand the nature of relationships between behaviour and symptoms, we performed mediation analyses 58 using the pinguoin Python package (https://pingouin-stats.org). This enabled us to establish whether observed associations between symptom dimensions and behavioural patterns were mediated by parameters from our computational models, providing further evidence for the mechanistic role of the processes described by these models. While mediation analysis cannot provide conclusive evidence for a causal model in which symptom -behaviour relationships are mediated by the processes described by these models, they do provide one test of such a model in the absence of more direct experimental tests.
To achieve this, we performed four regression analyses: 1)
~ , 2) ℎ ~ , 3) ℎ ~ , 4) ℎ ~ (
controlling for
). Significant effects for paths 1-3, in conjunction with a significant decrease in the strength of path 4 relative to path 3 provides evidence for a mediation effect. We also estimate the indirect effect (also referred to as the average causal effect of mediation 
59
 ) as an estimate of the strength of mediation. Significance was estimated using bootstrapping with 20,000 samples.


Computational modelling
The computational modelling approach was near identical to that described in our prior work 2 . These models were designed to capture putative mechanisms underpinning participants' ability to predict the predator's upcoming moves and could be either model-free (i.e., not using a model of the task environment) or model-based (i.e., using a model of the task environment).
The simplest of the model-free models is referred to as "policy learning", and assumes that participants learn the predator's policy using error-driven learning. Essentially, this model learns the extent to which the predator tends to select a particular action, with no regard to the environment in which it is choosing these actions. Formally, this model learns the predator's preferred actions as follows:
π ( ) = π −1 ( ) + α ⋅ ( ; − π −1 ( ))
Here, π ( ) is the estimate of the probability of performing action after observing the action on trial ,
;
is the action observed on that trial and α is a learning rate parameter. Note that in contrast to our prior work using this model 2 , the learning rate did not decay.
We also included an extension of this model that accounted for correlations between adjacent action values, assuming that adjacent action values should be similar. In this model, we convolved the observed action (a one-hot vector representing the one chosen action on the current trial) with a squared exponential kernel:
( , ⊤ ) = exp [− ( − T ) 2 2ℒ 2 ]
(5)
As a result, the chosen action was generalised to adjacent actions, resulting in them having similar values, through convolution using this kernel:
̂; = ( ; , ; )
Where ; is a one-hot vector representing the action chosen by the agent on trial . The estimate of π was updated as in Equation 4, using ̂; in place of ; . The length scale parameter ℒ was fixed at 0.02.
The final model-free model was the simplest, assuming that the predator would simply repeat its previous move. This was achieved by setting the learning rate in Equation 4 to 1.
Our model-based approach was more complex, and used value iteration to determine the optimal policy given a model of the task based on the true preferences of the predator. We additionally fit combinations of the model-free and model-based models, scaling the action values π estimated by each model to the range 0-1 to ease interpretation of resulting weights on the values from each model: π = π − min(π) max(π) − min(π)
These action value estimates were then combined according to weighting parameter (which could take values from 0 to 1). π ( ) = ⋅ π ( , ) + (1 − ) ⋅ π ( )
We formed 3 combination models by combining the model-based strategy with each of the 3 model-free models. The output of each model was transformed using a softmax function to produce choice probabilities, with the temperature parameter set to 1. We then determined model fit using the log likelihood of the model based on the categorical likelihood function.
− (θ) = − ∑ log (π ( ; )) =1

 Here, π ( ; ) is the inferred probability of the predator selecting this action on trial , summed across all predictions . Parameters were the learning rate in the policy learning models and the weighting parameter in the combined models. These were estimated using differential evolution in SciPy (https://scipy.org/). For the purposes of model comparison, we calculated the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of each model. All modelling was performed in Python.

) and greater weight of the model-based component of the combined model (r(982) = 0.42, p < .001, Figure 4C). When examining the extent to which variation in model parameters was explained by hierarchical dimensions of mental health and neurodevelopmental characteristics, we found again that a model incorporating level 4 of the hierarchy best explained variation in the model-based weight parameter W (adjusted R 2 = 0.07 vs 0.04, F(1, 975) = 32.27, p < .001, Figure 4D), alongside the difference in model fit between model-based and model-free implementations (adjusted R 2 = 0.06 vs 0.04, F(1, 975) = 28.22, p < .001, Figure 4G). Model coefficients indicated that this was a result of a divergence between different dimensions; greater use of a model-based strategy was associated with the inattentive/neurodevelopmental dimension (W: β = 0.19 [0.11, 0.26], p < .001, Figure 4E; model fit: β = 0.20 [0.13, 0.28], p < .001, Figure 4H), whereas reduced use of the model-based strategy was linked to both internalising (W: β = -0.15 [-0.23, -0.06], p = .001, Figure 4E; model fit: β = -0.15 [-0.23, -0.07], p < .001, Figure 4H) and externalising (W: β = -0.12 [-0.19, -0.06], p < .001, Figure 4E; model fit: β = -0.12 [-0.19, -0.05], p = .001,Figure 4H) dimensions.

Computational modelling of movement prediction behaviour and links to transdiagnostic dimensions. A)Model fit, indicating that a model that combines model-free and model-based strategies (the combined generalisation model, see Methods) provides the best fit to the data. B) Correlation between model-based weighting parameter from the winning model (W) and accuracy in the task. Higher W values represent greater use of model-based strategies. C) Association between relative fit of models using model-free and model-based strategies and accuracy in the task. Higher values of ΔBIC represent greater fit of the model-based implementation, and hence greater use of a model-based strategy. D) Results of sequential regression procedure showing adjusted R 2 for models including symptom dimensions of increasing granularity, where the dependent variable is the weighting parameter W. E) Coefficients from winning regression model predicting weighting parameter values. F) Result of mediation analysis examining mediation of the link between inattentive/neurodevelopmental dimension scores and accuracy in the task by weighting parameter values. Indirect path = Inattentive scores > W > accuracy. Direct path -Inattentive/neurodevelopmental scores > accuracy, controlling for W scores. Total path = Inattentive/neurodevelopmental scores > accuracy, without controlling for W scores. G) Results of sequential regression analyses where the difference in model fit between model-based and model-free implementations is the dependent variable. H) Coefficients from the winning regression model predicting difference in model fit. I) Results of mediation analysis, as described in F) but with the difference in model fit as the mediator. BIC = Bayesan Information Criterion, * = p < .05; ** = p < .01; *** = p < .001.


While some of these participants would likely have clinically significant mental health problems or neurodevelopmental conditions, this was not an explicit inclusion criterion and the majority of the sample will sit within the subclinical or typical range. It is plausible that the decision-making processes assessed here could be differentially associated with transient fluctuations in symptomatology within individuals. However, symptoms and features of mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions are normally distributed in the population, and we focused on trait measures, with the intention of identifying mechanisms underpinning stable transdiagnostic dimensions potentially representing general predispositions to more transient periods of severe symptoms.
