You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Research into dispositional optimism-the tendency to look on the bright side 
(Scheier, Carver & Bridges, 1994)
-has found that positive beliefs are correlated with higher cognitive ability in adolescence, adulthood and old age 
(Karhu, Hintsanen, Koskela & Veijola, 2022;
Lounsbury, Welsh, Gibson & Sundstrom, 2005;
Nurmi & Pulliainen, 1991;
Taylor, Ritchie & Deary, 2017)
. This association is thought to be related to the Broaden-and-Build theory of positive emotions 
(Fredrickson, 2004;
Fredrickson & Branigan, 2005)
. Here, positive emotions (prevalent in those with an optimistic mindset) are thought to broaden the scope of an individual's attention and momentary thought-action repertoire. However, demonstrating the relationship between optimism and cognitive ability is not straightforward. In particular, if beliefs about the future hold any systematic rational component and higher cognitive ability types are more likely to experience better outcomes, as you would expect, then cognitive ability and dispositional optimism will be positively correlated. Simply, the most obvious conclusion would not be that beliefs matter for cognitive ability (or vice-versa), but that those higher in cognition have more to be optimistic about. 
1
 To understand whether optimism is associated with cognitive ability, we must adopt the alternate psychological perspective of unrealistic optimism or optimism bias 
(Weinstein, 1980)
. Here, optimism is not simply a generalized outcomes expectancy that good things will happen but the difference between a person's expectation and the outcome that follows. More formally, optimism bias is characterized as a tendency for individuals to overestimate the chance of favourable outcomes occurring and underestimate the chance of bad 
(Weinstein, 1980)
. Unrealistic optimism has been found to be one of the most pervasive human traits across 
1
 The difficulties in interpreting the relationship between cognitive ability and dispositional optimism are also found in the extensive literature associating dispositional optimism with physical and psychological health. For instance, a finding that dispositional optimism is associated with enhanced well-being could simply reflect the realistic expectation of individuals likely to have positive experiences 
(de Meza & Dawson, 2021)
. many domains 
(Sharot, 2011)
. For instance, research has shown that individuals tend to underestimate the likelihood of developing a drinking problem or getting divorced 
(Weinstein, 1980)
 and to overestimate their future earnings 
(Dawson, 2017)
 and how long they are going to live 
(Puri & Robinson, 2007)
. Our established tendency towards unrealistic optimism is puzzling as normative models of human judgement, like expected utility theory, suggest unbiased assessments of probabilities are advantageous. Like any other judgemental bias, optimism bias has been shown to distort the decision-making process, leading to systematic decision errors, rash behaviour (de Meza, 
Dawson, Henley & Arabsheibani, 2019)
 and a failure to take precautionary measures 
(Dillard, Midboe & Klein, 2009)
. Inflated expectations have also been associated with substantial downstream psychological consequences in the form of disappointment-when outcomes are inevitably worse than expected 
(Kőszegi & Rabin, 2006;
Mellers, Schwartz, Ho & Ritov, 1997)
. Explanations of this puzzle have tended to focus on the immediate affective benefits of unrealistic optimism, such as enhanced psychological wellbeing, improvements in our ability to cope with negative feedback 
(Taylor & Brown, 1988)
 and the ability to savour in our in future successes 
(Brunnermeier & Parker, 2005;
Loewenstein, 2006
). However, it remains untested whether unrealistic optimism is to some extent a consequence of competence and cognitive limitations. Indeed, there are many theoretical reasons to think that the optimism bias may be associated with lower cognitive ability.
Firstly, according to the rational expectations hypothesis in economics, individuals make optimal use of all available information to construct expectations, hence individuals do not make systematic errors when forecasting the future. Broadly speaking, this process of collecting and processing information in an optimal way clearly requires cognitive dexterity.
Hence, any deviations from perfect foresight could easily arise from performance errors or computational limitations 
(Stanovich & West, 2000)
, rather than just random errors. Secondly, according to the heuristics and biases approach to decision making, unrealistic optimism arises from the inappropriate use of heuristics in decision making 
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1996)
. As suggested by 
Raab and Gigerenzer (2005)
, those with higher cognitive abilities may be less reliant on heuristics or alternatively, may use more effective heuristics. A further possible explanation linking unrealistic optimism and cognitive ability comes from the 'two-system' approach, which incorporates emotions and cognition into the decision-making process 
(Fudenberg & Levine, 2006;
Thaler & Shefrin, 1981)
. Here, the two-systems are labelled as System 1, where reasoning is effortless, impulsive, and emotional, and System 2, where reasoning is deliberate, logical, and analytical. The ability to favour logic is known to be correlated with measures of general cognitive ability 
(Stanovich & West, 1997)
. Therefore, more accurate assessments of the future, however dire, may result from reliance on System 2 thinking by the more cognitively able. Consistent with this view, dysfunction in neural systems subserving emotion has been linked to more advantageous decision making 
Shiv, Loewenstein, Bechara, Damasio & Damasio, 2005)
.
The literature on cognitive ability and behavioural biases has found empirical support for these theoretical perspectives. For instance, lower cognitive ability has been associated with a higher incidence of the conjunction fallacy 
(Oechssler, Roider & Schmitz, 2009)
, hindsight bias 
(Stanovich & West, 1998)
, framing and the sunk cost fallacy (Bruine de 
Bruin, Parker & Fischhoff, 2007)
. The literature on overconfidence bias has also emphasized the relationship between cognition and beliefs. Overconfidence is a more specific form of unrealistic optimism, characterized as overestimation or excessive precision in one's estimates of own ability, performance or chances of success 
(Moore & Healy, 2008)
. As with unrealistic optimism, overconfidence has been found to have important affective benefits, such as maintaining self-esteem 
(Dunning, Leuenberger & Sherman, 1995;
Koszegi, 2006;
Kunda, 1987)
, whilst also being linked to a catalogue of decision errors resulting in substantial personal costs. These have included excessive trading; undertaking value-destroying mergers; risky driving behaviour; entrepreneurial failures and problem gambling 
(Barber & Odean, 2001;
Camerer & Lovallo, 1999;
Davis, Sundahl & Lesbo, 2000;
Koellinger, Minniti & Schade, 2007;
Malmendier & Tate, 2008;
Schlehofer et al., 2010)
. As with other behavioural biases, the literature has pointed to a negative relationship between cognitive ability and overconfidence bias. For instance, 
Stanovich and West (1998)
 found that participants displaying a larger overconfidence in a general knowledge test-where overconfidence was measured as the difference between an individual's actual score on the test and predicted score-were found to be lower in cognitive ability. Whilst Bruine de Bruin, 
Parker and Fischhoff (2007)
 found that fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence are correlated with more accuracy in participants assessment of their own knowledge. Here, consistent with the metacognitive approach to explaining the Dunning-Kruger effect-where people with low ability in a certain area of knowledge are the most likely to overestimate their ability in that area-, people may be unable to accurately assess their own competence, simply because they may lack the competence to understand their own incompetence 
(Kruger & Dunning, 1999)
.
In this paper, we used an unbalanced panel of 36,585 respondents drawn from a nationally representative UK longitudinal survey and investigated whether unrealistic optimism-a bias that plays a fundamental role in behavioral science-is correlated with cognitive ability. To understand whether biased beliefs are associated with cognitive ability, it is important that beliefs are elicited in a context where they matter. That is, where there are incentives for accuracy. Importantly, our study is conducted in a context where expectations have real consequences for the respondents. Specifically, unrealistic optimism is operationalized as the difference between a person's expectation about next year's financial circumstances and the financial outcomes that follows. Financial expectations are crucial for key household decisions such as consumption, investments and savings. For instance, according to the standard life-cycle model, households who expect increases in income can increase current consumption and reduce current savings 
(Bachmann, Berg & Sims, 2015;
Brown & Taylor, 2006;
Springer, 1977)
. Importantly, research has also shown that when people make systematic forecasting errors, then this bias can impact real economic activity through its impact on these important household decisions (see for example, 
Caliendo & Huang, 2008;
Sandroni & Squintani, 2013;
Claus & Nguyen, 2023)
. Not only do financial expectations inform important decisions, but participants are inevitably exposed to feedback when next year's financial circumstances are realized. Thus, when setting financial expectations, respondents faced the trade-off between the immediate affective benefits from savouring in their future successes and the downstream consequences of distorted decision making and disappointment. 2 A further advantage is that our respondents reported financial expectations on a repeated basis, which allowed us to measure the bias with more precision, limiting issues surrounding random errors, bad luck and regression toward the mean. Moreover, the cognitive ability measures used in our study covered a broad range of cognitive skills, including memory, verbal fluency, fluid reasoning and numerical reasoning.
The findings we present provide evidence of a strong relationship between forecasting accuracy and cognitive ability. Specifically, we find that higher cognitive ability is strongly associated with a higher incidence of realism and pessimism in beliefs and a lower incidence of unrealistic optimism. This suggests that the increased incidence of negative outcomes associated with an unrealistically optimistic outlook 
(Shepperd, Waters, Weinstein & Klein, 2015)
, may be a side product of the true driver, lower cognitive ability. been found to be greatest amongst the young, men, black people, people on lower incomes, and those residing in the Greater London area (see 
Lynn & Borkowska, 2018)
. Understanding Society covers a broad range of subjects including labor market activity, household dynamics, personality, attitudes and opinions, among other things. The sample used for our empirical analysis is restricted to those who gave valid responses to the dependent, independent and control variables used in the subsequent analysis. This yielded a final panel of 36,585 individuals with 251,027 observations. Therefore, we observed, on average, 6.9 observations per individual.


Method


Measuring unrealistic optimism.
An issue with a substantial proportion of the studies on unrealistic optimism is that the bias is only evaluated at the group level, that is, whether the majority of respondents expectations about positive (negative) events exceed (fall below) the population average. This is problematic as it is impossible to tell who is biased and who is unbiased. Of course, some people are objectively more (or less) likely to experience good (bad) events 
(Colvin & Block, 1994)
. To be able to assess the correlation between optimism bias and cognitive ability we must be able to evaluate optimism at the individual level, that is, to compute the difference between a person's expectation and the outcome that follows. The data used in this study allowed us to follow this strict definition of optimism but also allowed us to measure optimism on a repeated basis. We measured optimism in the domain of household finances. Specifically, by the comparison of expectations about next year's financial circumstances and the financial outcomes that followed. Household finances is an appropriate area to elicit optimism, as previous research has suggested that the bias is highest when outcomes are under the individual control and rely, to some extent, on the individual's effort or ingenuity 
(Shepperd, Klein, Waters & Weinstein, 2013)
. Financial expectations were measured via responses to the following question asked in all 12 Waves of USoc: "Looking ahead, how do you think you will be financially a year from now, will you be...


Better off 2. Worse off than you are now 3. or about the same?"
From this we created a 3-point scale of expectations, , for each individual, , at time, . The 3-point scale (from -1 to +1) ranges from 'worse off than you are now' to 'better off'. Across all responses, 15.5% reported 'worse off', 62.6% reported 'no change' and 21.9% reported 'better off'.
As previously mentioned, for optimism to be a bias, financial expectations need to be compared to financial outcomes. Financial outcomes are measured as changes in household income from one year to the next, that is, ∆log( ) +1 = log( ) +1 − log( ) . Here, is self-reported current monthly income of a respondent's household. 
4
 So that our household income variable more accurately captured spending power, we deflated household income by the Consumer Price Index (2005 = 1) and by the size of the participant's household, using the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD). Lastly, we log transformed the variable so that changes in household income from one period to the next, ∆log( ) +1 , could be approximately interpreted as percentage changes. The mean change in household income, ∆log( ) +1 , is approximately zero.
To illustrate the degree of rationality and bias exhibited by respondents in their selfreported financial expectations, 
Figure 1
 plotted the fraction of those who reported each of the three possible financial expectations at time (of + 1) against changes in household income from time to + 1. Specifically, we used a binned scatterplot to describe the relationship.
The binned scatterplot groups the x-axis variable (change in household income from time to + 1) into 100 equal-sized bins and then computes the mean of the y-axis variable (financial expectation at time ) within each bin, then creates a scatterplot of these data points. For illustrative purposes, we included the estimated quadratic relationship between our x-axis and y-axis variables. We did this separately for changes in household income above and below zero (i.e., we included a regression discontinuity where the change in household income is equal to zero). As depicted in 
Figure 1
, there is substantial evidence of both rationality and bias in selfreported expectations. Specifically, as depicted in the first panel of 
Figure 1
, the fraction of those who reported an expectation of 'worse off' (we used a dichotomous variable that takes on the value of one for individuals who reported 'worse off' and zero for individuals who reported either 'no change' or 'better off') is found to be decreasing in changes to household income from time to + 1. That is, those who experienced the largest negative changes to household income from time to + 1 are the most likely to have reported an expectation of 'worse off' at time . Moreover, the fraction of those who reported an expectation of 'worse off' is smallest for those who experienced household income increases from time to + 1.
However, in terms of a pessimistic bias in beliefs, the fraction of those who reported an expectation of 'worse off' for those who experienced an income increase from time to + 1 of around 50%, is approximately 14%. The second panel of 
Figure 1
 repeated the analysis, but where the focus is on the fraction of those who reported an expectation of 'no change' (we used a dichotomous variable that takes on the value of one for individuals who reported 'no change' and zero for individuals who reported either 'worse off' or 'better off'). Importantly, in terms of rationality in beliefs, those who experienced changes to household income near the regression discontinuity (i.e., no change in household income), were the most likely to have reported an expectation of 'no change'. The fraction of those who reported an expectation of 'no change' decreased as we move away from the regression discontinuity in either direction.
Finally, the last panel repeated the analysis for a final time, but where the focus is on having reported an expectation of 'better off' (we used a dichotomous variable that takes on the value of one for individuals who reported 'better off' and zero for individuals who reported either 'no change' or 'worse off'). The fraction of those who reported an expectation of 'better off' increased as we moved away from the regression discontinuity towards those who experienced the largest positive changes to household income from time to + 1. However, in terms of an optimistic bias in beliefs, moving away from the regression discontinuity towards those who experienced the largest negative changes to household income from time to + 1, is found to be associated with an increased probability of expecting 'better off'. Indeed, the fraction of those who reported an expectation of 'better off' at time for those who experienced an income decrease of around 50% from time to + 1, is approximately 23%. 
Figure 1
. The relationship between financial expectations and changes in household income. Binned scatterplot, which plots the fraction of each financial expectation for the 100 equalsized bins of the change in household income. For presentation, we winsorized the change in household income distribution at the 7.5 th and 92.5 th percentiles. We include the estimated quadratic relationships on each side of a regression discontinuity which occurs when the change in household income is equal to zero.
The comparison of financial expectations at time to changes in household income from time to + 1, formed the basis of measuring unrealistic optimism. As financial expectations were assessed on a 3-point scale, to create our measure of unrealistic optimism we also categorized changes in household income, ∆log( ) +1 , on a 3-point scale (from -1 to +1) ranging from 'worse off' to 'better off'. This financial realization variable, +1 , classified those who experienced a negative change to household income of more than 5% as 'worse off'.
Those who experienced a change to household income between -5% and 5% were coded as 'no change' and lastly, those who experienced a positive change to household income of more than 5% were classified as 'better off'. From these 3-point scales we constructed a 5-point scale (from -2 to +2) of unrealistic optimism, = − +1 . Consistent with the literature, respondents are found to be slightly skewed towards an optimism bias. Specifically, 7.87%
(5.82%) are found to exhibit extreme optimism (pessimism), that is, scoring 2 (-2) on the 5point scale, whilst 27.54% (27.70%) exhibited moderate optimism (pessimism), that is, scoring 1 (-1) on the 5-point scale. This leaves 31.07% who exhibited realistic beliefs, that is, scoring 0 on the 5-point scale.


Measuring cognitive ability.
In Wave 3 of USoc, cognitive function measures were collected.
Five measures of cognitive ability were assessed, covering different domains of cognitive ability. Our first measure of cognitive ability assessed respondents' memory, using an immediate and delayed word recall task. Specifically, participants were read a series of 10 words and immediately afterwards were asked to recall as many words as possible, in any order.
Participants were then asked again, later in the interview, to recall as many words as possible.
Scores form the immediate and delayed word recall task were summed together to produce a single measure, which we refer to as 'Word Recall'. Our second measure assessed semantic verbal fluency, where participants were given one minute to name as many animals as possible.
The final score on this item is based upon the number of unique correct responses. We refer to this measure as 'Verbal Fluency'. Our third measure assessed working memory, which is important for complex cognitive tasks. Here, participants were asked to give the correct answer to a series of subtraction questions. Starting at 100, the interviewer asked the respondent to subtract 7. At the next question, the respondent is asked to subtract 7 again, and so on. There is a sequence of five subtractions. The number of correct responses out of a maximum of five was recorded. We refer to this measure as 'Subtraction Test'. Our fourth measure assessed fluid reasoning or the ability to use abstract thought to solve novel problems. Participants were asked to write down a number sequence, as read by the interviewer. The number series consists of several numbers with a blank number in the series. The respondent is asked which number goes in the blank. Respondents were given two sets of three number sequences, where the difficulty of the second set was determined by performance in the first set. The final score is based on the correct responses from the two sets of questions, whilst accounting for the difficulty level of the second set of problems. We refer to this measure as 'Fluid Reasoning'. Our last measure assessed practical numerical knowledge. Participants were asked up to five questions that were graded in complexity. Based on performance on the first three items, participants can get two additional (more difficult) questions or one additional (simpler) question. The types of questions asked, included: "A second hand car dealer is selling a car for £6,000. This is two thirds of what it cost new. How much did the car cost new?" and "If 5 people all have the winning numbers in the lottery and the prize is £2 million, how much will each of them get?".
The final score is based on a simple count of number of correct items. We refer to this measure as 'Numerical Reasoning'. Lastly, we created a general factor (i.e., composite score) from the five cognitive function measures, which we refer to as 'Cognitive Ability'. This composite measure standardizes and then combines the scores from each of the five cognitive tasks. The level of internal consistency across the five items appears to be high: Cronbach's alpha is 0.72.
The correlation matrix of our measures of cognitive ability are displayed in 
Table 1
. Individuals who performed well in one cognitive ability measure performed well on others. Our primary interest is in the relationship between unrealistic optimism, which is measured repeatedly for each individual-on average 6.9 observations per individual-over the 12 Waves of annual data, and cognitive ability which is only observed in Wave 3 of USoc.
A potential methodological challenge here is that cognitive ability is highly dependent on age, with previous research having illustrated large, non-linear, variations in cognitive ability across the life course 
(Whitley et al., 2016)
. We investigated the relationship between our six measures of cognitive ability and age using Wave 3 of the data and a fractional-polynomial prediction plot. Fractional-polynomials provided us with a flexible parameterization for our continuous variable, age, which allowed us to identify non-linear and non-monotonic relationships. As depicted in 
Figure 2
, cognitive ability is found to be subject to life cycle effects, with our cognitive ability measures found to peak at around middle age and then falling, rather sharply, into older age. If the researcher was purely interested in investigating the correlation between a respondent's cognitive ability in Wave 3 and their unrealistic optimism in Wave 3, controlling for an individual's Wave 3 age would be sufficient to absorb these life cycle effects-and to control for the possibility that unrealistic optimism is also dependent on age 
(Moutsiana et al., 2013)
. However, what if the researcher was also interested in, as we are here, in the correlation between a respondent's cognitive ability in Wave 3 and their unrealistic optimism measured in the other annual Waves of data? Here, controlling for age is less straightforward. To resolve this issue, we conditioned each cognitive ability measure, , for each individual, , (i.e., for = 1, … ,6) on a fourth-order polynomial of age.
Specifically, we estimated the following equation using Wave 3 of the data:
= + ∑ 4 =1 +
The resulting residuals were then standardized to give us individual measures of cognitive ability independent of life cycle effects. 5 Control variables. There are many factors that may explain the relationship between cognitive ability and unrealistic optimism. In the analyses that follows, we included controls for age (in quartic form); gender; educational attainment; marital status; the number of dependent children in the household; the square root of household size; housing tenure; economic activity; logarithm of deflated monthly household income (adjusted by the OECD-modified equivalence scale and entered in quadratic form); logarithm of deflated monthly personal income (in quadratic form); self-assessed general health; and region of residence and year controls. Age and gender have been shown to be related to unrealistic optimism. For instance, there is evidence that unrealistic optimism is lower in middle age and higher in childhood and old age 
(Moutsiana et al., 2013)
. Evidence has also pointed to a lower optimism bias for females than for males 
(Lin & Raghubir, 2005)
. Marital status, the number of dependent children in the household and the square root of household size were included as household composition may affect the ability to forecast accurately. For instance, it may be easier to make realistic judgements about next year's financial position when you live alone. Self-assessed general health is included as a control owing to the established literature on positive illusions and health 
(Taylor & Brown, 1988)
. Here, positive illusions have been found to promote well-being, although in our analysis using general health as a control elevated the concern that well-being may promote positive illusions. Education, housing tenure, economic activity and household income were also included as our primary focus is on the direct correlation between cognitive ability and unrealistic optimism. These controls remove the indirect sources of correlation that may occur for example, due to a tendency for cognitive ability to be associated with higher levels of education, economic activity and wealth, which in turn is associated-perhaps through greater exposure to more normative models of human judgement (Stonovich & West, 1998)-with a tendency to make less unrealistically optimistic forecasts. 


Results
Formal analyses. The main focus of our study was to provide evidence of the direct correlation between unrealistic optimism and our measures of cognitive ability. Most studies on unrealistic optimism only have a cross-sectional component, however, here we had the rare chance to measure unrealistic optimism on a repeated basis for a common 'real-world' task. This is advantageous, as unrealistic optimism, as measured at a certain point in time, is likely to comprise of substantial measurement error. Specifically, unrealistic optimism measured in one period will capture both the systematic psychological bias associated with biased expectations and a stochastic component, capturing random errors of evaluation and unforeseeable shocks to household income. Repeated measures of unrealistic optimism per person allowed us to assess the correlation between optimism bias and cognitive ability with more precision.
In this view, we pooled the data over the 12 Waves and employed a series of multinomial logistic regressions, to establish the relationship between standardised cognitive ability measures, net of life cycle effects, and financial expectations, , financial realizations, +1 , and optimism bias, . As described above, our goal was to provide evidence of the partial (direct) correlation between these dimensions, that is, having conditioned the relationships on the full set of control variables described above. 
6
 As a first test, we separately estimated the influence of cognitive ability on financial expectations and financial realizations. We reasoned, that if lower cognitive ability is significantly associated with lower realizations, but significantly associated with higher expectations then it can be concluded that lower cognitive ability is associated with a greater optimism bias. In this view, we estimated a total of twelve pooled multinomial logistic equations, where the dependent variable was either financial expectations at time or financial realizations from time to + 1. Each of the six cognitive ability measures were entered separately, alongside our control variables, as predictors. The results for the six pooled multinomial logistic regressions (i.e., one for each of the six cognitive ability measures) where the dependent variable was financial expectations at time are presented in 
Table 2 and the
 results from the six pooled multinomial logistic regressions where the dependent variable was financial realizations from time to + 1 are presented in 
Table 3. For Tables 2 and 3, we
 transformed the coefficients into relative risk ratios. A relative risk ratio of one would indicate that a one-unit change in a cognitive ability factor, has no effect on the relative risk of being in one category of the dependent variable relative to another category. Values below one would indicate a reduced risk and values above one an increased risk. In 
Table 2
 a financial expectation of 'worse off' is treated as the base category to which the relative risk of other categories is compared. We used the same base category in 
Table 3
, that is, a financial realization of 'worse off'. As depicted in Tables 2 and 3, all measures of cognitive ability were found to be statistically significantly associated with higher realizations and lower expectations. For instance, from Table 2, given a one standard deviation increase in our composite measure, 'Cognitive Ability', the relative risk of being in the 'better off' category of financial expectations versus the 'worse off' category would be expected to decrease by a factor of 0.915. Whilst, from 
Table 3
, for a one standard deviation increase in our composite measure, the relative risk of being in the 'better off' category of financial realizations versus the 'worse off' category would be expected to increase by a factor of 1.136. It can therefore be concluded that lower cognitive ability is associated with higher unrealistic optimism. The base category is a financial expectation of 'worse off'. The standard errors used to compute the statistics are adjusted to control for intra-individual correlation. We included control variables for age (in quartic form); gender; educational attainment; marital status; the number of dependent children in the household; the square root of household size; housing tenure; economic activity; logarithm of deflated monthly household income (adjusted by the OECD-modified equivalence scale and entered in quadratic form); logarithm of deflated monthly personal income (in quadratic form); self-assessed general health; and region of residence and year controls. Full results are available on request. rrr = relative risk ratio. CI = confidence interval. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001. The base category is a financial realization of 'worse off'. The standard errors used to compute the statistics are adjusted to control for intra-individual correlation. We included control variables for age (in quartic form); gender; educational attainment; marital status; the number of dependent children in the household; the square root of household size; housing tenure; economic activity; logarithm of deflated monthly household income (adjusted by the OECD-modified equivalence scale and entered in quadratic form); logarithm of deflated monthly personal income (in quadratic form); self-assessed general health; and region of residence and year controls. Full results are available on request. rrr = relative risk ratio. CI = confidence interval. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001.
As a second test, we estimated the influence of cognitive ability on our dependent variable, financial realizations from time to + 1, controlling for financial expectations at time and our full set of control variables. We reasoned, that if cognitive ability has no effect on optimism bias, then the distribution of financial realizations would be the same conditional on expectations. However, for instance, if higher cognitive ability is found to be significantly associated with better (worse) financial realizations, controlling for financial expectations, then it can be concluded that higher cognitive ability is associated with relatively less (more) optimism bias. As with our first test, each of the six cognitive ability measures were entered separately, alongside financial expectations at time and our control variables, as predictors.
The results of this procedure-from a total of six pooled multinomial logistic regressions (i.e., one for each of the six cognitive ability measures)-are reported in 
Table 4
. Here, a financial realization of 'worse off' is treated as the base category to which the relative risk of other categories is compared. As depicted in 
Table 4
, higher cognitive ability is associated with higher financial realizations, controlling for financial expectations. It can therefore be concluded that lower cognitive ability is associated with a greater incidence of optimism bias. The base category is a financial realization of 'worse off'. The standard errors used to compute the statistics are adjusted to control for intra-individual correlation. We included control variables for financial expectations; age (in quartic form); gender; educational attainment; marital status; the number of dependent children in the household; the square root of household size; housing tenure; economic activity; logarithm of deflated monthly household income (adjusted by the OECD-modified equivalence scale and entered in quadratic form); logarithm of deflated monthly personal income (in quadratic form); self-assessed general health; and region of residence and year controls. Full results are available on request. rrr = relative risk ratio. CI = confidence interval. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001.
As a third, final and most direct test, we made use of our 5-point unrealistic optimism scale as a dependent variable. As explained in the text, expectations and realizations were coded on a three-point scale thereby creating a five-point optimism scale, = − +1 . 7
7 As in 
Dawson, de Meza, Henley and Arabsheibani (2014)
, the 5-point forecast error measure of unrealistic optimism may, in specific circumstances, lead to respondents being incorrectly classified as unrealistically optimistic. For instance, if for individuals with low cognitively ability the most likely financial realization is 'better off', then in each period their rational prediction is 'better off'. Nevertheless, because next year's financial outcomes are stochastic-that is, there is an element of randomness-some individuals with low cognitively ability may have rationally expected to be 'better off' but got unlucky. It follows that we could falsely conclude from the 5-point scale of unrealistic optimism that low cognitive ability is associated with higher unrealistic optimism. Importantly, this is only an issue if the group found to be the most unrealistically optimistic systematically have better financial realizations. From the results in 
Table 3
, this property does not apply to our data.
As with our previous tests, each of the six cognitive ability measures were entered separately, alongside our control variables, as predictors. The results of this procedure-from a total of six pooled multinomial logistic regressions (i.e., one for each of the six cognitive ability measures)-are reported in 
Table 5
. In 
Table 5
 'realism' is the base category to which the relative risk of being in the other categories of the 5-point unrealistic optimism scale were compared. As depicted in 
Table 5
, for all cognitive ability measures, higher cognitive ability is associated with a lower incidence of 'extreme optimism' and 'moderate optimism' relative to the 'realism' category. We also found evidence that higher cognitive ability is associated with a higher incidence of 'extreme pessimism' relative to 'realism'.
For ease of interpretation, we summarized the key results from 
Table 5
 in 
Figure 3
.
Here, we reported the marginal effect of a change from low (-2 standard deviations from the mean) to high (+2 standard deviations from the mean) cognitive ability on our 5-point unrealistic optimism scale. The marginal effects are reported as percentage points where the control variables were held constant at their respective mean values. We also included in 
Figure   3
, as a scatterplot, the marginal effects transformed into percentages. In 
Figure 3
, low cognitive ability is found to be associated with a greater incidence of 'moderate optimism' and 'extreme optimism' for all cognitive ability measures. There is also evidence that high cognitive ability is statistically significantly associated with a greater incidence of 'extreme pessimism' and 'moderate pessimism'. Importantly, high cognitive ability is found to be associated with more realistic beliefs, for all measures of cognitive ability. As discussed, normative theories of human judgement predict that realistic beliefs are essential inputs into the decision-making process, leading to better decisions and better outcomes for the individual. In support of this, numerical reasoning has been related to financial outcomes such as wealth 
(Smith, McArdle & Willis, 2010)
. In terms of effect sizes, as depicted in 
Figure 3
, those with high cognitive ability (+2 standard deviations from the mean) are found to be 2.91 percentage points less likely to be categorized as 'extreme optimists' than those with low cognitive ability (-2 standard deviations from the mean). This relates to a reduced incidence of 'extreme optimism' of some 39.14%.
High cognitive ability is also found to be associated with an increased incidence of 'realism' of 6.10 percentage points or 21.91%, relative to those with low cognitive ability. Similar magnitudes of results revealed themselves for other aspects of cognitive ability. 251,027 Note: The base category is 'realism' on the 5-point unrealistic optimism scale. The standard errors used to compute the statistics are adjusted to control for intra-individual correlation. We included control variables for age (in quartic form); gender; educational attainment; marital status; the number of dependent children in the household; the square root of household size; housing tenure; economic activity; logarithm of deflated monthly household income (adjusted by the OECD-modified equivalence scale and entered in quadratic form); logarithm of deflated monthly personal income (in quadratic form); self-assessed general health; and region of residence and year controls.

We also repeated the analysis presented in 
Table 5 and Figure 3, for a 3-point scale
 (from -1 to +1) of unrealistic optimism. This scale was created by collapsing the optimistic and pessimistic categories in the 5-point scale. The results from this procedure, reported in 
Table 6
 and 
Figure 4
, support the idea that higher cognitive ability is significantly related to a lower incidence of optimism and a higher incidence of realism and pessimism. 8 Note: The base category is 'realism' on the 3-point unrealistic optimism scale. The standard errors used to compute the statistics are adjusted to control for intra-individual correlation.

 Our 5-point and 3-point unrealistic optimism scales are constructed from nine possible combinations of expectations and realizations. Given this restriction, we also analysed the influence of cognitive ability on the probability of being in each of the nine cells (i.e., nine combinations of expectations and realizations). The results revealed that higher cognitive ability is associated with a higher incidence of realism for all three realism cells and for all cognitive ability measures. Higher cognitive ability was also found to be strongly associated with lower unrealistic optimism for all measures of cognitive ability. The exception is the unrealistic optimism cell categorized by individuals expecting 'better off' and realizing 'no change'. In this cell, there was no statistically significant effects for any of the cognitive ability measures. Lastly, higher cognitive ability was also found to be associated with a higher incidence of pessimism for all three pessimism cells. However, this effect is less prevalent for the expecting 'no change' and realizing 'better off' cell. Additional analyses. One potential issue in our analysis arises from the somewhat arbitrary categorization of financial realizations. For instance, it is not obvious what people meant when they reported a financial expectation of 'no change'. For these reasons, we repeated the analysis that uses the 5-point and 3-point scales of unrealistic optimism, but where financial realizations from time to + 1 were coded around a 'no change' in household income of between -2.5% and 2.5%, -7.5% and 7.5%, -10% and 10%, -12.5% and 12.5% and lastly, -15% and 15%. Here we found, regardless of how we categorize financial realizations, the main results continue to hold.
Furthermore, it is possible that the partial correlation between unrealistic optimism and cognitive ability could be explained by some aspect of personality. Previous research has illustrated a strong relationship between cognitive ability and personality, with cognitive ability being positively associated with emotional stability and openness, and negatively correlated with conscientiousness 
(Rammstedt, Danner & Martin, 2016)
. Research on the association between unrealistic optimism and personality is however limited, but the research relating dispositional optimism to personality has suggested a positive correlation with openness, extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness, and a negative relationship with neuroticism 
(Sharpe, Martin & Roth, 2011)
. In Wave 3 of USoc, we had available the short 15item Big-Five inventory (BFI-15). As with cognitive ability we conditioned our measures of personality on a fourth-order polynomial of age. The resulting residuals were then standardized to give us our measures of personality net of life cycle effects. We then repeated the analysis that uses the 5-point and 3-point scales of unrealistic optimism, including all aspects of personality as control variables. Here we found, including personality factors into our analysis does not moderate the relationship between unrealistic optimism and cognitive ability. That is, the results remained almost completely unchanged (see 
Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplemental   Material)
. Interestingly, openness to new experiences and agreeableness were found to be broadly associated with an increased incidence of optimism and a reduced incidence of pessimism. In addition, neuroticism is found to be associated with an increased incidence of pessimism and a reduced incidence of optimism. There is also found to be no clear evidence of a relationship for conscientiousness, extraversion and our unrealistic optimism scale. It can therefore be concluded the relationship between unrealistic optimism and personality appears to be similar in direction to the literature linking personality and dispositional optimism. This supports the idea that dispositional optimism measures are likely to contain elements of psychological bias and rationality.
Lastly, as we analyzed an unbalanced panel, individuals differ in the number of times we observed their unrealistic optimism. This means that for some individuals we measured their unrealistic optimism with less precision. To mitigate these concerns, we repeated the analysis on a balanced panel of 6,944 individuals observed in all of the 12 waves. Whilst this procedure may have introduced survivorship bias, the results were wholly consistent with those reported in the main text.


General Discussion
It is a puzzle why humans tend towards unrealistic optimism when normative models of human judgement, like expected utility theory, suggest unbiased assessments of probabilities are advantageous. In answering this puzzle, the literature has tended to focus on the affective benefits of unrealistic optimism 
(Taylor & Brown, 1988)
, despite recent evidence which has suggested it may be realists that do best on the well-being front 
(de Meza & Dawson, 2021)
.
Here, we provide evidence from a nationally representative longitudinal survey, that unrealistic optimism, one of the most established psychological 'biases' that plays a crucial role in behavioural science, is associated with cognitive ability. We do this in the context of financial expectations, which are fundamental to key household decisions such as saving, investment and consumption. Therefore, the accuracy of elicited expectations has 'real-world' consequences for participants. Our results suggest that the distribution of financial expectations and financial realizations do differ systematically for levels of cognitive ability. That is, lower cognitive ability is associated with a greater incidence of unrealistic optimism from a combination of higher expectations and worse realizations. Importantly, cognitive ability also matters for accuracy. That is, higher cognitive ability types are associated with an increased incidence of realism. These effect sizes are not small. For instance, those with high numerical reasoning (+2 standard deviations from the mean) are 33.34% less likely to be categorized as extreme optimists and 19.28% more likely to be categorized as realistic, relative to those with low numerical reasoning (-2 standard deviations from the mean).
A large body of literature has highlighted the pervasive nature of discrepancies between objective ability and subjective ability. Indeed, the Dunning-Kruger effect is one of the most famous cognitive biases 
(Kruger & Dunning, 1999)
. Explanations for this belief inaccuracy include statical artefacts such as regression towards the mean 
(Krajc & Ortmann, 2008;
Krueger & Mueller, 2002)
 and perhaps most famously, the metacognitive approach, whereby individuals with low experience or skill in a particular area are unable to properly assess their performance in that area, as they have not yet acquired the discriminatory ability to do so 
(Dunning, Johnson, Ehrlinger & Kruger, 2003;
Kruger & Dunning, 1999)
. Simply, the unskilled lack the metacognitive ability to realize their incompetence. In our analysis, we go beyond the discrepancy between objective and subjective ability in a particular domain and instead look at how cognitive ability affects accuracy in a forecasting task related to household finances. Despite this important departure, it is possible that our results can also be explained by adopting the metacognitive approach. That is, those lower in cognitive ability, do not have the skill to be able to assess their future financial well-being. However, counter to this, financial forecasting is a task all households must conduct on a regular basis, so our participants are experienced. It is also a task where people are frequently exposed to the true state of the world and their competencies. Furthermore, it is unlikely that our results can be explained by regression towards the mean, as we have repeated measurements of unrealistic optimism over approximately a decade. This leads us to consider other possible mechanisms. One possibility is that those lower in cognitive ability are less likely to learn from feedback. Indeed, optimism bias can only be maintained if individuals update their beliefs optimistically when new information is positive but neutrally when new information is negative 
(Drobner, 2022;
Eil & Rao, 2011;
Sharot, 2011;
Sharot, Korn & Dolan, 2011)
. Or, in a similar way, if people attribute past success to their own skill and failure to bad luck 
(Langer & Roth, 1975;
Seligman, 1990)
.
We did investigate whether the relationship between unrealistic optimism and cognitive ability was moderated by differences in asymmetric responses to positive and negative current financial realizations. Whilst we found no supporting evidence of this, unrealistic optimism was found to be more prevalent following a positive financial realization, supporting the idea that experiencing success promotes unrealistic optimism. A final possibility is that unrealistic optimism is correlated with cognitive ability via the emotional system of decision making, whilst more accurate assessments of the future, however dire, may result from reliance on System 2 thinking by the more cognitively able. However, this seems unlikely, as controlling for neuroticism (emotional instability) does little to affect our key conclusions.
In our study, there is the limitation that unrealistic optimism about household finances is a very specific measure of optimism. It is unclear whether these results would emerge in other domains. However, we have reasons to suggest it might. Specifically, our forecasting exercise is performed repeatedly by the same individuals over a decade, in a context where accuracy really matters and where individuals are constantly exposed to the true state of the world. Ideal conditions to be able to elicit individual differences in underlying optimism, if of course, a stable, trait like component of optimism bias does exist. There is also the possible limitation that our unrealistic optimism variable is not particularly fine-grained. For instance, financial expectations are measured on a 3-point scale, ranging from 'worse off than you are now' to 'better off'. Whilst in experimental setting, researchers could ask the alternative, "Please indicate how much you think your income will change by this time next year", experimental samples are not typically nationally representative or reinterviewed over a decade.
Lastly, our results lead us to make some final important conclusions. It is possible that the well documented negative consequences of optimism bias on decision making, such as, excessive business entries and subsequent failures (de Meza et al., 2019), are not a consequence of unrealistic optimism but a side product of the true driver, lower cognitive ability. That said, even those with higher cognitive abilities display significant errors in judgement. This makes it difficult to conclude that unrealistic optimism will be unimportant in markets where participants are likely to have high cognitive abilities 
(Oechssler, Roider & Schmitz, 2009)
. Note: The base category is 'realism' on the 5-point unrealistic optimism scale. The standard errors used to compute the statistics are adjusted to control for intra-individual correlation. We included control variables for age (in quartic form); gender; educational attainment; marital status; the number of dependent children in the household; the square root of household size; housing tenure; economic activity; logarithm of deflated monthly household income (adjusted by the OECD-modified equivalence scale and entered in quadratic form); logarithm of deflated monthly personal income (in quadratic form); self-assessed general health; and region of residence and year controls. Personality traits-openness, neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness-are measured using the short 15-item Big-Five inventory (BFI-15). Each trait is based on a level of agreement with three statements, assessed on a seven-point scale. Responses are added across each set of the three statements and then divided by the number of items over which the sum is calculated. Each trait is the residualized on a quartic of age and then standardized. We report the results of the Big-5 traits from the regression that included the composite measure 'Cognitive Ability' as a measure of cognitive ability.

Data and sampling. To
understand the correlation between optimism bias and cognitive ability, we used data from Understanding Society (USoc) 2009 to 2021 (Waves 1-12). USoc is a nationally representative annual longitudinal survey of some 40,000 households, funded by the
UK Economic and Social Research Council. Wave 1 of USoc included 26,000 households
which were recruited from Great Britain (24,800) and Northern Ireland (1,200) with a further
ethnic minority booster sample included, of some 4,000 households. A further sample of
households were included from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). The BHPS is a
national representative annual longitudinal survey from 1991 to 2008 (Waves 1-18). As part of
Wave 18, BHPS participants were asked if they would consider joining the new, larger and
more wide-ranging survey Understanding Society. Almost 6,700 of just over 8,000 BHPS
participants invited to join did so. The first interviews with BHPS participants were carried out
in Wave 2 of Understanding Society. 3 Sample attrition rates in USoc are generally low and
certainly comparable to those achieved in other similar household panels. Attrition in USoc has

Drobner (2022)
 found that individuals in receipt of piecewise information optimistically updated their beliefs about performance when there was no feedback but neutrally when feedback was imminent. Therefore, when there are affective down-stream consequences to beliefs participants tended to follow a more normative model of cognition, in this case, Bayes theorem.


A further sample of household called the Immigrant and Ethnic Minority Boost Sample (IEMBS), was added in Wave 6. This was approximately 2,900 households selected from areas of high ethnic minority concentration where at least one member was born outside the UK, or from an ethnic minority group. This sample was not included in our analysis as these households were recruited after the collection of cognitive ability measures, which occurred at Wave 3.


Household income can be decomposed into six subcomponents: labour income; miscellaneous income; private benefit income; investment income; pension income; and social benefit income.


Residualizing the six cognitive ability measures on age, whilst important, has little impact on the estimated coefficients in the subsequent analysis.


As our 3-point expectation and realization scales and our 5-point optimism bias scale are plausibly ordered categorical variables, we might have considered using ordered logistic regression. In our case, however, the data was found to violate the proportional odds assumption required for ordered logistic regressions.








The base category is 'realism' on the 3-point unrealistic optimism scale. The standard errors used to compute the statistics are adjusted to control for intra-individual correlation. We included control variables for age (in quartic form); gender; educational attainment; marital status; the number of dependent children in the household; the square root of household size; housing tenure; economic activity; logarithm of deflated monthly household income (adjusted by the OECD-modified equivalence scale and entered in quadratic form); logarithm of deflated monthly personal income (in quadratic form); self-assessed general health; and region of residence and year controls. Personality traits-openness, neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness-are measured using the short 15-item Big-Five inventory (BFI-15). Each trait is based on a level of agreement with three statements, assessed on a seven-point scale. Responses are added across each set of the three statements and then divided by the number of items over which the sum is calculated. Each trait is the residualized on a quartic of age and then standardized. We report the results of the Big-5 traits from the regression that included the composite measure 'Cognitive Ability' as a measure of cognitive ability. Full results are available on request. rrr = relative risk ratio. CI = confidence interval. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001.
