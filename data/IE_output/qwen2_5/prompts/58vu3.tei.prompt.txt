You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Less-is-more is considered a governing principle of cognitive processing in making decisions 
(Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011;
Shah & Oppenheimer, 2008)
, where a reduction in cognitive processing counterintuitively elicits more adaptive behavior.
We argue that embodiment, the notion that cognition is coupled to and constituted through the body and environment 
(Shapiro, 2007;
Thelen et al., 2001)
, is one means with which this is achieved. These two perspectives complement and augment one another to form an enlightening approach to understanding embodied cognition as the natural result of the assumed principles underlying cognition. This novel description gives embodiment a raison-d'être, and explicates a previously implicit blueprint shaping much of cognition.
Cognition is privy to a constant stream of rich information from the body and its actions in the world. This richness means that adaptive behavior results from cognition exploiting the body and the situation, with the aim of reducing computational load 
(Shapiro & Spaulding, 2019)
. In other words, a brain with access to a body can perform computations with the body and -we argue -does this frequently. In contrast to other embodiment perspectives that posit 'cognition is for action' (e.g., 
Glenberg, 1997;
cf. Wilson, 2002)
, less-is-more and embodiment (LIME) emphasizes the other direction: action is for cognition. In this paper we present this new concept and how it underlies much decision making. Following, we present examples of classic phenomena from the realm of sport to demonstrate how LIME underlies adaptive behavior.
Research in sport has been forced to emphasize how cognition deals in complex and resource-limited situations using similarly complex actions to produce effective performance. It is therefore an excellent test bed for identifying the cognitive strategies used by a body with action capabilities 
(Gordon et al., 2021)
. LIME expands on the thriving framework of embodiment, while also connecting it to existing pillars in decision making, and extending it to align with the 'ecological turn' 
(Fischer, 2024;
 Rączaszek-Leonardi, 2016) in cognitive sciences.


Demonstrative Example of Mental and Bodily Computations -Shakey and


Allen
How the body enables adaptive behavior by reducing mental 
(i.e., brain-based)
 computation is eloquently demonstrated by 
Brooks' (1991) assessment of 'unembodied'
 and 'embodied' robots. The first, Shakey, is constructed such that all computation is 'mental': taking place in a detached central module, representing an unembodied brain.
A camera sends visual input to a computer which transforms this input into symbols, these symbols are manipulated to identify adaptive behavior, and this is then backtransformed into an action plan. The second robot, Allen, does not rely on performing extensive computation over symbols in a central module, but rather on perceptual inputs which are directly connected to motor output (e.g., 'halt movement if an obstacle is in the path'). Allen, and other robots like it, can operate in real-time, performing sophisticated tasks, whereas their unembodied siblings take hours to days 
(Matarić, 1998;
Shapiro, 2019)
. Most importantly, the robots' performance seemingly goes beyond its processing limits, by virtue of using the body and situation for computation.
Giving Allen access to his body allows 'mental' computation to be completely removed and replaced by interaction with the environment. This is the reasoning of LIME: We argue that human cognition is more like Allen, adaptive behavior being the result of the brain having access to the body acting in the environment. Although these findings have often been used to support a more radically embodied view of cognition that denies the existence of mental representations, we do not make such claims. This example portrays that the tasks that are often considered as mental can be performed by a body in action, and this is a computationally frugal distribution of responsibility.


Reducing the Need for Mental Computation
The principle "less-is-more" is philosophically embedded in Simon's notion of satisficing. In contrast to the homo economicus envisioned in classical decision making, who maximizes possible gains by engaging in elaborate rational calculation to arrive at decisions, the homo heuristicus satisfices 
(Brighton & Gigerenzer, 2012;
Simon, 1956
).
The satisficing decision maker reduces mental computation by relying on methods which are generally effective in the current environment (i.e., ecologically rational), often replacing extensive decision making rules with basic rules of thumb (e.g., takethe-first heuristic, which involves choosing the first option which is satisfactory, as opposed to considering all options and then choosing the best; 
Raab, 2012)
. Behavior in real life often has limits on time, information, and cognitive resources, which makes a maximizing method unfeasible and ineffective 
(Petracca, 2021)
. Satisficing entails reducing mental computational load while retaining or even improving performance across many situations. Furthermore, the satisficer does not reach decisions which are optimal across contexts, but rather ecologically rational decisions, i.e., good enough for the current context.
Although the principle is most exhaustively described in decision-making literature, similar concepts exist throughout cognitive sciences. The 'cognitive miser' describes the brain's innate tendency to develop strategies which reduce computational load 
(Fiske & Taylor, 1991)
. A number of social processes have been conceptualized as being the result of reducing the need for complex computations already since the 1920's 
(Corcoran & Mussweiler, 2010;
Lippmann, 1922;
Shintel & Keysar, 2009)
. These examples underline a universal tendency for less-is-more: the amount of mental computation is consistently reduced while retaining (and often, as we will see, improving) performance.


Computation in the Body
Embodied cognition describes a broad perspective on cognition which emphasizes the body 
(Thelen et al., 2001;
Wilson, 2002
; for applications in sport psychology see 
Voigt et al., 2023)
. This includes the situatedness of cognition: emphasizing the important role of the immediate context in cognition 
(Robbins & Aydede, 2001)
. Especially the body's ability to act, and to subsequently perceive the environment in terms of action capabilities, is a core component of this view 
(Foglia & Wilson, 2013;
Gibson, 1977)
. While embodiment is a very broad perspective overarching many distinct positions, the common factor unifying the many ways in which research has approached it is that the body's role in shaping and furnishing cognition is more important than let on by classic approaches 
(Shapiro, 2019)
. In this paper, our notion of embodiment focuses on the contribution of the body and situation in aiding cognition to perform computations 
(Gigerenzer, 2021;
Shapiro & Spaulding, 2019
). The body does not 'just' provide valuable input to the mental computation, rather the body and environment perform parts of the computation itself. Therefore, even ostensibly mental computations are often not fully independent from the body.
Some examples of this include that we exploit sensorimotor capacity to aid in perception, abstract cognition, and language understanding. For example, participants wearing a heavy backpack judge the slant of a hill as steeper, arising from perceptual information about difficulty in climbing the hill 
(Bhalla & Proffitt, 1999)
. In place of extensive and uncertain computation about possible action, the sensorimotor-based simulation of walking up the hill is exploited. Similarly, the body can help with abstract computation: children's ability to move their fingers and to distinguish fingers predicts future math ability 
(Barrocas et al., 2020;
Michirev et al., 2021)
. To scaffold the abstract (and therefore more demanding) numerical cognition, the sensorimotor system is exploited to reduce the computational load on mental processing. Indeed, even adults use finger-based representations to perform arithmetic tasks 
(Andres & Pesenti, 2015;
Klein et al., 2011
; similarly, see also 
Boroditsky, 2000)
. Body-based representations also construct the understanding of language 
(Barsalou, 2008;
Körner et al., 2023)
.
When thinking about action concepts like the word 'kick', sensorimotor regions in the brain become active 
(Hauk et al., 2004)
. This even holds for abstract concepts, which we have never interacted with 
(Pulvermüller, 2005;
Günther et al., 2020)
. These examples demonstrate the meaningful ways that even ostensibly non-body-based cognition is not independent from the body and underlines that cognition is constituted of, dependent on, and in constant coupling to the body.


Reducing the Need for Mental Computation by Using the Body
Assuming less-is-more as a fundamental principle guiding computation, and knowing significant parts of cognition are performed using the body and situation, we argue that embodiment acts in service of less-is-more 1 (a concept we term LIME). This seems feasible because the body is a source of very rich information. With rich, we mean that information 'bits' coming from the body are more helpful in arriving at adaptive behavior. This richness comes from two attributes which body and situation have. First, the information is rich because it tends to be task relevant: The body can direct perceptual input towards relevant information, such as looking over the shoulder 1 This point sometimes implicitly underlies reasoning on embodied cognition. 
Shapiro & Spaulding (2019, p. 9
) argue for example: "an embodied perspective […] reveals how the brain's computational burden might be reduced by taking advantage of the body's natural dynamics". Yet these principles have, to our knowledge, never been explicitly combined, which produces novel conclusions (cf. Conclusion).
to find out whether a car is approaching. It is also task relevant because it is -save for a few hundred milliseconds of neural delay -immediate. Second, it is detailed (I can feel minute differences in the position of my toes) with understandable structure (my toes are perceived in relation to my foot, attached to my leg, attached to my hip). As with the embodied and unembodied robots, a body acting in a world is so rich that it allows to drastically reduce the computation which must be performed mentally (or for robots by a central module). This richness of bodily information means that a system aiming to minimize mental computation will find success when exploiting the body and situation to do this.
The core tenet of LIME is: mental computation should be reduced and the body acts in service of this, performing computations. Yet, does this mean that less-is-more causes embodiment? Or does cognition make the body perform computation? We argue that adaptive behavior emerges from the interplay of cognition and a body-in-action (and their respective abilities and limits) over time. Less computation is always favored, so long as the outcomes are satisfactory. Performing computations using the body acting in an environment (i.e., embodying cognition) allows to reduce the amount of computation which has to be performed mentally 
(Petracca, 2021)
. Over time, when less computation is always favored, the body will therefore take on increased computational load. The natural consequence of the less-is-more principle is therefore embodied cognition, but a clear causal chain cannot be described. Consequently, we can say embodied cognition serves the less-is-more principle, and simultaneously embodied computational strategies are driven by less-is-more. This is also why we argue that the embodiment research program should be joined to less-is-more research, because their contents are complementary.
Having described less-is-more and embodiment, we turn to how embodiment serves the less-is-more principle. In other words, how does embodying cognition allow to reduce mental processing while maintaining (or improving) performance. We argue that the body 1) constrains the amount of information which is processed, and 2) allows cognition to off-load information processing into the sensorimotor system and environment.


Constraining
Firstly, embodiment reduces mental computation by constraining. Information input is constrained to task-relevant stimuli (e.g., reducing visual input to solely the most relevant and informative point of information, subsuming the task of weeding out irrelevant information). There is ample evidence that effective performance involves reducing perceptual input 
(Haider & Frensch, 1999)
. For example, sport expertise is often accompanied by a reduction in the number of visual fixations during performance 
(Brams et al., 2019;
Gegenfurtner et al., 2011)
. Second, not just sensory input, but also perceived options for future actions are constrained 
(Pezzulo & Cisek, 2016)
. The body limits focus solely to feasible action opportunities, which in turn improves performance.
A classic example is that individuals, based on their leg-length or strength, perceive steps on a staircase as 'steppable' or not 
(Konczak et al., 1992;
Warren, 1984)
. This use of bodily constraints to constrain action possibilities is similarly reflected in athletes such as climbers who consider options and adjust the complexity of their actions based on their ability to perform a climb 
(Seifert et al., 2021;
Luis del Campo et al., 2024)
.
Similarly, expertise corresponds to reducing the amount of time to determine whether a grasp can be reached 
(Seifert et al., 2018)
. The richness of information (e.g., knowing the exact action capabilities of my arm) allow for perception (e.g., perceiving distance in relation to one's arm length) to immediately discard unfeasible action possibilities without including them in any computations.


Offloading
Secondly, mental computation is reduced by off-loading. Off-loading entails computations being delegated to the body and environment. Take the outfielder problem, a prototypical example in embodiment literature to demonstrate the ways which an embodied mind performs sophisticated tasks without resorting to elaborate mental computations 
(McBeath et al., 1995;
Oudejans et al., 1996)
. An outfielder, attempting to catch a fly-ball is tasked with identifying where to stand in order to catch the ball. While it could be possible that the brain figures out where it is likely to land by computing a location based on the strength of the hit, air friction, gravity, and other forces, this is a computationally heavy method. The embodied method which maintains (and even improves) accuracy is that the outfielder instead runs so that the visual angle while tracking the baseball remains constant. Elaborate mental computation of various variables is replaced by a body in movement maintaining a perception, which, given it is physically feasible, has a one-hundred percent accuracy rate. One could argue that the computation is being performed, but much like our fingers performing arithmetic when clicking buttons on a calculator or remembering a forgotten pin code at the ATM, the body and environment compute the landing location of the ball. In other words, the computation is off-loaded into the body and environment. The outfielder performs better because the method is more accurate, but also more generally because mental resources are preserved for other computations, such as deciding which baseman to throw to.


LIME in Four Exemplary Sport Phenomena
Having outlined the concept of LIME, we aim to give shape to the abstract explanations above by providing examples from research on real-life phenomena. Each of the phenomena describes a domain in sport and how it is an instance of LIME. We choose sport psychology as the domain of interest because it most extensively portrays cognition in the context of a body acting in the world with limited computational capacity (i.e., vast, changing, and complex perceptual information; 
Beilock, 2008;
Gordon et al., 2021)
. The examples are intentionally not perfectly parallel and certainly non-exhaustive. This diversity demonstrates the strength which this concept has, providing clarity and explanatory power beyond lines in the sand drawn by prior frameworks, extending and connects previously disparate fields. LIME connects first principles of cognition to explain, not only other theories, but real life decisions from applied research. This underlines how fundamentally it functions and demonstrates the relevance of this theoretical contribution.


Skill Execution
The first example argues that movement analogies in skill execution are a way to reduce mental computational load by off-loading computations onto the body. The utilization of movement analogies in motor skill learning exploits the richness of preexisting sensorimotor representations, which improves athletic performance by letting existing sensorimotor representations guide motor processes. This not only serves to improve performance in high-pressure situations, but also to prevent reinvestment, a potential cause of performance detriment under performance pressure 
(Masters & Maxwell, 2008)
.
Analogy learning consists of providing athletes with a biomechanical metaphor for the to-be-learned skill, i.e., a familiar movement from another domain. For example, one can learn the topspin forehand movement in table tennis by pretending that the bat is travelling up the side of a mountain 
(Poolton et al., 2006)
. Analogy learning places the guidance of control into existing motor programs. By tapping into existing sensorimotor representations, essential information for motor control is chunked, which in turn reduces load on mental computations needed for motor control 
(Cabral et al., 2020;
Poolton & Masters, 2014
; see for a review 
Kal et al., 2018)
. This improves performance under high demand situations and prevents performance detriment under pressure or manual control, like reinvestment 
(Masters & Maxwell, 2008)
, because learning transpires implicitly with minimal accumulation of explicit knowledge 
(Lam et al., 2009;
Masters, 1992)
.
Consider a Padel (a popular racquet sport similar to tennis or squash) player learning a Padel stroke through analogies. The player is instructed to envision holding the racket like a tray with a drink on it for learning the "Bandeja" stroke or to liken the arm movement for a forehand volley to making stones splash on a lake. Instead of teaching the single components of this movement in several step-by-step instruction (e.g., to raise the elbow of the dominant arm to face height to reach the plateau position with the racket), a single representation (holding a drink tray or making stones splash on a lake) is activated and details are filled in by rich sensorimotor information stemming from previous movement experiences with the analogy (as opposed to mental computation). This approach improves performance by reducing processing of explicit knowledge about the technical movement information, thereby minimizing mental computation.
The less-is-more aspect of movement analogies is evident in the off-loading of mental computation. The single analogy, as opposed to numerous explicit technical rules, offers rich information because many minute details about movement execution are referenced in a single familiar sensorimotor representation. It is embodiment because the richness comes from the existing sensorimotor representations, which are executed to perform the skill. Athletes off-load the control of minutiae in motor execution to existing abilities in the sensorimotor system, replacing conscious (mentally computed) control. In other words, the motor control is embodied.
Importantly, this LIME in skill execution improves performance in two ways.
First, generally by reducing mental computational load. This frees up mental computation capacity for other processes (e.g., remembering serve sequence of the opponent). Yet it also prevents performance decrements in high-pressure situations that are characterized by higher cognitive demand. Second, beyond hindering performance breakdown under high demand generally, analogies also improve performance by preventing more specific performance-impairing mechanisms like reinvestment.
Reinvestment involves athletes monitoring and controlling their movements and decisions using explicit knowledge 
(Kinrade et al., 2010;
Masters & Maxwell, 2008)
, which results in the loss of the automatic movement sequence of the athletes 
(Sullivan et al., 2022;
Tang et al., 2023)
. The embodied analogy learning prevents this loss because athletes rely on ingrained sensorimotor patterns activated through the relevant analogy 
(Liao & Masters, 2001;
Maxwell et al., 2000)
. Reinvestment is prevented (and excellent performance maintained) by hindering the mental computation involved in motor control 
(Lam et al., 2009)
; by off-loading mental computation into the body.


Tactical Decision Making
The second example argues that decision making under physical fatigue Physical fatigue is a momentary reduction in the body's action capability as a result of exertion 
(Trendall, 2000)
, which has profound detrimental effects on an athlete's performance by limiting abilities, e.g., in the form of declined muscle activity 
(Abd-Elfattah et al., 2015)
. Fatigue also has effects on athletes' decisions by increasing the likelihood of making energy-conserving decisions 
(Barte et al., 2020;
Iodice et al., 2017)
 Consider a beach volleyball player who adapts their strategies during competition based on their physical state. For example, in conditions of extreme heat and humidity, where fatigue is more prominent, the player chooses to employ less energy-intensive tactics. They opt for strategic positioning over agile movements, or simpler plays that are less physically demanding. This decision-making process, constrained by the body's physical state, ensures that the employed tactics are not only effective but also sustainable given the athlete's condition.
The less-is-more aspect of fatigue is evident in the constraining of generated options. Firstly, less-is-more must be present under fatigue. Fatigue reduces the capacities of athletes, yet their performance is often maintained. For example, fatigued cyclists showed a reduction in visual information uptake, but still maintained performance when fatigued 
(Zeuwts et al., 2021)
. This demonstrates how, under fatigue, sensory input is constrained. Yet, also the generation of action possibilities is constrained. When making decisions which are executed with the motor system, models of possible movements form the space of action possibilities 
(Lepora & Pezzulo, 2015;
Raab, 2017)
. Importantly, these models are linked to the body, reflect current action capabilities. The current sensorimotor input limits the generated action possibilities, and are impacted by fatigue: e.g., mental simulations of movements are slower when a person is fatigued than when not 
(Demougeot & Papaxanthis, 2011;
Pezzulo & Cisek, 2016)
. This reduction in options facilitates quicker and more efficient decision making.
Mental computation is reduced, yet decisions are made that are more ecologically rational, because they are necessarily aligned with current physical capacity.


Pacing Strategies
The The body strives to maintain a homeostatic balance, and changes in heart rate during exercise reflect these alterations 
(Berntson & Cacioppo, 2007;
Craig, 2003)
.
Heart rate is the output of a computation integrating various visceral signals including vascular and respiratory-driven ones. Additionally, heat, high altitude, and dehydration further increase the heart rate during prolonged exercise, suggesting its sensitivity to factors other than exercise intensity 
(Jeukendrup & VanDiemen, 1998)
 and its ability to summarize the current level of bodily imbalance. Through cardiac interoception, i.e., the awareness of and sensitivity to one's heartbeat and its changes 
(Garfinkel et al., 2015;
Herbert & Pollatos, 2012)
, athletes detect changes in their heart rate and use this information to make decisions regarding the distribution of their power output. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that athletes rely on cardiac changes in effort estimation. In an auditory manipulation of the heart rate feedback during a cycling task, hearing faster rather than true heart rate led to higher perceived effort, despite cycling at the same intensity level 
(Iodice et al., 2019)
. Furthermore, chosen pacing strategy was found to correlate with cardiac interoception ability, demonstrating the importance of perceived heart rate in pacing 
(Herbert et al., 2007)
.
Consider a long-distance runner competing in an ultra-trail race such as Tor des
Géants, a race involving running up and down mountain trails for more than 60 hours (cf. 
Hutchinson, 2018)
. The runners continuously break their homeostasis to gain an advantage over other competitors. The considerable distance to be covered, however, does not permit them to perform at maximum power output throughout, necessitating adjustments in pacing behavior to re-establish homeostasis (St Clair 
Gibson et al., 2018)
. The runner makes continuous decisions to increase, maintain, reduce their speed, or to stop. It has been suggested that bodily balance may be affected by factors such as excessive heat and sleep deprivation but "our brain protects us against our own excessalmost always" 
(Hutchinson, 2018, p. 11)
. Instead of attempting a laborious mental computation of all available information (e.g., breathing frequency, incline, heat, humidity, oxygen level), the status of a single, ecologically rational, signal constrains action possibilities. We argue that our body plays a crucial role in protecting our homeostatic balance by executing part of the computation involved in pacing decisions: via changes in cardiac signal which summarizes visceral information and is thereby used to constrain options.
The less-is-more aspect of cardiac interoception is evident in the constraining of generated options. Computation-heavy consideration of numerous influencing factors, including current fitness level and environmental conditions, is inefficient, uneconomical, and at times impossible. Instead, interoceptive information such as increased heart rate summarizes these factors and allows constraining of the pacing options. Those action possibilities that would substantially disrupt athletes' homeostatic balance and be detrimental to their performance are a priori excluded 
(Pezzulo & Cisek, 2016)
. Following the less-is-more principle, athletes may therefore use cardiac feedback to perform part of the computation necessary for decision making, such as the pacing strategy in endurance sports.


Anticipation
The fourth example argues that the use of sensorimotor simulation in anticipation is a way that mental computation is off-loaded into the body. Through the ability to simulate observed actions, athletes can off-load parts of the ostensibly mental computation into the sensorimotor system. This mechanism provides performers with rich, readily accessible information while reducing the mental computational load needed to process the continuous incoming information 
(Prinz, 1990;
Prinz et al., 2013)
.
This not only maintains performance compared to purely mental computation, but improves anticipation skills and thereby performance.
Across a wide range of sport disciplines, and beyond, anticipation is a critical skill 
(Williams & Ericsson, 2005)
. Anticipation often involves athletes simulating others' movements. Simulation involves the activation of the motor system during action observation 
(Buccino et al., 2001;
Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004)
. The role of simulation in visual perception is so critical that even movements which have never been visually perceived are discriminated better when they have been learned motorically 
(Casile & Giese, 2006)
. The simulation goes beyond shapes on a visual plane, and even the force underlying the movements is perceived 
(Runeson & Frykholm, 1981)
. This further means that it is not only others' movements that we simulate, but also objects' physical relations 
(Battaglia et al., 2013;
Hafri & Firestone, 2021)
. Furthermore, athletes' expertise augments the extent to and detail in which simulation occurs 
(Beilock, 2008)
. This allows to more finely anticipate others' movements, such as detecting whether a movement is deceptive or not based on very small differences (Cañal-Bruland, 2017).
Consider a professional basketball player who, as a result of extensive motor experience, has improved their anticipation abilities. Compared to individuals with similar visual experience (coaches and sports journalists) and novices, basketball players can predict the outcome of free throw shots earlier and more accurately 
(Aglioti et al., 2008)
. The reason for their superior ability is that with expertise, the athletes are better able to simulate others' actions. Furthermore, the influence of simulation is not limited to anticipation skills, but also visual discrimination, such as professional gymnastic judges. These demonstrate higher judgment accuracy in evaluating movement performance when possessing motor experience in a movement compared to judges without 
(Pizzera, 2012)
. This visual discrimination also translates onto the field,
where rugby players' ability to detect deceptive movements is improved with increasing motor experience 
(Jackson et al., 2006)
.
The less-is-more aspect of simulation is evident in the off-loading of action consequences. Anticipation of likely consequences of movements would typically require a computation-heavy calculation on many components such as angle of body, or gaze locations. Instead, the sensorimotor system provides the same information without mental computation (as in the outfielder example) by letting the movements be perceived in one's own sensorimotor system (cf. 
Prinz, 1990)
. We deem the perceptual information provided by simulation rich because it goes beyond visual information, to include causes of movements and transfer of force, among others. For this reason, in predicting action outcomes, it fares better than a purely 'mental' calculation, but simultaneously allows this calculation to be performed by the body. Less computation is required for the athlete to process more information, and despite this reduction in mental computation, performance is improved, because the computation is off-loaded into the body.


How LIME Advances our Understanding of Ecological Rationality
While many embodied cognition proponents have argued that cognition should be viewed as stemming from the need to perform action (cognition is for action; e.g., 
Glenberg, 1997;
cf. Wilson, 2002)
, we argue for the case that action is often a constituent part of cognition (action is for cognition). We have argued that to perform ecologically rational behavior, necessarily in line with the less-is-more principle, cognition is constrained and offloaded by and into the body, respectively. It is able to do this because the body provides rich information, being task-relevant and detailed without becoming opaque 
(Shapiro & Spaulding, 2019)
. We have outlined a variety of sport examples that have demonstrated how athletes' decision making adheres to less-ismore by exploiting the body to perform computation.
We used sport phenomena to exemplify LIME because this was more facilitative in portraying the concept, but also because research in sport has unique strengths.
Regarding the first point, it is difficult to draw a demonstrative example of off-loading from a person sitting at a desk (but see finger-counting and language understanding examples in Section 3). LIME is much more accessible if naturalistic action is required.
Furthermore, the uncertainty, complexity, and time pressure, which are assumed under ecological rationality, are exacerbated in the sport context. Therefore, here more than anywhere, cognition must adhere to the less-is-more principle, while also having a body in action with which to do it. Second, research in sport also has the unique strength that it has made significant progress in understanding subjects in action, because these are de facto components of the research object 
(Maselli et al., 2023)
. Other research may have failed to identify off-loading and constraining, because its research relies on synthetic laboratory situations without a body in action to constrain or off-load.
Nonetheless, LIME should apply beyond sports and also explain real-world everyday situations. Despite often performing tasks with minimal action, we likely still resort to embodied cognition. For the majority of its existence, the brain has served a body acting in a rich environment 
(Cisek & Pastor-Bernier, 2014;
Gordon et al., 2021)
. Therefore, the ways we currently traverse our (comparatively brain-based) everyday experience evolved to serve a body in action and are built on a sensorimotor substrate 
(Bain, 1868;
Glenberg, 1997;
Pezzulo, 2011;
Shepard, 1984)
.
One major strength of LIME is that it provides a mechanics to the origin of embodied cognition and may present a way to explain findings. LIME argues that 'embodied cognition' is the result of aiming to distribute the computational load beyond the confines of the skull. Although embodiment literature rarely discusses why cognition should be embodied, this would be an elegant answer. Furthermore, it would also be a parsimonious resolution to discussions about whether cognition is body-based, by arguing for the moderate position: it can be embodied, and very often is, when this is the most ecologically rational solution. When given the option, cognition will readily exploit the body in order to reduce mental computations.
As mentioned in Section 4, we argue that LIME is an emergent phenomenon, resulting from an interplay of brain, body, and environment. Therefore, less-is-more is perhaps best viewed as a principle governing the maintenance of cognitive processing rules (cf. dynamical minimalism; 
Nowak, 2004)
, in a 'computational Occam's razor':
assuming all else is equal, in deciding between two strategies, the one where mental computation is most reduced will be preferred 
(Kruglanski & Gigerenzer, 2011)
.
Computation strategies with heavy mental computational load will be weeded out over time, which means that those which are maintained will be those that require least mental computation. Because the body and action information is so rich, embodied computation (in place of mental computation) will often win the computational Occam's razor and be retained. This natural selection on cognitive processing rules, scaled up to the monumental number of milliseconds, minutes, and days which humans must make decisions, leads to the emergence of cognitive processing that is heavily embodied. Therefore, computation could likely also be performed without embodying cognition, but under the pressures it is most ecologically rational to do so. Off-loading and constraining are the two main ways in which body and situation can perform computation.
From a meta-theory perspective, LIME has the strength that it unifies two distinct research lines. Integrating theories is the hallmark of scientific progress 
(Kuhn, 1962
), therefore we argue that solely on this point, LIME provides a valuable contribution. Beyond though, as demonstrated in the examples above, giving a common language to different fields allows them to communicate. It provides a common denominator to problems that are typically assessed on different levels of analysis, which should allow to extrapolate principles from one field to another. This commensurability and understanding between fields is likely to invite collaboration and cross-fertilizing ideas.


Conclusion
Whereas classical decision-making literature argued that the computational load of real-life environments was too high and therefore cognition often failed (e.g., 
Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
, or that in dealing with the high computational load, cognition consistently resorted to 'fast-and-frugal' heuristic decision-making (e.g., 
Gigerenzer & Todd, 1999;
Todd & Gigerenzer, 2000)
, we argue that computational load can be reduced by letting the body and environment perform it (for similar positions, see 
Clark & Chalmers, 1998;
Raab, 2020)
. In this sense, a more implicit contribution we have made in the current paper is that less-is-more is the aim to reduce mental computation. With embodiment being the answer to this task, we posit that the computational capacity of a body in action seems to be greater (albeit likely much less precise) than that of mental computation 
(Shapiro & Spaulding, 2019)
.
involves computation being performed by the body. In decision making under fatigue, options which are too effortful are a priori not considered. The, ostensibly mental, task of identifying and excluding unfeasible action options is replaced by the body providing direct access to rich information that exclude unfeasible options. Athletes do not consider action possibilities which are not in their (present) action repertoire. By letting the body's capabilities constrain action options, performance is maintained and arguably even improved because athletes make decisions better suited to their current physical capacity.


third example argues that processing of information related to homeostatic balance is off-loaded into the body and constrains action possibilities. Many aspects of the individual's bodily response to the given task and environmental conditions are summarized in the single interoceptive signal of heart rate. Mental computation is reduced, in line with the less-is-more principle, by letting the body integrate much diverse visceral information into the cardiac signal, which in turn serves to constrain the space of action possibilities. In endurance athletes, performance benefits are attained through efficient pacing, by preventing excessive strain on their body. By virtue of the structure of visceral information, cardiac signals are an ecologically rational summary index to make effective pacing decisions.
