You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on promoting patient participation and communication 
[1]
. This is marking an ideological shift away from paternalistic healthcare practices towards a more collaborative approach that values the patient voice 
[2]
. Patient online access to medical records (hereafter "online access") may be a promising tool to facilitate this development by empowering patients to take a more active role in their own care 
[3,
4]
. The implementation of online access has been gaining momentum in recent years with increasing numbers of healthcare systems worldwide adopting this practice 
[5]
. For example, in the US and Nordic countries online access is already an integral part of healthcare systems 
[5,
6]
. In the Netherlands, patients gained legal entitlement to access parts of their general practice [GP] medical record electronically in July 2020. Access is mainly facilitated through online patient portals that are linked directly to the GP's electronic medical record. Patients are currently able to view medication and allergy lists, medical notes, and diagnostic test results 
[7]
.
Potential positive effects from online access are thought to arise partly due to increased knowledge about personal health (e.g., of a health condition or treatment) in patients, which might subsequently encourage them to be more actively engaged in their healthcare 
[8]
 and facilitate patient informed decision-making 
[4]
. Informed decision-making is the process wherein a patient reaches a choice that is grounded in relevant and good-quality knowledge, reflects the patient's values, and can be subsequently executed 
[9,
10]
. This kind of decision-making helps prevent the occurrence of "decisional conflict" for patients, which refers to the experience of uncertainty or regret concerning their decisions 
[11,
12]
, and can promote treatment adherence 
[13]
.
Patients' expectations of effects from online access are wide-ranging: In a previous interview study, Dutch patients imagined that it would give them a better overview about their healthcare and appointments and that it would promote trust in and improve communication with their GP 
[14]
. They expected increased self-efficacy for actions such as accessing test results independently and imagined that this would lead to fewer telephone calls to the GP office. Participants anticipated an empowered role in the GP-patient relationship and in healthcare decision-making 
[14]
. However, they also had concerns about encountering distress or anxiety when reading sensitive, incomprehensible, or incorrect information in their medical record 
[14]
. Patients expressed similar expectations, both positive 
[15,
16]
 and negative 
[17,
18]
, in other studies.
The extent of the experienced effects, however, seems limited: The results of the few studies that measured the effect of online access on patient empowerment were summarized in a review as inconclusive, yielding no or only small effects 
[19]
. Despite ongoing efforts to comprehend the intricate process of how patient online access to medical records might impact patients and healthcare systems, systematic reviews repeatedly conclude that the current evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the actual influence on patient empowerment and decision-making 
[19]
[20]
[21]
. Furthermore, a previous study revealed that patients who used online access were more likely to indicate that online access would increase their participation in health care, improve the relationship with their general practitioner, and support informed decision-making compared to patients that did not use it, but these between-group differences were very small 
[22]
. To evaluate the impact of online access as a public health measure, further insight is needed into how online access affects patients. Additionally, further investigating effects is crucial for providing accurate information to patients.
Accurate information about possible effects allows patients to make an individual and informed decision about whether they want to use online access 
[23,
24]
.
The recent introduction of online access in general practice in the Netherlands provided the opportunity to explore the early-phase development of effects. Results are thereby likely relevant to countries in similar or earlier implementation stages. Consequently, this study investigates within-person changes in effect measures over a one-year period, thereby allowing comparison of patients who have never used online access with those who have used it or recently started using it.


Methods


Research design
This study was part of a larger project with a longitudinal cohort design, using online surveys. For this study, data from baseline and one-year follow-up measurements, conducted in July 2021 and July 2022 respectively, were used. The project was approved by the XXX Research Ethics Committee (approval number: XXX) and preregistered at the Open Science Framework (OSF): 3gnx2 
[25]
. Pretesting of the survey was conducted with both native and second-language Dutch speakers.
Data collected in this study were pseudonymized before analyses, meaning that the researchers could not identify specific persons from the dataset 
[26]
. The survey as well as analysis scripts, output of the analysis, and pseudonymised data are available or can be requested at OSF 
[25]
. This article adheres to the STROBE guidelines for observational research 
[27]
.


Sample size calculation
The sample size was calculated using the "ufs" package 
[28]
 in R 
[29]
. As we could not infer the effect size from earlier research, we assumed a small effect size of Cohen's d=0.2, a margin of error (half-width) of 0.1, and a confidence level of 95%. The calculation indicated a required sample size of 1545 participants for the baseline to follow-up measurement for the whole group on each belief.


Participant recruitment and procedure
Participants were panel members of the Dutch ISO certified internet research agency Flycatcher 
[30]
. Adult patients residing in the Netherlands, who had at least one contact with a GP within the past six months, were eligible for inclusion in the cohort, as we were interested in recent experiences. The research agency identified eligible panel members and subsequently invited a sample representative of this group based on age, gender, education, and region within the Netherlands to participate in this study. No substitution of participants that dropped out took place at follow-up, as drop-out rates were factored into the sample size calculation. Informed consent was obtained online. Participants received brief written and video explanations about what online access constitutes, as given its recent introduction it was anticipated that not all participants would have experience with online access. Each survey took approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants were reimbursed in the form of panel points, worth approximately 2 euros (2.14 US dollars) for each survey, which could be exchanged for gift vouchers.


Measurements


Socio-demographic characteristics
At baseline (July 2021), the following socio-demographic characteristics were assessed as previous research indicated a potential relationship with the use of or the effects from online access: Age 
[31]
, gender identity 
[32]
, educational level, migration background, and region 
[33]
, digital and health literacy 
[34]
, presence of a chronic illness and health status 
[35]
, and whether a participant ever visited a GP due to a psychological complaint 
[36]
.
Highest completed educational level was categorized into low (e.g., primary education), intermediate (e.g., secondary vocational education), and high (e.g., university education) 
[37]
. A participant was considered a migrant if they were born abroad 
[38]
. Digital literacy, defined by the American Library Association as "the ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills" 
[39]
, was assessed using five items from the Dutch "Quick scan digital skills" measurement tool. It was developed by the Dutch Centre of Expertise on Health Disparities to identify patients' digital literacy in general practice 
[40]
. Items asked e.g., "Do you sometimes use an app?" with response options and scores "no" (0), "with help of for example family or friends" (2) and "yes" (4). All item scores were a) summed; b) divided by five; and c) multiplied by 25. Sum scores ranged from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher digital literacy. The World Health Organization describes health literacy as the skills individuals need to gain access to, understand, and use information in ways that promote their health 
[41]
. To assess health literacy, six items from the HSL-EU-Q47 
[42]
 were selected that cover all cognitive domains deemed necessary to handle health information within the health care setting 
[43]
. The selection was made to provide a multifaceted yet concise indication of health literacy. Items were phrased as questions (e.g., "How easy would you say it is to find information on treatment of illnesses that concern you?") with response options "very easy" and "easy" coded as 1, and "difficult" or "very difficult" coded as 0 
[44]
. Health literacy sum scores were calculated by summing the responses and ranged from 0 to 6 with higher scores indicating higher health literacy.


Use of online access
At baseline and follow-up, participants were asked, "Have you ever accessed your GP medical records online?" with answer options "no" or "yes". Based on their answers, participants were categorized in three separate groups: 1) Established users who had used online access prior to the study, 2) new users who started using online access during the course of the study, and 3) never users who did not use or start using online access through ought the study.


Changes in beliefs about effects of online access
In this study, the term "effects" refers to the impacts of online access, such as its influence on the number of consultations. The term "development of effects" refers to the progression or evolution of these effects over the one-year study period. Beliefs about the effects of online access (hereafter: "beliefs") were assessed at both measurement points using 16 items. Content of the items was derived from expectations mentioned by patients in a preceding interview study 
[14]
. Those expectations were operationalized by following instructions on measuring instrumental attitude belief expectations from the PsyCoRe repository 
[45]
: Items all began with "By using online access, …" followed by the possible effect. Bidimensional 7-point Likert scales were embedded in the statements with the left anchor being the lesser/lower/worse assessment and the right more/higher/better assessment of a belief (e.g., "… I have way less (1) -way more (7) overview about my healthcare"). Eight items assessed expected practical changes in healthcare, five items expected impact on affective outcomes and the GP-patient relationship, and three items expected influence on informed healthcare decision-making. Within-person changes in each belief over time were calculated by subtracting the score at baseline from the score at one-year follow-up and could range from -6 to 6.


Analysis
Analyses were conducted in SPSS 28. Descriptive statistics characterized the study population. Chi-square tests post-hoc adjusted standardized residuals analysis 
[46]
 were performed to determine whether the proportion distribution of participant characteristics measured with categorical variables was equal, and one-way Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc Tukey HDS tests were performed to determine whether means of characteristics measured with continuous variables differed between the three user groups.
For the main analyses, first it was analyzed whether there were differences between group means. In contrast to randomised controlled trials, in nonrandomized or observational studies it cannot be assumed that the pre-test means of the groups are equal. Consequently, it is not obvious to what population mean the individuals in a category regress, and rather than correction for baseline (ANCOVA) exploration of means (ANOVA) is advised 
[47]
. Therefore, sixteen separate ANOVA were performed to compare the effect of user category on the mean change in individual beliefs. User category was the independent variable and changes in beliefs between measurements the dependent variable. Eta squared (η 2 ) was reported as effect size. In accordance with common practice, η² was classified as indicating a small effect (0.01 ≥ η² < 0.06), medium effect (0.06 ≥ η² < 0.14), and large effect (η² ≥ 0.14). To control for multiple testing, we used the Benjamini and Hochberg linear step-up method 
[48]
 to calculate adjusted significance levels for each separate ANOVA.
Second, in case the p-value was significant, we used Tukey HSD tests for multiple comparisons to find out which means were different from each other. For those post hoc comparisons, p-values ≤ .05 were interpreted as significant. Adjusted residual analysis showed that chronic disease presence was higher in the group of established   After adjusting significance levels to control for multiple testing, the analyses revealed significant differences in five of the sixteen measured changes in beliefs between the three user categories:


Results


Sample description


Effect of user category on mean changes in beliefs
The decline in the belief that online access 1) improves overview of appointments was greater for new users than never users. The decline in the beliefs that online access 2) increases the ability to correct mistakes in the medical record, 3) increases patients time investment in healthcare, and 4) increases patients' ability to prepare consultations, was greater for new users than for both established or never users. Additionally, the decline in the belief that online access 5) leads to better communication was greater for new users than established users.
User group category accounted for a small proportion of the variance (indicated by the effect size η 2 ) in the change in the belief that online access increases patients' time investment in healthcare. For all other significant differences in changes in beliefs, the proportion of variance accounted for by user group category was negligible. User category accounted for significant variability in changes in beliefs between 0.5 and 1.1%.


Discussion and Conclusion 4.1 Discussion
This study investigated the effects of patient online access to medical records by analyzing within-person changes in perceived effects over a one-year period, comparing patients that never used online access to those who have used it or recently initiated use. Most changes in beliefs did not differ between the groups. Five of the sixteen beliefs declined more in new users compared to at least one other user group. These beliefs centered around patients' perceived empowerment to actively participate in their healthcare process, either by possessing the ability to do so or by actually engaging in such actions. However, these between-group differences in within-person changes were small or negligible.
These findings are in line with the observations of several reviews, which indicate that existing research does not provide evidence to support the idea that online access significantly improves the patient-provider relationship or empowers patients by enabling them to participate more in their own care process 
[19,
20]
. The perhaps most apparent explanation is that the potential impact of online access on patient empowerment, the GP-patient relationship, and informed decision-making might not be as substantial as initially assumed.
Moreover, the findings may also indicate that there is potential for improvement in the current system of online access in the Netherlands. Experiences from other countries warn that rushed or inadequately funded implementation of online access could result in systems that fail to adequately consider the patient perspective, thus diminishing the utility and value of online access 
[49]
. At the time of statutory introduction of online access in the Netherlands, many online patient portals were still under development. User tests conducted in 2022 revealed that 17% of Dutch patients encountered difficulties in creating an account for those portals, and over half of the patients failed to retrieve their GP medical record 
[50]
. Patients in the Netherlands 
[14]
 and reviews that included research from various countries 
[51]
 reported technical difficulties and a complex and complicated interface of an online access environment as major obstacles for use and utility. Particularly patients with limited digital or health literacy may be affected more by these challenges than average 
[31]
 and might thus experience less benefits than average 
[22]
. Enhancements in accessibility at the portal level 
[52]
 or providing additional training specifically for vulnerable groups 
[31]
 could address these challenges, but further research is needed to identify the best strategies to support patient groups with lower digital and health literacy in accessing their medical record.
Another challenge hindering the realization of benefits might arise from the fact that medical records have traditionally been created to be viewed by healthcare professionals, rather than by patients themselves. As a result, these records often employ language that is difficult to understand for individuals without medical training 
[53]
, potentially impeding their overall experience and the benefits derived. Further, patients may not be able to accurately interpret numbers of test results without contextual information, especially those patients with limited health literacy and numeracy skills 
[54]
. Patients' concerns that the medical language used and numbers presented in their record are incomprehensible for them 
[14]
 reflect those issues. At best, this leads to a lack of perceived advantages, and at worst causes confusion and concerns for patients 
[55,
56]
. It is considered unlikely that medical shorthand and jargon in medical records will change in the near future, given their ease of use and established professional writing norms 
[56]
. But undoubtedly, it will be necessary to investigate strategies to modify documentation practices to ensure comprehensibility for lay readers. This could entail the establishment of a system for automatically converting complex medical language and codes into lay language 
[53]
 or exploring the feasibility of writing notes collaboratively with patients 
[57]
. Healthcare providers have acknowledged the importance of physician education in developing and promoting optimal documentation practices 
[57]
. However, considering GPs' and other healthcare providers' concerns 
[20]
 and experiences 
[58]
 of implementation of online access increasing their workload, future research has to explore how this can be done without imposing additional burden on them.
By fulfilling these fundamental prerequisites, online access may provide patients with valuable insight into their health information. However, the potential benefits of online access for patient-provider communication appear to depend upon physician behaviour 
[59]
. In order to truly enable more patient-centered healthcare and informed decision-making, it is crucial that patients are also given the opportunity to evaluate different options, i.e., regarding two treatments, to consider their individual values, and to exercise the degree of control they choose over their health care decisions 
[10]
.
Consequently, realizing the potential of online access may likely require additional adjustments to standard consultation and treatment procedures. Future research might explore key conditions in healthcare procedures and patient-provider communication dynamics that create a conducive environment for online access to effectively contribute to patient empowerment.
This study has limitations. It is unclear why the results show a slight decrease in beliefs in potentially favourable effects after participants began using online access. The observational nature of this study does not allow for identifying causal factors. It may be that socio-demographic characteristics that differ between participant groups are related to online access, but previous research indicates that these factors contribute only minimally to explaining use 
[24]
. However, notably, in the current study a higher proportion of established users reported having a chronic condition compared to those who began using online access during the study (49.0% vs. 39.4%). Differences in motivation for use between the groups could provide a plausible explanation for the findings of this study, with new users possibly being influenced by curiosity evoked during the baseline measurement (i.e., mere measurement effect) and established users more likely being driven by health-related reasons. Utility might be proportionately greater for the latter, as patients with (long-term) conditions or recent health events tend to benefit more from accessing their medical records 
[60]
. Consequently, satisfaction with the experience of accessing the medical record may be higher for this group. Conversely, new users may have experienced disappointment as the medical record lacked immediate relevance to their health needs. Future observational research should include the reasons and frequency of patients' online access usage as well as a measure of satisfaction to contextualize findings.
The study design also has notable strengths: First, the longitudinal measurements enabled us to examine individual-level changes, enhancing the ability to draw causal conclusions. Second, in addition to building upon previous research conducted in various contexts and countries, we incorporated insights from prior local qualitative research to inform the selection of variables to measure effects. This approach provides a detailed insight into the experienced effects of online access. The findings and implications are likely also relevant for countries with similar socio-cultural contexts and technical infrastructure 
[61]
.


Conclusion
This study did not find strong evidence of effects of online access on practical changes in healthcare, the GP-patient relationship, and informed decision-making. Possibly, this finding indicates a need to improve the current system of online access in the Netherlands in terms of accessibility and comprehensibility of information in the medical record and to establish consultation procedures that facilitate benefits from use. Future research should explore conditions under which online access might be beneficial for patients, and especially the needs of vulnerable patient groups.


Practice implications
The potential for online access to benefit for patients is likely to depend on the consideration and integration of the patient perspective. To maximize the advantages, it is therefore advisable to create the necessary and supporting conditions. This may include, but is not limited to, improving accessibility at the portal level, ensuring comprehensibility of health information in medical records, and providing training specifically for vulnerable groups. Additionally, for online access to facilitate informed decision-making, consultation and treatment processes may need to incorporate a greater focus on individual patient preferences and enable patients to take control of their healthcare decisions.

A
total of 1769 individuals participated in this study, comprising 510 (28.83%) established users, 386 (21.82%) new users, and 873 (49.35%) never users. The three user groups differed in age (F(2, 1769) = 6.10, p = .002), digital literacy (F(2, 1769) = 22.38, p < .001), presence of chronic disease (X 2 (2, 1769) = 12.69, p = .002), and visiting the GP due to a mental health complaint (X 2 (2, 1769) = 7.74, p = .021). Post-hoc Tukey HSD tests indicated that the new users were younger (M = 51.85, SD = 15.78) compared to both established users (M = 54.53, SD = 15.61) and never users (M = 55.21, SD = 15.87). Additionally, digital literacy was lower among never users (M = 8.95, SD = 1.96) compared to both established users (M = 9.53, SD = 1.33) and new users (M = 9.42, SD = 1.45).
