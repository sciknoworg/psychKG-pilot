You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Social media is a major source of vaccine and health (mis)information 
(Jones et al., 2012;
Wawrzuta et al., 2021)
. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the barrage of information spreading about the pathogen and its treatment online, including false and misleading claims, was termed an "infodemic" that could lead people to become confused and overwhelmed 
(Cinelli et al., 2020;
Islam et al., 2020)
. Thus, understanding how vaccination-related information spreads and how people evaluate the source of this information is critical for developing interventions related to vaccine decision-making.
A study of Twitter posts about COVID-19 vaccines during April 2021 found that profiles containing biomedical credentials were present in both the pro-and anti-vaccine communities 
(Harris et al., 2024)
. These biomedical credentials included academic prefixes and suffixes in a user's name or handle (e.g., 
Dr., Professor, MD, MPH, RN, PhD)
, and professional or educational information in a user's description (e.g., scientist, retired nurse). In both communities, users who had biomedical credentials on their profiles disproportionately occupied central network positions important to information propagation, and received significantly more engagement on their vaccine-related posts compared to users without credentials in their profiles. 
Harris et al. (2024)
 hypothesized that users with biomedical credentials were more influential because these credentials increased their perceived expertise on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination in both the pro-and anti-vaccine communities. However, they did not empirically test whether the presence of biomedical credentials increases perceived expertise. Thus, this research aims to provide a controlled and direct test of how the presence of biomedical credentials in social media profiles affects perceived expertise on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination by observers.


Expertise Cues
Individuals utilize source credibility as a criterion to access information truth 
(Schwarz et al., 2016;
Schwarz & Jalbert, 2020)
. Judgments of source credibility are often based on declarative information that bears on the source's expertise, education, or achievement (for reviews, see 
Eagly & Chaiken, 1993;
Petty & Cacioppo, 1986)
. Individuals can access source credibility through heuristic or analytical means 
(Schwarz & Jalbert, 2020)
, although digital platforms may encourage heuristic reasoning due to an overabundance of content that requires rapid evaluation and limited information about and verification of source identity 
(Lin et al., 2016;
Sundar, 2007)
.
Healthcare providers are often identified as trusted sources of vaccine information who shape individual decisions about whether to get vaccinated 
(Berenson et al., 2021;
Freed et al., 2011;
Reiter et al., 2020)
. In prior studies on online health information, sources with medical credentials were viewed as having greater expertise, trustworthiness, and credibility . Similarly, statements attributed to scientific journals and articles are seen as more truthful and trustworthy 
(Nadarevic et al., 2020;
Verma et al., 2017)
, and exposure to vaccine misinformation that cites scientific articles is associated with a reduction in vaccine intent 
(Loomba et al., 2021)
.
Other work has directly compared reactions to health messages by biomedical professionals versus other sources. Scientists advising mandatory mask-wearing were rated as having greater competence and integrity than politicians writing on the same topic 
(Janssen et al., 2021)
, and people were also more likely to believe fact-checking posts about health topics when they come from doctors or public health agencies compared to people who did not indicate they were biomedical professionals 
(Amazeen & Krishna, 2020;
Vraga & Bode, 2017)
. However, it is important to note that the way individuals obtain health-related information has changed over time. During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals relied heavily on social media as a source of health information, with many following individual health experts 
(Neely et al., 2021)
. Previous work has largely examined the impact of expertise cues outside of a social media context or has focused on expertise cues tied to a specific institution (e.g., the CDC). Less is known about the impact of biomedical credentials that individual users choose to appear on their social media profiles. Thus, whether these credentials may also confer an individual with perceived expertise on the topic of COVID-19 vacation remains an open question, and is one of particular importance given that any individual (relevant expert or not) has the ability to add or remove these cues from their profile. In this context, reliance on biomedical credentials may be advantageous if it leads individuals to place higher trust in individuals with relevant expertise who are motivated to share accurate information. However, this reliance may be problematic when the public is unable to discern genuine expertise from non-genuine expertise 
(Cummings, 2014)
, especially considering that anti-vaccine influencers frequently leverage credentials 
(Kata, 2010;
Prasad, 2022)
, which could be a persuasive tactic 
(Bradshaw et al., 2020
(Bradshaw et al., , 2022
.


Observer Characteristics
Observer characteristics may moderate how biomedical credentials are perceived. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a key area of focus has been the relationship between conservatism, anti-vaccination sentiment, and trust in medical experts. In the context of media behavior, individuals who consume more conservative media (like Fox News) and who follow more U.S.
Republicans on Twitter hold more vaccine-hesitant attitudes 
(Green et al., 2023;
Rathje et al., 2022)
. In addition, anti-vaccine Twitter accounts share more right-leaning news 
(Muric et al., 2021)
. These anti-vaccination attitudes are concerning given the public health consequences of forgoing vaccination. For example, one study of deaths in Ohio and Florida found that the excess death rate was markedly higher among Republican voters compared to Democratic voters after COVID-19 vaccines were made available to all adults compared to the pre-vaccine period. This pattern was attributed to lower vaccine uptake amongst Republican voters. In addition, this difference between Republican and Democratic voters was larger in areas with lower vaccination rates 
(Wallace et al., 2023)
 A narrative that has recently gained traction is that conservatives and those in the anti-vaccination community do not recognize biomedical credentials as conferring expertise (e.g., 
Chait, 2020;
Oreskes & Conway, 2022;
Shmerling, 2021)
, based on the findings that conservative (vs. liberal) individuals have lower trust in scientists as a source of information about vaccination 
(Hamilton et al., 2015)
 and lower belief in scientists' ability to understand COVID-19 
(Evans & Hargittai, 2020)
. There also is a general distrust for experts in anti-vaccine communities which appears to have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic 
(Bradshaw, 2022;
Griffith et al., 2021;
Hughes et al., 2021;
Kata, 2010)
. These findings appear inconsistent with the observation by 
Harris et al. (2024)
 that individuals with biomedical credentials were more influential than users without credentials in both pro-vaccination and anti-vaccination networks, which points toward a valuation of biomedical credentials regardless of stance on vaccines.
Thus, it is critical to understand how perceptions of users with and without biomedical credentials may vary depending on an individual's vaccination attitudes and political affiliation, especially in the recent context of the COVID-19 pandemic. One possibility is that individuals who are more vaccine-hesitant and conservative may not believe that biomedical credentials confer expertise on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination. In this case, we would not expect biomedical credentials in online user profiles to increase perceived expertise on COVID-19 vaccination among these individuals. Another possibility is that more conservative and vaccine-hesitant individuals do believe that biomedical credentials confer expertise. However, the role these credentials play may vary as a function of their context, such as the identity of the communicator or the content of the message being communicated, and whether these are in conflict or alignment with the information seeker's identity and belief 
(Berl et al., 2021)
.
Credentials may therefore be influential in both pro-and anti-vaccination contexts. In this case, we would expect credentials to confer expertise for all individuals when minimal information about the communicator and their stance toward vaccines are provided.


Present Investigations
We conducted four experimental studies investigating how the presence of biomedical credentials in a user's profile influenced viewer perceptions of user expertise on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination. Experiments 1a and 2a were conducted in a general Prolific sample, while Experiments 1b and 2b were replications of each in Prolific samples of conservative participants (half vaccinated, half unvaccinated), as this was a key demographic of interest. Each experiment followed the same basic methodology. Twitter users (Ns = 200-201) were shown a series of mock Twitter profiles and judged to what extent they believed each user was an expert on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination. Half of the profiles contained biomedical credentials typical of those present in online profiles, while half appeared without these credentials. We then investigated whether participants judged users with profiles appearing with (vs. without) credentials to have more expertise on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination. We also varied where biomedical credentials appeared within profiles (i.e., name, handle, description, or some combination of the three) and checked whether credentials affected perceived expertise in each location to ensure our reported results were generalizable to the variety of ways credentials appear in profiles. In addition, we looked at how individual differences in vaccination attitudes, vaccination status, and political orientation moderated the influence of biomedical credentials on perceived expertise. Given the similarities in method and analysis across these experiments, we report the methods and results of 1a and 2a together, and the replications of 1b and 2b together.


Experiments 1a and 2a 1
Study methods and hypotheses were preregistered (Experiment 1a: https://osf.io/en6km, Experiment 2a: https://osf.io/sqm8f). Each experiment investigated the impact of biomedical credentials on a Twitter user' perceived expertise on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination. The main comparison between the credential present and absent conditions was preregistered as the primary analysis, while the remaining analyses are exploratory. Full stimuli, data sets, and script for analysis for all experiments in this paper can be found at https://osf.io/dbcf8/. We conducted Experiment 1a and Experiment 2a in June 2023.
In Experiment 1a, profiles consisted of a name, handle, and profile picture, representing the user information viewers see when scrolling through a Twitter feed. In Experiment 2a, profiles again included profile names (name and handle), a profile picture, and a user description, representing the user information viewers see while hovering their mouse over a user's name or when directly viewing a user's profile. Examples of each of these profile views can be seen in 
Figure 1
.


Method


Design 1
The procedures for all experiments reported in this paper were approved by the University of Washington's Institutional Review Board (IRB) with the approval number 00017635.
Each experiment used a 2 (biomedical credentials: present or absent) within-subjects design. Each participant viewed and judged 36 profiles, half appearing with biomedical credentials and half appearing without biomedical credentials. For the profiles that appeared with credentials, we also varied the location of credentials. In Experiment 1a, one-third of the profiles had credentials in the name only, one-third had credentials in the handle only, and one-third had credentials in both. In Experiment 2a, one-third of the profiles had credentials in the profile names (defined as credentials in either the name, handle, or both), one-third had credentials in the description only, and one-third had credentials in both the profile names and description.


Participants
We recruited Prolific users located in the U.S. who reported using Twitter and had a minimum approval rating of 95%. Prolific is an online subject pool commonly used to collect data for human-subjects research. We excluded participants who had participated in one of our previous studies using similar mock Twitter profile materials, as seeing the same profiles before may influence our results. Additionally, as part of the requirements of our funding, participants could not be University of Washington employees, family of University of Washington employees, or a University of Washington student involved in this particular research.
A power analysis using G*Power 
(Faul et al., 2007)
 with a small effect size of f = 0.10, α = .05, power (1-β) = .80, two-tailed, and a correlation among repeated measures of .5, indicated a total sample size of 199 participants needed to detect a difference in outcomes between the biomedical credentials present and absent conditions. We thus recruited 200 participants for each study, with 200 participants completing Experiment 1a (M age = 33.74, SD age = 12.59; 51.7% male, 41.5% female, 4.4% non-binary) and 201 participants completing Experiment 2a (M age = 37.99, SD age = 13.34; 45.8% male, 52.7% female, 1.5% non-binary).
Participants were required to take the survey on a computer (not a tablet or phone). Experiment 1a was estimated to take 5 minutes or less and participants were paid $1.00. Experiment 2b was estimated to take 7 minutes or less (due to the additional time to read profile descriptions) and participants were paid $1.40. These payments were consistent with Prolific's current recommended rate.


Materials
For each study, we created 36 mock Twitter profiles, each with a biomedical credential-present and biomedical credential-absent version. Profiles consisted of profile names (name and handle) and profile pictures for Experiment 1a, and profile names, descriptions, and profile pictures for Experiment 2a. Profiles were based on existing Twitter users taken from a set of 5,147 individual users with English-language profiles who tweeted about COVID-19 vaccines during April 2021 
(Harris et al., 2024)
. In this data set, profile names, handles, and descriptions were manually reviewed to identify biomedical credentials that could signal expertise, defined as listing training or employment as a medical professional or scientist. Additional details regarding this data set and coding can be found in 
Harris et al. (2024)
. Half of the chosen profiles originally contained biomedical credentials (with one-third in each of the possible credential locations), while half of the profiles did not contain these credentials. In Experiment 2a, in conditions where credentials could appear in the profile names (made up of the name and handle), credentials appeared in the name only one-third of the time, in the handle only one-third of the time, and in both one-third of the time. Half of the chosen profiles were male-presenting and half were female-presenting. We selected profiles to represent users with a variety of characteristics (e.g., demographics, professions) but were not able to systemically select profiles on specific characteristics given the limited information we had about each user in the data set.
In each experiment, we anonymized profiles to protect the privacy of the original users and ensure participants did not have pre-existing knowledge about the user. In doing so, we kept the same formatting of the name, handles, and descriptions but changed the specific name and other details. We also removed obvious cues of political partisanship and vaccination attitudes to make profiles more neutral. Some of the stimuli names and images used came from those created by 
Jalbert et al. (2023)
. Additional names and images were created using a similar procedure, with common names selected from recent census data and stock images taken from Pexels.com.
None of the profile images selected contained cues related to biomedical credentials, such as attire associated with medical jobs. Some of the same profile names and handles were used in both experiments, while some were used in just one. We checked that the handles we created did not represent currently well-known users (<1000 followers if the account existed). Examples of this adaptation process can be seen in 
Table 1
, while examples of final biomedical credential present and absent versions of stimuli can be seen in 
Figures 2 and 3
 respectively. To control for item effects, we created two counterbalances of the 36 profiles, varying which half of the profiles appeared with biomedical credentials between subjects. Thus, each profile appeared a similar number of times with and without credentials across participants. 2


Measures
Our primary variable of interest was ratings of perceived expertise in COVID-19 vaccination. For each profile, participants answered the question "To what extent do you believe this user is an expert on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination?" on a six-point unnumbered scale from "not at all" (coded as 1) to "very much" (coded as 6). This item was modeled after the dependent variable to assess source expertise in 
Clark et al. (2012, Exp. 1)
.
We also asked participants to complete measures of vaccination attitudes, vaccination status, and political orientation for exploratory purposes. For vaccination attitudes, participants rated nine statements from a COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS; Grossman-Giron et al., 2023) on a five-point scale from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". For vaccination status, participants were asked "What is your COVID-19 vaccination status?" and chose from the For political orientation, we used an adapted measure from the American National Election Studies (ANES) surveys. Participants were told "Here is a 7-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal (left) to extremely conservative (right). Where would you place yourself on this scale?" and responded on a seven-point scale from "extremely liberal" (coded as 1) and "extremely conservative" (coded as 7) with "neither liberal nor conservative" as the center label.


Procedure
After reading an information sheet and indicating their agreement to participate in the study, participants were shown the series of 36 Twitter profiles and asked to imagine that they came across these profiles while using Twitter. For each profile, they answered the measure assessing to what extent they believed the user was an expert on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination.
Next, participants completed the measures of vaccine attitudes, vaccination status, and political orientation followed by additional demographic questions of gender, age, ethnicity, and nationality. Finally, participants read a debriefing explaining the purpose of the study and that, while the profiles they viewed were based on real Twitter profiles, they did not represent currently existing users.


Results


Analytic Approach
Data analysis for all experiments in this paper was performed on SPSS Statistics 
(IBM,
version 28
). To answer our main question of whether Twitter users with biomedical credentials were perceived to have more expertise on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination, we conducted a paired-subjects t-test comparing the mean expertise ratings of profiles with and without biomedical credentials. Effect sizes d z use Hedges' correction for small sample sizes, and for all analyses in this paper, means reported with 95% CI are estimated marginal means. A full description of our analytic approach for our exploratory analyses can be found in the supplemental materials.


Biomedical Credential Presence
In Experiment 1a, consistent with our predictions, we found that users with profiles containing biomedical credentials were judged to have significantly more expertise on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination, M = 3.85, SD = 1.04, compared to profiles without these credentials, 


Exploratory Analyses 3
Individual Differences. Looking at our individual difference measures, participants in each experiment skewed liberal, Experiment 1a: M = 2.93, SD = 1.65; Experiment 2a: M = 3.07, SD = 1.70 (1 = extremely liberal; 7 = extremely conservative), vaccinated, Experiment 1a: 160 fully vaccinated, 33 unvaccinated; Experiment 2a: and 161 fully vaccinated, 30 unvaccinated), and low in vaccine hesitancy, Experiment 1a: M = 34.37, SD = 9.24; Experiment 2a M = 33.6, SD = 9.95 (scale range 9-45, higher value = less hesitant).
Looking across variations in these individuals differences, we found that vaccination attitudes and political orientation significantly moderated the effect of biomedical credentials in both experiments, both Fs > 4.44, ps < .037, and vaccination status significantly moderated these effects in Experiment 2a, F (1, 189) = 9.52, p = .002, but not in Experiment 1a, F (1, 191) = 0.03, p = .853. Less vaccine-hesitant and more liberal participants were more influenced by the addition of biomedical credentials, and, in Experiment 2a, vaccinated (vs. unvaccinated) participants were more influenced. However, importantly, the impact of biomedical credentials on perceived expertise remained significant across high and low levels of vaccination attitudes, political orientation, and vaccination status, p < .001 one standard deviation above and below mean values. A full breakdown of vaccination status reported by participants in each experiment can be found in 
Table 2
.


Biomedical Credentials Location.
In each experiment, we found a significant difference among the three biomedical credential location conditions, both Fs > 167.62, ps < .001. In Experiment 1a, profiles with credentials in the name only and in both the name and handle had higher perceived expertise than profiles with credentials in the handle only, both ps < .001, with the name only and both name and handle conditions not differing significantly, p > .999. In Experiment 2a, profiles with credentials in both the profile names and description had higher perceived expertise than profiles with credentials in the description only, which in turn had higher perceived expertise than profiles with credentials in the profile names only, both ps < .001.
Although the effect of credentials on perceived expertise was moderated by where biomedical credentials appeared, both Fs > 82.67, ps < .001, credential presence had a significant no matter where the credentials appeared in the profiles in both experiments, p < .001 for the simple effects of credential presence in each location. 4


Experiments 1b and 2b
Experiments 1a and 2a provide compelling evidence that the presence of biomedical credentials on social media platforms increases perceptions of expertise on the topic of COVID-19. However, because we did not recruit specifically to obtain a more balanced sample of these groups, our participant samples skewed liberal and vaccinated. Given our motivation to understand whether these credentials increase perceived expertise even in audiences more likely to be opposed to vaccination, we decided to investigate if our findings replicated in a larger sample of conservative and unvaccinated individuals. Thus, we conducted Experiments 1b and 2b as replications of Experiments 1a and 1b in a fully conservative sample, with half of the participants being unvaccinated and half receiving at least one vaccination. Experiment 1b was preregistered at https://osf.io/h7ms9 and Experiment 2b was preregistered at https://osf.io/mzs95. We collected data for these experiments in August 2024.


Methods


Design
Our main design was a 2 (biomedical credentials: present or absent) by 2 (vaccination status: vaccinated or unvaccinated) mixed model design, with expertise cue presence manipulated within subjects and vaccination status varying between subjects.


Participants
We recruited Prolific participants using the same criteria as in Experiments 1a and 2a, but this time added Prolific's "Political Spectrum US" pre-screener to restrict our sample to users who indicated they were conservative in response to the question: "Where would you place yourself along the political spectrum?". In addition, we used Prolific's "COVID-19 Vaccination" pre-screener which asked "Have you received a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination?" to recruit participants so that half were unvaccinated (answered "No") and half were vaccinated (answered "Yes [at least one dose]").
In our original two studies, the smallest effect size of expertise cue presence we observed among conservative participants who were either vaccinated or unvaccinated was d = 0.67. A power analysis using G*Power 
(Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007)
, an effect size of d = 0.67, α = .05, power (1-β) = .95, and two-tailed indicates that we would need 31 participants to detect a difference in outcomes between an expert cue present and absent condition. To ensure we were well-powered to observe the effects of expertise cues within both our vaccinated and unvaccinated groups of participants (and to be consistent with the sample sizes of our initial studies), we recruited 100 vaccinated and 100 unvaccinated participants per study, giving us 200 participants total.
We ended up with 201 participants completing Experiment 1b (100 unvaccinated, 101 vaccinated; M age = 41.07, SD age = 14.38; 61.7% male, 37.8% female, 0.5% prefer not to say) and 200 participants 5 completing Experiment 2b (100 unvaccinated, 100 vaccinated; M age = 40.31, SD age = 12.98; 60.5% male, 39.5% female).


Measures
Our included measures were identical to Experiments 1a and 2a. Although we were now recruiting our sample to be conservative and half vaccinated/ half unvaccinated, we also retained our own measures of vaccine hesitancy, vaccination status, and political orientation (as Prolific's prescreens measures on vaccination status and political orientation differed from our own) so we could explore our results using the same categorization as in Experiments 1a and 1b.


Procedure
The procedure was an exact replication of Experiments 1a and 2a.


Results


Analytic Approach
To test our primary hypotheses, we conducted a 2 (expertise cue presence: present or absent) by 2 (vaccination status: vaccinated or unvaccinated) mixed model ANOVA with mean expertise ratings as our dependent variable. For our follow-up analysis, we conducted simple effects analysis using a Bonferroni adjustment and report a p-value and corresponding 95% CI adjusted for these multiple comparisons that can be compared to the standard alpha level of .05.
Expertise cue presence was again manipulated within-subjects and vaccination status was a between-subjects variable.


Biomedical Credential Presence
Replicating the original study, there was a significant effect of expert cue presence in  These findings indicate that the presence of biomedical credentials significantly increased perceived expertise to a similar extent in both our vaccinated and unvaccinated groups of conservative participants. Biomedical Credentials Location. In each experiment, again we found a significant difference among the three biomedical credentials location conditions, both ps < .001, with the pattern of these results replicating those observed in the original experiments. In Experiment 1b, profiles with credentials in the name only and in both the name and handle had higher perceived expertise than profiles with credentials in the handle only, both ps < .001, with the name only and both name and handle conditions not differing significantly, p = .375. In Experiment 2b, profiles 7 Detailed reporting of our exploratory analyses can again be found in our supplemental materials. We also performed a parallel analysis using the same measure and method of categorizing vaccination status as in Experiments 1a and 2a. This yielded the same pattern of results and can be found in the supplemental materials.
with credentials in both the profile names and description had higher perceived expertise than profiles with credentials in the description only, which in turn had higher perceived expertise than profiles with credentials in the profile names only, both ps < .001.
Although the effect of credentials on perceived expertise was moderated by where biomedical credentials appeared, both Fs > 62.26, ps < .001, credential presence again had a significant effect no matter where the credentials appeared in the profiles in each experiment, p < .001 for the simple effects of credential presence in each location. 8


Discussion
Biomedical credentials in social media profiles (e.g., prefixes and suffixes like Dr. or MD in a user's name or handle, professional information like "scientist" in a user's description) consistently increased a user's perceived expertise on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination in these investigations. The effect of credentials on perceived expertise was observed in conservative, unvaccinated, and more vaccine-hesitant individuals. In addition, these effects occurred for credentials present within a more limited view of a user profile (Experiments 1a and 1b) and when credentials appeared in a more detailed view of a user profile that included a description (Experiments 2a and 2b), as well as when credentials were located in different places within these profile views (see 
Figure 1
 for these locations). These findings suggest that biomedical credentials may be leveraged by both pro-and anti-vaccine communities to increase perceived credibility and message reach 
(Bradshaw et al., 2020;
Harris et al., 2024;
Hughes et al., 2021)
 The Role of Individual Differences 8 As in Experiments 1a and 2a, we also explored whether the influence of biomedical credential location was moderated by the individual difference measures of vaccination attitudes, vaccination status, and political orientation. Again, the same significant pattern of results reported here persisted across variations in these measures. Full reporting can be found in our supplemental materials.
In our general Prolific samples from Experiments 1a and 2a, the effect of biomedical credentials on perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine expertise was moderated by vaccination attitudes (Experiments 1a-2a), vaccination status (Experiment 2a), and political orientation (Experiments 1a-2a), with participants who were less vaccine-hesitant, vaccinated, and more liberal being more influenced by the presence of credentials when judging COVID-19 vaccination expertise. Vaccine-hesitant and unvaccinated individuals also indicated overall lower levels of perceived expertise across all profiles in each of our experiments. These results are consistent with research finding that conservatives and those in anti-vaccination communities trust experts (like scientists) less as a source of information about vaccination 
(Evans & Hargittai, 2020;
Hamilton et al., 2015;
Kata, 2010)
. However, even though these individuals were less influenced by biomedical credentials and sometimes gave lower ratings of expertise overall, there was a strikingly robust influence of biomedical credentials across vaccination attitudes, vaccination status, and political orientation, with the impact of expertise presence generally being much larger than moderation by observer characteristics.
These findings counter the idea that those with anti-vaccination attitudes do not believe that biomedical credentials confer expertise on the topic of COVID-19 vaccines. Rather, it points to a more nuanced story in which the role of credentials is moderated by other contextual variables. For example, biomedical credentials may play a role in the spread of misinformation surrounding vaccinations in anti-vaccination networks when they are leveraged by users who share anti-vaccination sentiment 
(Bradshaw et al., 2020;
Harris et al., 2024;
Hughes et al., 2021)
.
These results are also important given the specific considerations of these online social media environments. In these settings, users can choose what cues appear in their profiles and may either fabricate cues or, intentionally or unintentionally, present cues that appear to bear on biomedical expertise (e.g., "Dr." or "Professor" in their profile name and handle) but actually pertain to an unrelated credential (e.g., a history degree). In these cases, the presence of unrelated credentials could confer the user with unwarranted perceived expertise around vaccination, especially in cases where only a user's name and handle are seen, such as when a user is scrolling through a Twitter feed, or when a user does not provide additional details in their description regarding these credentials. This suggests the importance of education around assessing scientific information, including source credibility 
(Osborne & Pimentel, 2022)
. In addition, social media platforms may consider designing profiles in a manner that provides sufficient context for users to assess the relevance of different credentials or implementing a verification process for these credentials.


Limitations and Future Directions
One limitation is that our measure for vaccination status did not capture reasons for why individuals had their particular vaccination status (e.g., an individual may not be vaccinated because of a general distrust of vaccines or because their health status prevented them from receiving one). It's also possible that there are effects only seen at the highest levels of these individual differences that we cannot observe through our current methods. In addition, perceptions of user profiles and the messages they share are likely to depend on other source characteristics, such as trustworthiness and competence (e.g., 
Pornpitakpan, 2004)
, partisan identity (e.g., 
Cohen, 2003)
, or demographic characteristics such as age, ethnicity, or gender.
Reactions may also be dependent on message characteristics such as evidence format/quality, stance, and familiarity 
(Hample & Hample, 2014;
Hyman & Jalbert, 2017;
Jiménez et al., 2018;
Lachapelle et al., 2014;
Schwarz & Jalbert 2020)
, and other contextual variables such as comments or reactions from other users (e.g., 
Epstein et al., 2022;
Jalbert et al., 2023)
. We created our profiles to contain the types of source characteristics present in real profiles, but we did not select these profiles to be strictly representative nor did we systematically vary these characteristics. We also removed strong cues of partisanship from our profiles in this study. We also did not include messaging with our profiles. These methodological choices limit the generalizability of our findings. Thus, future work may test how the effects of biomedical expertise cues are moderated by other characteristics of the source, message, and context.


Conclusion
While additional investigations are needed to better understand the conditions leading someone to be perceived as an expert on COVID-19 vaccination on social media, this work provides strong support for the important role of biomedical credentials, with the influence of these credentials being robust across individual differences in vaccination attitudes and political orientation.
following: I have received the full primary vaccination (2 doses of Moderna/Pfizer or 1 dose of J&J) and at least one booster or additional dose; I have received the full primary vaccination (2 doses of Moderna/Pfizer or 2 doses of J&J); I have received one dose of Pfizer or Moderna; I have not received any COVID-19 vaccinations; Other (please specify).


Experiment 1b and 2b, with users with profiles containing biomedical credentials judged to have significantly more expertise on the subject of COVID-19 vaccination, Experiment 1b: M = 3.73, SD = 1.16; Experiment 2b: M = 3.55, SD = 0.97, compared to users without these credentials, Experiment 1b: M = 2.17, SD = 1.08, mean difference = 1.56, 95% CI [1.41, 1.71], F (1, 199) = 423.89, p < .001, partial eta 2 = .681; Experiment 2b: M = 1.84, SD = 0.87, mean difference = 1.71, 95% CI [1.58, 1.84], F (1, 198) = 688.02, p < .001, partial eta 2 = .777. There was also a main effect of vaccination status on perceived expertise, with participants who had received at least one vaccination judging the users in the profiles to have more expertise overall, Experiment 1b: M = 3.26, SD = 1.00; Experiment 2b: M = 2.95, SD = 0.77, compared to participants who had not received any vaccines, Experiment 1b: M = 2.64, SD = 0.87, mean difference = 0.61, 95% CI [0.35, 0.87], F (1, 199) = 21.37, p < .001, partial eta 2 = .097; Experiment 2b: M = 2.43, SD = 0.74, mean difference = 0.52, 95% CI [0.31, 0.73], F (1, 198) = 23.17, p < .001, partial eta 2 = .105. However, the effects of biomedical credentials were not moderated by vaccination status in either Experiment 1b, F (1, 199) = 0.42, p = .519, partial eta 2 = .002 or Experiment 2b, F (1, 198) = 0.09, p = .762, partial eta 2 < .001. The effects of credential presence was significant in follow-up analyses in just the unvaccinated participants, Experiment 1b mean difference = 1.61,


Looking at our individual difference measures, participants were now (expectedly) on the conservative side of our scale, Experiment 1b: M = 5.80, SD = 1.09; Experiment 2b: M = 5.98, SD = 0.92 (1 = extremely liberal; 7 = extremely conservative), and had more vaccine-hesitant scores on our VHS scale, Experiment 1b: M = 22.76, SD = 10.51; Experiment 2b: M = 24.81, SD = 11.13. Unlike in Experiments 1a and 2a, this time the effect of biomedical presence was not moderated by political orientations, both Fs < 2.40, both ps > .238, or vaccination attitudes, both Fs < 0.64, ps > .427, indicating the effects of these credentials were similar across the variation in political orientations and vaccination attitudes captured in this sample.

M = 2.00, SD = 0.83, mean difference = 1.85, 95% CI [1.69, 2.01], t (199) = 22.87, p < .001, d z = 1.61, 95% CI [1.40, 1.82]. Results were identical in Experiment 2a, with biomedical credential present M = 3.53, SD = 0.95, and biomedical credential absent M = 1.67, SD = 0.87, mean difference = 1.86, 95% CI [1.75, 1.98], t (200) = 32.13, p < .001, d z = 2.26, 95% CI [2.00, 2.52]).


95% CI [1.40, 1.82], p < .001; Experiment 2b mean difference = 1.73, 95% CI [1.55, 1.91], p < .001, and in just the vaccinated participants, Experiment 1b mean difference = 1.51, 95% CI [1.30, 1.72], p < .001; Experiment 2b mean difference = 1.69, 95% CI [1.51, 1.87], p < .001. 6


Full counterbalancing information and stimuli sets can be found in the supplemental materials.


A more detailed reporting of these supplemental analyses include scoring information, descriptives, full statistics, and figures visualizing these results can be found in the supplemental analysis.


We also explored whether the influence of biomedical credential location was moderated by individual differences. Overall, the same significant pattern of results reported here persisted across variations in vaccination attitudes, vaccination status, and political orientation, although the size of some of these differences was moderated by some of these variables. We report the full results of these analyses in the supplemental materials.


Due to an error on Prolific, one participant was able to complete both the vaccinated and unvaccinated versions of the survey by changing their COVID-19 vaccination prescreen results from "Yes" to "No" between surveys. Due to uncertainty about how to categorize them, we removed them from our analyses and opened up additional slots to replace them.
