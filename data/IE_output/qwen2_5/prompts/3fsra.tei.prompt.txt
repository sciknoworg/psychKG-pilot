You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Recent research has called for the scientific community to "grapple with the challenge of better understanding catastrophic climate change" or a 'Climate Endgame' 
Kemp et al. (2022)
. This call has led to a chorus of voices debating the potential impact of such an approach (see commentaries on 
Kemp et al. (2022)
, e.g. 
Bhowmik, McCaffrey, and Rooney Varga (2022)
; 
Burgess, Pielke, and Ritchie (2022)
). This debate brings the issue of how to communicate the impact of different climate futures into sharp relief. A commonly used format, and the one discussed in detail in 
Kemp et al.,
 is to define 'current', 'best' and 'worst' case scenarios based on assumptions about Greenhouse Gas emission pathways [e.g., Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) (2023)]. These scenarios are often accompanied by numerical ranges with estimates of upper and lower bounds 
McVeigh (2023)
. For example: 'in the worst-case scenario scientists expect an increase in average global temperature of 5.6 degrees but this might be as high as 7.2 or as low as 4' 
(Figure 1
).
The inherent uncertainty in such statements raises two immediate challenges for interpretation. First, there is deep, irreducible uncertainty about the relative likelihood of the current, best, worst, (or any number of other potential scenarios) eventuating 
Kemp et al. (2022)
. Second, there is uncertainty about how to interpret the relative likelihood of different values in the numerical ranges associated with different scenarios 
Dieckmann, Gregory, Peters, and Hartman (2017);
Van Der Bles et al. (2019)
. These sources of un-

Alice Mason received funding from the ESRC (ES/T016639/1) and Ben Newell received funding from the Australian Research Council (DP190101076). certainty both independently and in combination may have significant impacts on the judgments and decisions stakeholders make on the basis of the projections 
Budescu, Por, Broomell, and Smithson (2014)
; 
Howe, MacInnis, Krosnick, Markowitz, and Socolow (2019)
; 
Patt and Weber (2014)
.
A decision-maker who believes that the best case is most likely may fail to pay sufficient attention to the implications of the worst-case scenario, and thus underweight potential catastrophic impacts 
Kemp et al. (2022)
. Similarly, a belief that all values in a given range are equally likely (a uniform distribution), may yield a different perception of risks than a belief that values are approximately normally distributed, or skewed toward higher or lower values 
Dieckmann et al. (2017)
. Moreover, research on multi-stage probability judgment suggests that decision-makers may have difficulty separating beliefs about the most likely trajectory the climate will take (current, best or worst) from judgments about numerical ranges 
Hayes and Newell (2009)
.
Here, we take a step toward understanding how laypeople's beliefs about the likelihood of future scenarios affects their interpretation of identical numerical ranges provided in climate projections. In four online experiments (N = 702) we replicate a pattern which implies the presence of 'optimism' and 'pessimism' biases: people who believe the best-case scenario is most likely to happen, show a stronger tendency to endorse lower temperature values across all three scenarios. This pattern is reversed for the 'pessimists' who believe the worst-case scenario is most likely and more strongly endorse higher values in all three cases.


Methods
Participants. For all experiments, we used Prolific Academic to recruit participants online. We did not allow repeat participation across experiments. We recruited participants from the UK who were (self-reported) fluent English speakers, and had a Prolific Academic approval rating of over 
Figure 1
. The figure shows the general structure of questions used across the experiments. In all experiments participants were presented with three different scenarios. They were then presented with five options that described the potential distribution of values and asked to select one option.
90%. We only recruited participants who believe in climate change. They were required to have answered "Yes" to the pre-screener question "Do you believe in climate change?".
For the climate scenario experiments the demographics were: n = 702, 423 Female, 273 Male, 6 unreported, age range = 19-84, M = 42.4, SD = 13.1. For the planet-based scenarios the demographics were: n = 199, 123 female, 76 male, age range = 20-75, M = 41.0, SD = 11.4.
Participants were paid a show-up fee. In Experiment 1 participants were paid £1.50. We realised that the average completion time was lower than we had anticipated and so for the remaining experiments participants were paid £0.75.
The University of Warwick Ethics committee approved all experimental work.
Procedure. In all experiments participants were presented with all three scenarios. In the best case scenario the temperatures used were 1.5°C -2.4°C with a mean of 1.9°C ; for the current scenario they were 2°C -3.6°C with a mean of 2.8°C and for the worst-case scenario they were 4°C to 7.2°C with a mean of 5.6°C . In Experiments 1 to 4 the scenarios described predicted global mean temperature rises. In Experiment 5 the scenarios referred to temperatures on fictional planets. After reading about the scenario, participants were asked the 'Distribution Question'. This allowed us to classify their response as either normal, uniform, U-shaped, left skewed or right skewed.
At the end of the climate experiments participants were also asked the "Scenario Prediction Question". They were asked to select which of the three scenarios (current trajectory, best-case or worst-case) they thought was most likely to happen.
The procedural variations across experiments and the exact wording for each experiment are reported in the Supple-mentary Information. 
Figure 2
. Panel A. Each row shows a different group of participants (maintainers, optimists, pessimists), according to which scenario they thought was most likely to happen (current, best, worst, respectively). There were different numbers of participants in each of the groups (Maintainer n = 428, Optimist n = 144, Pessimist n = 130). Each column shows participants' perception of the distribution underlying the three different scenarios (Current, Best, Worst). The labels on the X-axis correspond with the descriptions (a-e) presented in Panel A: a) Uniform; b) Normal; c) U-shaped; d) Upper; and e) Lower. Panel B. In an additional experiment the climate change context was removed and people were given the best estimate and range for temperature rises on fictitious planets. The graphs show the proportion of participants who responded with each distribution type when the same numeric values were used but the climate context was removed.


Results
The results provide a clear demonstration that the same numerical intervals are interpreted very differently by people who exhibit contrasting expectations about the way in which our climate will evolve.
This central result is displayed in panel A of Figure 2 which collapses across the data from four experiments (variations between each experiment were mostly procedural and did not impact the overall patterns). Participants were presented with projected global mean temperature increases un-der three different scenarios described as 'best', 'worst', and 'current' 
(Figure 1)
. In addition to choosing a distribution for each scenario, participants indicated which scenario they believed was most likely to occur. The majority of our participants, (61%) endorsed the 'current trajectory' as most likely (labelled as the 'maintainers', top row, 
Figure 2A)
. These participants show a pattern favouring 'normal' or 'uniform' distributions under a current-scenario, but switch to increased endorsement of a skew toward the higher end of the range for the best-case scenario and the lower end of the range for the worst-case scenario. This pattern might reflect a form of regression toward an overall perceived most likely temperature increase. This speculation is supported by an additional experiment which found a median value of 3°C when participants were asked to report the most likely temperature increase by 2100 (see section below for details).
We described participants who chose the best case as most likely as the 'optimists' (20% of participants, second row 
Figure 2A
). These include people who endorse uniform and normal, but have a stronger tendency than the 'maintainers' to select a skew toward lower values in each scenario. Finally, those we termed the 'pessimists' (19%, third row of 
Figure 2A
), chose the worst case as most likely and tend to favour distributions skewed toward higher values in every scenario. These visual impressions are supported by a multinomial logistic regression showing a significant effect of both the scenario (χ 2 (8) = 208.1, p <.001) and participants' predicted scenario on their distributional perceptions (χ 2 (24) = 255.6, p <.001). The dependent variable was distribution type and the "Normal" distribution was used as the reference group. For scenario and for predicted scenario, the "Current" scenario was used as the reference group. The standardised coefficients for the model containing both scenario and predicted scenario are reported in full in 
Table 1
.
Further support for our interpretation that prior beliefs about the likelihood of different climate trajectories affect the interpretation of projected temperature ranges comes from a final experiment in which, rather than providing participants with projections based on current, best-or worst-case scenarios, we told them that the projections were for three fictional planets (Alpha, Beta & Gamma). Removing prior expectations about climate change -by placing the projections in a fictional context -led the majority of participants to endorse a normal distribution for all three ranges ( 
Figure 2B
; no effect of context: χ 2 (4) = 8.43, p = .39). This response pattern presumably reflects a more ingrained prior that in the absence of any other information, distributions are likely to be normal 
Dieckmann et al. (2017)
.


Effects of Age and Gender on Predicted Scenario
We collected Age and Gender data from participants in each of the Experiments. The data for Experiment 1 was anonymized immediately and cannot be linked to individual participants' responses. In Experiments 2 to 4, we examined whether there were any differences in Age and Gender among people who believed each of the scenarios (Current, Best, Worst) was most likely to happen. Two people were excluded from this analysis: one did not provide their age, and another didn't provide their gender.
We then examined whether the average age and sex composition were different among these three groups: Maintainers, Optimists, and Pessimists. On average, Pessimists (M = 39.1, SD = 1.15) were significantly younger than both Optimists (M = 45.1, SD = 1.29) -see 
Figure 3
. A oneway ANOVA found that the average age was significantly different across groups (F(2, 594) = 6.13, p = .002). Pairwise corrected comparisons found a significant difference in age between the Maintainers and the Pessimists (t(594) = 2.47, p = .035) and between the Optimists and the Pessimists (t(594) = 3.49, p = .002) but not between the Maintainers and the Optimists (t(594) = −1.82, p = .163).
A chi-square test found no significant difference in the number of males and females in each of the groups (χ 2 (2) = 5.30, p = .071). The group composition was as follow: Maintainers -Female = 233, Male =133); Optimists -Female = 64, Male =54; Pessimists -Female = 71, Male =39.


Predicted Temperature Rise Experiment
To better understand people's prior beliefs about global mean surface temperature increases we asked an additional sample of 196 people (126 female, 74 male, age range =20-77, M = 39.2, SD =12.7) to answer the following question: "Scientists expect global temperatures to increase by some number of degrees by 2100. Tell us what you think the increase will be. Please give your answer in degrees C to one decimal place". The distribution of the responses in plotted in 
Figure 4
; the mean value reported was 6.16 degrees

 Standardised coefficients, p-values and odds ratios for the multinomial logistic regressions run across all Experiments. The Normal distribution was the reference group for Distribution type and the Current scenario was the reference group for the Scenarios.

Discussion
Our sample was pre-screened to include only participants who 'believe' in climate change (see Methods) thus a key contribution is to show that even among 'believers', optimism/pessimism about our collective ability to achieve emissions-cuts has a significant impact on the interpretation of projections. These results complement and extend previous findings showing that scepticism about climate change influences distribution-perception, and other statements of uncertainty 
Budescu et al. (2014)
; 
Dieckmann et al. (2017)
. They are also broadly consistent with more general frameworks highlighting the role of motivated cognition, and/or accuracy-reasoning on the interpretation of climate changerelated information 
Bayes and Druckman (2021)
; 
Kahan et al. (2012)
. It is worth noting that our goal with this work is not to argue for a correct interpretation. It is impossible to decide which trajectory is, in fact, most likely and in many cases, given the potential for sampling bias in the models included, there may not be a technically correct answer for the nature of the distribution underlying the projected temperature ranges (although in the limit, a normal distribution might be expected Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) (2023).
Future work could focus on how these differences in perception might translate into the judgments, decisions and behaviours that people, and organisations are willing to make. Understanding the perception of the risks communicated by climate projections is becoming increasingly important across a variety of sectors. Not least, in the financial domain where developments in the legislation pertaining to climaterisk disclosures is requiring businesses to report climate resilience against different future possible states of the climate (e.g the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures). For example, the Australian Treasury is currently proposing to allow businesses to select at least two possible scenarios of future global temperature increases. Allowing this freedom to choose scenarios places the onus on the business to understand the uncertainties inherent in the likelihood of the scenarios and the likelihood of values in the ranges.
Differences in risk perception may also help to shed light on the emergence of varying policy preferences based on the same climate information 
Constantino and Weber (2021)
. Simply increasing the discourse around the potential scenarios may help people to understand the uncertainty in climate scenarios and could shift both their priors and their behaviours 
Howe et al. (2019)
; 
Kemp et al. (2022)
. The fact that the Pessimists in our sample tended to be younger on av-erage than Optimists and Maintainers provides a salutary indication of how the reality of potential climate futures might be perceived differently as a function of age. Indeed, worstcase scenarios are typically underrepresented in climate communication, perhaps for fear of increasing the psychological burden of climate change particularly among younger generations Palinkas and Wong (2020). However, recent work has suggested that increased climate anxiety could be a motivating force for behaviour change 
Whitmarsh et al. (2022)
 and worst-case scenarios can facilitate people taking action 
Joslyn, Savelli, and Nadav-Greenberg (2011)
. These results accord with the Climate Endgame proposal reinforcing the idea that a more inclusive discussion about all potential climate futures could lead to more robust and prudent climaterisk management 
Kemp et al. (2022)
