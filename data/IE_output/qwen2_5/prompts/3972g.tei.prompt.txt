Introduction
While making decisions, we often try to predict the consequences of our choices so that we can pick the best option.
Very often, the outcomes of our choices do not match with our predictions, generating signals called reward prediction errors (RPEs). Reinforcement learning (RL) models capture this framework of trial-by-error learning, which is critical for understanding decision making in animals and humans and for building artificial agents 
1,
2
 . However, it is not well understood whether, or how, RPEs that are central to RL models may have a more lasting effect on cognition by influencing the encoding and retrieval of memories related to prior decisions.
Neurally, RPEs have been associated with phasic dopamine release in the brain 
3
 , which are then used to guide how we evaluate and optimize subsequent choices. Understanding how RPEs impact memory is important because RL algorithms provide biologically plausible models of dopamine-driven learning 
1,
4
 facilitated by mesocortical and cortico-striatal circuits for habits, action-selection, and decision making. As a result, one prominent theory of RPE-mediated memory is that midbrain dopaminergic release strengthens memory encoding and consolidation 
5
 .
Indeed, recent behavioral evidence suggests that rewards 
[6]
[7]
[8]
 and RPEs 
[9]
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
 imbue stimuli with subjective salience that modulates memory 
14
 . However, the specific direction, timing, and magnitude of this effect varies across studies 
14
 suggesting the involvement of alternative, unaccounted-for sources of prioritized memory. Most prominent among these is the contribution that perceptual information makes to mnemonic salience, independent from the reward outcomes associated with the stimuli 
15,
16
 . Perceptual memorability is not explained by low-level visual salience, cognitive control, or priming 
15
 , and represents a parallel path to enhanced memory that has distinct neural circuits and behavioral implications. Therefore, in order to understand how decision-making processes shape our memories for those decisions, it is critical to understand the interplay between stimulus-specific perceptual memorability and reward prediction during memory processes 
[17]
[18]
[19]
 .
Untangling the distinct contributions of perceptual and reward information to memory is also important to understanding how disruptions to affective states-such as depressive and anxious mood-affect the relationship between RPEs and memory. This is important because RPEs and mood state bidirectionally affect each other 
20
 , and aberrant reward circuitry and altered RL are features of a range of mood and anxiety disorders 
21,
22
 . These disorders can also result in impaired or biased memory processes 
23,
24
 . While one prior study suggests that depression scores alter the relationship between RPE and memory 
25
 , it is not clear whether this effect is specific to RPE-driven memorability, or what specific depressive symptoms might underlie this effect. These studies, in sum, raise the possibility that individuals with altered mood states might not benefit from associating RPEs with stimuli for memory.
Therefore, understanding the computational mechanisms that link RPEs to memory could aid in assessing the biasing effect mood disorders have on memory, and developing therapeutic approaches to these symptoms and disorders.
Here, we investigated how individuals rely on both RPEs and perceptual memorability associated with the stimuli in order to recognize those stimuli, and how the interplay between RPE and perceptual memorability affects overall memory processes. Furthermore, we explored whether the relationship between RPEs and subsequent memory is impacted by mental health symptoms across depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder in a community sample of human participants. We constructed a dual-task paradigm probing how decisions in one task affect memory in a subsequent recognition task, and investigated how RL parameters from the decision task corresponded with memory performance. Participants better remembered stimuli associated with more positive RPEs and those with higher perceptual memorability ratings, in line with prior findings 
9,
12,
26
 . Furthermore, positive affect regulated the impact of RPEs, but not perceptual memorability, on memory. Overall, our results reveal how extrinsic value computations interact with intrinsic perceptual signals to modulate memory and how the link between RPEs and recognition memory is altered by affective symptoms.


Results
In order to investigate how the RPEs that become associated with a stimuli influence our memories for that stimuli, we designed an experiment consisting of two consecutive tasks: a decision-making task followed by a memory task, similar to prior studies 
[9]
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
 . For the decision-making task, participants performed a two-arm bandit task ( : Task schematic and participant performance. A) Schematic of two representative trials of the two-arm bandit task. Participants were cued to select a card from one of two decks (orange or purple) on each trial, then provided with feedback and a trial-unique face image, followed by a fixation cross. B) Probability of drawing from the male (orange) or female (purple) decks as a function of trial and reward block (mean reversal trial indicated by vertical lines). Shaded lines denote 95% confidence interval. C) Schematic of representative trial of the recognition memory task. Participants were presented with images of faces, and instructed to decide whether the images were old or novel lures. Participants then had to indicate their confidence in their selection, followed by a fixation cross. D) Probability of a successful recognition (hit) as a function of trial (mean reversal trial indicated by vertical lines). Shaded lines denote 95% confidence interval.
which they drew cards from two separate decks with oppositely yoked reward probabilities that reversed four times throughout the task without warning (80% chance of reward for one deck, 20% chance of reward for the other) 
27
 .
After every decision, participants were shown reward feedback for their choice, along with a unique image stimuli.
These image stimuli were then utilized in the subsequent memory task, where participants were asked to indicate if a cue image had been seen before, or was a novel lure. We selected the image stimuli from a database of face images with normed perceptual memorability ratings (PM) 
26
 (see Methods). Memorability is an intrinsic, perceptual property of images that is predictive of how easily remembered an image is 
28
 , and thought to potentially reflect how perceptual information is prioritized for memory 
29
 . As such, the memorability ratings of these images provided a metric for measuring how successful memory might also fluctuate as a function of the perceptual information associated with each image, independent of the extrinsic RPE that participants encoded along with each image.
We recruited 246 online participants (126 female) from Prolific (http://prolific.com), an online survey platform, to perform this experiment. After excluding participants with below chance-level accuracy for the decision task, we demonstrated that the remaining participants (n=206) learned to choose the more rewarding option during the decision-making task, even after reward probabilities reversed 
(Fig. 1B)
. These participants subsequently completed the recognition memory task 
(Fig. 1C)
, in which they have to assess whether stimuli in a set had been presented before, or are novel. Accuracy and reaction times (RTs) in the two tasks were correlated (ρ = 0.16, 0.49, ps < 0.03; 
Fig. S1A, B
), though RTs for the decision-making task were significantly faster than during the memory task (t(410) = −24.5 p < 0.001). In addition to successful recognition choices, called hits ( 
Fig. 1D
), memory responses were additionally categorized as correct rejections, misses, or false alarms ( 
Fig. S1C
). Memory performance computed from a combination of these response categories (d') indicated that participants performed above chance in the memory task ( 
Fig. S1D
).
Having demonstrated that participants exhibited sufficient learning in the first task and memory in the second 
(Fig.   S1D
), we constructed computational models of participants' choices during the decision-making task to investigate RPEs were weighed heavily in estimating the value of each option, and an inverse temperature of 4.9 ± 2.9 ( 
Fig. 2A
).
Neither learning rate nor inverse temperature correlated with reward accrued in the decision-making task 
(Fig. 2B
).
Next, we investigated how the RPE and PM ratings associated with each stimulus jointly affected the memory of the stimulus on a trial-by-trial basis. Previous studies which have focused on the trial-level enhancement of memory for stimuli focused on either the contribution of intrinsic perceptual information 
26
 or extrinsic reward information 
[9]
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
33
 . In contrast, our task design and stimuli choice enabled us to associate each stimulus with both p(correct memory)~9 a model-estimated RPE as well as a rating based on each stimulus' normed intrinsic memorability in the absence of rewards 
26
 
(Fig. 2C
). We selected only stimuli considered highly memorable on average (those with high PM ratings, see Methods) to ensure that participants could achieve high recognition success even if ignoring RPEs entirely. Because PM ratings and model-estimated RPEs were orthogonal ( 
Fig. 2D
), we could disentangle the relative contribution of both streams of information. In line with prior findings, we first restricted our analysis to hits during the recognition memory task and found that trial-wise RPEs estimated by the model exhibited a significant correlation with the probability of successful hits (logistic-regression coefficient = 0.18, p < 0.001, 
Fig. 2E
), with positive RPEs during the decision-making task predicting a higher probability of subsequent successful recognition. Similarly, the perceptual memorability ratings associated with each stimulus also correlated with the probability of successful hits in our participant cohort (logistic-regression coefficient = 0.16, p < 0.001, 
Fig. 2E
), confirming that these ratings generalized to our cohort.
We next examined the overall contribution of RPE and PM to memory beyond the probability of hits alone, accounting for subject-level demographics and RL parameters. We utilized a Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression model to measure the importance of extrinsic RPE information and intrinsic perceptual information to correct vs.  
3
), such that surprisingly rewarding stimuli and more perceptually memorably stimuli were remembered better than other stimuli. Furthermore, stimuli that appeared sooner after the reward-probability reversal were remembered better than those that appeared later after the reversal (fixed effects posterior mean = -0.12, 95% HDI = [-0.19, -0.01]),
suggesting that proximity to state changes also induced increased memorability. Participant demographics and RL parameters (learning rate and inverse temperature) did not meaningfully predict memory performance in this full model, nor did total reward earned during the decision-making task.
Next, we were interested in determining whether individual affective phenotype modulated the link between  reward prediction, perceptual information, and memory to ascertain the features that might contribute to altered memory processes in mood disorders. We thus next examined whether individual differences in self-reported affective symptoms might modulate subject-level reliance on perceptual and reward information during for memory.
Specifically, we collected the following psychometric surveys from a subset of task participants (n=173): the statetrait anxiety index (STAI-T), the Zung depression scale (SDS), and the obsessive-compulsive inventory (OCI-R) ( 
Fig. 4A
). Similar to prior studies 
34,
35
 , we utilized a factor analysis to identify latent, transdiagnostic constructs and to derive synthesized affective symptom scores given the considerable overlap between depression and anxiety symptoms and effects on cognition (see Methods). Factor analysis identified three, non-overlapping prominent factors ( 
Fig. S3A
): positive affect (factor 1; e.g. "I am content"), intrusive thoughts and rumination (factor 2; e.g. "I lack self-confidence"), and obsessive-compulsive behaviors (factor 3; e.g. "I feel I have to repeat certain numbers") ( 
Fig.   4B
, 
Table 2
). We added the subject-level factor scores to the Bayesian mixed-effects model to quantify the impact of factor scores on memory (see Top: relationship between β RPE (subject-level random effect from the mixed-effects model) and memory performance, organized by a tercile split of positive affect (measured by factor 1 score). Asterisk indicates significant interaction between factor score and β RPE in predicting memory performance (linear-regression coefficient = 1.8, p = 0.02).

(linear-regression coefficient = 1.8, p = 0.02), indicating that individuals with more positive affect exhibited better memory when prioritizing RPEs. This effect was selective for RPEs, as positive affect did not affect the relationship between participants' reliance on perceptual memorability and overall memory performance ( 
Fig. 5B
). Because positive affect did not exhibit a significant relationship with task performance, RL parameters, or reaction times ( 
Fig.   S3B
), it suggests that affect plays a specific role in regulating the linkage between RPE and memory performance. Critically, this relationship was specific to affective symptoms, and was not observed for the other two factors 
(Fig.   S4A
,B).


Discussion
Identifying the specific relevance of RPEs to memory is crucial for understanding why we remember rewarding events better than others and how this process can go awry in psychiatric states featuring altered mood. To that end, we designed and tested an experimental paradigm in which participants performed a decision-making task followed by a memory task. Using a reinforcement learning model, we found that participants remembered a stimulus better if it was associated with a model-estimated RPE, or if it was a more perceptually memorable stimulus. By disentangling the relationship between RPE-driven memory and perceptually-driven memory we were able to observe differences in their behavioral consequences. Specifically, we showed that transdiagnostic measures of positive affect regulated the relationship between RPE-driven memory and enhanced memory performance, which was not true for perceptuallydriven memory. Furthermore, this regulation was specific to affective phenotype, and was not present using alternative mental health factors such as intrusive thoughts and rumination or obsessive-compulsive traits. Together, these findings illuminate the computational mechanisms mediating the relationship between decision-making, memory, and affect.
While several prior studies have investigated whether model-estimated RPEs influence subsequent memo-ries 
[9]
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
36
 , these studies provide conflicting evidence for whether positive, negative, or unsigned RPEs enhance memory, whether this effect is most pronounced only after a delay period, or even whether these effects are agedependent. One possible reason for these conflicting accounts is the that prior studies do not account for how inherently memorable stimuli are on the basis of reward-agnostic perceptual features. The current task design specifically utilized stimuli with known perceptual memorability ratings 
28
 that index how intrinsically memorable a stimulus is in the absence of rewards. These memorability ratings are nor explained by low-level visual properties, aesthetic attractiveness, or interest level 
19,
26,
28,
37
 . Furthermore, perceptual memorability ratings are not explained by purely attentional processes 
15,
28
 , and correlate with memorability scores determined by neural networks 
29
 , suggesting that perceptual memorability captures intrinsic stimulus properties at the junction between high-level visual processing and memory. This information, in combination with computationally estimated RPEs, enabled us to dissociate between RPE-driven and perceptually-driven memory processes in the subsequent recognition memory task using these same stimuli. Because perception and subjective valuation involve distinct neural circuits and cognitive processes, understanding their contributions to memory has distinct implications for the downstream effects that psychiatric disorders impairing perception or learning might have on memory. By showing that transdiagnostic affective state modulates the link between reward information and memory, but not perceptual information, our findings provide evidence that RPEs may bring a degree of salience to a stimulus that strengthens memory encoding.
Identifying the specific influence that RPEs have on memory is critical to understanding the neural mechanisms that may underlie memory enhancement. In addition to providing computationally parsimonious models of decision making, reinforcement learning algorithms play a critical role in biological psychology because RPEs have been tightly correlated with the activity of dopaminergic neurons 3 in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (VTA).
This suggests that these models capture dopamine-driven learning 
1,
4
 facilitated by mesocortical and cortico-striatal circuits for habits, action-selection, and decision making. One prominent theory of RPE-mediated memory is that midbrain dopaminergic neurons innervate the hippocampus, and that dopamine release strengthens hippocampal plasticity involved in memory encoding and consolidation 
5
 . In support of this theory, neurophysiological evidence from rodents has demonstrated that mesolimbic dopamine modulates memory-related neuronal activity during memory encoding 
38,
39
 . Research has also shown that neuronal activity in the VTA, a critical region in the brain's reward circuitry, correlates with memory-related theta oscillations 
40
 . In parallel, neuroimaging in humans suggests that RPEs correlate with increased memory-related BOLD activity 
9
 . In contrast, perceptual memorability is thought to engage neural activity at the junction of perception and memory in the ventral visual stream 
28
 , independent of reward 
16
 . By demonstrating the positive affect regulates the RPE-memory link, and not the perception-memory link, our findings suggest that RPEs and their associated dopaminergic activity could provide a plausible neural mechanism for enhancing memory in addition to driving RL processes 
41
 . Linking value-based decision making to value-based memory enhancement is essential to understanding the role that dopaminergic circuits might play in memory overall.
Critically, abnormal mnemonic processes are of particular importance to mood disorders that are also linked to abnormal learning and decision-making. For example, depression is known to feature impaired processing of RL-related computations such as RPEs 
22
 , as well as disruption of explicit memory capacity 
23,
42
 . Acute and posttraumatic stress disorders feature pathologically strong associations with traumatic events 
23
 that may rely on midbrain dopaminergic modulation of synaptic plasticity 
43,
44
 . Drug-associated cues may also develop enhanced salience in memory, contributing to substance abuse at the cost of other cues and natural rewards 
45
 . By taking a transdiagnostic approach to identifying a latent construct associated with mood, we demonstrate how affective state might further regulate the relationship between encoded RPEs and memory, consistent with findings from perceptual matching 
46
 and reward anticipation 
47
 studies. As such, disrupted affect could disrupt the interaction between RL and memory, distinct from impairments to RL and memory separately. These findings could have far-reaching implications for not only uncovering deeper neurocomputatonal mechanisms of disorders like depression and anxiety, but also suggesting that treatment and intervention strategies need to consider learning and memory deficits in an integrated fashion .
Here, we have demonstrated the interplay of perceptual information and reward information enhance memory, and how affective symptoms selectively regulate the influence of RPEs on memory. In addition to reinforcing recent work investigating the memory-enhancing effects of RPEs, these findings provide the first evidence for how value computations during learning directly interact with perceptual memorability, and how mood disorders may diminish the the beneficial effect of RPEs on memory while sparing perceptual processes. These results will thus enable future computational work investigating how models of memory may jointly and dynamically incorporate intrinsic perceptual information and extrinsic associations, and future physiological work investigating how dopaminergic circuits in the brain modulate neural activity in regions typically associated with memory.


Methods
Data collection and participants.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Participants were recruited from Prolific (http://prolific.co), an online survey platform. A total of 246 adults (126 female, age=40.1±14.3 years) completed this study. We excluded 40 participants whose overall behavioral performance in the decision-making task was no different from chance. The final sample that completed the behavioral task had 206 adults (109 female, age=40.3±14.2 years). Participants were asked to return to complete psychometric surveys. The sample that completed the psychometric surveys had 173 adults (94 female, age=42.4±14 years). Participants were paid a fixed rate with a bonus computed as a function of reward accumulated in the first task in the experiment. Target sample size was determined based on the results of similar studies investigating the effect of RPE on memory 
11,
12
 .


Task
Participants performed an experiment with two distinct stages: a decision-making task, followed by a recognition memory task. The decision-making task was a two-arm bandit task in which participants attempt to maximize their rewards by learning on one of two possible options (decks of cards) on each trial, for a total of 60 trials. Each option was associated with a specific win probability (either 0.8 or 0.2) which reversed four times, every 12 ± 1 trials. As a result, each option's win probability was always negatively correlated. However, in contrast to traditional bandit/reversal tasks, participants were shown a unique image stimulus after making each choice, associating each reward outcome with a specific image stimulus. These image stimuli were memorable faces drawn from a database on perceptual memorability, where each image was associated with a normed d' score 
48
 that measured how well these images are recognized in a large population sample 
26,
28
 . Upon completing the decision-making task, participants immediately began a recognition memory task in which these 60 image stimuli were shown, in addition to 60 novel lure images drawn from the same memorability database with matched d' scores. During this task, participants were instructed to indicate whether the image was "old" or "new", and then asked to indicate their confidence in their selection.


Computational modeling
We utilized a Rescorla-Wagner model to fit behavior in the decision-making task, in which RPEs modulate a learning rate (α) parameter, and RPE-based decisions are determined by an inverse-temperature parameter (β) modulating a softmax choice function. The learning and decision rules for this model are described by the following equations 
49
 :
(1) Q c t+1 = Q c t + α(r t − Q c t ) (2) p c t = e βQ c t C i=1 e βQ c i
where Q c t is the value of the chosen option on trial t, updated according to r t , the model-estimated RPE on every trial.
To address the possibility that participants might be utilizing decision making strategies that do not require tracking and updating values for each choice, we also fit two alternative models that did not rely on reinforcement learning. The first, a win-stay, lose-shift (WSLS) model models behavior as a simple piecewise function in which participants exploit a choice as long as it is rewarded, and switch as soon they receive unrewarded feedback, with a noise parameter to determine the probabilities of these behaviors. The second alternative we utilized was a Bayesian filter model estimating the probability of each latent state (which deck is more valuable) switching with a probability of reversal (p reversal ), and the probability of reward for the more valuable deck (p reward ) 
50
 . The probability of the prior trial's latent state is first estimated using Baye's rule, followed by a prediction about the current state based on p reversal . The latent state probability is then transformed into the probability of selecting a specific action using the softmax choice function. These models and their parameters are detailed in 
Table 1
.


Bayesian mixed-effects regression
To determine the features predicting successful memory retrieval, we used a Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression modeling framework 
51
 . Within this framework, we coded hits and correct rejections as correct memory choices, and misses and false-alarms as incorrect memory choices. We then constructed models of the form:
p(correct = 1) ∼ X + (1|sub ject) + (rpe|sub ject) + (pm|sub ject)
(1)
where the probability of correct memory choices is modeled using a logit-link function of fixed effects (X) and random effects. The fixed effects includes the following trial-level predictors: RPE, PM, and the within-block trial number (coded such that trials following a reversal restart at 1). The fixed effect also include subject-level traits, including:
age, sex, RL parameters (α, β), total gambling reward, and factor scores. All numerical predictors were standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by two times the standard deviation 
52
 , while sex was coded as a categorical variable. We generated weakly informative (broad) priors for all regression variables 
53
 which are scaled to regularize the model rather than integrate domain knowledge.


Model fitting and assessment
Behavioral models and Bayesian mixed-effects regression models were fit to individual subject data using Bayesian inference over the free parameters, using the Python library pymc 
54
 and bambi 
55
 . To fit models, we used four Markov chain Monte Carlo No-U-Turn (NUTS) samplers, drawing 1500 samples from the posterior for each chain, after a minimum of 1000 burn-in samples. All posteriors for independent variables were checked for convergence using the Gelman-Rubin statistic, which was less than 1.01 in all cases, indicating good convergence. We computed the 95% high-density interval (HDI) for each model parameter to quantify the uncertainty around the true value of the parameter 
56
 . We considered there to be substantial evidence for the influence of a parameter if the 95% HDI did not include zero 
57
 . Model comparison was performed using the Waikake-information criterion 
58
 . To test parameter recoverability, we used each model to simulate behavior for 206 agents. We fit this simulated behavior, and computed the correlation between the original parameters used to simulate behavior and those recovered by the fitting procedure.
To test model identifiability, we used the fit parameters for each model to simulate behavior for 206 agents, fit this behavior using every model, and performed model comparison to determine which model fit the simulated behavior best.


Factor analysis
First, we computed the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy to assess whether it was plausible to conduct a factor analysis, and found that the degree of overlapping information among the survey responses was appropriate for a factor analysis (KMO=0.91). We also computed Bartlett's sphericity test and found that the correlation matrix of the survey responses was not an identity matrix, and thus appropriate for a factor analysis (χ 2 = 7723). We next performed factor analysis using an orthogonal rotation, using maximum likelihood estimation.
From the resulting scree plot we utilized the first three factors which captured the most variance in eigenvalues.
The factor loadings for each survey question are depicted in 
Table 2
. The items with high factor loadings were used to categorize the factors into the following categories: positive affect, intrusive thoughts and rumination, and obsessive compulsive behavior. We computed the factor score for each participant by computing the dot product of the correlation matrix and factor loadings.

Methods). Neither positive affect nor intrusive thoughts directly impacted memory performance (95% HDI includes 0; Fig. 5A), while more obsessive-compulsive participants exhibited somewhat better memory (fixed effects posterior mean = 0.24, 95% HDI = [-0.001, 0.48]; Fig. 5A). No factor exhibited a statistically significant interaction with the fixed effect of RPE on memory, though factor 1 (positive affect) exhibited the strongest modulation of the relationship between RPE and memory (fixed effects posterior mean = 0.07, 95% HDI = [-0.08, 0.21];Fig. 5A). We next examined whether these transdiagnostic factors regulated the individual differences in the relationship between RPEs and memory (see Methods,Fig. 3B). Indeed, positive affect significantly increased the correlation between participants' reliance on RPE for memory (β RPE ) and overall memory performance Mood regulates memory-enhancing effect of RPEs.

Transdiagnostic mood does not affect subject-level RL traits, task performance, or reaction time. A) Factor scores across participants. Diagonal: distribution of scores for factor 1 (positive affect), factor 2 (intrusive thoughts and rumination), and factor 3 (obsessivecompulsive behaviors) across participants. Off-diagonal: pairwise scatterplots depicting relationship between scores across scores. B) Correlations between factor 1 score and task performance (top), RL parameters (middle), and reaction times (bottom). Dots denote individual participant values. Line indicates linear model fit.
