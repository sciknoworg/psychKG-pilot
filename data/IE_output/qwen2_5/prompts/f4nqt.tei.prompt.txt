You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 can only be effectively controlled by vaccination of large parts of the population 
(1)
. There is cumulating evidence that vaccinated people will less likely infect nonvaccinated people given contact with the virus 
(2)
, meaning that vaccinated people can protect others who cannot be vaccinated (community immunity), such as those with health conditions or therapies that suppress the immune system. Overall, there is public interest in ensuring that enough people get vaccinated, i.e. a proportion of between 60 and 80% of a country's population 
(3)
(4)
(5)
.
In Germany, at least 37 to 45% of the adult population intend to get vaccinated for sure, according to population-wide surveys (online 
[COSMO, ARD]
 and CATI [WiD, COVIMO, (6, 7)]).
Survey-based estimates further suggest that about 4 to 24% are unlikely to be convinced with arguments (clear refusal of vaccination; internationally, 20% refused hypothetical vaccines 
(8)
).
However, the decisive factor for COVID-19 vaccination is the large share of at least 24% undecideds and skeptics, who desire and need information in order to weigh potential benefits and harms 
(9)
. To convince many of them, evidence about vaccine efficacy and safety needs to be communicated 
(10)
 in a way that informs without simply persuading, as persuasion would violate the health care standard of informed decision-making and can damage trustworthiness and credibility of the communicator and vaccination 
(11)
.
In Germany, information needs in the pandemic led many people to turn to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for trustworthy information 
(12)
. Public health authorities need tools that help citizens understand COVID-19 vaccinations. Our studies investigate how a public health intervention ("COVID-19 vaccination fact boxes") that were recently developed jointly by the According to international standards of evidence-based health care 
(13)
 and the patient protection law in Germany 
(14)
 and, more generally and ideally, in an enlightened and democratic societyevery citizen should be enabled to weigh the possible benefits and harms of medical options on the basis of the best available evidence and to decide freely on this basis.
Under this premise of informed decision-making (ethos), a comparison of benefits and harms of having or not having the vaccination would be required to inform undecideds and skeptics (target audience) from the beginning of vaccinations (timing). Given the best available evidence, informed decisions are expected to lead more often to COVID-19 vaccinations than not (aim).
Therefore, transparent, comprehensible, and balanced communication tools are required that enable this comparison 
(15)
(16)
(17)
.
One approach to communicating the best available evidence is the "fact box" 
(18,
19)
, a tabular or graphical form of a balance sheet (20) that summarizes benefits and harms of medical options and how likely these will occur. Fact boxes inform various health decisions, including those about medical treatments, cancer screenings, and vaccinations 
(18,
21,
22)
. In contrast to regulation, incentives, and (invisible) nudges 
(23)
, fact boxes are not designed to enforce directed behavioral change 
(24)
. They are boosts that have been shown to enable comprehension of medical options and short-term knowledge acquisition 
(25,
26)
. Many undecided or vaccineskeptical recipients of fact boxes who are uninformed or misinformed could be convinced by the facts to get vaccinated.


Furthermore, those who perceive communication about a vaccine as clear and consistent
show both greater trust in institutions and higher intentions to vaccinate 
(27)
. Even though perceiving increased risks of COVID-19, influenza 
(28)
, or H1N1 (29) can be associated with an increased number of vaccination intentions 
(30)
, overstating the risk of COVID-19 in vaccination communication is detrimental to trustworthiness of medical and scientific experts 
(31)
, which in turn predicts uptake 
(30)
. Enhancing risk perceptions of having or not having a vaccination is thus a prerequisite of informed choices 
(16)
. By communicating transparently and comprehensibly, fact boxes can inform without undermining the public's trust in the communicating institution.
We hypothesize that a COVID-19 vaccination fact box intervention on the population level can achieve a net surplus of proponents over opponents, without persuasion, thereby avoiding the risks of resiliency and distrust. Assuming that this increased intention to get vaccinated leads to greater vaccination uptake, fact boxes could thus serve public health authorities in protecting citizens via transparent and ethical risk communication.


Method and Results
We assessed the relationship of vaccination knowledge and vaccination acceptance in Germany over a  Also, the proportions of undecideds shrank. The proportion of opponents (definitely not) and skeptics (probably not) decreased until actual vaccinations began but remained stable in January and February at about 12% and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, between the end of Dec 2020 and the beginning of Feb 2021 (only mRNA vaccines available) the samples surveyed showed increasing vaccination knowledge ( 
Figure 2
). Over this time course, those without or with low educational attainment showed a similar increase in vaccination knowledge (from M=4.40, SE=0.08 to M=4.67, SE=0.07) compared with those with higher educational attainment (from M=4.68, SE=0.04 to 4.96, SE=0.03).
Vaccine intentions were associated with increasingly correct knowledge (rT0 = .36 and rT4 = .36) with respect to the items. Among those who were undecided in Feb, little improvement in knowledge could be observed when compared with undecideds at the turn of the year, e.g. the proportion of undecideds who could rule out many false assertions about vaccine-related uncertainty remained relatively stable (+0,1 of out 4 test items, compared with +0,3 among proponents). and subjective requirements (e.g. desired facts) of the target population: people from 60 years of age on with a higher risk for severe courses of COVID-19 and those younger than 60 years (more social, more mobile) as mitigators and facilitators of the pandemic. Beyond reasons to choose from (36%: no threat of a severe COVID-19 course, 20%: pandemic passing without larger harm; 
Table S2
) responses to open-ended questions were successively coded, reduced, and summarized according to the 5C scale for monitoring psychological antecedents of vaccination 
(35)
.
Predominantly, undecided respondents' motivations to have the vaccination were related to confidence in the vaccines and the delivering system, such as more investigations (36%), exclusion of harms (14%; more often from 40 years of age on), and long-lasting high efficacy (7%). Besides those requirements, about 11% of undecideds below 40 years of age explicitly claimed their motivation to depend on more or better information. Motivations of those below 40 were more likely extrinsic (e.g., no contact restrictions, freedom to travel) but also reflected collective responsibility (18% stated that they would agree to vaccination if that would protect others, but only 7% of those aged 40-59 and 4% over 60 mentioned the same).
Nearly all reasons against vaccination of undecideds, skeptics, and opponents showed information needs related to confidence and trust 
(Table S3)
  More positive evaluations (F(1,357) = 12.55, p < .001, np 2 = 0.03) and increasing intentions to get vaccinated (F(1,357) = 7.63, P = .006, np 2 = 0.02) were not format-specific 
(Table S4)
. Here, control information may have been as effective as fact boxes, albeit by promoting fear and perceived severity.  Recall of information from simple fact boxes was lower than from complex fact boxes for respondents with low to moderate levels of education (F(1,2048) = 4.10, P = .043, np 2 < 0.01) in both age groups ( 
Figures 3A-B
).
For complex fact boxes, the proportion of quick responders (below median response time of the control condition) among those with the lowest educational attainment was lower (7%; higher: 15%), which indicates that they needed more time for reading and/or for deciding to skip reading. However, for simple fact boxes, the proportion of quick responders was similar (about 11-12%), although longer reading times of those with the lowest educational attainment indicate that the simple formats more likely invited them to skip reading. vaccinations may lead to informed intentions for fact box readers, if they base their intentions on these facts. This mechanism, in line with the standards of the Western health care system, also contributes to the trustworthiness of authorities engaged in vaccination risk communication. For example, since denying information gaps can undermine perceived credibility 
(38,
39)
, fact boxes contain epistemic uncertainty disclaimers 
(19)
. Transparently informing about vaccinations' limitations does not reduce vaccination intentions 
(40)
. Persuasive communications, e.g.
messages framed in relative risks, however, can increase vaccination intentions (41) but are both misinformative and incomprehensible 
(42)
, which collides with the rights and needs of undecided and skeptical citizens. Also, incomprehensible information has the potential for a backlash effect.
Future research may investigate the causal link between the grade of comprehensibility of information about benefits and harms and people's vaccination intentions.
In our population-wide sample, simple fact boxes appear to be more beneficial than complex ones for those with more education or income. This contradiction to the design intention could be due to overly brief reading time of the simple box by vulnerable groups (equal to that of those with higher levels of education). Further, although information needs and requirements were surveyed, sample from a pool of 75,000 panelists who belong to the 25 million members of the German PAYBACK consumer scheme) were invited in each case T0 to T4 (300 per day). Between 14 and 46 of them were not eligible. Among those who were eligible, between 25.4% and 28.0% were non-responders in each case, between 1.0% and 1.5% did not complete the survey, and N=2,037 (T0), N=2,090 (T1), N=4,021 (T2), N=6,056 (T3), and N=1,942 (T4) were presented with our items (samples described in 
Table S1
), and received remuneration worth about 1 euro. In Study 4, we excluded respondents (n=182, 6.1%) who studied an intervention for more than fivefold the average time (> about 18 minutes), assuming that this group had likely turned to other activities.
719 adults aged 18 to 68 years (M=28.8, SD=8.8), who were recruited as a convenience sample through the online portal Prolific.co, completed Study 3 
(Table S6
). Participants were eligible if their mother tongue was German and if Germany was their current country of residence. Participants were contacted by email with information about the study and a link to the online survey. They were remunerated with 2.65 pounds (about euros).
Design. Studies 1, and 4 were plain surveys. The experiment in Study 4 had a mixed design. Betweensubjects presentation format (simple (n=984) vs. complex fact box format (n=974) ( 
Figure S1
) vs one group without information presentation (n=991)) was varied for separate age groups 
(18-59 years vs. 60 onward)
 and with repeated assessments of vaccination evaluation within-subjects (baseline and post). Study also had a mixed design: between-subjects (six presentation formats) and within-subjects (baseline and post).
The three conditions were (1) vaccine fact box (n=120, 
Figure S2A
), (2) vaccine fact box with social framing (n=123, 
Figure S2B
), and (3) the control condition (n=116; website from www.helios-gesundheit.de 
46
 Knowledge (Study 1) was assessed with a focus on vaccination decisions: four items on potential harms (e.g. headache with and without vaccine), and uncertainty (e.g. reduction of contagiousness). The responses were scored according to the best available evidence in Dec 2020 
(Table S7)
 ("How much do you fearâ€¦"), its perceived severity ("How severe would be for you personallyâ€¦"), and numerical risk perception. A frequency format elicited to which extent participants could provide estimates of the probability of developing COVID-19 within a correct range spanning the best available evidence (5-28%, 
Table S8
 on the evidence). For control, all items were presented with numbers for influenza as well. To analyze open responses (Study 2) about reasons in favor of and against COVID-19 vaccination, two category systems starting with the subgroup of 18-to 39-year-olds were inductively developed independently by two researchers (one was the author C.E.). Successively, generated codes were reduced and summarized according to the 5C scale 
(35)
, a tool to monitor psychological antecedents of vaccination that describes five key elements: confidence (e.g. in the effectiveness and safety of vaccination, of the health care system), complacency (perception of risk), constraints (barriers to execution), calculation (extent of information seeking), and collective responsibility (sense of responsibility for the community). Afterwards, the raters compared and consensually agreed on a combined category system with consistent codes for each item 
(Table S9
) and coded the responses of the three items again independently from each other.
Interrater reliability was high, Cohen's kappa = .92 (motivation), kappa = .90 (against vaccination), and kappa = .87 (undecided), respectively. Discrepancies in the coding of the individual answers were discussed, a uniform coding was jointly decided upon, and the codes were quantified.

Center for Risk Literacy and the RKI could increase the number of proponents of COVID-19 vaccination by means of balanced information (boosting) for informed decision-making instead of persuasion (marketing) or seduction (nudging). The fact box was disseminated via established communication channels of the RKI (RKI webpage with about 130 million visits in 2020, Twitter account, Mobile-App of the Permanent Vaccination Commission in Germany).


period of three months (Study 1). To develop an intervention, we assessed respective information gaps and needs of the population in Germany (Study 2) and verified efficacy of "fact boxes" for risk communication with a convenience sample (Study 3). Based on those insights, Study 4 examined whether different fact box formats are effective for enabling informed vaccination intentions. Studies 1, 2 and 4 were based on a daily survey of the German population (32, 33). Multi-stratified online samples (N=2,037 (T0), N=2,090 (T1), N=4,021 (T2), N=6,056 (T3), and N=1,942 (T4)) of about 14,000 invited panelists within a consumer scheme provided data(Table S1), which areafter weightingrepresentative of German citizens who are active online (for details see

.All four studies were conducted consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki. Study 3 was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Potsdam (Germany). The panel company provided de-identified data for Studies 1, 2 and 4.

The independent samples were weighted at the time of their assessment. By asking open-ended questions, we identified objective informational needs (e.g. false beliefs)


: belief in insufficient research on the vaccine and uncertainty about its efficacy and safety (28-52%, increasing with age), fear of harms (34-49%, decreasing with age), and distrust of policies or the vaccine (11-21%). Personal requirements (8%) and low disease risk perception (7%) played minor roles.Confidence-related information needs about vaccine efficacy, safety, short-and long-term reactions and harms, and uncertainty were revealed as the dominant target of vaccination information with the aim of building trust. This is in line with information requirements of health information guidelines

(25,

, do improve COVID-19 risk perception and promote vaccination intentions accordingly, even though fact boxes are not designed to enforce directed behavioral change
(24)
.Fact boxes decreased(Table 1)numeric disease risk perception (F(1,357) = 10.05, P = .002, np 2 = 0.03) compared with control presentation, leading to more accurate estimates (Figure S3, P < .001). Only control presentation increased both fear (F(1,357) = 4.17, P = .042, np 2 = 0.01) and perceived severity of developing the disease (F(1,357) = 19.90, P < .001, np 2 = 0.05).


post assessment). The shift in vaccination evaluation after being presented simple fact boxes (+7.9%) could, to a substantial extent, be related to the skeptical and undecided respondents' comprehension of the information presented. Those who drew correct inferences about vaccine efficacy after having seen simple fact boxes showed a positive change in evaluation, but not those who drew incorrect inferences (F(1,467) = 3.88, P < .050, np 2 = 0.01). Separate sub-analyses highlighted that this effect is due to the younger skeptics and undecideds (F(1,387) = 5.65, P = .018, np 2 = 0.01), not to those aged 60 and above (F(1,76) = 0.04, P = .836). Knowledge recall after information presentation was not related to positive evaluation change (for skeptical and undecided respondents' showing at least 80% correct responses; (F(1,387) = 0.59, P = .445).Taking into account vulnerable individuals with expected limited reading skills, we compared simple and complex fact boxes for those with lowest educational attainment (16.5% of respondents). They recalled less (F(1,3086) = 11.44, P =.001, np 2 < 0.01), but there was no box type effect (F(2,3086) = 0.20, P = .820).

Error bars show the standard error of the mean. The sample is weighted. Discussion The association of vaccination knowledge and uptake implies one crucial mechanism with regards to the goal of an immunized society. Besides showing a differential increase in vaccination knowledge in proponents, the undecided, and opponents from the start of COVID-19 vaccination in Germany, Study 1 showed increasing intentions to have the (mRNA) vaccinations (6). Study 2 found that both undecideds and skeptics lack various pieces of information for making a decision, paired with false beliefs and a lack of trust in vaccine safety and efficacy. To address those gaps, a fact box format was developed in Study 3, which improved disease risk perception without increasing COVID-19 fears (unlike in the control condition). Applied on the population level in Study 4, fact boxes boosted knowledge of undecideds and skeptics together with a more positive evaluation of the vaccination's benefit-harm ratio. Studying simple or complex fact boxes instead of nothing was 1.3 times more likely to lead to any positive change in evaluation.Although a common factor (e.g. peers' behaviors) admittedly may underlie information acquisition and evidence-based intentions, and stable vaccination preferences may prompt differential information acquisition, knowledge about benefits and harms of COVID-19


the lower educated target group did not actively take part in the development process. Additional factors associated with formal education can also lead to inequality (e.g. working and living conditions). Future studies should incorporate approaches such as the PROGRESS Plus framework, which describes inequity-generating factors at multiple levels and takes into account concepts such as critical health literacy or digital health literacy, to examine the conditions under which who benefits and who does not benefit from fact boxes and how this affects health inequities
(43)
. An additional limitation of our work concerns the set of vaccination knowledge items that covered certain requirements of health information guidelines but were not a validated scale of vaccination knowledge.In Germany the current implementation of fact boxes (44) supports evidence-based education and, thus, empowerment on the population level. Our figures imply, theoretically presenting about 11 million undecided and skeptical adults under 60 years in Germany with a simple fact box for about 90 seconds would make more than 600.000 people learn vaccine efficacy. A majority of those would evaluate vaccinations more positively. By avoiding persuasion, reactance and distrust concerning the sender's intentions can be prevented or alleviated. In return, informed decision-making is not a threat to the goal of population vaccination. For achieving this preference, ensuring every individual's right to decide about their own health could be sufficient, while other types of social contract (45) could be minor. The legally binding standard of evidencebased health care (13), benchmark of a democratic society, would assure responsible vaccination decisions and future commitment when refreshments of the vaccination might be necessary or when individuals might have to decide to get vaccinated against other diseases. Material and Methods Samples. Independent samples with (T1, T3) and without (T0, T2, T4) knowledge assessment (Studies 1, 2, and 4) were conducted between 25 Nov 2020 and 16 Feb 2021 (T4). The "Corona Online Opinion Panel Survey Special", COMPASS, by the research institute "infratest dimap" (Berlin, Germany) was set up to monitor the pandemic over time. Between 13,664 and 13,816 German-speaking panelists (a multi-stratified


), in which standard information on SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 (without vaccination) and influenza from the internet was presented (between 20 Nov 20 and 21 Feb among the top three German search findings comparing SARS-CoV-2 and influenza). Three further fact boxes for another experiment on disease risks are not reported here. Participants were not aware of the alternative formats. The same introductory text was provided for each condition. Measures. Vaccination intention (Studies 1 and 4) was assessed with single-option choice ("Vaccines against the Corona virus are now available. If you get the chance, will you get vaccinated against Corona?": Definitely yes, probably yes, probably not, definitely not, I cannot yet say / am still undecided, I am already vaccinated (not at T0 and T1)). In Study 3, participants were asked if they plan to get vaccinated within the next six months. Reasons in favor of or against COVID-19 vaccination (Study 2) were asked, with singlechoice and open-response items depending on vaccination intention (e.g. for skeptics and opponents: "Why would you not want to be vaccinated if necessary?"). Participants of all studies evaluated the benefit-harm ratio of COVID-19 vaccination in question on an 11-point rating scale.


Procedure.
After their informed consent to multi-theme study participation, participants received demographic questions, items about pandemic conditions, and an inquiry on COVID-19 experience and evaluation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, followed by questions on vaccination intention, evaluation, and knowledge items (Studies 1, 2, and 4). In Study 4, the vaccine efficacy item was presented with fact boxes (intervention groups). Knowledge recall and once again vaccination evaluation were requested after intervention removal. In Study 3, after giving informed consent and responding to demographic questions, participants answered items on disease risk perception and fear, on previous adherence to COVID-19    measures, and on vaccination intention and evaluation. After reading the presentation formats with evaluation items (e.g. trust in the information presented), the intervention was removed and questions on fear, risk perception, adherence, and vaccination intentions and evaluations were repeated.Analyses. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to compare interventions with presentation formats (Studies 3 and 4), logistic regressions were used to study confounders, and McNemar tests were used to compare dichotomous data for individual formats from baseline to post-assessment.

(37)
. To address that, Study 4 compared complex and simple fact boxesbased on the implemented version and facilitating access for people of diverse educational backgroundswith regards to improving vaccination knowledge and evaluation.First, vaccination knowledge was higher after fact box presentations (F(1, 3101) = 36.58, p < .001, np 2 = 0.01) than with none. Respondents below and from 60 years of age onward recalled vaccine efficacy, safety, likely considered a potential risk of facial paresis (OR = 1.16 [1.04, 1.28]), and younger people more likely remembered vaccine efficacy (OR = 1.13 [1.02, 1.24]). Finally, vaccine efficacy was (OR = 1.85 [1.53, 2.17], p < .001) more likely correctly inferred when a fact box was present (controlled for education). Second, fact boxes more likely prompted any change (OR = 1.36 [1.20, 1.52]; Ï‡ 2 (1) = 14.53, p < .001, adjusted R 2 = 0.01) and a positive change (OR=1.25 [1.06, 1.44]; (Ï‡ 2 (1) = 5.29, P = .021, adjusted R 2 < 0.01) of the evaluation of the vaccination compared with no intervention. Whereas 18.6% of respondents without any intervention changed their evaluation of a COVID-19 vaccination positively, 20.3% did so if studying a complex fact box, and 24.2% if studying a simple fact box. At the same time, however, 14.5%, 19.8%, and 16.3%, respectively, evaluated the evaluation more negatively when asked a second time (at

. Respondents' estimates of how many people get sick with COVID-19 if vaccinated or not after meeting an infected person were elicited in Study 1 and 4 using a normalized frequency format (out of 1,000 people) to show understanding of vaccine efficacy instead of recall of deficient relative risk reduction (omitting base rate and absolute effect size). Resulting inferences reflected an underlying risk ratio between the estimations (to avoid zero, division numerator and denominator were adjusted with +1 out of 1,000); 88% to 98% vaccine efficacy was scored as correct (for mRNA vaccines across different age groups, from a meta-analysis published on Feb 2021 (47): 90% to 96%; we tolerated a +-2% margin of error). After information presentation (Study 4), five items with true-false statements tested participants' recall of vaccination safety (fatigue, serious adverse events), uncertainty (later harm, facial paresis), and efficacy.Risk perception and fear (Study 3). Five items measured the fear of getting or spreading COVID-19
