Abstract (250 palabras)
The present article advocates for the incorporation of philosophical tools in human neuroscience, aiming to develop transdisciplinary applications that address real-world problems. This is, considering that the 21st century -characterized by remarkable scientific advancements and formidable global challenges like climate crisis and pandemics-needs a holistic approach for applied human neuroscience. For example, traditional educational models, particularly STEM, often overlook the importance of integrating arts, humanities, and social sciences, leading to reductionist perspectives in both learning and decision-making about education. This trend extends to neuroscience, where essential concepts like ontology and epistemology are often underemphasized, hindering a comprehensive understanding of reality and knowledge.
Thus, we introduce the 3E (Embodied, Enactive, and Environmentally Scaffolded) Perspective to Cognition for Applied Human Neuroscience as a pragmatic adaptation of the more complex 4E-Cognition perspective. We criticize the insufficient integration of the 4E perspective in mainstream neuroscience and applied sciences, discussing its relation to the dominant biomedical and biopsycho-social models. We introduce the streamlined 3E perspective, which merges the Embedded and Extended aspects of the 4E perspective into a unified Environmental Scaffolding principle. Using education and medical science research, we exemplify the potential of the 3E perspective in enriching our understanding of human neuroscience research and its applications. The 3E perspective facilitates a more nuanced comprehension of cognitive processes and enables the creation of solutions for contemporary challenges. By fostering this integrated perspective, we can better equip professionals and decision-makers to navigate and address the complex issues of our time. 


Introduction
The 21st century has ushered in remarkable advancements, such as deepening our understanding of the universe and pioneering innovative treatments for viruses and diseases 
(Dai et al., 2021;
Goossens et al., 2022)
 However, it has also presented us with some of the most daunting challenges, including the climate crisis, emerging pandemics, and significant disparities in social equity 
(Nations, 2015)
. Amidst these challenges, there's a growing optimism rooted in the vast influx of data and the emergence of sophisticated data mining tools that hold the potential to address these issues. For example, in education, frameworks such as STEM 
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)
 often prioritize disciplines that have a direct impact on a country's gross domestic product (GDP), inadvertently sidelining arts, humanities, and social sciences. Such a skewed emphasis results in reductionist educational perspectives and -ultimately-reductionist decisionmakers. Take Chile for instance: philosophy, once a staple in the curriculum, is now merely an elective, no longer a mandatory subject for students 
(Eslava, 2022)
. Unfortunately, a similar trend is observed in neuroscience. Students often lack comprehensive instruction in ontology and epistemology, missing the opportunity to integrate these with the methodologies they learn to form a cohesive understanding of the nature of reality, the nature of knowledge, and the principles of research.
As neuroscientists, we strongly believe that a philosophical toolkit is needed to use human neuroscience for the development of transdisciplinary real-world applications. Therefore, in the present article, we will introduce the 3E 
(Embodied, Enactive, and Environmentally Scaffolded)
 perspective to cognition for applied Human Neuroscience. In order to make these philosophical principles more concrete, we present examples using educational and medical science research. The 3E perspective is a streamlined version of 4E-Cognition 1 
(Embodied, Embedded, Extended, and Enactive;
Gallagher, 2017;
Newen et al., 2018)
. 
1
 We will not go further into details about the 4E perspective as it exceeds the scope of the present article. We invite readers who might not be familiar with the 4E perspective to read the complete Oxford Handbook of 4E Cognition 
(Newen et al., 2018)
 as well as some of the different implications of the 4E principles in the context of human neuroscience research This article begins by explaining why the 4E perspective has not been adopted in mainstream human neuroscience or applied sciences including how it stands next to the dominant biomedical and bio-psycho-social models. Next, we introduce the 3E approach and argue for the relevance of merging the Embedded and Extended principles of the 4E perspective into the multidimensional Environmental Scaffolding construct. We will furthermore argue why it is not useful to keep adding principles to the 4E perspective, such as the 4EA 
(Protevi, 2010)
, 5E 
(Stilwell & Harman, 2019)
, or even 6E 
(McCauley, 2022
) approaches if we want to develop transdisciplinary neuroscience applications.


The Downfall of Mental Gymnastics
The biopsychosocial model, introduced by George Engel in 1977, aimed to develop a comprehensive understanding of an individual by integrating psychological, social, and cultural factors as key elements of behavior. This model emerged as an alternative to the then-dominant biomedical model, offering a holistic view of the individual, in contrast to the biomedical model's reductionist approach. Engel criticized the biomedical model for neglecting the personal and human aspects of the patient, thus overlooking the significant role of human experience in health and wellness 
(Engel, 1977)
. The biopsychosocial model addresses this gap by viewing health as an interconnected continuum of mind and body, influenced by environmental factors, and providing an integrated perspective on health and disease 
(Cooper, 2017;
Deacon, 2013;
Getz et al., 2011)
.
Despite the promising outlook of the biopsychosocial model in its ability to integrate the life experiences of an individual/patient in their treatment pathway, the biopsychosocial model continues to be overshadowed by the biomedical model 
(Pilgrim, 2015)
. For instance, research on major depressive disorder often remains focused on identifying treatable biomarkers, viewing the condition primarily as a neurochemical imbalance. This approach encounters significant limitations, including difficulty establishing causality and a lack of conclusive evidence 
(Kennis et al., 2020)
. Additionally, the psychopharmacological industry's emphasis on a brain-centric view of mental health diagnoses 2 
(Grasso-Cladera et al., 2022;
Palacios-García et al., 2022;
Palacios-García & Parada, 2021;
Parada & Palacios-Garcia, 2022;
Parada & Rossi, 2018
. promotes a medicalization of pathology, often overshadowing more holistic approaches 
(Vázquez, 2014)
. Even with challenges in biomarker research and reproducibility, medicalization continues to dominate treatment pathways 
(Chan et al., 2015
).
The biopsychosocial model's theoretical strength lies in its potential for a multifaceted exploration of mental illness. However, in practice, it often succumbs to the simplicity of a biomedical approach, reflecting a broader trend of reductionism. Holistic treatment within the biopsychosocial model is resource-intensive and may not be feasible, particularly in public health contexts, which limits its application and growth 
(Lane, 2014)
. At the end of the day, attempts to implement the biopsychosocial model frequently revert to reductionist, fragmented, and linear approaches . For applied scientists and professionals alike, there seems to be an inevitable regression to the mean of reductionism.
Reductionism's appeal lies in its capacity to yield practical, quantifiable results, making it a favored approach in social science research and beyond 
(Bickle, 2003;
Verschuren, 2001
).
Considering the ever-recurrent reductionism to molecular and cellular neuroscience, is especially relevant in the light of novel health and disease perspectives. One of these perspectives is the One Health approach, which is a global strategy aimed to emphasize the relevance of having an integrative and transdisciplinary approach to the health-disease continuum, incorporating biological, psychological, social, political, economic, environmental, and personal factors 
(Destoumieux-Garzón et al., 2018;
Who, 2017;
Zinsstag et al., 2011)
 3 . However, despite the power of reductionism in the analysis of human behavior, health, and disease, human neuroscience has not been able to establish a complexity-embracing model that can also be streamlined enough to be efficiently practiced to face the plethora of problems ahead 4 , while keeping the integrity of integration through multiple ethicoonto-epistemological levels. 
2
 The mental health distinction is made for explanatory reasons to show a specific field within the health-disease continuum. However, it is not possible to understand this continuum from integrative perspectives when separating mental health from physical health. 
3
 Explaining the One Health approach exceeds the scope of our article. We invite readers to read 
Destoumieux-Garzón et al., (2018)
 for an introductory overview. 4 E.g., from climate to socio-political crises. The 21st century has heralded significant advancements alongside major challenges. In this era, sophisticated data mining tools hold promise for addressing these issues, yet the translation of psychological and brain science research into practical applications often encounters hurdles. These limitations may originate from the constrained scope of the biomedical model and the segmented approach of the bio-psycho-social model, which frequently underpins the ethico-ontoepistemological perspectives in human neuroscience 
(Cormack et al., 2023;
de Haan, 2020
de Haan, , 2021
Stilwell & Harman, 2019)
. In response, the 4E perspective has emerged, integrating and refining the best aspects of both models into a unified, complex framework. This perspective views the mind as an Embodied, Embedded, Extended, and Enacted phenomenon, challenging traditional notions by highlighting the interconnectivity of the brain, body, and environment 5 
(Gallagher, 2017
(Gallagher, , 2023
Newen et al., 2018;
Varela et al., 1991)
.
The 4E perspective offers a robust framework for creating evidence-based applications in clinical, educational, architectural, and other fields. Yet, its adoption in mainstream research and applications remains limited. A potential barrier is the challenge of comprehending some of its principles and understanding their implications for the ontology, epistemology, and methodology of human neuroscience. Another limiting factor is the technological framework needed to create empirical research that can accommodate the 4E cognition research program. Research concerning the functioning of the nervous system alone is highly complex, even before the process needed to objectively measure how it might interact with the rest of the body or the surroundings. Without adequate technology to run the necessary experiments, 4E will remain purely a philosophical framework.
However, recent technological innovations have made the application of 4E research questions more practical, such as the emergence of Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI; 
Grasso-Cladera et al., 2022;
Ladouce et al., 2016;
Makeig et al., 2009)
 or Exposomics 
(Helbig et al., 2021;
 F o r P e e r R e v i e w 
Maitre et al., 2022;
Wei et al., 2022)
. However, challenges remain in monitoring neural and environmental activities under natural conditions and in developing software capable of analyzing complex multidimensional data. Current applications of MoBI, for instance, are still largely confined to controlled laboratory settings or specific cognitive tasks (e.g., 
Jungnickel & Gramann, 2016;
Ladouce et al., 2022)
. This restricts its widespread use and implementation. For 4E cognition to become widely accepted and used as an epistemological tool, technology must be both adequate and accessible to researchers, clinicians, educators, and more, which it currently is not.
The 4E perspective -while offering a rich and diverse perspective on cognition-faces practical limitations due to its dispersed nature. It stands in contrast to more linear and defined traditional neurological research paradigms like the biomedical model. Rather than a singular framework, the 4E perspective encompasses a broad spectrum of frameworks, each contributing unique insights but sometimes presenting conflicting viewpoints 
(Gonzalez-Grandón & Froese, 2018)
. This diversity fosters a wide range of research questions and perspectives, enriching the field. However, its inherent complexity can be challenging, especially for practitioners from different disciplines who may find it difficult to navigate its multifaceted and highly technical nature.
The relationship between the 4E perspective and findings from other fields can be complex, particularly when 4E principles contrast with established results. While it often complements established physiological data, it occasionally delves into philosophical speculation, offering theories that -though intellectually appealing-lack practical applications. In some cases, 4E theories even boldly challenge well-supported biomedical research findings 
(Carney, 2020)
 complicating its integration into empirically-grounded fields like medicine or environmental studies.


The Problem of 4E Cognition within Applied Neuroscience
The debate in the Philosophy of Mind has long grappled with understanding the mind's nature and its relationship with the body, oscillating between dualism and reductionism (Rossi et al.,  
6
 . In general terms, Dualism posits a distinct separation between the mind and the physical world, suggesting they operate under different principles 
(Robinson, 2023)
. Reductionism, in contrast, seeks to deconstruct complex phenomena like cognition into elemental processes governed by physical laws 
(Nagel, 2007)
. For example, Physicalism, a form of reductionism, asserts that understanding cognition hinges on comprehending the physical processes and interactions within the brain 
(Churchland, 1981;
Crane, 2000;
Schiffer, 1990
).
The 4E (Embodied, Extended, Embedded, Enacted) perspective has emerged as a more integrative ethico-onto-epistemological approach, addressing the shortcomings of both reductionism and dualism 
(Gallagher, 2023;
Newen et al., 2018;
Varela et al., 1991)
. It conceptualizes cognition as a multi-level phenomenon, deeply rooted in biology and intertwined with environmental context (i.e., ecological niche; 
Jonas, 1966;
Newen et al., 2018;
Rossi et al., 2019;
Thelen & Smith, 1995;
. The integration of multi-dimensional variables in the study and understanding of cognition has significantly enhanced the explanatory power 7 of contemporary neuroscience research 
(Nielsen, 1994;
Schupbach & Sprenger, 2011;
Ylikoski & Kuorikoski, 2010)
. By combining (neuro)physiological dynamics with contextual factors, human neuroscience has developed more robust heuristics to elucidate the complexity of cognition, thereby addressing its multifaceted nature 
(Djebbara et al., 2019;
Iggena et al., 2023;
Piñeyro Salvidegoitia et al., 2019)
.
Despite these advancements, the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications in the field remains 8 . The 4E perspective, while theoretically robust, has yet to effectively address 
6
 The development of this discussion exceeds the aim of the present article. For more insights on this debate, see 
(Feyerabend, 1963;
Hanna & Thompson, 2007;
Nagel, 1993)
. 
7
 Or the ability of a theory or explanation to yield new insights or predict outcomes related to a phenomenon.
8 Despite significant advancements in human neuroscience research, the practical application of these findings can often remain underdeveloped. Fully describing the gap between research and application exceeds the scope of the present work. However, in a nutshell, the brain is incredibly complex, and understanding its workings in detail is an ongoing challenge. Hence, translating nuanced research findings into practical applications requires a deep understanding of this complexity, the context of its workings, and its developmental trajectory, which has been complicated 
(Pessoa, 2023)
. Furthermore, the high degree of individual variability in brain structure and function can make it difficult to develop universallyeffective applications based on -sometimes too specific-neuroscience research 
(Kopal et al., 2023)
. This also explains why the development of new treatments, technologies, or therapeutic approaches based on the latest research is not readily available.
F o r P e e r R e v i e w specific real-world challenges 9 . This disconnect underscores the need for operationalizing the 4E framework to not only deepen theoretical understanding but also enhance its practicality and relevance in real-world contexts 
(Kuper & Whitehead, 2013)
. To effectively apply human neuroscience and achieve significant impact, the 4E perspective needs to be redefined and tailored for accessibility and practicality across various professional fields. Integrating the four core principles of the 4E perspective with concepts like "affective" and "emotive" can complicate its practical application. The 4E perspective establishes four foundational principles that provide a theoretical basis for comprehending the complexity of cognition, underpinned by a clear ethical stance. The introduction of additional concepts, such as "affective" as described by 
Protevi (2010)
 which pertains to experiences related to, influenced by, or expressing emotions or feelings 
(Gross & Barrett, 2013)
 can add unnecessary layers of complexity. Similarly, adding the concept of "emotive" 
(Stilwell & Harman, 2019)
, denoting experiences that evoke or trigger emotions, brings another dimension. These concepts address different aspects of emotional experience: one relates to the nature of emotional states and processes, and the other to the induction of such states. Considering that psycho-affective states are both physiologically grounded and socio-culturally manifested 
(Gross & Barrett, 2013)
, both of these concepts are aligned well with the principles already established in the 4E perspective. A recent development is the proposal of another 5E approach 10 , which also includes yet another concept: "empirical" 
(Troncoso et al., 2023)
. In parts 3 and 10 of The Oxford Handbook of 4E Cognition the empirical, modeling, and applied aspects are indeed addressed 
(Newen et al., 2018)
. Similarly, 
Aguayo (2023)
 suggested that the 4E perspective should be called 4E+, in order to consider the role of affectivity and the emotional dimension in influencing human cognition and experience. Even though all of these (and other) works are valuable additions to the 4E literature, we think that adding 
9
 What can we offer teachers and parents that can help them with a child that has been diagnosed with attentional deficit disorder? 10 The additional "E" in the "5E approach" represents "Emotional", in contrast to Stilwell & Harman's "Emotive" (2019).
The concept of "Emotional" typically encompasses experiences, expressions, or other aspects linked to psycho-affective states. It's crucial to note that this expanded "empirical 5E approach" is specifically designed for exploring empathy, a distinct and complex construct 
(Decety & Holvoet, 2021;
Hall & Schwartz, 2019)
, not for understanding cognition as a whole which makes it more confusing when trying to develop applications. In summary, indiscriminately blending principles, concepts, and constructs with the already established 4E perspective, will lead us away from the objective of providing a clear and concrete alternative to the biomedical and bio-psycho-social models. Therefore, it's crucial to maintain simplicity and clarity in the 4E perspective to enhance its applicability and effectiveness in various domains. In sum, we should make the 4E perspective simpler.


Introducing the 3E Perspective to Cognition for Applied Human Neuroscience
The 4E ethico-onto-epistemological perspective, with its focus on the interplay between brain, body, and environment, has sparked significant debate in cognitive science 
(Carney, 2020;
Coninx & Stephan, 2021;
Gallagher, 2023;
Newen et al., 2018;
Stephan & Walter, 2020)
. A key debate within this field revolves around the extended mind hypothesis where cognitive processes can extend beyond the individual's brain and body to include external devices and environments 
(Clark & Chalmers, 1998)
. This idea challenges traditional notions of cognition being confined within the boundaries of the individual's head 
(Adams & Aizawa, 2009)
. Similarly, the embedded mind hypothesis claims that cognitive processes are deeply influenced and supported by the physical and social environment in which an individual is situated 
(Newen et al., 2018)
. This idea extends to social, political, and cultural contexts. This includes the tools, practices, and norms of a society, which can shape thinking and reasoning.
Thus, the nature of cognition, the boundaries of the mind, and the interplay between individuals and their environments are at the core of the debates about the mind. Furthermore, the role of environments in cognition, specifically whether they play a causal or constitutive role in cognitive processes is heavily discussed 11 . Briefly, the main question refers to the ontological status of 
11
 Deepening on the discussion about the contextual/enabling/constitutive role of extra-cranial factors in cognition is beyond the scope of the present work as it has been deeply discussed elsewhere 
(Coninx & Stephan, 2021;
De Jaegher et al., 2010;
Rojas-Líbano & Parada, 2019;
Sterelny, 2010)
. necessarily part of the cognitive system? 
(Aizawa, 2010;
De Jaegher et al., 2010;
Rojas-Líbano & Parada, 2019)
. Should practitioners, professionals, and other fields join these highly-technical discussions? Following our argument of simplicity, we think not.
Stephan and collaborators (2018; 2014) advocate for a change in position, shifting from the traditional distinction between Extended and Embedded cognition to a focus on Environmental Scaffolding, advocating for a 3E approach (Embodied, Environmentally Scaffolded, Enacted). Hence, the 3E perspective to cognition is a streamlined form of the 4E perspective, it is compatible with autopoietic theory 
(Maturana & Varela, 1991)
, and we argue that these three principles are enough to allow human neuroscience to delve into developing applications to real-world problems. We will briefly introduce each of these principles that consider the organism (i.e., embodiment), the world (i.e., environmental scaffolds), and their active engagement (i.e., enaction).


Cognition Unfolds within Organisms
Embodiment is the fundamental principle of the 3E perspective and states that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's physiology of an autonomous organism. 
Following Varela and collaborators (1991)
, this implies that the organism's body and all (neuro)physiological states emerging from being in the natural, built, digital, social, cultural, political, and/or relational world, are mechanically and constitutively linked to the organism's experience 
(Parada & Rossi, 2020)
. This is, all cognitive processes (e.g., thinking, reasoning, memory) are influenced by the body's physicality and the possibilities it affords for actions in the world 
(Djebbara et al., 2022;
Purdon et al., 2013)
. This is, visceral, sensory, and motor systems are central in the development and function of cognition, not just outputs of cognitive processing. Hence, the embodiment principle challenges traditional, 
12
 The main problem is that these couplings could be just contextual modulators, not having causal roles in cognition. Also, these factors could be enablers of the cognitive function in question, yet have nothing to do with its nature. Finally, these factors could be causal to cognition. Even though these questions are highly relevant for philosophy of mind, are they relevant for applied neuroscience?  
(Adams & Aizawa, 2009;
Gallagher, 2023)
.
Given the fact that the organism's physiology constitutes the base for its experience 
(Purdon et al., 2013)
, cognitive research should always include psychophysiological and neurobehavioral measures 
(Azzalini et al., 2019)
.


Cognition Unfolds as it Vines Onto the World
Environmental Scaffolding is the novel principle that functionally merges the Extendedness and Embeddedness 4E principles. Therefore, environmental scaffolds can be understood as all natural, built, digital, social, cultural, political, and/or relational environments where an organism is exposed. The functional crossover and relations of all of these environmental modalities and dimensions -the emergent intersectionality 
(Phoenix & Pattynama, 2006)
is the organism's niche. Therefore, environmental scaffolding invites practitioners to make use of or configure environmental factors in order to shape, facilitate, support, or regulate a specific activity or capacity 
(Coninx & Stephan, 2021;
Shvarts & Bakker, 2019;
Sutton et al., 2010;
Varga, 2019)
. For the 3E perspective, there is no need to know whether the scaffolded skill or capacity is causally linked to the environmental scaffold, actively implemented or structured by the agent, or if it is merely serving as a passive backdrop 13 . The important aspect is to consider that a cognitive process is situated, relational, and is better to not reduce it to a single dimension.
The roots of environmental scaffolding can be found in Educational Theory 
(Belland, 2014)
.
It is aligned with Lev Vygotsky's seminal ideas on learning and development 
(1978,
1981
). Vygotsky's ideas suggest that learning processes happen when interpersonal engagement is embedded in significant contexts. This is the notion of the Zone of Proximal Development, which emphasizes the 
13
 Here, we disagree with 
Coninx & Stephan (2021)
, since they suggest that the relationship between agent and scaffold is constitutive. We think this is not necessary for the 3E Perspective to Cognition for Applied Human Neuroscience. Our definition of environmental scaffold implies that its ontological status depends on the organism and its constructed niche. Therefore, from our perspective, it is impossible -and unnecessary-to know a priori the ontological status of a given scaffold.  
(Vygotsky, 1978
(Vygotsky, , 1981
). An individual's development is greatly enhanced through collaborative problem-solving with more knowledgeable or skilled individuals, such as teachers, peers, or parents. The zone of proximal development highlights a developmental trajectory where learning progresses from what learners can do independently to what they can achieve with guidance or in collaboration with others 
(Belland, 2014;
Flick, 2000;
Nordlof, 2014;
Van Der Stuyf, 2002;
Wright, 2018)
. In this sense, the others (i.e., teachers, peers, and/or parents, etc. 14 ) can fulfill the role of environmental scaffolding for the student by providing the possibility to achieve goals they might not be able to accomplish by themselves 
(Nordlof, 2014)
. It is important to note that the environmental scaffolding principle is not the same as the zone of proximal development. Environmental scaffolding assumes that cognitive agents have an active role in shaping their environments 15 , emphasizing a bi-directional interaction: the agent adapts to its niche and -at the same time-produces its own niche 
(Gibson, 1979;
Lewontin, 1983;
Odling-Smee, 1988;
Sterelny, 2010;
Varela et al., 1991)
.
For environmental scaffolding, agents are involved in an active process of generating modifications on certain features of the relationship established with their environment 
(Bertolotti & Magnani, 2017;
Colombetti & Krueger, 2015;
Laland et al., 2016;
Odling-Smee et al., 2003)
. Hence, cognitive research should always consider environmental features as relevant factors influencing cognition 
(Charalambous & Djebbara, 2023;
Djebbara et al., 2022)
.


Cognition Unfolds within Niches that Actively Engage Organisms
Enaction is the third and final principle of the 3E perspective and unites the organism with its ecological niche. Considering that the Embodiment principle states that the body and all 14 From our perspective, the "skilled individual" does not need to be human. It could be an artificial intelligence, an animal companion, a computer, etc. The key difference between the zone of proximal development and environmental scaffolding is that the nature of the organism's counterpart is not important as long as the counterpart has a skill that the organism cannot enact at the moment, and the organism can actively interact with its counterpart. 
15
 Understood as an attribute of the species that refers to the environmental factors that conditioned the existence of species at a given location and the manner in which the agents modify their environment 
(Bertolotti & Magnani, 2017;
Gibson, 1979;
Grinnell & Swarth, 1913;
Hutchinson, 1957)
 F o r P e e r R e v i e w 14 (neuro)physiological states emerging from being in the natural, 
built, digital, social, cultural, political,
 and/or relational world, are mechanically and constitutively linked to the organism's experience and that the Environmental Scaffolding principle states that the functional crossover and relations of all of these environmental modalities and dimensions where the organism is situated shape, facilitate, support, or regulate a specific activity or capacity; the Enactive approach hinges and articulates organism and ecological niche. Cognition is not an isolated entity occurring ontologically within intrinsic brain areas, but is deeply interconnected with the body and the environment, through active engagement and interaction 
(Di Paolo et al., 2017;
Gallagher, 2023;
Varela et al., 1991)
. 
Following Varela, Di Paolo, Gallagher and collaborators (1991;
, cognition is not constituted by internal representations or computations in the brain, but arises through active, dynamic engagement of the organism with the world. Furthermore, all psychophysiological and neurobehavioral aspects of perception are not passively triggered by the world, but by actively exploring and interacting with it. This implies that organisms are continually engaged in a process of participatory sense-making, where interpretation and assignment of meaning to the niche is based on the organism's history, needs, and goals (De Jaegher & Di 
Paolo, 2007)
. Hence, cognition research should try to reach a healthy balance between laboratory and real-world experiments 
(Makeig et al., 2009;
Parada, 2018;
Stangl et al., 2023)
.


Implementing the 3E Perspective
While theoretical and philosophical in nature, the 3E perspective has concrete applications and solutions for applied human neuroscience. In the next subsections we will provide concrete examples of the implementation of the 3E perspective. Providing examples of each and every possible application of the 3E perspective is -of course-beyond the scope of the present work. Nevertheless, we will provide concrete examples using educational and medical science.  The obvious implication involves the physicality of learners while engaging in learning practices. Activities such as hands-on experiments, role-playing, and the use of physical models allow students to connect abstract concepts with tangible experiences 
(Macrine & Fugate, 2022)
. Enaction indicates that by integrating relevant and culturally sensible bodily movements and sensory experiences into the curriculum and learning activities, educators can enhance cognitive processes 
(Aguayo et al., 2023;
Markant et al., 2016)
. Furthermore, learning should focus on active engagement and interaction. It encourages educators to design learning experiences where students actively participate in knowledge construction. This could involve problem-based learning, where students tackle real-world problems, or project-based learning, where they engage in projects that require critical thinking and collaboration. These approaches foster a deeper understanding of subjects and develop skills like problem-solving, creativity, and teamwork 
(Videla et al., 2021)
.
However, a less obvious implication is given by the Embodiment principle. It emphasizes the fact that our (neuro)physiological states -essentially, the conditions of our nervous system and bodyplay a key role in how we think and learn. These states are vital for effective learning in any setting.
In learning environments, it's important for learners to develop and maintain physiological processes that help them manage their psycho-affective and behavioral states. This, in turn, creates a positive social and emotional atmosphere that supports complex cognitive processes like communication, attention, and metacognition (e.g., 
Malmberg et al., 2021)
. This raises an important question: Are our current classrooms and educational methods effectively encouraging the physiological states necessary for emotional regulation and learning?
The environmental scaffolding principle suggests that classrooms can be designed with flexible and interactive spaces that can adapt to various learning activities, catering to individuality

 But unfortunately, not necessarily with the reality of educational contexts F o r P e e r R e v i e w and diversity of learners' abilities. Following Nordlof (2014) two types of scaffolding that might take place inside the classroom: cognitive (i.e., offering suitable support to aid students in independently solving problems, such as cues, partial solutions, and direct instructions) and motivational (i.e., assisting teachers in creating a nurturing learning environment for the student by, for example, promoting peer support). Scaffolding in learning doesn't just come from teachers or peers (the social aspect), but also from environmental elements like technology and computer interfaces. These can help move students to a higher level within their zone of proximal development 
(Pea, 2004;
Wright, 2018
).
All things considered, the incorporation of the 3E principles into learning environments yields the ground for the development of specific teaching and tutoring methodologies to facilitate learning and development, that is: provides practical real-world interventions based on theoretical approaches 
(Wood et al., 1976;
Wright, 2018)
.
Regarding education research, there's a rising focus on creating strategies that use the environment as a scaffold. Researchers are exploring the effectiveness of these approaches 
(Belland et al., 2017;
Hug, 2023)
. There is a shift in science education research from purely conceptual learning to the broader learning context. This includes enhancing the learning environment, teacher-student interactions, peer dynamics, and students' attitudes towards learning 
(Lin et al., 2012)
. Another significant trend is the integration of technology in education, particularly in scaffolding strategies.
Reviews have shown a variety of these strategies, like managing frustration, providing feedback, structuring tasks, maintaining direction, and demonstrating concepts. These are part of diverse educational interventions, including conceptual, metacognitive, motivational, and strategic approaches 
(Belland et al., 2017)
. Given the increasing use of technology in education, -especially in STEM and STEAM programs 17 -experts are advocating for research that intersects personalized and computer-based scaffolding. They also emphasize the importance of preparing students for future learning, suggesting a need for further exploration in this area 
(Belland, 2014)
. Thus, the 3E perspective in education implies a paradigm shift towards a more integrated and holistic view of learning. By incorporating these principles, educators and researchers can develop and apply innovative teaching methods and learning environments that are grounded in realworld applicability and theoretical rigor. This approach ensures that education evolves to meet the diverse and complex needs of learners, preparing them effectively for the challenges and opportunities of a situated and local future but with a global perspective.


The 3E Perspective Applied to Medical Sciences
In Medical Sciences, the application of the 3E perspective brings a transformative approach to healthcare and treatment. By embracing the interconnectedness of physical, environmental, and interactive aspects of patient care, this perspective aligns with and enriches current medical practices, providing a strong theoretical and empirical foundation along with a research program 
(Grasso-Cladera et al., 2022)
.
The Embodiment principle -central to the 3E perspective-underscores the critical role of (neuro)physiological states in patient health and treatment. This principle implies that the conditions of a patient's nervous system and body constitute most of their health outcomes 
(Prince et al., 2007)
.
Therefore, clinicians must have a deep understanding of the (neuro)physiological processes underlying any health conditions; considering hormonal, neural, and genetic factors. This bio/physiological perspective ensures that the physical aspects of (mental) health are not overlooked.
The Embodiment principle furthermore indicates that healthcare environments should be conducive to fostering physiological states that support healing, care, and emotional regulation. This principle prompts a critical evaluation: Are current medical practices and environments effectively promoting the physiological states essential for patient recovery and well-being?
Environmental Scaffolding in healthcare implies creating treatment spaces and patient interactions that are adaptive and responsive to individual needs. This includes designing hospitals and clinics with flexible, patient-centered environments that encourage healing and cater to the diversity of patients' experiences and needs 
(Bates, 2018)
. Cognitive and motivational scaffolding can be applied in patient education and counseling, assisting in creating a supportive therapeutic An example is the development and treatment of chronic pain, which affects 24% of the global population, significantly impacting well-being, cognitive functioning, interpersonal relationships, and daily activities 
(Flor et al., 1987;
Greenberg, 2012;
Hadi et al., 2019;
Hunfeld et al., 2001;
Jukarainen et al., 2022;
Mansfield et al., 2016;
Zimmer et al., 2022)
. It is a major concern for public health as it often leads to opioid misuse and addiction 
(Shipton et al., 2018)
. Understanding chronic pain involves examining neuropathic and nociceptive pain pathways in the brain-body complex.
Neuropathic pain relates to nervous system injury, while nociceptive pain involves broader pain perception in the peripheral nervous system 
(Aronoff, 2016)
. Markers like allodynia 18 and hyperalgesia 19 indicate pain perception dysfunction in these pathways 
(Rosenow & Henderson, 2003)
. Interestingly, chronic pain perception in the brain suggests a significant role of cognition in its management and treatment 
(Ossipov et al., 2014)
.
Exploring environmentally scaffolded cognition is not limited to analyzing factors that only support healthy cognitive patterns. In current chronic pain research, it has been shown how environmental factors can indeed be detrimental to the development of chronic pain 
(Bushnell et al., 2015)
. Social integration is essential for healthy cognition, and the social isolation that develops from chronic pain can in turn worsen the symptoms of chronic pain 
(Carr & Moffett, 2005;
Dueñas et al., 2016)
. The field of affordances, as outlined by 
Coninx & Stilwell (2021)
, describes how individuals interact with their environment 20 . This field is dynamic, changing with life experiences, environmental shifts, and personal interests, akin to a video game character navigating a changing game world. The unpredictability of chronic pain can present a brutal challenge for the individual in establishing a consistent and beneficial relationship with the environment around them 
(Coninx & 18
 Allodynia is described as the perception of pain from a previously non-painful stimulus. 
19
 Hyperalgesia is described as heightened pain perception to a previously less painful stimulus. 
20
 Coninx and colleagues 
(Coninx et al., 2023)
 describe the dynamic nature of the field of affordances using a video game analogy, in that the game character (the individual) may be more or less interested in the quest (life experiences), the game world may change (major environmental changes), and the properties/characteristics of the game world may change as well (minor environmental changes), all influencing the individuals' field of affordances.  
Stilwell, 2021)
. Chronic pain can disrupt an individual's interaction with their environment, altering their field of affordances and changing how they inhabit the world. For example, an individual may not be able to participate in an outdoor adventure with their family that was within their abilities before the onset of chronic pain. Activities once enjoyed, like outdoor adventures, may become inaccessible, affecting familial relationships and physical health. Similarly, chronic pain can lead to depression, creating a negative feedback loop where the pain is exacerbated due to the reduced ability to engage in environmentally scaffolded activities beneficial for mental and physical health 
(Holmes et al., 2013;
Landmark et al., 2011;
Romano et al., 1997)
. Environmental factors that previously supported an individual's cognition may become limited or unattainable due to chronic pain's constraints, highlighting the importance of considering environmental scaffolding in understanding and treating chronic pain 
(Coninx, 2023)
.  Thus, the 3E perspective in medical sciences proposes a revolutionary approach to healthcare -integrating the physical, environmental, and interactive facets of patient care-consistent with modern approaches 
(Amuasi et al., 2020;
Sagner et al., 2017)
. It underscores the significance of understanding patients within their environmental context and emphasizes the active role of patients in their healing journey. By integrating the principles of Embodiment, Environmental Scaffolding, and Enaction, medical science can offer more nuanced, effective, and compassionate care, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and well-being.


Conclusions
The present article has explored the transformative potential of the 3E (Embodied, Enactive, Environmentally Scaffolded) perspective to understand cognition, providing examples in both education and medical sciences. The 3E perspective -a streamlined form of the 4E perspectiveemphasizes the critical interplay between the physical body, the environment, and active engagement in cognitive processes and is suggested as a theoretical framework for applied human neuroscience.
In education, we discuss how the 3E perspective encourages innovative teaching methods that integrate physical activities, sensory experiences, and interactive learning. We emphasize how the 3E perspective underscores the importance of understanding learning as an embodied, environmentally scaffolded, and enactive process. We highlighted the necessity for classrooms and educational methods that not only cater to acquisition of knowledge or developing specific cognitive or behavioral skills, but also consider the built environment and (neuro)physiological states essential for emotional regulation and holistic learning.
In medical sciences, the 3E perspective offers a fresh lens through which to view patient care and treatment. We underline the significance of considering the (neuro)physiological states of patients and the role of the environment in their recovery and overall well-being. The 3E perspective brings the concept of environmental scaffolding in healthcare to the forefront, advocating for patient-centered care environments and treatment plans. Furthermore providing a comprehensive framework that integrates subjective experience, behavior, social interaction, and the biological F o r P e e r R e v i e w 21 underpinnings into the understanding of health and disease. The holistic approach to healthcare derived from the 3E perspective challenges traditional models by focusing on the patient's interaction with their environment and their embodied and scaffolded sense-making processes. As a concrete example, we considered the case of chronic pain management, emphasizing how an individual's interaction with their environment can significantly impact their experience of pain and recovery.
In summary, the 3E perspective presents a compelling argument for a more holistic, integrated approach to understanding and facilitating cognitive processes in -virtually-any domain of human endeavor. By adopting this perspective, practitioners, clinicians, policy makers, and professionals in several human-centered areas can develop more effective strategies and interventions that are grounded in a deep understanding of the complex interplay of meaningfully and actively engaged organisms and their environments.  Artist's representation of the 3E perspective. The organism (i.e., brain (right round panel) along with sensorimotor, psychoaffective, and social phenomena (left round network)) is at the center of the 3E perspective (human silhouette in the center of the image embedded in dynamic interactions). Organisms are embedded within environments and cognition unfolds within these dynamics (main circular shape). In the image, the organism is embedded within an abstract cityscape (bottom), which represents built, natural, and digital environments. Environments are depicted at the bottom. 
the 4E approach would only set us farther apart from our goal of generating a usable human neuroscience framework for applied sciences.

Finally, the
the
Enactive approach emphasizes the active participation of patients in their healthcare journey. This involves patient-centered care, where medical professionals design treatment plans that actively involve patients in decision-making and self-care (de Haan, 2020). The Enactive approach fosters a deeper understanding of one's health conditions and encourages the development of skills like self-management, resilience, and informed decision-making. Furthermore, focuses on the vital role of embodied and contextually embedded processes in making sense of psychiatric conditions. This is, three critical aspects of a patient's health and disease states become central for healthcare providers: personal experiences, behavioral patterns, and social dynamics. Personal experiences refers to the subjective realm of the patient, the importance of individual experiences in shaping mental health: inner thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and perceptions. When talking about behavioral patterns it is meant the patient's external manifestations, including actions, habits, and routines. It recognizes that observable behaviors are key indicators and components of psychiatric conditions. Similarly, social dynamics emphasizes the significance of the patient's interactions within their ecological niche. This includes examining their relationships, culturalbackground, and adherence to or deviations from social norms, acknowledging that these social elements play a crucial role in health and disease.
