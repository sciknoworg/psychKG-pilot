You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Between Law and Conscience: The Role of Legality in Moral Decision-Making
From ancient thinkers to modern psychological theories, morality has been profoundly influenced by philosophical, religious, and scientific thought (e.g., 
Cicero, 2016;
Harris, 2011)
.
However, the concrete legal frameworks informed by these more abstract moral musings may similarly guide people's moral views. In many ways, laws can be seen as society's attempt to codify moral principles to ensure order, justice, and well-being. Laws not only reflect moral standards but may, over time, shape moral perceptions by delineating boundaries around what is and is not acceptable. Prior work reveals that legal outcomes often mirror the prevailing moral zeitgeist to maintain public support, with many landmark Supreme Court rulings serving as examples of this alignment 
(Brace & Boyea, 2008;
McGuire & Stimson, 2004)
. These findings suggest that a legal system's legitimacy hinges, at least in part, on its congruence with prevailing moral sentiments 
(Casillas et al., 2010;
Durr et al., 2000)
. When legal decisions contradict the modal citizen's moral convictions, the legitimacy of the law can be challenged 
(Skitka et al., 2009
). According to 
Klarman (2004)
, judges "rarely hold views that deviate far from dominant public opinion" (p. 6). Consistent with this claim, changes in public opinion have been shown to influence Supreme Court rulings in both the short-and long-term, even when controlling for the impact of broadly influential social forces (e.g., the current political climate; 
Casillas et al., 2010)
. Thus, individuals' moral beliefs may not only guide legal judgments, but serve as a benchmark against which the law's legitimacy is measured.
Nevertheless, there are cases in which notable legal judgments diverge from the moral sentiments of the average citizen. For example, most Americans (57%) disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade 
(Pew Research Center, 2022a)
, with 61% of Americans stating that abortion should be legal in all or most cases immediately prior to this landmark ruling 
(Pew Research Center, 2022b)
. Regardless of public support (or lack thereof), one may wonder the extent to which legal judgments shape the personal moral beliefs of citizens.
Does the legal status of an action influence how wrong people perceive the action to be and how immoral they consider the person performing it? If so, is the influence of legality on moral judgments limited to situations where laws are legislated by democratically elected officials and intentionally broken? We report results from three experiments that offer insights into these questions.


From Morality to Legality and Back: Do Legal Judgments Shape Moral Perceptions?
Studies investigating the impact of Supreme Court decisions on public opinion have produced mixed results 
(Christenson & Glick, 2015;
Egan & Citrin, 2011;
Marshall, 1989;
Tankard & Paluck, 2017;
Unger, 2008)
. For example, 
Unger (2008)
 found that knowledge of a Supreme Court decision resulted in attitude change congruent with the Court's decision in one case and attitude change incongruent with the Court's decision in another. 
Tankard and Paluck (2017)
 revealed that the Supreme Court's stance on same-sex marriage in 2015 shaped perceptions of broader social norms in a manner consistent with the Court's ruling but did not impact individual's personal attitudes. Variability in the framing of Court decisions by media outlets provides one explanation of the inconsistent influence of Court rulings on citizen's moral attitudes 
(Clawson & Waltenburg, 2003)
 and helps explain why controlled experiments-as opposed to observational studies-more frequently find evidence of attitude change. For instance, using an experimental design, 
Bartels and Mutz (2009)
 demonstrated that participants who were informed of the Supreme Court's endorsement of a position (e.g., favoring federal laws that require affirmative action programs) reported stronger endorsement-consistent attitudes compared to those who were not shown this message.
The high-profile legal decisions of Supreme Court justices represent one way legal judgments may impact the moral beliefs of citizens. However, there are other, less explored, avenues in which legal judgments may have a notable impact on moral perceptions. For example, to the extent that people view the law as legitimate, legality may serve as a heuristic cue guiding the evaluation of morally ambiguous actions. That is, rather than engaging in cognitively taxing reflective processes 
(Stanovich, 2018)
, knowledge that an action is illegal (or legal) may be used to quickly judge that an action is immoral (or moral). This may be especially true for individuals who view respect for authority as a moral virtue 
(Graham et al., 2011)
. Accordingly, we might expect people to give different moral evaluations of the same action depending on whether it is considered legal or illegal, particularly when endorsing deference to authority as a moral good.
Consistent with the theorized impact of legal status on moral evaluations, one study found that participants viewed actions taken in the context of sacrificial dilemmas as less moral when actions were described as having significant legal consequences (i.e., a four year jail sentence) compared to when unaccompanied by such consequences 
(Barbosa & Jimenez-Leal, 2017
; see also Zeev-Wolf & Mentovich, 2021).


The Present Research
Building from previous work examining the influence of legal decisions on moral attitudes, we present three experiments examining how legal status shapes moral judgments.
Specifically, in each experiment, we presented participants with descriptions of ten morallyrelevant actions (see 
Table 1
) performed by a person in a fictitious nation where the action undertaken was said to be legal or illegal. For each described action, participants judged the wrongness of the action and the moral character of the person performing it. Thus, the present work promises to provide novel insights into how the basic legal status of an action impacts people's moral judgments of both actions and the individuals performing them.
Intentionality plays an important role in both the legal and moral domain 
(Cushman, 2008;
Hart & Honoré, 1985;
Fletcher, 1978;
Malle et al., 2014;
Young & Saxe, 2011)
. As such, in Experiment 2, we manipulated whether individuals performing illegal actions did so with or without intent, allowing us to assess the extent to which the purposeful flouting of laws-as opposed to solely an action's legal status-shape judgments of morality. Moreover, the extent to which an action's legal status serves as a useful heuristic for moral judgments ought to depend on the perceived legitimacy of the law-making process. Therefore, in Experiment 3, we manipulated whether the legal status of actions was determined by a democratic or totalitarian government, and therefore citizen involvement in the law-making process, to assess whether government type moderated the relationship between legal status and moral judgments. Finally, in each experiment, we assessed the extent to which participants viewed respect for authority as a moral good 
(Graham et al., 2011)
, allowing us to examine whether the hypothesized influence of legal status on moral evaluations depended on the extent to which participants viewed respect for authority as a moral virtue.


Transparency and Openness
For all experiments, we collected our full sample prior to data analyses and report all data exclusions, all manipulations, and all measures used. Data and analyses scripts pertaining to each experiment are available on Open Science Framework (osf.io/f54ya). Experiments 1, 2, and 3 were preregistered through Open Science Framework. These pre-registrations can be viewed via the following link (https://osf.io/f54ya/registrations). A person goes to the nation of Costaguana. During their time there, this person attends festivities and enjoys smoking a joint.

Vignettes described actions that could plausibly be deemed legal or illegal in a variety of countries. Within each experiment, we manipulated the legal status of the described actions and had participants judge the morality of actions and the individuals performing them. Note, all nations implicated in these vignettes were fictitious to avoid preconceived notions about a country and their laws.


Experiment 1


Method


Participants
For all experiments, we conducted a power analysis using G*Power 3.1.9.7 
(Faul et al., 2009)
 to guide decisions related to sample size. To detect a small effect (f = .20) with 80% power at a significance level of .05, we required a least 200 participants. Across experiments, we oversampled to account for outliers and exclusions.
A sample of 508 participants was recruited from the University of Waterloo's psychological research participant pool. Consistent with our pre-registered intent, we excluded participants (n = 231) who failed to correctly respond to a comprehension check question. 
1
 We also excluded participants (n = 46) who failed to respond to a single vignette within legal or illegal experimental blocks. Following exclusions, our final sample consisted of 228 participants (80% Female, Mage = 20.25, SDage = 3.61; 43% White/Caucasian).


Materials and Measures
We generated 10 vignettes, each of which described an individual performing a morallyrelevant action within a fictitious nation (see 
Table 1
). We referred to fictitious nations to avoid biases about existing countries and their laws. These vignettes were used across all three experiments. In Experiment 1, each vignette included a statement that described the legality of the action (e.g., "Law: Burning the national flag is [illegal/not illegal] in Angria"), constituting our manipulation of each action's legal status. For each presented vignette participants made two judgments: one regarding the morality of the action described and the other regarding the moral character of the person performing it. Specifically, participants were asked "how morally wrong is this act?" and responded on a 7-point scale that ranged from 1 (Not at all wrong) to 7 (Very wrong). Likewise, participants were asked "how would you judge this person's moral character?", responding to this question using a 7-point scale that ranged from 1 (Extremely immoral) to 7 (Extremely moral).


Moral Foundations Questionnaire
Participants completed the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ; 
Graham et al., 2011
), a thirty-item scale that measures five domains of moral reasoning: harm, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity. 2


Design and Procedure
Experiment 1 used a within-subject design whereby participants completed two experimental blocks: One presenting five vignettes describing actions that were said to be legal and another presenting five vignettes describing actions that were said to be illegal. The legal status ascribed to vignettes was randomized. The order of presentation of each block (legal first or illegal first) was counterbalanced. After providing two moral judgments (see Measures) to all ten vignettes participants concluded Experiment 1 by completing the MFQ and answering six demographic questions.


Results and Discussion
In Experiment 1, the legal status of actions shaped moral judgments (see 
Figure 1
).
Participants viewed actions as less morally wrong when they were performed in a country in which they were legal (M = 3.80, SD = 1.00) as opposed to illegal (M = 4.76, SD = 1.23), t(227) = 8.83, p < .001, d = 0.58, 95% CI [0.44, 0.72]. Furthermore, the influence of legal status was not constrained to judgments of actions, but also guided moral perceptions of the individuals performing them. That is, despite being described as performing the same act, agents were judged to possess a more favorable moral character when the action they performed was legal (M  Note. Bars illustrate the mean moral evaluations of participants for actions described as illegal (red) or not illegal (green). Judgment Type indicates whether the moral evaluation was directed at the action or the person performing it. Action judgments were reverse coded so that higher scores represent greater perceived morality across both judgment types. Dots indicate the mean moral evaluations for individual participants. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.


Respect for Authority and the Influence of Legality on Moral Evaluations
Next, we assessed whether the extent to which participants viewed respect for authority as a moral good-as measured by Moral Foundation Questionnaire items pertaining to the moral foundation Authority-determined the extent to which their moral evaluations were shaped by an action's legal status. To this end, we conducted mixed-effects models featuring legality (0 -Legal and 1 -Illegal), MFQ authority score, and their interaction as predictors, while including a random intercept for subject, allowing for individual variability in moral evaluations. These analyses revealed a legality by authority interaction for judgments of actions, β = 0.21, SE = 0.15, t = 2.34, p = .020, Marginal R 2 = .211, but not agents performing them, β = -0.09, SE = 0.10, t = -1.01, p = .313, Marginal R 2 = .062. The influence of legal status on judgments of action wrongness was stronger among participants who endorsed deference to authority as a moral good (see 
Figure 2)
. Thus, the influence of action legality may not shape the moral evaluations of all individuals equally. Rather, the results of Experiment 1 suggest that the moral evaluations of those without authority-based moral concerns are minimally influenced by an action's legal status, whereas legality plays an important role in shaping the moral evaluations of individuals who see respect for authority as a moral virtue.

Figure depicts
 the linear relationship between participants' Authority score on the MFQ and their judgments of moral wrongness for illegal (red) and legal (green) actions. Dots represent the Authority score and mean moral wrongness judgments of individual participants.


Experiment 2
Experiment 1 demonstrated that action legality influences moral evaluations. In a second experiment, we aimed to replicate and extend this finding by manipulating not only the legal status of actions but also the intent behind agents' law-breaking. Intentionality plays a significant role in legal and moral evaluations 
(Cushman, 2008;
Young and Saxe, 2011)
. For example, the distinction between murder and manslaughter is based on whether the perpetrator intended to cause severe harm. As such, in Experiment 2, we examined whether the intentions behind illegal actions affect how strongly the illegality of an act influences judgments of immorality.


Method Participants
A sample of 352 participants was recruited from the University of Waterloo's psychological research participant pool. Consistent with pre-registered exclusion criteria, we excluded data from one-hundred participants who failed to correctly respond to a comprehension check question. 
3
 We also excluded data from two participants who elected not to respond to a single vignette. Following these exclusions, our retained sample consisted of data from 250 participants (77% Female, Mage = 20.16, SDage = 3.59; 38% White/Caucasian).


Materials and Measures
The materials and measures used in Experiment 2 were identical to those used in Experiment 1 with one exception: actions that were described as illegal were now accompanied by an additional statement that described the intentionality of the individual breaking the law (e.g., "assume this person broke the law [intentionally/unintentionally]"). No such statement accompanied actions that were said to be legal in the nation they were performed.


Design and Procedure
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three between-subject conditions (Legal, Intentional, Unintentional). In the Legal condition, actions described in each vignette were accompanied by an explicit statement indicating that they were "not illegal" in the nation in which they were performed. Conversely, in both the Intentional and Unintentional conditions, all actions were said to be illegal. However, these conditions differed with regards to whether agents were described as breaking the law intentionally or unintentionally. Regardless of condition, all participants were presented with ten vignettes in a random order and, for each vignette, judged the morality of an action and the moral character of the person performing it. Participants concluded Experiment 2 by responding to the MFQ and demographic questions.


Results and Discussion
There was a main effect of condition on participants' action judgments, F(2, 247) = 30.65, p < .001, η 2 p = .199 (see 
Figure 3)
. There was likewise a main effect of condition on judgments of moral character, F(2, 247) = 15.60, p < .001, η 2 p = .112. Agents who performed an illegal action were viewed as less moral than those who performed the same action in a country where it was not illegal (M = 3.73, SD = 0.68), regardless of whether the agent breaking the law did so intentionally (M = 3.15, SD = In sum, despite the same actions being described across conditions, participants' judgments of the wrongness of actions and the moral character of those performing them were influenced by action legality and agent intentionality. Notably, highlighting the impact of legal status on moral judgments, illegal behaviors, even when performed unintentionally, led to more negative moral evaluations. Note. Bars illustrate the mean moral evaluations of participants in Legal (green), Unintentional (blue), and Intentional (red) conditions. Action judgments were reverse coded so that higher scores indicate greater perceived morality across Judgment Type. Dots represent the mean moral evaluations of individual participants. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.


Respect for Authority and the Influence of Legality on Moral Evaluations
We again examined whether participants' endorsement of respect for authority as a moral virtue interacted with experimental condition to predict moral evaluations. Regression analyses featuring condition (0 -Legal, 1 -Unintentional, and 2 -Intentional), MFQ authority score, and their interaction as predictors of moral judgment revealed a significant condition (Legal vs.
Intentional) by authority interaction for judgments of action wrongness, β = 0.33, SE = 0.17, t = 2.53, p = .012, Adjusted R 2 = .398, but not agent' moral character, β = -0.27, SE = 0.13, t = -1.79, p = .074, Adjusted R 2 = .235. Consistent with the results of Experiment 1, this interaction resulted from the influence of condition being more pronounced for participants exhibiting stronger authority-related moral concerns (see 
Figure 4)
. Thus, Experiment 2 provides further evidence that the impact of action legality on moral evaluations is strongest for individuals who view respect for authority as a moral good.


Figure 4
Condition by Authority Interaction for Experiment 2 Note. Figure depicts the linear relationship between participants' Authority score on the MFQ and their judgments of moral wrongness within Legal (green), Unintentional (blue) and Intentional (red) conditions. Dots represent the Authority score and mean moral wrongness judgments of individual participants.


Experiment 3
The results of Experiments 1 and 2 were consistent with individuals using action legality as a heuristic cue when evaluating an action's moral wrongness and a person's moral character.
However, the informativeness of an action's legal status, and consequently, its usefulness as a heuristic guide for moral evaluations, may depend on the idiosyncrasies of the law-making process. In Experiment 3, we manipulated-in addition to the legal status of actions-the law-making process responsible for determining act legality. Specifically, we manipulated whether laws were enacted by democratically elected officials or a totalitarian government. As a result, Experiment 3 allowed us to investigate whether the influence of legal status on moral evaluations was restricted to democratic nations in which citizens contribute to the law-making process.


Method Participants
A sample of 366 participants was recruited from the University of Waterloo's psychological research participant pool. As in Experiments 1 and 2, we excluded participants (n = 112) who incorrectly responded to a comprehension check question. 4 As such, our final sample consisted of data from 254 participants (81% Female, Mage = 20.64, SDage = 4.68; 46% White/Caucasian).


Materials and Measures
Instead of a statement describing the intentionality of individuals breaking the law (as in Experiment 2), all vignettes-legal and illegal-were accompanied by a statement that provided information regarding the law-making process in each nation. Specifically, participants randomly assigned to a Totalitarian condition were presented the statement "The government is totalitarian and power is inherited, such that people have no say in the laws" below each vignette. Conversely, those assigned to a Democratic condition instead were informed that "The government is democratically elected by the people it governs, giving them say over the laws."
The remaining methodology of Experiment 3 mirrored that of Experiment 1. That is, Experiment 3 featured the same ten vignettes, the same manipulation of act legality, and asked participants to make the same two moral judgments.


Design and Procedure
Experiment 3 employed a 2 (Legality: legal, illegal [within]) x 2 (Government: democratic, totalitarian [between]) mixed design. Participants were randomly assigned to either the Democratic or Totalitarian condition. Regardless of condition, all participants completed two experimental blocks: one presenting five vignettes describing legal actions and another presenting five vignettes describing illegal actions. The order of presentation of each block was counterbalanced and the legal status ascribed to each vignette was randomized. After providing two moral judgments to all ten vignettes, participants concluded Experiment 3 by responding to MFQ and demographic questions.


Results and Discussion
We examined the influence of Legality and Government on judgments of action wrongness using a 2 (Legality: legal, illegal [within]) x 2 (Government: democratic, totalitarian
[between]) mixed ANOVA (see 
Figure 5
). There was a main effect of Legality, F(1, 252) = 105.21, p < .001, η 2 p = .295. Replicating the results of Experiments 1 and 2, actions labeled as "illegal" (M = 4.64, SD = 1.26), were judged as more morally wrong than those labeled "not illegal" (M = 3.67, SD = 1.04). We did not observe a main effect of Government, F(1, 252) = 0.06, p = .803, η 2 p < .001, nor a Legality by Government interaction, F(1, 252) = 2.54, p = .113, η 2 p = .010. That is, illegal actions were seen as more morally wrong regardless if an action's legal status was determined by a democratic, t 
134
 We conducted the same set of analyses for judgments of moral character. Here, we also observed a main effect of Legality, F(1, 252) = 31.17, p < .001, η 2 p = .110. Agents who performed actions in countries where the action was "not illegal" were perceived to have a more favorable moral character (M = 3.67, SD = 0.71) than those who performed the same actions in countries where the action was illegal (M = 3.31, SD = 0.84). There was no main effect of Government, F(1, 252) = 0.14, p = .712, η 2 p = .001, nor a Legality by Government interaction, F(1, 252) = 0.26, p = .610, η 2 p = .001. Again, agents were judged as less moral when performing actions deemed illegal regardless if the legality of the action was decided by a democratic, t

. Thus, we find evidence that the legal status of actions shapes individuals' moral perceptions of both actions and people, not only in democratic countries in which elected officials decide upon laws, but also in totalitarian nations in which citizens were explicitly described as having no input in the law-making process. Note. Bars illustrate the mean moral evaluations of Legal (green) and Illegal (red) actions. Action judgments were reverse coded so that higher ratings reflected greater perceived morality across Judgment Type. Dots represent the mean moral evaluations of individual participants. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.


Respect for Authority and the Influence of Legality on Moral Evaluations
We explored whether individuals' respect for authority interacted with action legality and government type to predict moral evaluations (see 
Figure 6
). Mixed-effects models featuring Legality (0 -Legal and 1 -Illegal), Government (0 -Democratic and 1 -Totalitarian), MFQ authority score, and their interactions as predictors, as well as a random intercept for subject, did not reveal evidence of any interactions for judgments of action wrongness or moral character (all ps > .081). Therefore, unlike in Experiments 1 and 2, the impact of legal status on moral evaluations was not dependent on participants' respect for authority in Experiment 3.


Figure 6
Legality by Government by Authority Interaction for Experiment 3 Note. Figure depicts the linear relationship between participants' Authority score on the MFQ and their judgments of moral wrongness for Legal (green) and Illegal (red) actions within Totalitarian (left panel) and Democratic (right panel) conditions. Dots represent the Authority score and mean moral wrongness judgments of individual participants.


General Discussion
Does the legality of an action influence how morally wrong people perceive it to be?
Prior work reveals that citizens' moral beliefs influence the law-making process 
(Casillas et al., 2010
), yet evidence for the influence of legal judgments on moral beliefs is mixed 
(Christenson & Glick, 2015;
Marshall, 1989;
Tankard & Paluck, 2017;
Unger, 2008)
. Observational studies centered on the impact of high-profile Supreme Court decisions often fail to find evidence of decision-congruent attitude change, while experimental studies examining the impact of legality on moral judgments are relatively uncommon (although see 
Barbosa & Jimenez-Leal, 2017;
Bartels & Mutz, 2009)
. The present work sheds light on this important, yet understudied question, demonstrating the consistent influence of act legality on individuals' moral judgments.
Notably, the moral impact of act legality was observed regardless of whether agents were described as breaking the law intentionally or whether citizens were said to participate in the law-making process. Furthermore, the influence of legal status was observed in both withinsubject and between-subject designs and was not limited to individuals' judgments of actions but also extended to perceptions of agents' moral character. Taken together, these findings suggest that legal frameworks not only mirror the moral values of citizens but actively shape them. That is, across three experiments, simply labeling an action as illegal-as opposed to "not illegal"led participants to judge these actions as more wrong and view the agents performing them as less moral.
Why might legality guide moral judgments? One possibility is that, to the extent that people view the law as legitimate, the legal status of an action is viewed as providing useful information about its morality. 5 Instead of engaging in effortful reflective processes 
(Stanovich, 2018)
, people may use knowledge of act legality to inform their judgments of act morality. In this way, when asked to judge the morality of various morally ambiguous acts, labelling an act as illegal (or legal) may lead people to quickly judge that action as immoral (or moral). Of course, individuals may vary in how much they consider the legality of an action as informative of its moral wrongness. Under this account, the influence of legality on moral evaluations should depend on the extent to which individuals a) are motivated to avoid or unable to perform reflective moral reasoning and b) view an act's legal status as an appropriate heuristic cue for judging act morality.
In Experiments 1 and 2, participants with a stronger respect for authority were more influenced by an act's legality when judging its moral wrongness. Thus, consistent with the proposed account, individual differences related to the perceived legitimacy of authority figures moderated the impact of legal status on participants' moral judgments. However, this interaction was not statistically reliable in Experiment 3. Furthermore, the influence of legal status persisted when laws were said to have been enacted by a totalitarian government, a legal system that one may suspect would be viewed as less legitimate to participants and thus minimize their use of legal status as a heuristic cue informing moral judgment. Nevertheless, it is possible that participants did not view this law-making process as illegitimate, as this was not directly measured in the present experiments. Future work assessing the moral impact of act legality may benefit from measuring the perceived legitimacy of legal decisions and the extent to which participants view them as associated with act morality.


Limitations and Future Directions
The present findings demonstrate that people's moral judgments-particularly those with a strong respect for authority-are shaped by an act's legal status. While we demonstrate the robustness of this moral influence across manipulations of intentionality and government type, future studies can provide further insight into when and why legal judgments guide individuals' moral beliefs. This research is not without limitations. First, the present study exclusively recruited university students from a Canadian university. Future studies can assess whether the present findings generalize across diverse demographic groups, who may have different views shaped by their distinct legal systems, socioeconomic status, and educational backgrounds.
Second, studies wishing to assess individuals' use of legal status as a heuristic cue may wish to measure and manipulate participants' ability to engage in deliberative moral reasoning during moral judgment 
(Paxton et al., 2012;
Pennycook et al., 2014)
. Our proposed framework predicts that the influence of legality on moral judgments would be stronger when participants are required to make quick, intuitive moral decisions. Future studies could test this hypothesis.


Conclusion
Three experiments demonstrate the influence of legality on judgments of moral wrongness and perceptions of moral character. These findings suggest that laws do more than mirror the moral values of citizens-they actively shape them. Laws may not only determine which actions are punished by legal authorities but guide the extent to which people view illegal actions as morally wrong and thus, deserving of punishment. This influence is not trivial, as legal rulings on polarizing issues, whether regarding abortion, inappropriate conduct, or elite corruption, may come to shape how individuals view not only these actions but the moral standing of those who engage in them. Ultimately, these studies demonstrate the power of the law as a guiding force in moral decision-making.

Evaluations by Legal Status for Experiment 1


Consistent with the results of Experiment 1, illegal actions were judged as more morally wrong than legal actions (M = 3.65, SD = 0.83), regardless of whether the agent performing the action was said to have broken the law intentionally (M = 4.80, SD = 0.98), t(159) = 8.00, p < .001, d = 1.26, 95% CI [0.92, 1.60], or unintentionally (M = 4.31, SD = 0.97), t(166) = 4.70, p < .001, d = 0.73, 95% CI [0.41, 1.04]. Nevertheless, intentionality affected participants' judgments of wrongness. Actions were seen as more morally wrong when agents intentionally broke the law compared to when they did so unintentionally, t(169) = 3.26, p = .001, d = 0.50, 95% CI [0.19, 0.80].


0.73), t(159) = 5.15, p < .001, d = 0.81, 95% CI [0.49, 1.13], or unintentionally (M = 3.53, SD = 0.58), t(166) = 1.98, p = .049, d = 0.31, 95% CI [0.01, 0.61]. Thus, as in Experiment 1, the legal status of actions influenced how participants viewed the moral character of agent's performing them. Intentionality also played a role, such that agents described as unintentionally breaking the law were judged to be more moral than those breaking the law intentionally, t(169) = 3.79, p < .001, d = 0.58, 95% CI [0.27, 0.89].

MORALITY & LEGALITY


Note that this exclusion criterion did not change the interpretation of any significance tests. For example, legal status was shown to impact moral evaluations of both actions and people when including participants who failed a comprehension check in our analyses (both p < .001).


Given the focus on action legality, we centre our analyses on the authority domain.


This exclusion criterion did not change the interpretation of any significance tests with one exception: Agents described as unintentionally breaking the law were no longer judged as less moral than those performing the same actions in a nation where these actions were legal, t(234) = 0.84, p = .401, d = 0.11, 95% CI[-0.15, 0.36].


Note that this exclusion criterion did not change the interpretation of any significance tests.


A related possibility is that people view an action's legal status as reflective of social norms (i.e., other people's beliefs about an act's morality;
Tankard & Paluck, 2017)
. If so, individuals wanting to avoid social repercussions for endorsing widely rejected moral beliefs may choose to align their moral beliefs with prevailing legal judgments.
