You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

The Absence of Positive-Skew Bias for Non-Monetary Realized Risky Decision Outcomes
Decision making is highly important in everyday life. While monetary rewards are predominately used in research on decision making to better understand how people make choices, financial decisions only make up a subset of the important decisions individuals make on a daily basis. There are many other relevant decisions made in real life that are not centered around money.
For example, Which route should I take on my way home from work to avoid traffic? What should I order at the restaurant? Should I try this new treatment for my health problem? Moreover, for the few studies that do examine decision making for non-monetary outcomes, the outcomes are typically hypothetical and are not experienced in real-time. Thus, across two studies, we use a novel task to examine how people make a certain type of risky decision with non-monetary realized outcomes. This will allow us to better understand how individuals make risky decisions that do not specifically pertain to money using a more realistic experience of receiving consequences in the moment.
The difference between outcome domains is an important consideration given that decisions made for various types of outcomes may not reflect behaviorally consistent patterns. In one study by 
Jimura et al. (2011)
, they examined the use of liquid juice rewards versus financial rewards in a delay discounting task. While they found evidence of stable discounting rates, the discounting of delayed liquid rewards was not correlated with that of hypothetical monetary rewards, providing evidence of reward domain independence. Another study by 
Seaman et al. (2016)
 explored decision-making and various forms of discounting across three different outcome domains: money, social and health rewards. They also found differences in discounting across domains, with older adults more likely to discount temporally and probabilistically for social and health related rewards, as compared to monetary rewards. These findings were then replicated in two larger, more diverse samples tested online 
(Seaman et al., 2021)
. Further evidence of domainspecificity comes from the risk attitudes and risk perception literature, which finds stark differences within the same individuals in reported levels of risk taking for financial, ethical, social, health, and recreational decisions 
(Weber et al., 2002;
Blais & Weber, 2006)
. Thus, it appears that multiple types of decision-making processes and biases appear to be outcome-specific and individuals may not show the same pattern of responses for other types of outcomes as they do for financial ones.
Importantly, most decision-making studies also tend to use hypothetical rewards or rewards provided at the end of the study, which makes it difficult to determine how actual experience of a previous decision outcome may affect subsequent future decisions in the same study. Such findings could have serious implications when it comes to our observations of realtime learning and decision-making behaviors in research. While it is more common to see realtime realized reward outcomes in monetary outcome studies, it is very rare for this to occur for non-monetary decisions, likely due to practical limitations. Yet this is extremely relevant to better understand real world decisions that do not center around money.
An important type of risky choice that is relevant for both monetary and non-monetary outcomes are those known as skewed decisions. Skewed decisions have asymmetrical risks and outcome distributions like pairing large but unlikely outcomes with smaller but more likely outcomes. Gambles can be either positively or negatively skewed. In positively skewed gambles, there is an unlikely chance for large gains paired with a much likelier chance of a small to moderate loss (e.g., buying a lottery ticket). In contrast, in negatively skewed gambles, there is an unlikely chance for a large loss paired with a much likelier chance of a small to moderate gain (e.g., insurance providers). Prior studies have shown that both animals 
(Caraco & Chasin, 1984;
Genest et al., 2016;
Strait & Hayden, 2013)
 and humans 
(Burke & Tobler, 2011;
Seaman et al., 2017;
Wu et al., 2011)
 tend to prefer positively skewed gambles. This tendency for individuals to prefer and select positively skewed choices has been termed a 'Positive-Skew Bias.' However, research on skewness in humans thus far has exclusively focused on the use of financial outcomes. While it is not uncommon to find studies that explore alternative reward measures as a motivational factor in decision making, no human studies have specifically examined alternate rewards in the context of skewed risky decision making. In the present work, we incorporate an established skewed risky decision-making paradigm into a perceptual (i.e., visual feature search) task, where gains and losses in the decision-making task alter the visual contrast of the objects shown on the screen, thereby affecting the subjective difficulty of the perceptual task. The use of the visual search task design serves several purposes. First, this allowed us to develop a decision-making paradigm where the outcomes of the choices were not associated with primary rewards and were non-monetary in nature (i.e. changes to the visual contrasts/subjective task difficulty). Secondly, such simulated manipulations would allow us to examine the influence of the outcomes being realized in real-time, as opposed to hypothetical scenarios where participants do not necessarily experience the impact of their decisions. Lastly, the perceptual task more generally constitutes a first step toward building more ecologicallyvalid paradigms that allow us to draw parallels to other types of non-monetary decisions that may actually be experienced in the real world while continuing to maintain appropriate experimental control. This paper describes two studies. In Study 1, participants completed the non-monetary skewed decision-making task. Assuming that there is an overall preference for positively skewed gambles, as observed in monetary-based skewed decision-making studies, we predicted that participants were likely to also show a preference for positively skewed options over both symmetric and negatively skewed options in the non-monetary skewed gambling task. In Study 2, a preregistered follow-up experiment, a new sample of participants completed both the nonmonetary skewed gambling task, as well as a monetary-based skewed gambling task allowing us to directly compare Positive-Skew Bias between monetary and non-monetary outcomes.


Study 1 Method
The preregistered design and sampling plans, as well as hypotheses and analyses can be found on https://osf.io/khfbd/ 1 .


Participants
Fifty-two participants (mean age = 20.5, SD = 2.84, age range = 18 -34, 37 females, 13 males, 2 other) were recruited from the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were not color blind (0 participants excluded).
Additionally, all participants reported no history of neurological or psychiatric disease. The study was conducted in-person during 2021, following approved COVID-19 protocols to ensure the participants' safety. The study took place in a single session and lasted approximately 1.5 hours.
Participants were excluded from the analysis if no responses were recorded for at least three of the decision-making trials within the allotted time (3 participants), or if they responded with the same key or response on more than 95% of the trials (0 participants). One additional participant was removed due to a technical error leaving a final sample of 48 participants.


Materials and Procedures
All participants first completed a vision screening for normal or corrected-to-normal vision (20/30 acuity) using a distance Visual Acuity Chart (Precision Vision, 2017) and color vision using Ishihara's Design Charts for Colour Deficiency of Unlettered Persons (2020).
Participants also completed the Visual Acuity measure 
(Varma et al., 2013)
 from the NIH toolbox 
(Gershon et al., 2013)
 to further characterize visual abilities. However, this information was not analyzed and will not be discussed here further. The visual assessments were followed by brief demographic questionnaire and Cognition battery from the NIH Toolbox then the non-monetary skewed gambling task.
Cognition Battery. Participants completed the full Cognition battery 
(Weintraub et al., 2013
) from the NIH toolbox 
(Gershon et al., 2013)
. The testing was conducted using the NIH Toolbox app on an iPad. Participants' scores on each of the measures were automatically calculated and standardized in the app, which were subsequently exported for analysis. The Cognition battery assess a series of cognitive abilities which include executive functioning, working memory, episodic memory, and language abilities. It also provided a composite score of participants' fluid and crystallized intelligence, based on the participants' performance on the measures. Average scores on these measures and exploratory correlations with the decisionmaking task can be found in the supplement.
Non-Monetary Skewed Gambling Task. This novel task is comprised of two components including 1) a visual search task and 2) a risky decision-making task 
(Figure 1
).
Choices made during the risky decision-making task affected the difficulty of the subsequent visual search task trials.
Visual Search. In the visual search trials, participants were required to visually scan the screen and identify a target image amongst other presented images (distractors) that differed by shape and color. On each trial, participants were first directed to a fixation point at the top of the screen within a white outlined box (1-3 seconds). The target image would then appear in the box (1 second), followed by 24 images appearing in random locations across the screen that included both the target and 23 distractors. Participants had to find and click on the target image within a specific response period and then received feedback on the accuracy of their response (1 second).
To ensure that the task was sufficiently challenging, the allowable response period for each trial was based on a calibration phase prior to the start of the experiment. During the calibration phase, participants were asked to click on a target image that appeared on the screen for 12 trials. They were told this was to familiarize themselves with the mouse controls and to complete the task as quickly as they can. Participants were not informed of the task's true purpose to adjust the fixed display time for the subsequent visual search task trials. The display time was then computed for each participant as the mean reaction time plus 1.5 standard deviations (M(SD) Display Time = 1.16 (0.27) seconds).
Initial trials were presented at a relatively lower visual contrast level (15% opacity based on findings from Toner et al., 2012 2 ) to guarantee sufficient difficulty and therefore ensure adequate motivation to perform the subsequent risky decision-making portion of the task. It also made it so that participants who received multiple risk-taking losses did not approach 0% opacity (a blank screen) too quickly. Any visual opacity that fell to zero or below was adjusted back to 5%.


Risky Decision Making.
The risky decision-making portion of the task consisted of a two-alternative forced-choice task, where participants were provided with the option to take the risk (presented with chances of winning or losing as a pie chart) or not. The outcome of the decision made by the participants affected the visual contrast of the following visual search task trials, thereby influencing the difficulty of the task. If participants opted not to take the risk, the current opacity of the visual search task remained the same for the next set of five trials. If the risky option was selected, the opacity of the visual search task either increased (improved) or decreased (worsened), making the subsequent trials easier or harder, respectively. If the risk was accepted, the probabilities of each outcome were dependent on the type of risk presented in that gamble: symmetric, positively skewed, or negatively skewed (see 
Figure 1B)
. For symmetric gambles, the probability of improvement or decline would be equal (50%) for a moderate change in opacity (Â±5%). Positively skewed gambles had a low probability (25%) of improving the opacity of the objects greatly (+8%) paired with a high probability (75%) of worsening the opacity by a small value (-2%). Negatively skewed gambles had the opposite outcomes with a high probability (75%) to achieve small opacity improvement (+2%) and low probability (25%) of large worsening in opacity (-8%). Participants were given ten seconds to respond using the arrow keys. They were then given immediate feedback on the outcome of their decision, then completed five new trials of the visual search where the visual contrast was determined by the outcome of their decision. If participants did not make a choice within the time limit, the outcome was treated as no risk taken and no change was made to the visual contrast for the next cycle of visual search trials.
Participants completed a total of 30 cycles of the visual search and decision-making trial sequence. One cycle consisted of five visual search trials, followed by one risky decision-making trial. Each of the three risk conditions were repeated ten times, for a total of 30 decision-making trials and 150 visual search trials with a break halfway through. The spatial location of the gambles on the computer screen (top or bottom) and response key options (left or right arrow key) were counterbalanced for each trial. The task developed using PsychoPy 3 (v2021.1.4; 
Peirce et al., 2019)
. 


Data Analysis
To examine the effect of skewness on gamble acceptance rate in the non-monetary skewed decision-making task, we used a multilevel binary logistic regression where the likelihood of the participants accepting the risky option was the outcome variable and the gamble type (positive, symmetric or negative) was the predictor. We used Helmert coding for contrasts to test whether there was a significant difference between acceptance of 1) positively, compared to negatively skewed and symmetric, gambles and 2) symmetric, compared to negatively skewed, gambles. Participants were included in the multilevel model as a random effects variable.
Analyses were computed using 'lme4' package in R 
(Bates et al., 2015)
.


Results
There was a main effect of gamble type such that there was a difference in acceptance rates between the positive-skew gambles (M = .47, SD = .29), and the negative (M = .55, SD = .32) and symmetric (M = .57, SD = .31) gambles (p < .001; see 
Table 1
 for model output). However, this difference was in the opposite direction than expected such that positively skewed gambles were accepted less often compared to negatively skewed and symmetric gambles (see 
Figure 2
 for mean acceptance rate by gamble type). There was not a significant difference in likelihood of taking risk between negatively skewed and symmetric gambles 
(Table   1)
. When accounting for the outcome of the decision immediately preceding, as expected participants were less likely to accept risks if they experienced a gain just before (OR = 0.62 [0.42, 0.93], p = .021) and more likely to accept risks when they experienced a loss in the previous trial (OR = 1.59 [1.03, 2.45], p = .035). The preference for symmetric over positively skewed gambles did not change even after accounting for previous decision outcome, 
OR = 0.64 [0.44,
0.94]
, p = .023. 


Interim Discussion
In Study 1, we examined the Positive-Skew Bias for non-monetary decisions occurring in real-time. Unexpectedly, the findings showed that participants in our sample were less likely to take a risk if presented with a positively skewed option rather than symmetric or negatively skewed gambles. This contrasts with reports of an overall Positive-Skew Bias observed in other studies on reward skewness and decision making where positively skewed risks were more likely to be accepted for monetary outcomes 
(Burke & Tobler, 2011;
Seaman et al., 2017;
2018;
Wu et al., 2011)
. Therefore, in a preregistered (https://osf.io/khfbd/) follow-up experiment, we attempted to replicate this finding using the non-monetary skewed gambling task, as well as to directly compare it to a monetary version of the skewed gambling task where the outcomes are also provided in real-time.


Study 2
In Study 2, we compared the existence of the For an interaction between gamble type and domain (effect sizes taken from 
Seaman et al., 2017
 Study 2), 27 participants were found to be sufficient with power = .83 and alpha = .05 and we recruited 32 participants to account for potential exclusions. Just as in Study 1, data were excluded from analyses if the participant provided no response or responded with the same key for â‰¥ 95% of the trials but no participants were removed for this reason. Task-specific trial data was removed for three participants who chose to reject the gambles for all trials of either the monetary or non-monetary skewed decision-making tasks.


Materials and Procedures
As in Study 1, participants first completed a vision screening for normal or corrected-tonormal vision (20/30 acuity) and color vision (0 participants excluded). Unlike Study 1, in Study 2, vision screening was conducted using an Optec 5000p Vision Screener, which was acquired after the conclusion of Study 1. Participants then completed the same demographics questionnaire and NIH toolbox subcomponents (see supplement for exploratory correlations).
They also completed the exact same version of the non-monetary skewed gambling task used in Study 1. However, participants also completed an additional monetary version of the skewed gambling task. The order of the decision tasks was counterbalanced between participants.


Monetary Skewed Gambling Task
Participants completed a monetary skewed gambling task based on 
Wu et al. (2011)
. The task had a series of 30 two-alternative forced-choice trials, where participants decided whether to take the risk (presented with chances of winning or losing as a pie chart) or not. There were three gamble types: symmetric, negatively skewed, and positively skewed. Symmetric gambles had an equal probability (50%) of winning or losing a moderate sum of money ($3.05). Negatively skewed gambles had a low probability (25%) of losing a large amount of money ($5.25) and a high probability (75%) of winning a small amount of money ($1.75). Positively skewed gambles had a high probability (75%) of losing a small amount of money ($1.75) and a low probability (25%) of winning a large amount of money ($5.25). The expected value of each gamble was $0, making it equivalent to the expected value of the no gamble option (100% chance of $0 gain/loss). Participants saw 10 of each of the aforementioned gamble types for a total of 30 trials.
Subjects started with a $7.50 endowment and feedback was provided after each trial. The outcome of their decision was added to or subtracted from the running total; which was displayed after each trial. The outcome from one of the trials was pseudo-randomly selected and combined with the initial endowment to calculate final performance-based compensation. This amount was in addition to the hourly compensation.


Data Analysis
To examine the effects of outcome type and gamble type, we used a multilevel binary logistic regression where the likelihood of the participants accepting the risky option was the outcome variable and the predictors were the outcome type (monetary vs. non-monetary) and gamble type (positive, symmetric and negative), as well as the interaction between the two. We used Helmert coding for contrasts to test whether there was a significant difference between acceptance of 1) positively skewed gambles, compared to negatively skewed and symmetric gambles and 2) symmetric, compared to negatively skewed, gambles. Participants were included in the multilevel model as a random effects variable. Analyses were computed using 'lme4' package in R 
(Bates et al., 2015)
.


Results
Consistent with our predictions, there was a main effect of outcome such that there was a difference in overall acceptance rates of the gambles such that participants were more likely to accept the gambles for non-monetary (M = 0.54, SD = .33), compared to monetary (M = 0.44, SD = 0.35), outcomes (p < .001; see 
Table 2
 for full model output). There was also a main effect of gamble type such that participants were more likely to accept gambles with a positive skew overall (p = .01). Also consistent with our predictions, there was a significant outcome by gamble type interaction (p = .037), which the increased positive-skew acceptance rate was driven by increased acceptance of positively skewed monetary gambles (see 
Figure 3
 for mean acceptance rate by outcome and gamble type). However, for the non-monetary gambles, there was no preference for positively skewed gambles. Similar to Study 1, these effects did not change after accounting for previous decision outcome. In a series of exploratory analyses, we also examined the relationships between the monetary and non-monetary decisions. Overall mean acceptance rates for monetary and nonmonetary decisions were significantly related, r(27) = .48, p = .009. We also calculated skew bias scores for each individual as the difference between acceptance rates for positively, relative to negatively, skewed gambles. Skew bias scores between the monetary and non-monetary tasks were also correlated, r(27) = .44, p = .017. A complete list of exploratory analyses can be found in the supplemental materials.


General Discussion
Across two studies, we tested for the existence of the Positive-Skew Bias in risky decision making for non-monetary outcomes with real-time feedback. We did not find evidence for a Positive-Skew Bias for non-monetary outcomes occurring in real time in either Study 1 or 2. We did, however, replicate the Positive-Skew Bias seen previously for monetary skewed risky decision making. These results suggest there are differences between monetary and nonmonetary domains during skewed decision making.
In Study 1, we found that for non-monetary outcomes, participants were less, rather than more, likely to choose positively skewed gambles. Yet, when we attempted to test the reproducibility of this finding in a new sample in Study 2, we saw no evidence of any preference for positively skewed, negatively skewed, or symmetric gambles. This difference may be due to when participants in these two studies were tested. In Study 1, participants were tested in-person during the summer and fall of 2021, during a peak of COVID-19-related deaths in the area due to the dominance of the Delta variant. To participate in in-person research, additional precautions were taken including phone screenings before and after the session and temperature and health screenings at the beginning of the session. However, due to state mandates, masks were required to be optional for both experimenters and participants. Thus, the people who chose to participate in in-person research during this time may have demonstrated atypical risk behaviors, as the decision to participate was a risky decision in and of itself. Had it been tested, this may have also affected the monetary decisions as well. Furthermore, the pandemic brought about a significant amount of stress into individuals' daily lives, which could affect the way they think and behave (for a review, see 
Rosenfeld et al., 2021)
. Indeed, there is evidence that people who experience a significant crisis event are more likely to behave in a manner that would not be typical for their age group, evidenced by observed changes in motivated cognition and behavior during the Hong Kong SARS epidemic and September 11 attacks, which prime the sense of fragility of life 
(Fung & Carstensen, 2006)
. Furthermore, a review by 
Porcelli and Delgado (2017)
 suggests that acute stress can impact probabilistic decision making in a myriad of ways. Therefore, whether it was the participants who opted into the study, or the context of the pandemic overall, this very well may have impacted the results in Study 1. Future studies should continue to examine how selfselection and stress may impact decision making, including skewed decisions.  
(Burke & Tobler, 2011;
Seaman et al., 2017;
Wu et al., 2011)
 If subjective values were indeed weighted differentially between domains, this would then, in turn, influence how the skewness of a gamble influences the decision to take the risk. Further support of divergent processing of monetary and non-monetary gambles comes from the overall higher willingness in accepting risk for non-monetary gambles, regardless of skewness.
Nevertheless, in a series of exploratory analyses for Study 2, we found there were significant relationships between gamble acceptance and skew bias between the monetary and nonmonetary tasks, indicating that while there appears to be some domain-specific processing that is occurring, there may also be some domain-general tendencies within individuals.
There were also several limitations within our two studies. First, the gender distribution of both samples was heavily skewed toward female. While, to our knowledge, there are no documented gender differences in skewed decision making, it is important to replicate these findings with more representative samples in the future. Additionally, it is particularly difficult to motivate performance without incentives, which are typically in the form of monetary bonuses.
Because doing so for the visual search task would compromise the non-monetary nature of the task, we were unable to encourage high performance extrinsically. However, when we examine performance, accuracy across both studies is approximately 70%, and over the course of the 30 total trials, opacity increased, indicating that participants sought to improve the ease of performance and did so across the course of the task. This suggests there was at least some motivation to perform well on the task.
Much regarding similarities and differences between monetary and non-monetary skewed gambling remains unanswered. Using the novel task presented here provides one way in which follow-up work can begin to address some of the remaining questions. The integration of the visual search and risky decision-making tasks can be adapted for many purposes to allow for other comparisons between monetary and non-monetary outcomes, including for non-skewed, or other types of risky gambles. Additionally, while we specifically examined non-monetary decision outcomes occurring in real-time, similar versions of the task could be implemented to examine choices that are not realized. Another potential future direction would be to examine the role of attention in these decisions. Computational studies focused on the role of visual gaze and attention on decision making have found that visual attention can bias participants' choices, such that longer fixation on a given choice was also more likely to amplify its subjective value, and subsequently influence the participant's likelihood of selecting that choice 
(Krajbich et al., 2010;
Smith & Krajbich, 2019)
. Thus, it would be interesting to use process-tracing techniques (e.g., eye tracking) to investigate how people direct their attention differentially between the domains of skewed gambling. Furthermore, an age-related increase in Positive-Skew Bias has been seen for monetary outcomes 
(Seaman et al., 2017;
2018)
. Older adults make some of the most highly consequential decisions among the population, many of which involve non-monetary (e.g., health, social) domains. Therefore, it would be informative to examine whether any age-related differences in preferences exist within the skewed gambling for non-monetary outcomes occurring in real time. Using a more inclusive, adult lifespan sample would allow for age-related effects to be tested.
In conclusion, we used a novel task designed to examine skewed decision making with non-monetary outcomes occurring in real time. Across the two studies, we found no evidence of a Positive-Skew Bias for realized, non-monetary outcomes. However, we did replicate a Positive-Skew Bias for monetary outcomes. This adds to a growing body of literature calling for further research on how people make important non-monetary decisions.

, as well as evidence from our own Study 2 that shows a Positive-Skew Bias for monetary decisions.This difference in behavior seen between monetary and non-monetary domains may be related to the subjective values given to reward outcomes. It may be the case that the subjective value of these visual contrast gains and losses are differentially weighted as compared to those that are expected in a monetary outcome. As such, potential gains in non-monetary decisions may not be as heavily weighted as compared to those for purely monetary gains. Alternatively, although not mutually exclusive, the losses may be weighted even more for non-monetary losses.

The preregistration originally had an aging component with sample of older adults. However, upon completion of the data collection for younger adults, we felt it was important to follow-up on our unexpected results in a second study (Study 2) before answering questions regarding age-related differences.


Toner et al. (2012)
 found that younger adults had critical contrast levels of 12.1% opacity. At these levels, participants were able to identify a briefly presented digit on screen with approximately 80% accuracy.
