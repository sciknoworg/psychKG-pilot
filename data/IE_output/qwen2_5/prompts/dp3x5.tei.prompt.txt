You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Heuristic Decision Making Across Adulthood
Younger and older adults alike make many decisions on a daily basis. Some decisions (e.g., what to eat for breakfast, what to wear to work) are simple and require minimal effort, while others (e.g., where to invest your money, which medication to take) are more complex and tap into numerous cognitive resources. In the face of the aging population 
(Cire, 2016)
, researchers have begun to more closely examine how older adults make decisions, especially as they relate to the preservation or decline of various cognitive resources across adulthood (e.g., 
Finucane et al., 2002;
Mata et al., 2015;
Strough et al., 2011a;
Strough et al., 2020)
. Much of this work has focused on older adults' use of simpler strategies or heuristic processing in general, but less published work has examined older adults' usage of classic heuristics (e.g., anchoring, availability), which younger adults often rely on to make decisions. Here, we investigate whether there are age-related differences in the use of four classic heuristics: anchoring, availability, recognition, and representativeness.
How can the existing literature on aging and decision making inform whether there are adult age differences in classic heuristic use? In general, older adults' use of simpler decision strategies is well documented. In a meta-analysis, 
Mata and Nunes (2010)
 found that compared to younger adults, older adults search for less information before making decisions. Older adults also favor smaller sets of options 
(Reed et al., 2008;
Reed et al., 2013)
 and prefer to consider one important attribute (take-the-best) instead of several (weighted additive rule) when choosing between alternatives 
(Mata et al., 2007)
. These instances all reflect older adults' tendency to engage in satisficing behavior 
(Bruine de Bruin et al., 2016)
; they choose the option that is "good enough" for their purposes and not necessarily "the best" with respect to maximizing.
Researchers have proposed several explanations for why older adults rely on simpler strategies when making decisions. First, consistent with the theory of bounded rationality 
(Simon, 1990)
, older adults' declining fluid intelligence may leave them with fewer cognitive resources, making less-demanding strategies appealing 
(Finucane et al., 2005)
. Supporting this idea, one study found that lower fluid cognitive ability mediated older adults' poorer performance on a battery of decision making tasks (Adult Decision Making Competence (A-DMC); Bruine de 
Bruin et al., 2012)
. Subsequent studies have documented associations between specific fluid and crystalized cognitive abilities and age-related differences in decision making (for a review, see 
Strough et al., 2020)
. Second, most laboratory decision making tasks are hypothetical and the choices made are often not meaningful outside of the lab; older adults may not be motivated to expend effort on these tasks because they are less relevant to their personal goals 
(Hess et al., 2013)
. On a more positive note, older adults have more knowledge and life experience, allowing them to adaptively adjust their decision making strategies based on the context or environment 
(Queen et al., 2012;
Mata et al., 2007)
.
Here, we make a distinction between using simplified strategies due to reductions in cognitive resources and using specific heuristics because they are cognitively efficient. Broadly, a heuristic is defined as "a strategy that ignores part of the information, with the goal of making decisions more quickly, frugally, and/or accurately than more complex methods" 
(Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011, p. 454)
. Classic work has highlighted many common heuristics and detailed how they may lead to biased and systematic errors (e.g., 
Tversky & Kahneman, 1974
). Yet, more recent work contends that despite their occasional faults, heuristics can lead to more accurate inferences under uncertainty than more complicated strategies 
(Neth & Gigerenzer, 2015)
.
Heuristics have developed and are continually used because they are simple, quick, and often yield accurate answers. Some research has focused on the development of such heuristics, examining differences in heuristic use in children and adolescents as compared to college-aged adults (e.g., 
Jacobs & Potenza, 1991;
Jetter & Walker, 2020;
Guerten et al., 2015)
. In contrast, there is a dearth of research on older adults' use of many of the classic heuristics outlined by 
Tversky and Kahneman (1974)
, even though adulthood provides many opportunities for individuals to learn that heuristics offer efficient ways to make good choices. As such, we predict that many common heuristics are implemented equally across the adult lifespan.
In this study, we examined the heuristics of anchoring, availability, recognition, and representativeness. We selected these heuristics because they are well known in the literature, remain highly cited (e.g., in 2021 there were 1,142 publications that cited 
Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
, and have few to no empirical studies conducted with older adults. In the anchoring heuristic, people make estimates by starting from an initial value and adjusting to the final answer. Different starting points garner different estimates, which are biased toward the initial values (e.g., participants' estimates of the percentage of African countries in the United Nations (25% vs. 45%) differed based on the initial value they were given (10% vs. 65%); 
Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
. Availability is used when the frequency or probability of an event is judged by the ease with which an example comes to mind (e.g., incorrectly estimating there are more R words in the English language because it is easier to recall words beginning with the letter R than words with R as their third letter; 
Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
. In recognition, if one of two alternatives is recognized and the other is not, then one can infer that the recognized alternative has the higher value with respect to the criterion (e.g., incorrectly estimating that Minneapolis, MN has a higher population than Mesa, AZ because Minneapolis is the more familiar city; 
Pachur et al., 2009)
. Finally, representativeness involves evaluating the probability that something is true based on the degree to which one thing resembles another (e.g., assuming it is more likely that Steve, a shy, withdrawn man with a passion for detail, is a librarian instead of a salesman or physician; 
Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
.
For comparison purposes, we also examined the sunk cost fallacy, a bias where there are known adult age differences. People are said to be susceptible to the sunk cost fallacy when they continue a behavior or action because of their previously invested resources (i.e., time, money, effort), even if the behavior or action is no longer rewarding (e.g., continuing to watch a movie you dislike because you already paid for the ticket; 
Arkes & Blumer, 1985)
. Studies have shown that older adults, perhaps due to their decreased time horizons, greater life experience, or improved emotion regulation, are less susceptible to the sunk cost fallacy than younger adults (e.g., 
Strough et al., 2008;
Strough et al., 2014
; Bruine de Bruin, 2014).
To our knowledge, there is only one study on adult age difference in the availability heuristic 
(Maley, 2000)
, two studies on adult age differences in the recognition heuristic 
(Pachur et al., 2009)
, and no existing studies on adult age differences in either the anchoring heuristic or representativeness heuristic. None of these studies found age differences between younger and older adults, but their sample sizes were small (n = 18 per age group in 
Maley, 2000
; an average of 50 per age group in 
Pachur et al., 2009)
. Of course, there may be many unpublished studies that examine adult age differences in heuristics; studies showing null effects are much more likely to be relegated to the file drawer. Yet, null effects of aging are not uninteresting, as it is important to understand what abilities are spared with age 
(Lakens et al., 2020;
Isaacowitz, 2020)
. Null results in this case would suggest that heuristic use is preserved as one gets older.
Such results would be consistent with findings that crystallized intelligence, or the accumulated knowledge one gains about the world through socialization, experience, and education, increases and stabilizes across the lifespan 
(Craik & Bialystok, 2006)
 and contributes to the preservation and/or improvement in decision making with age 
(Samanez-Larkin & Knutson, 2015)
. However, more research is needed to corroborate this hypothesis.
In the present study, a sample of over 300 participants aged 20 to 90 completed a series of tasks to clarify potential similarities or differences in heuristic use across adulthood. Heuristic use is automatic and widespread among younger adults-even among experts (e.g., 
Brannon & Carson, 2003;
Englich et al., 2006)
-leading us to predict that older adults should be at least as likely as younger adults to rely on heuristics. Given the few existing studies that found null age effects and the lack of specific theoretical predictions for increased reliance with age, we hypothesized that we would not find any age differences across adulthood in the use of anchoring, availability, recognition, and representativeness. To preview, we found support for our hypothesis -we found no evidence for adult age differences in the use of these classic heuristics. In contrast (and consistent with previous literature), we found age differences in the sunk cost fallacy; younger adults were more susceptible to this bias than older adults.


Method
Transparency and Openness. We report how we determined our sample size and describe all manipulations and measures in the study. The de-identified data, materials, and analytic code are available on OSF (see Author's Note). Data were analyzed using JASP, version 0.16.2 (JASP Team, 2022). This study's design and analyses were not pre-registered.
Participants. Three hundred and eight participants (Mage = 54.20, SD = 18.99, range = 20-90, 166 female, 42.8% White, 29.2% African American, 28% Hispanic/Latinx) were recruited through Qualtrics Panels. We under sampled White participants and over sampled African American and Hispanic/Latinx participants in order to address historical exclusions of the latter populations in cognitive aging research and increase the generalizability of our findings. All participants were included in the analysis. Our sample size was calculated in G*Power to be able to identify small main effects of age (f 2 = .03) with 0.85 power using an α of .05. This effect size was based on previous studies that found age-related differences in the sunk cost bias (e.g., 
Bruine de Bruin et al., 2014;
Strough et al., 2008;
Strough et al., 2016)
. This study was approved by the Duke University Health System Institutional Review Board. Materials. Three to six scenarios demonstrating each heuristic were adapted from various sources (see Appendix). As these heuristics are prompted in different ways across the literature, we included three instances of anchoring, availability, representativeness, and sunk cost fallacy in order to capture a fuller range of heuristic responding. We included six instances of recognition to allow for three examples each of the disease prevalence and city population inference tasks 
(Pachur et al., 2009)
.
Anchoring Heuristic. We used scenarios listed in 
Furnham and Boo (2011)
: height of the tallest redwood tree, length of the Mississippi River, and gestation period of an African elephant.
Participants first decided whether the height, length, or gestation period were greater than or less than the given anchor and then estimated the exact measure.
Availability Heuristic. Adapted from 
Tversky and Kahneman (1973)
, we used a shortened version of the "famous names problem" that was implemented in 
Braga et al. (2015)
.
Sixteen names were given: five were famous men and one was a famous woman (e.g., David
Beckham, Britney Spears). The other ten names were taken from the 2011 census list of the most frequent U.S. names (e.g., Richard Miller, Sarah Wilson). After the names were listed in random order one by one, participants decided whether more men or women's names were presented (note: an equal number of men's and women's names were shown). We also used the letter likelihood scenario from 
Tversky and Kahneman (1974)
 for the letters R and K. Participants decided whether it was more likely that a randomly sampled English word started with the target letter or had the target letter as its third letter (the correct answer is the third letter, but it is easier to recall words that begin with the target letter).
Recognition Heuristic. We adapted the disease prevalence and city population inference tasks used in 
Pachur et al. (2009)
. Participants saw two options and chose the one they believed has higher prevalence in the U.S. (e.g., shigellosis vs. E. coli) or has the higher population (e.g., Dublin vs. Minsk), respectively. Choice of the more familiar option (i.e., E. coli or Dublin)
would indicate use of the recognition heuristic.
Representativeness Heuristic. We used the Linda problem from 
Tversky and Kahneman (1983)
, the lawyer vs. engineer base rate problem from 
Kahneman and Tversky (1973)
, and the marble problem from 
Kahneman and Tversky (1972)
. In the Linda problem, participants were given a description of Linda (e.g., bright, outspoken 31-year-old woman concerned with issues of social justice) and asked to indicate whether it is more probable that Linda is 1) a bank teller or 2) a bank teller that is active in the feminist movement. In the lawyer vs. engineer problem, participants were told that 30 engineers and 70 lawyers were interviewed by psychologists. They then received one randomly chosen description of one of the interviewees (e.g., Jack has no political interests and enjoys carpentry and math puzzles) and were asked to predict the probability (0-100%) that the man is an engineer. In the marble problem, five children are playing a game and 20 marbles are distributed randomly among them. Participants selected which of two distributions (Distribution A: 4,4,5,4,3; Distribution B: 4,4,4,4,4) was more likely to occur after several rounds of the game. In all scenarios, reliance on the representativeness heuristic means choosing the option that matches one's expectations (i.e., knowledge about the characteristics of lawyers vs. engineers) rather than focusing on the probabilities.


Sunk Cost Fallacy.
We used three scenarios adapted from Bruine de Bruin et al. 
2014
and 
Strough et al. (2014)
 and participants decided on a scale from 1 (most likely to stick with plans) to 6 (most likely to cancel plans) how willing they were to forego their plans. For example, participants read a scenario about losing interest in a project and then rated their likelihood to continue or stop working it.
Procedure. After providing informed consent, participants completed demographic information about their age, sex, education level, and ethnicity. They then completed three blocks of decision scenarios. Each block contained two recognition scenarios and one scenario tapping each of the following heuristics: sunk cost bias, availability, representativeness, and
anchoring. Presentation of each heuristic within a block was randomized and high versus low anchors were counterbalanced across participants. Finally, participants were asked seven openended response questions, including whether they looked up the answers to any questions and whether they had prior exposure to the scenarios used in the study. Then, for each of the five heuristics, participants were asked to describe what strategy they used to make their decision.
Finally, participants were compensated for their participation directly through Qualtrics.


Results
Anchoring. First, we computed independent samples t-tests on participants' estimates to confirm that the items used in the study produced anchoring effects. Anchoring occurred when participants estimated the height of the tallest redwood tree and the length of the Mississippi River. The redwood tree was estimated as shorter (M = 128, SD = 126) when participants were given a low anchor (65 feet) versus a high anchor (500 feet; M = 630, SD = 972); t(306) = -6.17, Next, we put participants' estimates on the same scale by calculating the absolute proportional difference from the anchor. That is, we computed the absolute difference between the estimate and the anchor and divided it by the anchor. For completeness, we report the age effect results for the two items that showed anchoring and the one that did not separately below.


Height of tallest redwood tree and length of Mississippi River.
To evaluate the effect of age on the use of anchoring, we computed a repeated-measures ANCOVA, with item (redwood height, Mississippi River length) as a within-subject factor and age (continuous) as a betweensubject factor. The main effect of age was non-significant, F(1, 305) = .034, p = .854, as was the age by item interaction, F(1, 305) = .000002, p = .999, ηp 2 < .001. In other words, the degree of difference between estimates and their anchors did not vary based on age. The age effect remained non-significant after controlling for sex, ethnicity, and education, F(1, 301) = .297, p = .586.


Gestation period of an African elephant.
Evaluating age effects for a single item eliminated the need for a categorical item factor, so we computed a simple linear regression.
There was a non-significant main effect of age, b = -.012, 95% CI = [-.027, .004], t = -1.48, p =
.140, which remained non-significant after controlling for sex, ethnicity, and education, b = -.008, 95% CI = [-.025, .009], t = -.951, p = .342. See 
Figure 1
 for the age effects of each anchoring item separately. Availability. A score of 1 was assigned to responses that followed the availability heuristic (i.e., selected that more men's names were presented in the list, selected first letter in a word). A score of 0 was assigned to responses that did not follow this heuristic. On average, participants chose the more available option over half of the time (M = 59%, SD = 35%). To evaluate the effect of age on the use of availability, we computed a repeated-measures ANCOVA, with item as a within-subject factor and age as a continuous between-subject factor.
We found a small item by age interaction, F(2, 612) = 3.17, p = .043, ηp 2 = .01, driven by a positive relationship between age and heuristic use in the R letter likelihood scenario, r(306) =
.
12, p = .036. However, this interaction was not robust and did not remain significant after controlling for sex, ethnicity, and education, F(2, 604) = 1.18, p = .309, ηp 2 = .004. The main effect of age was non-significant, F(1, 306) = .389, p = .533 and remained non-significant after controlling for sex, ethnicity, and education, F(1, 302) = .0006, p = .981.
Recognition. A score of 1 was assigned to responses that followed the recognition heuristic (e.g., selected Dublin-the more familiar option-even though Minsk has the higher population). A score of 0 was assigned to responses that did not follow this heuristic. On average, participants chose the more familiar option most of the time (M = 77%, SD = 19%). To evaluate the effect of age on the use of recognition, we computed a repeated-measures ANCOVA, with item as a within-subject factor and age as a continuous between-subject factor.
The main effect of age was non-significant, F(1, 306) = .434, p = .511, and there was no itemlevel interaction with age, F(1, 306) = .018, p = .894, ηp 2 < .001. The age effect remained nonsignificant after controlling for sex, ethnicity, and education, F(1, 302) = .013, p = .909.


Representativeness. The representativeness scenarios used different scales, in that the
Linda and marble problems require a binary choice and the lawyer vs. engineering problem involves generating a percentage. To put all responses on the same scale, answers of 40% and above in the lawyer vs. engineer problem were counted as heuristic responses. The correct percentage is 30% as there were 30 engineers in the sample. Technically, a response of 31% or higher suggests heuristic responding, but we chose 40% to select a value that is meaningfully different from 30%. Using a stricter cutoff (i.e., 35%) did not change the results. Across tasks, representative responses (i.e., selecting that Linda is a bank teller and feminist, selecting Marble Distribution A) were scored as 1 and non-representative responses were scored as 0. On average, participants chose the more representative option most of the time (M = 76%, SD = 24%). To evaluate the effect of age on the use of representativeness, we computed a repeated-measures ANCOVA, with item as a within-subject factor and age as a continuous between-subject factor.
The main effect of age was non-significant, F(1, 306) = .545, p = .461, and there was no itemlevel interaction with age, F(2, 612) = 2.28, p = .103, ηp 2 = .007. The age effect remained nonsignificant after controlling for sex, ethnicity, and education, F(1, 302) = .039, p = .843. indicating that the data is at least six times more representative of the null hypothesis (there are no age-related differences in heuristic use) versus the alternate hypothesis (there are age-related differences in heuristic use). See Supplemental 
Table 2
 for full results.
Sunk Cost Fallacy. Across scenarios, participants were slightly likely to cancel plans (3.73 on a scale of 1 to 6; SD = 1.16). To evaluate the effect of age on the use of the sunk cost fallacy, we computed a repeated-measures ANCOVA, with item as a within-subject factor and age as a continuous between-subject factor. There was no item-level interaction with age, F(2, 612) = 1.44, p = .238, ηp 2 = .005. However, there was a significant main effect of age, F(1, 306) = 4.55, p = .034. Simple linear regression confirmed that age significantly predicted avoidance of the sunk cost fallacy -as age increased, so did the likelihood that participants would forego their plans, b = .007, 95% CI = [.0006, .014], SE = .003, t = 2.13, p = .034. The age effect was not significant after controlling for sex, ethnicity, and education, b = .007, 95% CI = [-.0005, .014], SE = .004, t = 1.84, p = .067. However, the point estimate was identical and the confidence interval was highly overlapping with the simple age effect. This effect is similar in size to what has been reported in previous studies that found age-related differences in the sunk cost bias 
(Bruine de Bruin et al., 2014;
Strough et al., 2016)
. Simple Bayesian linear regression found evidence in favor of the alternate hypothesis (BF10 > 1), indicating that the data is relatively more representative of the alternate hypothesis (there are age-related differences in the sunk cost bias) versus the null hypothesis (there are no age-related differences in the sunk cost bias). See Supplemental 
Table 3
 for full results.  


General Discussion
In this study, we found that classic heuristic use was common across adults of all ages.
Age did not significantly impact 1) how far participants' estimates were from the anchors they were given (anchoring heuristic), 2) how often participants chose the more accessible option of a pair (availability heuristic), 3) how often participants chose the more familiar option of a pair (recognition heuristic), and 4) how often participants chose the option that most closely resembled a target description (representativeness heuristic). However, there were age-related differences in the sunk cost bias. Older adults were more likely to avoid this fallacy and chose to forego their plans more often than younger adults.
Although the age difference in the sunk cost fallacy is small, it is consistent with others in the literature. One possible explanation for age-related differences in this heuristic and not the others may be related to learning that occurs across the lifespan. The longer one lives, the more opportunities one has to learn that persistence is not always worthwhile. In fact, several studies have suggested that age-related improvements in the sunk cost bias are related to affect and experience 
(Bruine de Bruin et al., 2014;
Bruine de Bruin et al., 2007;
Bruine de Bruin et al., 2012)
. And while self-reports should be taken with caution, 78% of participants reported that they relied on life experiences while rating their likelihood to cancel plans (see Supplemental 
Table 1
). These findings are in line with research that suggests that age-related differences in certain decision making tasks may be related to age-related differences in fluid and crystalized cognitive abilities. Similar to the sunk cost fallacy, some tasks (e.g., making internally consistent probabilistic judgments of getting into a car accident vs. driving accident free) rely more on crystallized capabilities that improve with age, while other tasks (e.g., applying designated decision strategies when choosing between multiple products) rely more on fluid capabilities that decrease with age (Bruine de 
Bruin et al., 2012;
Li et al., 2013;
Del Missier et al., 2013;
Strough et al., 2011a)
. Prior researchers have speculated about the role of age-related differences in specific fluid and crystalized abilities 
(Agarwal et al., 2009)
 or cognitive and affective abilities 
(Peters et al., 2007)
 in decision making across adulthood, yet relatively few studies (e.g., 
Li et al., 2013;
Li et al., 2015)
 have directly measured multiple domains of cognitive (fluid and crystalized) or affective abilities across adulthood to confirm that they specifically account for age-related variance in choice (see review in 
Strough et al., 2020)
.
In contrast to life experience reducing susceptibility to the sunk cost fallacy, experience might preserve use of the classic heuristics because they often lead to the correct answer 
(Gigerenzer & Gaissmeier, 2011)
. Heuristics are shortcuts that reflect a common state of the world: in most cases, more populous cities are mentioned in the news, learned about in schools, and are common travel destinations. Thus, using the cue of familiarity would typically lead one to choose the correct answer. Even experts use these heuristics, although sometimes to a lesser degree. One review found that auditors tended to respond heuristically (e.g., use anchors, neglect base rates) in neutral tasks, but this behavior was mitigated in familiar and job-related tasks 
(Smith & Kida, 1991
). Yet, some experts in other domains (e.g., real estate agents, legal professionals, nurses) are still susceptible to heuristic responding even when making decisions in their area of expertise 
(Northcraft & Neale, 1987;
Englich et al., 2006;
Brannon & Carson, 2003)
. Related work in finance reveals that the use of heuristic-like rules of thumb may increase with age as investors gain more experience 
(Korniotis & Kumar, 2011)
. Together these studies highlight the pervasive nature of heuristic use even after significant domain-specific experience.
Some views contend that we use heuristics to reduce effort, especially in the face of capacity limitations (e.g., limited time, motivation; 
Shah & Oppenheimer, 2008)
. With even fewer cognitive resources, older adults might be expected to be more likely to use heuristics.
However, many of the cognitive mechanisms proposed to underlie these heuristics do not show declines with age. More specifically, accrued knowledge about the world plays a role in all of the heuristics that did not show age effects. Availability effects are linked to the ease with which information is retrieved from memory 
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
. To the extent that the task is asking people to retrieve from semantic memory, we would not expect age-related differences.
Older adults generate category examples at the same rate as younger adults 
(Light & Albertson, 1989
), so we would expect them to be similarly able to generate words starting with K or with K as its third letter. The recognition heuristic also draws on stored knowledge. People rely on a global sense of familiarity as a way of choosing their answer 
(Pachur & Hertwig, 2006)
. The relative familiarity of two diseases or cities should not differ as a function of age given the obscurity of the unfamiliar option 
(Pachur et al., 2009)
. Finally, the representativeness heuristic draws on well-learned schemas and depends on the degree of similarity between the target person/event/sample and the population from which it is drawn 
(Galavotti et al., 2021)
.
Schematic knowledge is preserved in healthy aging and is believed to be a major aid to memory when episodic details are forgotten 
(Siegel et al., 2020)
. Informally, participants reported drawing on their knowledge to solve all of these decision scenarios, especially the recognition (65%) and representativeness heuristic scenarios (66%) (see 
Supplemental Table 1
).
In contrast, it is less clear what role knowledge plays in the anchoring heuristic. Plausible anchors are more likely to sway decisions 
(Sugden et al., 2013)
, but specific expertise in a domain may reduce reliance on anchors altogether 
(Smith et al., 2013)
. In the present case, we do not have any reason to believe there are age-related differences in specific knowledge of the height and length of the tallest redwood tree or Mississippi River, respectively, thus it is not surprising that we did not find age-related differences in anchoring.
These results are unlikely to be attributable to the online nature of the study. Paralleling earlier papers showing similar results across laboratory and Amazon Mechanical Turk samples (see 
Buhrmester et al., 2018 for review)
, research is now emerging showing similar adult age effects across in-person and online samples from various data collection platforms (e.g., 
Greene & Naveh-Benjamin, 2022;
Seaman et al., 2021)
. Furthermore, we found an age difference in the sunk cost fallacy using our online sample, replicating an effect observed numerous times in the laboratory 
(Strough et al., 2008;
Strough et al., 2011b)
. More generally, older adults have been the fastest growing users of the internet for over a decade, with the gap between younger and older adults' smartphone, tablet, and internet usage steadily decreasing over time 
(Faverio, 2022)
. Thus, aging samples in online studies are likely becoming more representative of the general aging population.
Future studies should address some of our limitations. While we attempted to recruit a diverse set of participants, this sample was not nationally representative, especially in the oldestold group of 80-90 year olds, so our findings may differ when including people from other ethnic and educational backgrounds (though we note we have no specific predictions about how heuristic use might vary as a function of these factors). Additionally, Qualtrics Panels was unable to provide us with the number of invited individuals who did not participate, thus underlying differences may exist between those who participated and those who did not. This study was also cross-sectional instead of longitudinal, so age differences may reflect cohort differences instead of changes with age. However, it is not clear exactly what cohort difference might be predicted to explain these effects. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the heuristic tasks used hypothetical scenarios; it is possible that participants' responses to these scenarios do not reflect their real-world decision making. This concern is especially valid for older adults; in other domains (e.g., prospective memory), it has been shown that older adults behave differently in laboratory studies than they would in everyday life (e.g., 
Rendell & Thomson, 1999;
Henry et al., 2004)
.
Moving forward, an interesting future direction for this research would be to explore whether these results would extend to individuals with age-related diseases. To the extent that cognitive impairment is mild and semantic knowledge is intact, we would not expect there to be differences in heuristic use between healthy and clinical populations. However, if a breakdown of semantic processing does occur, as is believed to be the case in Alzheimer's Disease (AD;
Verma & Howard, 2012), then we would expect to see differences from healthy controls. AD populations may have deficits in heuristic use because they are not readily able to rely on their semantic knowledge. For example, Balthazar and colleagues found that patients with amnesiac mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) performed normally on the Boston Naming Test (BNT), a semantic assessment that asks participants to name line drawings of objects of increasing difficulty (2008). Mild AD patients performed significantly worse on the BNT, but were able to boost their performance to that of aMCI patients and healthy controls after they were given semantic (i.e., a short explanation of the picture) and phonemic (i.e., the first phonemes of the target word) cues upon making a naming error. Thus, we can speculate that people with MCI, but not AD, would use heuristics to the same degree as healthy controls. People with AD may need certain cues and nudges in order to use heuristics effectively.
Overall, we believe it is important to highlight the skills and abilities that are preserved in healthy aging. Null age effects should not automatically be relegated to the file drawer; they may reveal something significant about the preservation of certain aspects of human cognition with age 
(Lakens et al., 2020;
Isaacowitz, 2020)
. For example, the current work suggests that adaptive strategies like heuristics are used consistently throughout the adult lifespan; older adults are not more likely to use them than younger adults. These results challenge some earlier speculation that older adults might be more reliant on heuristic processing compared to their younger counterparts 
(Peters et al., 2000)
 and identify yet another preserved aspect of cognition in healthy aging. In fact, related prior research has shown that the simplifying decision strategies of older adults produce high quality decisions in everyday life 
(Mata & Nunes, 2010)
. More generally, knowledge about what is preserved across adulthood could be useful when developing tools and strategies for optimizing older adults' decision making.

• Linda is a bank teller • Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement
Base Rate Problem 
(Kahneman and Tversky, 1973)
 A panel of psychologists have interviewed and administered personality tests to 30 engineers and 70 lawyers, all successful in their respective fields. On the basis of this information, descriptions of the 30 engineers and 70 lawyers have been written. Below, you will find one of those descriptions, chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Sunk Cost Fallacy (Adapted from Bruine de Bruin et al., 
Strough et al., 2014)
 You have driven halfway to a vacation destination. Your goal is to spend time by yourself. You feel sick. You feel that you would have a much better weekend at home. You think that it is "too bad" you already drove halfway, because you would much rather spend the time at home. Please think about what you would do if you were in this situation. Would you be more likely to stick with your plans (1) or to cancel your plans (6)?
After a large meal at a restaurant, you order a big dessert with chocolate and ice cream. After a few bites, you find you are full and you would rather not eat any more of it. Would you be more likely to eat more (1) or to stop eating it (6)?
You have been working on a project related to one of your hobbies. Lately, you have lost interest in the project. Whenever you work on it, you are bored and wish that you were doing something else. You must decide what to do. Would you be more likely remain committed to the project (1) or stop working on it (6)?
p < .001, d = -.71. Similarly, the Mississippi River was estimated as shorter when participants were given a low anchor of 200 miles (M = 939, SD = 1,729) versus a high anchor of 20,000 miles (M = 15,980, SD = 35,670); t(306) = -5.29, p < .001, d = -.60. Participants did not show an anchoring effect when estimating the gestation period of an African elephant. Estimates were similar regardless of whether participants were given a low anchor (12 months; M = 23.7, SD = 45.1) or high anchor (32 months; M = 25.2, SD = 12.1); t(306) = -.388, p = .698, d = -.044.


Figure 1 .

The absolute proportional difference between participants' estimates and the anchors they were given for height of the tallest redwood tree (left), length of the Mississippi River (middle), and gestation period of an African elephant (right) did not differ across age groups. The top row includes all data points. The bottom row shows that the pattern of results is unchanged even after matching the ranges for absolute proportional difference by removing extreme values. In all plots, zero indicates estimates that were equal to the anchors provided.Plots depict simple regression lines with 95% confidence intervals (gray bands) and correlations (r) between age and anchoring use; analyses controlling for covariates are reported in the text.

To assess the relative evidence in support of the null or alternative hypotheses, we conducted simple Bayesian linear regressions. Age was included as a predictor of anchoring, availability, recognition, and representativeness heuristic use. Consistent with our frequentist results, we found moderate evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (BF01 > 6),
