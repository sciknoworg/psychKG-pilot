You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Main Text Introduction
Outside of the psychology laboratory, value-based decisions are rarely made in private. Friends go shopping together. Families often decide together about budgeting, saving, or investing, etc. in matters such as where to go for holiday or what school to put the children in. Similarly, teams in organizations collaborate to choose clients and projects, balancing risks, potential rewards, and shared goals, while considering their shared values and long-term visions. Despite the ubiquitously interactive nature of value-based decision in human experience, almost nothing is known about the role of face-to-face interactions in value-based decision. Overwhelming majority of studies of value-based decisions focus on individuals making private decisions, leaving a gap in understanding how social interactions dynamics influence value-driven choices. Here we ask how humans make joint value-based decisions in face-to-face, interactive context.
There are, of course, studies that have looked at how value-based decisions are informed by social information from others through advice 
(1,
2)
, imitation (3), emulation (4), observational learning 
(5)
, exposure to large scale collectives 
(6)
 and many other variations of social information. However, these studies have not incorporated any interactive, face-to-face element in them. Instead, and often driven by concerns such as limitations in measurement precision, need for experimental control, and practical convenience, these previous studies presented the social information on the computer screen using symbols and pictures attributed to others while the participants decided privately. Thus, there is a glaring blindspot in our theoretical and empirical understanding of collective, naturalistic value-based decision making in humans.
This blind post is important because direct social interaction has emergent consequences that constrain the human mind and behaviour in ways that cannot be spontaneously inferred from studying isolated individuals making private decisions. The mere presence of others influences arousal and attention 
(7,

. Being observed can trigger concerns for self-presentation 
(9)
 and reputation management 
(10)
 requiring accountability 
(11)
 and justification 
(12)
. Under observation, adults (13) -but not adolescents 
(14)
-become more risk-averse. Going beyond mere presence, Bahrami et al 
(15)
 showed that people put more effort into their private decisions when they know that -down the line -they will have to discuss their choice with an interaction partner. Mahmoodi and colleagues 
(16)
 research on equality bias in joint decision making suggested that individuals conform to egalitarian social norms even when such norms lead to suboptimal joint outcomes. When talking to their decision partner, people adjust their own confidence and reliance on others prioritising equality and reciprocity over choice accuracy and monetary benefit 
(16)
. Thus, the impact of direct, face-to-face context on value-based decision making is unknown and very likely to be different from what has been captured by previous studies of social value learning

Explore-Exploit dilemma: from individual to social
A key challenge in value-based decision-making is the balancing of exploration and exploitation. In this fundamental trade-off, individuals must decide whether to stick with known, rewarding options (exploitation) or seek out new possibilities that might yield better outcomes (exploration) 
(22)
(23)
(24)
(25)
. In recent years this phenomenon has been described in situations ranging from economics to human development (e.g. adolescents forming social connections) 
(26)
 to performing arts such as improvisational dance 
(27)
, and across multiple time-scales 
(23)
. Recent studies have allowed drawing parallels with non-human animals, both in natural habitat (searching for food, mate choice or competition) 
(28,
29)
 and in laboratory settings with neurophysiological recordings 
(30)
. This extensive previous literature has investigated this balance in isolated decision-making. However, as we saw earlier, interactive, face-to-face contexts introduce their own dynamics and additional complexity.
Deciding together may change risk attitudes 
(31)
, information sharing 
(32)
, or other biases such as loss aversion 
(33)
 and anticipated regret 
(31,
34)
. Even within the extensive research cited above on non-interactive social influences in value-based decisions, little is known about how people navigate the exploration-exploitation trade-off in social context let alone in real-time interactions. Therefore we investigated exploratory behavior in interactive decision-making, asking how pairs of collaborating human participants shift their joint balance between seeking novel options and relying on known values.
Recent developments 
(35)
 in the empirical study of exploration and exploitation have identified an important confound: one might favour an option with higher observed payout, acquiring more information about that option, and making it less likely to explore the other (unexplored and therefore more informative) option. This problem has been addressed by new paradigms that distinguish between systematic, directed exploration for information on one hand and random variability in reward seeking on the other. While exploring, an agent might be inclined to prioritize gaining more information about the less well known choice options, thus incorporating an "information bonus" in their valuation of options 
(36,
37)
. This is called directed exploration. Conversely, exploration can also involve undirected random stochasticity allowing for the accidental discovery of unexpected opportunities at the expense of increased frequency of mistakes.
These directed and random explorations have been studied extensively using the Horizon Task (35) c.f. 
Figure 1
. Horizon task is a game for studying value learning under uncertainty. In a given round of this game, the participant is repeatedly exposed to the choice between two slot machines (red and blue, 
Figure 1
). Their aim is to maximize their collected points from the outcomes that are played out. The first four trials of each round are "forced-choice," where one or the other machine is selected for the participant and the outcomes are revealed to them. After forced-choice trials, it is the participant's turn (i.e., "free choice") to try their chances with proceeding choice(s). Participants make either one free choice ("short horizon" in 
Figure 1
) or six ("long horizon") consecutive free choices. The choices and corresponding outcomes are serially displayed on the screen.
The forced-choice trials enable the experimenter to manipulate the amount of information participants have about each option. In the "equal information" condition, each machine is played twice, giving the participant equal information about them. Since the expected value of the two options can be exactly calculated in this condition, choosing the less valuable option here indicates random exploration. In the "unequal information" condition, one machine is played three times and the other only once. Consequently, the participant has more information about the more frequently played machine. If the participant selects the other, more informative machine, this choice is taken as direct exploration. Using this paradigm, neurophysiological properties of directed and random 
(38,
39)
 exploration have been characterized. Connections have also been made between exploration and discounting 
(25)
, impulsivity 
(40)
, anxiety 
(41)
, and schizophrenia 
(42)
. Most recently, this task was used to test the cognitive capacities of large language models 
(43)
.


Current Study
Here, we set out to first replicate the previously established findings under the individual condition in the Horizon Task. We predicted greater decision noise-choosing lower-value options more frequently-at the beginning of the long (vs short) horizon. In the long horizon condition, this decision noise should decline as participants accumulate information across their consecutive choices, shifting from initial exploration to later exploitation. Finally, we anticipated evidence for more directed exploration under the long horizon by observing a tendency for choosing the more informative option, i.e., the one that participants have less information about.
Going beyond individual behaviour, we predicted that dyads can achieve a collective performance that surpasses the average of their constituent individuals' earnings. This prediction is based on previous demonstrations that groups can improve over their individuals in choice accuracy in various domains including perception 
(44)
(45)
(46)
(47)
(48)
, numerical cognition 
(15)
, and even medical diagnosis 
(49)
. Moreover, previous studies in interactive reasoning using the Wason selection task suggest that groups who exchange arguments towards solving a logical problem outperform those that interact via simple bargaining 
(50)
. Our experimental paradigm permits testing the suggestion that face-to-face interaction may enable groups to converge on closer to optimal value-based decisions that exceed the individual performance.
The horizon task allowed us to investigate not only whether groups outperform individuals but also identify the mechanisms that may be driving such collective advantage. Because the task distinguishes between directed and random exploration, we could examine how joint decisionmaking shapes directed and random exploratory choices. We hypothesized that joint decisionmaking would reduce random variability in exploratory choices. This prediction aligns with Condorcet's Jury Theorem (51, 52) and extensive empirical findings 
(53)
(54)
(55)
(56)
(57)
 showing that aggregating of many independent, fallible error-prone judgments can generate collective opinions with higher precision by canceling out the random error inherent in individual opinions. Accordingly, we predicted that in both short and long horizon conditions, dyads would display lower decision noise (conversely, higher precision) than individuals, reflecting reduced random exploration and more efficient exploitation of the available information.
Moreover, by quantifying directed exploration, the horizon task enabled us to compare information seeking under individual and joint conditions. Previous works on Informational herding 
(58,
59)
 have shown repeatedly that when individuals have access to observing the actions or choices of others, they tend to imitate others rather than doing their own private information search. Uncertainty exaggerates informational herding (60) by strengthening the presumption that others must have access to some better or more accurate information. Similarly, studies using the hidden profile paradigm (32) have consistently shown that groups tend to focus on shared information at the expense of unshared (unique) information, leading to suboptimal collective decisions. When making decisions, groups tend to discuss and repeat information that all members already know rather than integrating novel, unshared pieces of information held by individual members. Unshared information is often ignored even when it is crucial for identifying the best option. biased deliberation 
(61)
 suggests that group setup may not be ideal for encouraging information search.
These findings are unsettling because there are theoretical 
(62)
 and empirical 
(5,
(63)
(64)
(65)
(66)
 findings that have shown that diversity of opinions enhances collective intelligence. After all, information seeking is a clear (if not the clearest) way to diversity of opinion. This raises the question why the evidence has so consistently pointed to groups being so unwilling to seek information. Indeed, more recent theoretical 
(67)
 and empirical 
(68,
69)
 studies have suggested that members of a group are more likely to imitate one another when they are incentivised individually (i.e., every man for himself). These studies have shown that informational herding is reduced and diversity increases when members of a group are paid equally and proportional to the group's overall performance. In the experiments reported here, dyadic payoffs were collectively determined. Putting these contradictory pieces of evidence together, we cautiouslyand with considerable uncertaintypredicted that our dyads may demonstrate more directed exploration compared to when they undertake the same horizon task individually.
To summarize, we set out to investigate how face-to-face social interaction influences valuebased decision-making, particularly in balancing exploration and exploitation. In a "discovery plus pre-registered replication", we employed the horizon task (35) in a cross-over design 
(Figure 1
) to compare individual and joint decision-making and tested whether dyads and individuals demonstrate different exploration strategies.


Results
The key behavioral hallmarks of random and directed exploration under the Individual condition were replicated in both the discovery and the replication studies. Having established our setup's consistency with previous works, we focus on our main research question starting with are two heads better than one? in value based decision-making under uncertainty. Accuracy -defined as the proportion of trials in which agents (be it individual or dyad) selected the slot machine with the higher mean payout-was consistently higher ( 
Figure 2
) under dyadic (versus individual) condition both in the discovery as well as the replication experiments.
In the short horizon, individuals' mean accuracy did not significantly differ from those of the dyads' 
(Figure 2
, Discovery: , t(8) = -1.74, p = 0.12; Replication: t(16) = -1.50, p = 0.15). In the long horizon, a repeated-measures 2-way ANOVA showed a significant main effect of choice sequence (Discovery: F(1, 8) = 3631.50, p < .001, ηp2 = .998. Replication: F(1,16) = 19,299.00, p<.001, ηp2=.999) and a main of social condition (Discovery: F(1, 8) = 4.50, two-tailed p = .067, ηp2 = .360. Replication: F(1,16)=4.17, one-tailed p =.029, ηp2=.207). Throughout the results, we report two-tailed p-values for the discovery and one-tailed p-values for the same (which are, by definition, directional) tests in the replication datasets. A marginally significant interaction was observed between social condition and choice sequence in the Discovery experiment (F(1, 8) = 4.35, p = .071, ηp2 = .352) which was then confirmed more strongly in the Replication experiment (F(1,16)=5.13, one-tailed p=.019, ηp2 = 0.24).
Post-hoc pairwise comparisons showed that the accuracy difference between individual accuracy and dyad accuracy was most pronounced for the later choices in the sequence i.e., 4, 5, and 6. (all p< 0.05) whereas no significant differences were found between individuals and dyads in the first 3 choices (p > 0.05). A similar trend to these early choices under long horizon was observed in the single choice under short horizon: individuals' mean accuracy were lower than that of dyads, but the difference only approached statistical significance (Discovery: individual M = 0.83, SD = 0.03, dyad M = 0.86, SD = 0.04, t(8) = -1.74, two-tailed p = 0.12. Replication: individual M = 0.82, SD = 0.05, dyad M = 0.85, SD = 0.04), t(16) = -1.50, one-tailed p = 0.07). Having demonstrated the superior accuracy of dyadic value-based decisions, we then moved forward to examine the potential mechanism(s) underlying this collective advantage over individuals. We first compared the overall level of exploration in dyads vs individuals. In the horizon task, the difference between choice accuracy in the short horizon and in the first trial of the long horizon constitutes a measure of overall exploration 
(Figure 3
). This is because when making the first (or only) choice, the participant has the same amount of information about the expected value of their options' returns and should therefore be able to make equally accurate decisions under long and short horizons. However, in the long horizon they can also afford to explore the (momentarily) less desirable option in the hope of finding good information that could be exploited later in trials 2-6. The data showed that overall exploration was somewhat, but not very strongly, reduced under dyadic (vs individual) condition (Discovery: t(8)=-2-23, twotailed p=0.06; Replication: t(16)=0.44, one-tailed p= 0.33). These results suggested that dyads might have engaged less frequently in exploration compared to their constituent individuals. However, they do not tell us exactly what type of exploration this difference might arise from. Next, we pushed forward to disentangle the specific computational characteristics of exploration in face-to-face interactive decision-making. In the horizon task, the agent's vulnerability to round-to-round variability i.e., random exploration, is captured by how often they choose the lower-value machine in equal information (see Methods) rounds. To quantify this variability, focusing on the first trial of each run, we computed the probability of choosing the option on the right-hand side of the screen as a function of the difference in means of the samples observed on the previous four, forced-choice trials. The slope of the rising segment of the resulting sigmoid-shaped empirical choice curves 
(Figure 3 middle inset)
 gives us an estimate of the participant's precision, with higher values indicating less random exploration.
The data 
(Figure 3)
 were much more clear here, showing significantly larger choice precision i.e., less random exploration for dyads compared to individuals (Discovery: F(1, 32) = 22.63, p = 0.000, ηp2=0.41; Replication: F(1, 64) = 34.82, p = 0.000, ηp2=0.35). Consistent with previous studies 
(Wilson et al. 2014)
, there was also a significant main effect of horizon length in the Discovery experiment (F(1, 32) = 4.41, p = 0.044, ηp2=0.12) and a similar, albeit less pronounced effect in the Replication (F(1, 64) = 2.25, one-tailed p = 0.069, ηp2=0.03). The interaction between social context and horizon length was not significant in either experiment (p>0.4 in both cases). Post-hoc comparisons showed that dyads showed less random exploration than individuals for both the short (Discovery: t(16) = -3.00, p = 0.009; Replication: t(32) = -5.48, p = 0.000), and the long horizon (Discovery: t(16) = -3.70, p = 0.002; Replication: t(32) = -3.31, p = 0.002). We then examined directed exploration. To measure the tendency to prioritize gaining more information about the less well known choice options over accumulating immediate reward, we focused on the unequal information condition in the horizon task. These are the first trials in which the first four forced choices in the round have revealed one option three times and the other option only once. The more informative option here is the less sampled bandit, about which the agent knows less. We compared the rate of choosing the more informative bandit in the unequal information rounds. Under individuals vs dyadic choices in the short vs long horizon separately in the Discovery and Replication datasets.
As expected, we found a main effect of horizon length on directed exploration 
(Figure 4;
 repeated measures ANOVA, Discovery: F(1, 32) = 4.95, p = 0.033, ηp2=0.13, Replication: F(1, 64) = 5.27, one tailed p = 0.013, ηp2=0.08). Directed exploration rate was higher in the long (Discovery: M = 0.61, SD = 0.14; Replication: M = 0.57, SD = 0.15) versus short horizon (Discovery: M=0.51, SD =0.11; Replication: M=0.50, SD =0.09). Critical for our purpose here, neither the social context (Discovery: F(1, 32) = 0.80, p = 0.378, Replication: F(1, 64) = 0.13, p = 0.723) nor the interaction (Discovery: F(1, 32) = 0.00, p = 0.961, Replication: F(1, 64) = 0.31, p = 0.582)) between social context and horizon length showed any significant effect in the Discovery nor Replication datasets. Given that each participant took two sessions to complete the experiment, one could imagine that improvements in performance could also have been the result of gaining more experience with the Horizon task. We therefore wanted to know whether and how the effects of practice with the task and collective context affected the overall performance. Since this question was not originally a part of our pre-registration, in the interest of transparency, we treated this question as an exploratory analysis, and put together the data from the discovery and replication experiments. Following a previous similar study 
(15)
 and given the nature of our cross-over design, we employed a mixed two-way ANOVA with time (session 1, 2) as withinsubject and order of the conditions (i.e., whether participating first individually and then collectively or vice versa) as between-subject factors. Separate ANOVAs are reported for the Short and Long Horizons.
In 
Figure 6A
 we have schematically illustrated three main hypotheses: main effect of practice ( 
Figure 6A left panel)
, main effect of social interaction (middle panel) and an interaction between the two factors. Across the horizons, we found a significant main effect of time ( 
Figure 6B
; Short Horizon: F(1, 24) = 24.624, p = 0.000, η² = 0.444; 
Figure 6C
, Long Horizon: F(1, 24) = 44.947, p = 0.000, η² = 0.512) indicating that performance significantly increased from first to second block. Main effect of order was not significant (Short Horizon: F(1, 24) = 0.001, p = 0.978, η² = 0.000; Long Horizon: F(1, 24) = 2.092, p = 0.161, η² = 0.000). In both horizon, there was a significant interaction between time and order (Short Horizon: F(1, 24) = 6.813, p = 0.015, η² = 0.123; Long Horizon: F(1, 24) = 18.792, p = 0.000, η² = 0.214). Post-hoc comparisons (see 
Supplementary Tables S1-4
 for details) showed that participants who took the task individually first did worse as individuals but produced much better collective performance later. The collective benefit was more pronounced when comparing between groups vs individuals in the second session as well. Conversely, participants who started together did not achieve much collective benefit 
(Supplementary Tables S5-8)
. These results clearly demonstrate that the impact of practice and joint-decision making add up with one another. 


Discussion
We set out to investigate how joint decision-making influences value-based choices, particularly in balancing exploration and exploitation. While prior research has explored individual decisionmaking in uncertain environments, the role of direct, face-to-face interaction in shaping collective value-based decisions remains unclear. Using the Horizon Task, we compared individual and dyadic decision-making, testing whether collaboration enhances choice precision and alters exploration strategies. Our findings revealed that dyads outperformed individuals in maximizing rewards, demonstrating greater decision accuracy, particularly in later trials of longhorizon conditions. This advantage was primarily driven by a reduction in random, value-free exploration, while directed exploration-actively seeking informative options-remained comparable across individual and social conditions. These results suggest that joint decisionmaking fosters more efficient value-based choices by mitigating randomness rather than fundamentally altering strategic information search.
Our finding that dyads outperformed individuals in value-based decision-making aligns with the broader popular maxim that "two heads are better than one," yet it differs in key ways from similar effects observed in perceptual decision-making. In perceptual tasks, joint decisions benefit from confidence-weighted integration, where individuals combine noisy sensory evidence and calibrate their reliance on each other accordingly 
(44,
45,
48)
. However, in our value-based task, there was no sensory uncertainty-the available stimuli were clearly displayed, and participants had ample time to consider their choices. This minimizes the role of confidence aggregation as a mechanism for collective advantage in the current paradigm. This distinction could point to a fundamental difference in how joint decisions improve across domains: while perceptual tasks rely on combining uncertain evidence, value-based choices may benefit more from a shared resistance to erratic, value-free exploration. Dyads may function as a self-correcting system, discouraging erratic choices. Future research should explore whether similar stabilizing effects of social interaction extend to other types of valuebased decisions, particularly those involving risk and long-term planning.
Our results showed that both groups and individuals engaged in a similar level of directed exploration. Participants-whether alone or in pairs-demonstrated greater information seeking in the long-horizon condition, where they had the opportunity to explore more before committing to exploitation. Contrary to some prior findings suggesting that social interactions can either enhance 
(58)
 or suppress (32) information search, our study found no significant difference between individuals and dyads in this respect. This aligns with the studies showing that groups focus on shared information at the expense of novel insights 
(70)
, but contradicts the ones suggesting that collective deliberation fosters deeper exploration 
(58)
. A key limitation of our paradigm is that under the dyadic condition, it could not clearly distinguish between individual and joint payoffs-a factor that previous research 
(67,
68,
71)
 has identified as crucial in shaping diversity in information search in social context. These previous studies suggested that when individuals are rewarded separately, they tend to imitate others, whereas collective incentives encourage broader exploration. Future studies that explicitly manipulate payoff structures under collective decision-making could help understand whether joint decisionmaking inherently constrains or enhances directed exploration.
Our finding that dyads exhibited lower random exploration compared to individuals aligns with prior research linking random exploration to impulsivity. Dubois et al. 
(40)
 found that individuals with higher impulsivity scores engaged in greater random exploration, suggesting that a lack of controlled decision-making leads to erratic choices. One may then take the reduction of random exploration in dyads in our experiment to indicate that social deliberation may discourage impulsivity. Inspired by Dubois et al., we did measure individual impulsivity using the Barrat Impulsivity scale (BIS-11) (72) but found no clear evidence for correlation between impulsivity and random exploration in the individual condition. This negative result renders our findings moot regarding the possible impact of deliberation on impulsivity. Future studies should further investigate whether the presence of a partner mitigates the effects of impulsivity on exploratory behavior.
It is important to clarify here the distinction that sets our study apart from those investigating the role of social information in exploration and exploitation 
(73,
74)
. That extensive literature focuses on understanding how agents integrate social informationsuch as observing other agents' choices 
(3,
4,
17)
, or receiving advice from them 
(1,
75)
 etc.with non-social information that the agents themselves accumulated through direct interaction with the environment. These studies constitute a large spectrum of different fields, methodologies and target audiencesspanning human and animal behaviour, ecology 
(28)
, organisational psychology 
(76)
 and computational modelling (77)they share one important feature that distinguishes them from our study. Invariably, these studies permit the agent to choose to follow the social information or overrule it and go their own, separate way. Our study, however, examined value-based decisions that are made through face-to-face deliberation and mutual consensus, such as when family members decide their next holiday destination over dinner. This universally ubiquitous situation in our everyday life experience is not captured by any of the social learning and foraging studies mentioned above.
To conclude, our findings highlight the stabilizing effects of face-to-face interaction in valuebased decisions, particularly in reducing random exploration and promoting choice efficiency. However, many questions remain about how social dynamics shape real-world decision-making. Future research should further explore interactive, naturalistic settings to uncover the mechanisms driving collective value-based choices and their broader implications.


Materials & Methods
Two studies, one discovery (18 participants; 9 dyads, Mean age = 24.44 years, SD = 2.33) and the other, a pre-registered (https://osf.io/qu42r/) replication (34 participants; 17 dyads, Mean age = 25.15 years, SD = 5.86) were conducted on volunteer healthy adults. We used the Horizon Task (Wilson et al., 2014), a multi-armed bandit paradigm that examines decisionmaking under uncertainty. Participants were presented with two virtual slot machines and were required to maximize rewards by choosing between them. Each round of task ( 
Figure 1
) contained: (1) Four forced-choice trials: participants observed the choice made for them, revealing the reward value of the chosen machine. (2) Free-choice trial(s): Participants could freely select between the two machines, with round length varying ○ Short-horizon rounds: 1 free choice (5 trials total). ○ Long-horizon rounds: 6 free choices (10 trials total).
The reward structure followed a Gaussian distribution (SD = 8 points), with one machine offering a higher mean payout (40 or 60 points). The mean difference between machines varied systematically 
(4,
8,
12,
16,
20
, or 30 points, randomised across rounds). Additionally, information availability was manipulated during the forced-choice phase, giving rise to two difference situations on trial 5 of each round:
• Equal information rounds: Each machine was sampled twice (2:2 distribution).
• Unequal information rounds: One machine was sampled three times and the other only once (3:1 distribution). Participants completed 160 rounds under each of two conditions. In the Individual condition participants made choices independently, and in the Collective condition, they were paired into dyads jointly discussing and reaching a consensus before making a choice. Condition order was counterbalanced across dyads. The two conditions took place within a single session. During the individual condition, participants sat opposite each other but worked independently on separate laptops. Interaction was not permitted, and participants were monitored to ensure compliance. In the collective condition, dyads worked on the same laptop, deliberating verbally. Separate microphones attached to each participant recorded their discussions, and all communication was conducted in English. Participants received 20 Euros compensation for their participation.
