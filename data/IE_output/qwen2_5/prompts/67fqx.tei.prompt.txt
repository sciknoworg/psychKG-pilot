You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1â€“3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD
The Symbiosis of Narcissistic Leaders and Low Self-Esteem Followers:


Dominance Complementarity in Childhood
Around the world, narcissistic leaders are on the rise 
(Sedikides & Campbell, 2017)
. Although much is known about the harmful effects of narcissistic leaders 
(Chen, 2010;
O'Boyle et al., 2012;
O'Reilly et al., 2021;
Tokarev et al., 2017)
, little is known about the interplay between narcissistic leaders and their followers. Are there individuals who thrive under narcissistic leaders? And do narcissistic leaders benefit from leading them? According to dominance-complementarity theory 
(Grijalva & Harms, 2014)
, the dominance and confidence of narcissistic leaders may provide a good match with the submissiveness and insecurity of followers with low self-esteem, for both parties.
We theorize that this may be observable in childhood, when narcissism first develops and children start forming leader-follower relationships 
(Brummelman et al., 2021;
Tackett et al., 2022)
. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a large observational-experimental test in children. We combined self-reports, informant reports, and observer-coded behaviors to provide a rigorous test of our hypotheses. Observing such dynamics already in childhood would suggest that they are fundamental to human social interaction.


Narcissistic Leaders
Narcissism is an everyday personality trait characterized by a sense of being more important and deserving than others 
(Brummelman et al., 2016;
Krizan & Herlache, 2018)
. Narcissism is not a personality disorder but a continuous personality trait, with individuals ranging from lower to higher levels 
(Back & Morf, 2018)
. We focus on grandiose narcissism (hereafter: narcissism), which is characterized by agentic tendencies, such as self-confidence and a sense of superiority, as well as by antagonistic tendencies, such as arrogance and disdain for others 
(Back et al., 2013;
Crowe et al., 2019;
Miller et al., 2017)
. Due to their need for power and status 
(Grapsas et al., 2020;
Mahadevan & Jordan, 2022;
Zeigler-Hill et al., 2019)
, individuals with high levels of narcissism (i.e., narcissistic individuals) are eager to obtain leadership positions in groups 
(Zitek & Jordan, 2016)
. Others may select narcissistic individuals into leadership positions because several narcissistic characteristics-DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD 5 such as dominance, confidence, and extraversion-match onto people's implicit leadership schemas 
(Lord et al., 1984)
. Unsurprisingly, then, narcissistic individuals tend to emerge as leaders in groups 
(Brunell et al., 2008;
Grijalva et al., 2015;
, already in childhood 
(Brummelman et al., 2021)
.
How do narcissistic leaders influence their followers? Research in adults has revealed that narcissistic leaders have both bright and dark sides (e.g., 
Braun, 2017;
Fatfouta, 2019;
Grapsas et al., 2020;
Rosenthal & Pittinsky, 2006;
Sedikides & Campbell, 2017)
. On their bright side, narcissistic leaders are charming and assertive 
(Goncalo et al., 2010;
Leckelt et al., 2015)
, expound charismatic vision 
(Galvin et al., 2010;
Nevicka, Van Vianen, et al., 2018)
, inspire innovation 
(Gerstner et al., 2013)
, and make followers feel more secure in times of turmoil 
(Nevicka et al., 2013)
. On their dark side, narcissistic leaders often show unethical behavior 
(Blair et al., 2017;
O'Reilly et al., 2018;
Watts et al., 2013)
, reduce collaboration and integrity in groups 
(O'Reilly et al., 2021)
, disregard advice of experts 
(Kausel et al., 2015)
, respond aggressively to criticism 
(Kjaervik & Bushman, 2021)
, and stifle employee voice 
(Huang et al., 2020)
. Unfortunately, to date, little is known about the conditions under which narcissistic leaders show their bright or dark sides.


Leader-Follower Compatibility in Groups
Scholars have called for research on contexts that bring out the different sides of leader narcissism 
(Braun, 2017;
Campbell et al., 2011;
Fatfouta, 2019)
. We theorize that an important factor is leader-follower compatibility 
(Grijalva & Harms, 2014)
. According to dominance-complementarity theory 
(Carson, 1969;
Grijalva & Harms, 2014;
Kiesler, 1983)
, matching the dominance and assertiveness of one interaction partner with submissiveness and compliance of another will result in greater harmony, reduced friction, more optimal leader-follower interactions, and higher leadership effectiveness 
(Grant et al., 2011;
Grijalva & Harms, 2014;
Hu & Judge, 2017)
. We propose that low trait self-esteem is a well-compatible follower characteristic for narcissistic leaders.
Followers with low self-esteem may perceive narcissistic leaders positively, because these leaders complement their insecurity, submissiveness, and need for acceptance. Narcissistic leaders may DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD behave more positively when leading followers with low self-esteem, because these followers complement their self-confidence, dominance, and need for admiration.


Through the Eyes of Followers
How do followers with low self-esteem feel when they have a narcissistic leader? Individuals with low self-esteem feel unsatisfied with themselves 
(Brummelman et al., 2016;
Leary & Baumeister, 2000;
Orth & Robins, 2014)
. They often have a history of rejection 
(Leary & Baumeister, 2000)
, so it is not surprising that they tend to be shy, lonely, and socially anxious 
(Karababa, 2022;
Leary & Kowalski, 1993;
Orth et al., 2008)
, while exhibiting a strong need for social acceptance 
(Harter et al., 1996;
Leary, 2005;
Rudich et al., 2007)
. They also tend to be self-protective in an attempt to stave off social rejection; for example, they often avoid the limelight, behave submissively, and eagerly conform to others 
(Josephs et al., 1992;
Leary, 2005)
. Consequently, they may look toward their leaders for approval, validation, and belonging, and they may be particularly drawn to narcissistic individuals, who can offer them guidance, security, a sense of community, and belonging through their charismatic collective vision 
(Den Hartog et al., 2007;
Padilla et al., 2007;
Rogoza & Fatfouta, 2020;
Schoel et al., 2011;
Thoroughgood et al., 2012)
. Consequently, narcissistic leaders may enable individuals with low self-esteem to establish a shared identity with the group (e.g., 
Scheepers & Ellemers, 2019)
. Indeed, when their need for social acceptance is satisfied, individuals with low self-esteem are expected to feel better, experience more inclusion and group cohesion, and even behave more positively toward others 
(Buckley et al., 2004;
Friedkin, 2004;
Leary, 2005;
Schutte et al., 2002)
. Hence, when followers with low self-esteem have narcissistic leaders, they may not only perceive these leaders as more effective but also experience greater wellbeing, perceive more group cohesion, and show more positive social behavior.


Through the Eyes of Leaders
How do narcissistic leaders behave when their followers have low self-esteem? Narcissistic leaders can behave in antagonistically-they may be aggressive, hostile, and derogating toward their followers-especially when they feel threatened 
(Grapsas et al., 2020;
Kjaervik & Bushman, 2021)
.


DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD 7
Followers with low self-esteem are unlikely to activate these rivalrous tendencies, because they typically behave submissively, compliantly, and agreeably. Rather than threatening the narcissistic leaders' position, they may follow the narcissistic leader's directions and let them take center stage.
As a result, when leading followers with low self-esteem, narcissistic leaders may behave in less antagonistic ways, showing less direct aggression (i.e., verbal bullying, overt aggressive behavior) and less indirect aggression (i.e., social exclusion; 
Wyckoff & Kirkpatrick, 2016)
. Also, as narcissistic leaders feel secure of their low self-esteem followers' respect, they may behave less arrogantly, as the arrogance mainly serves to secure others' respect and to uphold one's grandiose image 
(Horvath & Morf, 2010;
Morf & Rhodewalt, 2001
). Thus, when leading followers with low self-esteem, more narcissistic leaders may show less antagonistic and less arrogant behavior.


Leaders and Followers in Childhood
We studied leader-follower compatibility in childhood. Children already become aware of social hierarchies in infancy 
(Thomsen et al., 2011)
. As they develop, children proceed to form expectations about the asymmetrical organization of relationships 
(Hawley, 2015)
, become more sensitive to markers of social rank, and form schemas about which characteristics constitute leadership 
(Heck et al., 2022)
. Unsurprisingly, then, leadership commences in childhood 
(Day et al., 2014;
Escobar Vega et al., 2024;
Eva et al., 2021;
Guerin et al., 2011;
Z. Liu et al., 2019
Z. Liu et al., , 2021
Murphy & Johnson, 2011)
. In late childhood and early adolescence, children spend most of their free time at school in groups of three or more peers 
(Coplan et al., 2015)
, which makes leadership skills increasingly relevant. Collaborative tasks enable children to adopt leader and follower roles 
(Sun et al., 2017)
. Children who emerge as leaders tend to lead subsequent tasks, while others assume the role of followers 
(Li et al., 2007)
. Thus, childhood is a critical and sensitive developmental period to study leader-follower relationships. Research in childhood may also help inform interventions when leadership identity is still malleable 
(Tackett et al., 2022)
, with the aim of improving leadership across the lifespan 
(Day et al., 2014;
Z. Liu et al., 2021;
Murphy & Johnson, 2011)
.
Around the time leader-follower relationships emerge, individual differences in narcissism DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD and self-esteem tend to crystallize 
(Thomaes & Brummelman, 2016)
. Narcissism and self-esteem can be measured reliably from age 7, when children acquire two critical abilities. First, children become able to make global self-evaluations (e.g., "I'm a worthy person" 
;
Harter, 1988)
. Younger children tend to evaluate themselves within specific domains, and they rarely spontaneously aggregate across these domain-specific self-evaluations to evaluate their overall worth. Second, children make social comparisons in the service of self-evaluation (e.g., "I'm better than others"; 
Lapan & Boseovski, 2017)
. Younger children can make social comparisons, but they often evaluate themselves unrealistically positively, even when they perceive others as better than them. Once narcissism and self-esteem have emerged, they tend to remain relatively stable over time 
(De Clercq et al., 2017;
Trzesniewski et al., 2003)
. Like their adult counterparts, narcissistic children see themselves as great leaders and tend to emerge as leaders in their classrooms 
(Brummelman et al., 2021)
, while children with low self-esteem tend to be more withdrawn and submissive 
(Harter, 2015)
. By focusing on the symbiosis between leader narcissism and follower self-esteem, we highlight the importance of children's personality traits for life outcomes 
(Soto & Tackett, 2015)
.


Theoretical Contributions
Our work bridges insights from social, organizational, personality, and developmental psychology to understand leader-follower dynamics in childhood, thereby making critical contributions. First, by studying the interdependence of leaders and followers (rather than studying them as isolated actors), we demonstrate the potential functionality of a seemingly harmful leadership trait-narcissism-for followers with low self-esteem. Second, this study extends the applicability of dominance-complementarity theory 
(Carson, 1969;
Grijalva & Harms, 2014;
Kiesler, 1983)
 to childhood, and thereby demonstrates the importance of examining social dynamics and group processes in childhood using theories from social and organizational psychology. Third, we respond to calls for studying earlier stages in the developmental trajectory of leadership, which are pivotal for the development of leadership 
(Escobar Vega et al., 2024;
Tackett et al., 2022)
. We focus on ages 7-14, a critical phase when collaboration becomes increasingly important and children DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD 9 develop fine-grained communicative skills 
(Liu et al., 2021;
Murphy & Johnson, 2011)
.


Study Overview
Our experimental-observational study provides the first empirical test of the complementarity of leader narcissism and follower self-esteem in children. We recruited a large sample of children (N = 332) ages 7-14. Our study combines self-reports, informant reports, and observer-coded behaviors to provide a rigorous test of our hypotheses. We measured children's narcissism and self-esteem levels. We then randomly assigned them to three-person groups. In these groups, children performed a collaborative task where one child was randomly assigned as leader, who was in charge of the group discussion and decision, and the other two children were assigned the role of followers. Afterwards, we measured the followers' evaluations of the leader (i.e., perceived leader effectiveness and future leader preference), followers' well-being (i.e., state self-esteem, state positive affect, and perceived inclusion), and followers' perceived group cohesion.
Based on video recordings of the collaborative task, we coded the leaders' and followers' behavior.
We coded the extent to which followers and leaders excluded others during the task, as well as the extent to which leaders displayed aggression and arrogance. We tested two sets of hypotheses:
First, we examined how leader-follower combability affects followers. We hypothesized that followers with low (vs. high) self-esteem would perceive more narcissistic leaders as more effective and preferred leaders (Hypothesis 1a), experience higher well-being under more narcissistic leaders (Hypothesis 1b), feel more group cohesion under more narcissistic leaders (Hypothesis 1c), and engage in less antagonistic behavior under more narcissistic leaders (Hypothesis 1d). Second, we examined how leader-follower combability affects leaders. We hypothesized that, when leading followers with low (vs. high) self-esteem, more narcissistic leaders would show less antagonistic behaviors (Hypothesis 2a) and show less arrogant behavior (Hypothesis 2b).


Method


Transparency and Openness
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD and all measures in the study. The study was not preregistered. All de-identified data, research materials and measures (including the full study protocol) and analysis code are available on OSF at https://osf.io/2ts5u/?view_only=c2b509e43513496383edd16390432485.


Participants
Participants were 332 children (46.4% boys; 96.4% born in the Netherlands), ages 7 to 14 (M = 11.58 years, SD = 1.98), recruited from elementary and secondary schools in The Netherlands for the Childhood Leadership Study. We approached schools in socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods throughout the Netherlands. We collected data between February 2017 and May 2017. We recruited as many participants as possible throughout the semester, aiming for at least 300 children. We did not inspect or analyze the data before terminating data collection, so our decision to terminate data collection could not have been influenced by our results. We did not preregister the study design or hypotheses. The Ethics Review Board [masked] approved the present study. Children received parental consent and provided their own assent prior to participation.


Procedure
All participants were randomly assigned to a three-person group. In each group, one child was randomly selected as leader. From the original 332 participants, 11 children did not participate in the experimental session. There were 107 groups in total, totaling 321 children (45.8% boys;
96.6% of Dutch origin; mean age of 11.58 years, SD = 1.98). Our sample size exceeded the power recommendations for multi-level modelling, with more than 50 level-2 (i.e., group-level) observations 
(Kachanoff et al., 2020;
Maas & Hox, 2005)
.
Participants first completed narcissism and self-esteem personality questionnaires in their classrooms. One child did not complete the narcissism questionnaire. Several days later (M = 3.00 days, SD = 2.49), children were randomly assigned, within their classrooms, to three-person groups and participated in a group-decision making task in a separate room. We used a hidden-profile task which we developed and piloted extensively for use with children (for a complete overview of the pilot and task materials, see DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD 11 https://osf.io/2ts5u/?view_only=c2b509e43513496383edd16390432485). This is a three-person collaborative task in which information is distributed among group members so that the optimal decision remains hidden unless group members exchange information. The task was to select the best police officer from 3 candidates. Each child received a profile of each candidate. Unbeknownst to them, children received different information in the profiles. Only by exchanging information could children identify the best candidate. Such tasks have been successfully used in children 
(Gummerum et al., 2014)
. In each group, one child was randomly assigned to be the leader. The other two children were followers. The leader sat at the head of the table. All group members were told that it was the leader's responsibility to guide the discussion and make the final group decision.


Measures
All self-report items were rated along a 4-point scale (0 = not at all true, 3 = completely true).
This study was part of a larger study that also included measures that were not relevant to our research questions (for a complete overview of materials and measures, see OSF link).


Personality Traits
Leader Narcissism. Children completed the 10-item Childhood Narcissism Scale 
(Thomaes et al., 2008)
, a well-validated method for assessing childhood narcissism as a unified and continuous personality trait 
(Thomaes & Brummelman, 2016)
. Example items include: "I think it is important to stand out" and "Kids like me deserve something extra". The scale has been validated extensively in prior research, demonstrating good test-retest reliability, as well as convergent, discriminant (e.g.,
showing weak correlations with self-esteem), concurrent, and predictive validity (e.g., predicting peer group popularity and bullying over time; 
Poorthuis et al., 2021;
Reijntjes et al., 2016;
Thomaes et al., 2008)
. Responses were averaged across items for leaders, with higher scores indicating higher levels of narcissism (Î± = .83).
Follower Self-Esteem. Children completed the 10-item Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale 
(Rosenberg, 1965
; e.g., "I am satisfied with myself as a person"), a well-validated unidimensional scale widely used to measure global self-esteem in children on a continuum 
(Krauss et al., 2020;
Lei DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD et al., 2020;
Thomaes et al., 2008
Thomaes et al., , 2010
. Responses were averaged across items for followers, with higher scores indicated higher levels self-esteem (Î± = .85).


Leadership Evaluations
Perceived Leader Effectiveness. After the group task, followers assessed the perceived effectiveness of their leader with a 4-item measure 
(De Hoogh et al., 2005)
. Items were simplified for use with children (e.g., "The leader performed well as a leader"; Î± = .87).
Future Leader Preference. After the group task, followers rated their future leader preference with 3 items based on the leadership emergence scale 
(Smith & Foti, 1998)
. Items were simplified for use with children. Followers were asked: "Imagine that you will do another group task in the future. Who would you prefer to have as a leader? Write down person A, B, and C". In line with previous studies , we counted the number of times that the leader (person A) was ranked as number one by their followers. Scores could range from 1 (none of the followers would prefer the leader) to 3 (both followers would prefer the leader). A higher score indicates a higher preference for someone as a leader in the future.


Follower Well-Being
State Self-Esteem. Followers reported on their state self-esteem with 3 items from the State Self-Esteem Scale 
(Thomaes et al., 2010
; e.g., "I feel satisfied with myself"). They completed this measure after role assignment (Î± = .83) and after the group task (Î± = .84).


State Positive Affect. Followers reported on their positive state affect with 3 items from the
Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children 
(Laurent et al., 1999
; e.g., "I feel happy"). They completed this measure after role assignment (Î± = .89) and after the group task (Î± = .88).
Perceived Inclusion. After the group task, followers reported on the extent to which they felt included by their leader with 3 items from The Children's Rejection Sensitivity Scale 
(Downey et al., 1998
; e.g., "During the group task, I felt like the leader ignored me"), which were reverse coded so that higher scores indicated higher inclusion (Î± = .62).


Follower Perceptions of the Group


DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD 13
Perceived Group Cohesion. After the group task, followers reported on the perceived group cohesion with 3 items from the Group Cohesiveness Scale 
(O'Reilly et al., 1989;
Seashore, 1954)
.
Items were simplified for use with children (e.g., "We got along well with one another"; Î± = .85).


Follower Behavior
Exclusion of Others. Two observers independently coded the frequency of exclusion behaviors displayed by all group members from video recordings of the group task. Exclusion involved words or actions used to exclude a group member from the task or the group interaction (e.g., "You are not allowed to say anything"). The observers were provided with a coding protocol and were trained by the first and fourth author. To establish inter-rater reliability, the observers first coded the same 20% of the groups. Inter-rater reliability and agreement were sufficiently high 
(LeBreton & Senter, 2008)
, ICC(A,1) > .78, p < .001, so the main observer continued to code the remaining 80%. Ratings of the main observer were used to measure followers' exclusion of others.


Leader Behavior
Aggression. Aggression of each group member was coded by four trained observers based on The MÃ¼nster Behavior Coding-System 
(GrÃ¼nberg et al., 2018;
M-BeCoSy)
. Aggression was coded every 30 seconds by rating the extent to which group members showed signs of aggression (e.g., exhibiting an angry and aggressive facial expression or speaking in an irritated and dismissive manner; 0 = none, 3 = very much). Each observer coded 25% of the videos. To establish interrater reliability, for each set of videos rated by one main observer, 22% was coded by another observer.
The intra-class correlation coefficient for this rating was sufficiently high 
(LeBreton & Senter, 2008)
, ICC(A,1) = .72, p < .001. Ratings of the main observer were aggregated across all time periods for leader aggression.
Perceived Leader Verbal Bullying. Followers reported on the perceived verbal bullying by their leader with 2 items adapted from the Verbal Bullying Scale 
(Olweus, 1996;
Wang et al., 2009;
 e.g., "The leader teased me in a mean way"; Î± = .85).


Exclusion of followers.
Leaders' exclusion of followers was coded in the same way as for the DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD followers' exclusion of others.
Arrogance. Arrogance of each group member was coded by four trained observers based on the M-BeCoSy 
(GrÃ¼nberg et al., 2018)
. Arrogance was coded every 30 seconds by rating the extent to which group members showed signs of arrogance (e.g., talking to other group members in a patronizing way or showing off to other group members; 0 = none, 3 = very much). The intra-class correlation coefficient for this rating was sufficiently high 
(LeBreton & Senter, 2008)
, ICC(A,1) = .71, p < .001. Ratings of the main observer were aggregated across all time periods for leader arrogance.


Data analysis
Followers (Level 1) were nested within leaders (Level 2), so we tested our hypotheses with multilevel linear models, using the linear mixed model in SPSS (Version 25) with Maximum Restricted Maximum Likelihood estimation (REML), allowing intercepts to vary. As we were interested in the between-group effects, we included the followers' self-esteem group mean as well as the interaction between leader narcissism and follower self-esteem group mean, while controlling for the withingroup effects of individual self-esteem and the cross-level interaction 
(Hofmann & Gavin, 1998)
.
Hypotheses with leader behaviors as outcomes were at the group level (Level 2), and as such were tested with multiple regression analysis. We used grand-mean centering for the predictor and moderator variables because our focus was on the group members' relative standing with respect to those of other groups rather than the individual's standing with respect to their fellow group members 
(Aguinis et al., 2013)
. To control for the within-group effects and cross-level interaction, we group-mean centered follower self-esteem.


Results


Table S1
(see Supplemental Materials for all tables and figures) presents means, standard deviations, and correlations among variables. Significant interactions were followed by simple slopes analysis, testing effects of leader narcissism at lower (-1SD) and higher (+1SD) levels of follower selfesteem.


Leadership Evaluations


DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD 15
There was a significant interaction between leader narcissism and follower self-esteem on leader effectiveness and future leader preference (Table S2, 
Figure S1
). Among followers with lower self-esteem, leader narcissism was positively related to perceived leader effectiveness, B = 0.32, SE = 0.15, t(102.51) = 2.17, p = .032, 95%CI [0.028,0.616], r = .21, and future leader preference, B = 0.34, SE = 0.17, t(100.95) = 2.00, p = .048, 95%CI [0.003,0.683], r = .20. Among followers with higher selfesteem, these associations were not significant, ts ï‚£ -1.36, ps ï‚³ .176. Thus, followers with low selfesteem perceived leaders with higher narcissism as more effective and more strongly preferred them as future leaders, supporting Hypothesis 1a.


Follower Well-Being
We examined follower well-being in three steps. First, there was no significant interaction between leader narcissism and follower self-esteem on follower post-task state self-esteem, controlling for pre-task state self-esteem (Table S3, 
Figure S2
). Yet, exploratory simple slopes analysis showed that, among followers with lower self-esteem, leader narcissism was positively related to follower state self-esteem, B = 0.16, SE = 0.08, t(101.32) = 2.00, p = .048, 95%CI
[0.002,0.321], r = .20. Second, there was a significant interaction between leader narcissism and follower self-esteem on follower post-task state positive affect, controlling for pre-task state positive affect (Table S3, 
Figure S2
). Among followers with lower self-esteem, leader narcissism was positively related to followers' positive affect, B = 0.24, SE = 0.09, t(207) = 2.00, p = .007, 95%CI
[0.059,0.431], r = .19. Third, there was a significant interaction between leader narcissism and follower self-esteem on perceived inclusion (Table S4, 
Figure S2
). Among followers with lower selfesteem, leader narcissism was positively related to perceived inclusion, B = 0.32, SE = 0.12, t(103) = 2.78, p = .006, 95%CI [0.093,0.556], r = .26. Among followers with higher self-esteem, these associations were not significant, ts ï‚£ -1.68, ps ï‚³ .095. Thus, followers with low self-esteem experienced greater well-being under leaders with higher narcissism, supporting H1b.


Follower Perception of the Group
There was a significant interaction between leader narcissism and follower self-esteem on DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD perceived group cohesion (Table S4, 
Figure S3
). Among followers with lower self-esteem, leader narcissism was positively related to perceived group cohesion, albeit marginally, B = 0.20, SE = 0.11, t(103) = 1.79, p = .076, 95%CI 
[-0.021,0.419]
, r = .17. Among followers with higher self-esteem, this association was not significant, t(103) = -1.59, p = .114. This tentatively suggests that followers with low self-esteem experienced more group cohesion under leaders with higher narcissism, supporting H1c.


Follower Behavior
There was a significant interaction between leader narcissism and follower self-esteem on followers' exclusion of others (Table S5, 
Figure S4
). Among followers with lower self-esteem, leader narcissism was negatively related to followers' exclusion of others, B = -0.27, SE = 0.13, t(103) = -2.03, p = .045, 95%CI 
[-0.534,-0.006]
, r = .20. Among followers with higher self-esteem, this association was not significant, t(103) = 1.36, p = .177. Thus, followers with low self-esteem showed less exclusion behavior towards others under leaders with higher narcissism, supporting H1d.


Leader Behavior
There were significant interactions between leader narcissism and follower self-esteem on leader aggression, perceived leader verbal bullying, and leader exclusion of followers 
(Tables S6-7
 [-0.951,-0.146], r = .26. Among followers with higher self-esteem, these associations were not significant, ts ï‚£ 1.12, ps ï‚³ .264. Thus, among followers with low self-esteem, leaders with higher narcissism behaved less antagonistically, supporting H2a.
The interaction between leader narcissism and follower self-esteem on leader arrogance was not significant (Table S7, 
Figure S6
). Yet, exploratory simple slope analysis showed that among followers with lower self-esteem, leader narcissism was negatively related to leader arrogance, DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD 17 albeit marginally, B = -0.07, SE = 0.04, t(103) = -1.75, p = .083, 95%CI 
[-0.146,0
.009], r = .17. Among followers with high self-esteem, this association was not significant, t(103) = 0.78, p = .436. This tentatively suggests that among followers with low self-esteem, leaders with higher narcissism showed less arrogance, supporting H2b.


Discussion
Narcissistic individuals tend to emerge as leaders 
(Grijalva et al., 2015)
 and may thus become central and influential figures in social groups, already in childhood 
(Brummelman et al., 2021)
. It is pivotal to examine how narcissistic leaders affect their followers, and how their followers affect them. Our observational-experimental study, which combined detailed behavioral observations with self-reports and informant reports, enabled us to examine these leader-follower dynamics in childhood. Our findings provide converging evidence for leader-follower compatibility.
First, followers with low self-esteem benefited from having narcissistic leaders. If their leaders had higher narcissism, followers with low self-esteem perceived these leaders as more effective, endorsed them more strongly for future leadership roles, perceived more group cohesion, felt more included by them, experienced less bullying from them, and felt better about themselves. Second, narcissistic leaders benefited from having followers with low self-esteem. If their followers had lower self-esteem, narcissistic leaders showed less aggression and social exclusion toward their followers. In line with dominance-complementarity theory, the match between narcissistic leaders' dominance and their followers' submissiveness meant that both parties experienced the interaction as more comfortable and harmonious 
(Grijalva & Harms, 2014)
. Our findings reveal an earlyemerging symbiosis between narcissistic leaders and low self-esteem followers in groups.


Theoretical Implications
Our research demonstrates that childhood is a critical period to study leader-follower dynamics. To our knowledge, such dynamics have been studied exclusively in adulthood. This is unfortunate because leader-follower roles already emerge in childhood . We contribute to theories on leadership identity development (DeRue & Ashford, 2010), which posit that leadership identity is DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD formed when children claim and are granted leadership positions. Prior work has shown narcissistic children tend to claim leadership positions 
(Brummelman et al., 2021)
. We extend this work by showing that leadership is also being granted to narcissistic children by followers with low selfesteem, who acknowledge them as effective leaders and show a preference for them as future leaders. Over time, these processes of claiming and granting leadership positions may mutually reinforce each other, leading narcissistic children to see themselves as leaders.
Our research demonstrates leader-follower compatibility in childhood. This has implications for multiple theories in personality, social, and organizational psychology. Our findings are consistent with person-environment fit research 
(Denissen et al., 2018;
Kristof-Brown et al., 2005)
, showing that a good match between individuals and their environments-including team membersgenerate positive consequences for the individual. We extend this work by showing that these benefits extend beyond the individual to the group as a whole. Also, our findings align with uncertainty identity theory 
(Hogg, 2007
(Hogg, , 2021
, which holds that individuals are motivated to reduce uncertainty about who they are, in order to feel more certain about their place in the world. To do so, they may endorse more dominant or even autocratic leaders 
(Hogg, 2021)
. We extend this work by showing that this process applies especially to children with low self-esteem, who show support for narcissistic leaders and endorse them as leaders, perhaps as means of reducing their own insecurities. This concurs with research showing that people perceive overconfident and dominant individuals as competent, granting them power and status 
(Anderson et al., 2012;
Anderson & Kilduff, 2009)
. Accordingly, the allure of narcissistic leaders for children with low self-esteem may stem from the reassurance these children find in the leaders' apparent competence.
Our research contributes to our understanding of the bright and dark sides of narcissism in groups (e.g., 
Braun, 2017;
Fatfouta, 2019;
Grapsas et al., 2020;
Rosenthal & Pittinsky, 2006;
Sedikides & Campbell, 2017)
. Our findings indicate that low self-esteem individuals thrive under narcissistic leaders; to them, narcissistic leadership does seem to have an apparent "bright side" despite the fact that narcissism sits under the umbrella of dark triad personalities including Machiavellianism and psychopathy, which are considered antithetical to effective leadership 
(Braun, 2017;
Fatfouta, 2019)
. Moreover, our findings suggest that, in some cases, group functioning can be enhanced by improving leader-follower compatibility, rather than targeting leaders or follower individually, particularly because leadership is a bidirectional collaborative process 
(DeRue & Ashford, 2010;
Reicher et al., 2005)
. For example, when creating teams, one can consider the selfesteem and narcissism levels of the members. When low self-esteem individuals accumulate positive social experiences under narcissistic leaders, they may come to see themselves more positively and improve their functioning in social contexts 
(Hosogi et al., 2012;
Orth & Robins, 2014)
. Conversely, when narcissistic leaders accumulate positive social experiences with low self-esteem followers, they may develop a more functional leader identity, curbing their self-protective antagonistic behaviors and engaging their "bright side." Future work should test these possibilities.
One might expect that the very personality features that prompt low self-esteem individuals to follow narcissistic leaders-their insecurity, submissiveness, and compliance-make them more vulnerable to narcissistic leaders' potential toxic effects 
(Grijalva & Harms, 2014;
Padilla et al., 2007;
Thoroughgood et al., 2012)
. Research with adults in an organizational context showed that followers with lower self-esteem experienced more abusive leadership under a narcissistic leader . However, this may be less of an issue in children, as prior research suggests that the more toxic aspects of narcissistic leadership seem to be tempered in childhood 
(Brummelman et al., 2021)
. One reason for this could be the absence of a conducive environment in enabling destructive or toxic leadership 
(Grijalva & Harms, 2014;
Padilla et al., 2007)
. Specifically, the power differential between children (even for those children in a leadership position such as team captains) is smaller than between organizational leaders and their subordinates. The power and authority of organizational leaders is more formalized and more encompassing. Indeed, in children, leadership functions tend to be more widely shared among group members, even if the formal leader is dominant 
(Li et al., 2007)
. Given that power can amplify socially toxic components of narcissism 
(Mead et al., 2018)
, the lower power distance among children may prevent narcissistic children in DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD positions of power from manifesting their potentially toxic behaviors.
Our findings reveal a symbiosis between narcissistic leaders and low self-esteem followers.
We borrowed the term symbiosis from psychoanalysis and biology, referring to "a close functional association of two organisms to their mutual advantage" 
(Mahler, 1967, p. 740
). Yet, it is important to consider the possibility that these advantages are limited to one-shot or short-term group interactions. When low self-esteem followers work with a narcissistic leader over extended periods of time, they may develop codependency: low self-esteem followers may enable the narcissistic leader to become increasingly dominant, whereas the narcissistic leader may enable low self-esteem followers to become increasingly submissive. As such, dominance complementarity may lead to symbiotic relationships that enable unsafe leader-follower interactions (e.g., where followers lose power to exchange information or influence group decisions; 
Nevicka, Ten Velden, et al., 2011)
. This aligns with research showing that narcissistic individuals are initially well-liked but show more and more antagonistic behavior over time 
(Back et al., 2010;
Leckelt et al., 2015;
Ong et al., 2016)
.


Constraints on Generality
Because we conducted an ecologically valid experiment with behavioral observations in a sample of children from public schools, we believe our findings are generalizable to school children aged 7-14. However, one important constraint on generality is culture. We conducted our research in the Netherlands, a prototypically individualistic country. Although narcissism tends to be higher in individualistic than collectivistic cultures, it appears to predict leadership emergence similarly across cultures 
(Liu et al., 2024;
Nuzulia & Why, 2020)
. Nonetheless, we encourage researchers to pilot the experimental materials and coding of leadership behavior in their local contexts, ensuring that they are culturally appropriate and reveal leader-follower dynamics. The materials and coding protocol can easily be adapted to different contexts.


Strengths, Limitations and Future Directions
Our study has several strengths, including its experimental design, its multisource and multimethod approach, and use of an ecologically valid group decision-making task. Our study also has DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD 21 limitations. First, our study focused on children ages 7-14, a critical age for leadership development.
Future research should examine how leader-follower compatibility extends to late adolescents, where greater participation in extracurricular group activities and an expanding social network play an increasingly important role for social learning about leadership 
(Liu et al., 2021)
. Second, our study used the most extensively validated measure of narcissism in children, which assesses narcissism as a unified personality trait 
(Thomaes & Brummelman, 2016)
. Research in adults suggests that narcissism can have both agentic and antagonistic features 
(Back & Morf, 2018;
Krizan & Herlache, 2018)
. Given that the agentic features include vision, charisma, and self-confidence, it is possible that low self-esteem followers benefit mainly from leaders who show agentic features.
Future research should explore this possibility. Another question pertains to interventions. Our work suggests that two seemingly maladaptive traits-narcissism and low self-esteem-can jointly generate positive consequences, at least in the short run. Interventions can focus on improving the compatibility between leaders and followers as a means of enhancing group functioning, while being mindful of the possible long-term risks.


Conclusion
Narcissistic individuals are more likely to rise to leadership positions, even in childhood. We show that complementing narcissistic leaders with low self-esteem followers seems to strike a symbiosis. Not only do followers with lower self-esteem seem to thrive under narcissistic leadership but the leaders themselves behave more positively. This shows that, from a young age, leaderfollower compatibility is critical for understanding the allure of narcissistic leaders. Note. Nwithin = 210-212 followers; Nbetween = 107 leaders. Follower SE = Follower Self-Esteem. The total variance explained by the models is given by the conditional R 2 , and the total variance explained by the fixed effects is given by the marginal R 2 (Nakagawa & Schielzeth, 2013). Note. Nwithin = 212-214 followers; Nbetween = 107 leaders. Follower SE = Follower Self-Esteem. The total variance explained by the models is given by the conditional R 2 , and the total variance explained by the fixed effects is given by the marginal R 2 (Nakagawa & Schielzeth, 2013). Note. Nbetween = 107 leaders. Follower SE = Follower Self-Esteem. For leader aggression, normal R 2 is reported.

Our findings generate avenues for future research. One question is how the dynamics between narcissistic leaders and low self-esteem followers develop over time. From what age are children with low self-esteem drawn to more narcissistic leaders? What are the key features of narcissistic children that draw these children in (e.g., charm, charisma, self-confidence, risk-taking)? Do these features remain consistent over the course of development, or do they change? And from what age do the positive effects of narcissism on followers with low self-esteem start to dwindle?
