You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Family experience provides a foundation for effective later life social functioning. This is particularly important in adolescence when other-oriented behaviours mature, leading to the establishment and maintenance of stable relationships 
(1)
(2)
(3)
. The emergence of trust is considered an important contributory factor to such other-oriented behaviours, where trust is defined as a willingness to be vulnerable to the actions of another party 
(4,
5)
. This willingness encapsulates a positive expectation that the reciprocal actions of another will be beneficial, irrespective of one's own ability to exert control over the other. As such, trust is commonly conceived as incorporating a risk-benefit tradeoff, where trusting another entails uncertainty both to potential negative consequences but also positive consequences.
Economic games are a commonly deployed means for quantifying trust, enabling measurement of inter-individual differences in the risk-benefit trade-off for trust, including an ability to establish and maintain cooperative behaviour 
(6,
7)
. This quantitative approach has helped identify neural correlates of trust-based decision-making, implicating activity in anterior insula 
((8, 9)
 for meta-analysis).
Computational modelling of economic trust games 
(10,
11)
 has also suggested that core cognitive mechanisms underlying trust behaviour include social preference factors (a willingness to tolerate social risk, social inequity aversion), a capacity to plan ahead as well as an awareness of the states of mind of self and others (see 
Table 1
 for an overview and conceptual description). Importantly, a parameter in the model captures an agent's irritable state, formalising retaliatory impulses induced by perceived unfairness ('Irritability' 
(10,
11)
).
Economic trust games have primarily been deployed in cross-sectional studies, with inconsistent findings especially in relation to a mid-and late adolescent period. Some studies, including a previously reported analysis of baseline data from the current study 
(12)
, show age-related increases in trust 
(12)
(13)
(14)
, while others find no age-related differences 
(15)
(16)
(17)
 or even decreases during the course of adolescence 
(18)
. Such inconsistencies may, in part, reflect substantial inter-individual differences in development, a factor that cannot be examined in studies that deploy cross-sectional designs. Indeed, previous research in adolescent neurocognitive development has concentrated largely on 'average' development 
(19)
, potentially concealing meaningful inter-individual variability in social development. It is widely considered that longitudinal designs are necessary to fully capture change at an individual level 
(20)
(21)
(22)
.
An important source of inter-individual variability in adolescent social development is the impact of social experiences occurring during earlier developmental periods, and that may cascade across successive developmental phases 
(23)
. Distinct developmental phases carry their own unique social challengesfrom engagement with a caregiver during infancy to integration with a peer group in adolescence. Indeed, a long-standing hypothesis in developmental psychopathology proposes that earlier childhood family experiences, including parent-child interactions, are critical constituents in the emergence of an ability to establish and maintain healthy later life social relationships 
(24)
(25)
(26)
(27)
.
In this study we detail typical longitudinal developmental trajectories of trust, including underlying cognitive mechanisms, with specific attention to characterising inter-individual differences in developmental trajectories of trust. Based on the literature, we focused on a hypothesis that past family experiences shape how trust develops intra-individually during adolescence. Based on self-reported family and parenting experiences we derived a family experience factor (28), which we hypothesized would impact individual adolescent trust development. To ascertain the relevance of trust for real-life social relationships, we examined how inter-individual differences in trust related to the development of peer relations.
We show, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, that there is an increase in trust behaviour from adolescence into young adulthood. Computational modelling on our data provided novel insight into this normative developmental process, showing the emergence of trust was best explained by reference to an adaptive decrease in social risk aversion over the course of adolescence, which conferred adaptive benefits in task performance. Notably, family adversity attenuated the observed longitudinal gain in trust, while unconditional trust in our economic game predicted the quality of future social relationships, particularly so in those with a history of pronounced family adversity.


Results
We focus on longitudinal analyses (~1.5-year follow-up), involving multi-modal measurements, across 570 participants (14-25 years of age, 284 female, 286 male (gender assessment based on participants' self-report)). A cross-sectional analysis based on the baseline dataset has been published previously 
(12)
. To assess trusting behaviour, participants engaged in 10 rounds of an interactive multiround 'trust game' 
(7,
12)
 
(Figure 1A
), in which they played the role of the 'investor'. In each of ten rounds, the investor received an initial credit of 20 coins, and then decided how much of this credit to transfer to another person (the 'trustee'; unbeknownst to our participants, mimicked by a computer algorithm). The participant was informed that their investment would be tripled by the experimenter before the trustee then decides how many coins to pay back to the investor. Participants were shown the trustee's repayment at the end of each round.


Figure 1. Multiround Trust Game A) Illustration of one round in the trust game. At the beginning of each
round, the participant (adopting the role of the 'investor') received play-coins. The participant decided how much of this credit to invest with another player ('trustee'), and how much they wanted to keep for themselves. The participant was informed that their investment ai, (but not the money they kept) would be tripled by the experimenter. In a next step, the trustee (unbeknownst to the participant, a computer algorithm which was informed by trustee decisions in previous studies), decided on the amount of coins to repay to the participant (aT). Participants were shown the trustee's repayment aT at the end of each round. Coins gained were not transferred to the next round, which would start with a credit of 20 coins again. Participants played a total of 10 rounds. B) Amount of coins invested in round 1 to 10; thicker line denotes mean investment as a function of time 
(T1 vs


. T2). C). Histogram of mean investments across all rounds at baseline (T1) and after the ~1.5 years follow-up period (T2).
To gain insight into the development of different aspects of trusting behaviour, as measured in our iterative economic task, we ran a series of complementary analyses. First, we analysed amount invested in the first round as an index of a priori, initial ('unconditional') trust, before any interaction with a partner had occurred. Secondly, we took account of all ten rounds that a participant played and analysed round-by-round investments as an index of mean trust. Note that while the latter analysis takes account of all repeated decisions made by one individual, these are biased by the interaction experienced. Lastly, we derived a measure of reciprocity, based on prior literature (6), defined as relative change in investment from one round to another in response to a change in repayment by the partner on a previous round. This definition is de facto an operationalisation of tit-for-tat like behaviour(6) (see SI-Methods for details).


Behavioural Analyses: Longitudinal Development of Trust Behaviour
We used linear mixed effects models to ascertain whether trust-related behaviours (first round investment, round-by-round investment, reciprocity) show age-related and within-person developmental change over a ~1.5 year follow-up period by analysing them against cross-sectional (mean) age and longitudinal developmental effects ('longitudinal age', see Methods for details).
First round investment: a-priori trust. We found both cross-sectional age effects (estimate=.26, sd=.06, F(1,567.00)=19.10, p<.001), as well as longitudinal effects (estimate=.67, sd=.15, F(1,568.00)=19.45, p<.001), on investment behaviour in the first round of the game. This indicates that a-priori trust increases both between persons with increasing age, as well as within persons with development. There was no significant interaction of longitudinal development and cross-sectional age effects (estimate=-.03, sd=.05, F(1,568.00)=0.32, p=.572, see S- 
Table 1
 for full output of the model).
Round-by-round investment behaviour across the whole game: mean trust. Both cross-sectional age (estimate=0.57, se=.06, F(1,567.00)=24.32 p<.001) and longitudinal development (estimate=0.26, se=.05, F(1,10819.00)=109.81, p<.001) were significant predictors of round-by-round investment behaviour (see S- 
Table 2
 for full output of the model). This indicates that mean trust increased significantly with age in a between-subject manner, but critically this was also evident as a within-person effect (see 
Figure 2
). Interestingly, the interaction of longitudinal development and cross-sectional age was significant (estimate=-.07, sd=.02, F(1,10819)=15.14, p<.001), implying the extent to which investment behaviour changed longitudinally from baseline to follow-up was dependent on the age of the participants. In essence, a longitudinal increase of trust was steepest for the youngest of the sample whereas the developmental increase in mean trust flattened in older adolescents/early adults (see 
Figure  2
). A supplementary analysis on a subgroup of participants who underwent the task three times ("retest sample", n=55 who played the task ~ 6months after the first task assessment) was consistent with longitudinal effects being more likely to be explained by developmental, as opposed to retest, effects (see Supplementary Methods and Results, S- 
Figure 3
 and 
(29,
30)
 for details on this subsample analysis). 


Reciprocity
We did not observe any significant cross-sectional age or longitudinal developmental effects on reciprocity. Here we formalise reciprocity in terms of the relative change in investment from one round to another in response to a change in repayment by a partner, based on the literature(6) (all Fs<.086, all ps>.05). See SI for results on complementary reciprocity measures analysed.


Computational Modelling
Next, we turned to computational modelling (see methods and SI results for details) to probe cognitive mechanisms underlying trust development. Here we availed of a model, validated for this multi-round trust task 
(11,
12)
, that describes how an agent observes a partner's behaviour and then tries to infer  
Table 1
 and (11) for details). We previously validated this computational modelling approach in the current sample 
(12)
, where the focus was on inter-individual differences on model parameters in the baseline (T1) dataset alone. 


Relationship between adolescent development of trust and childhood family adversity
Whilst in the earlier set of analyses we defined patterns of typical development in trust behaviours, our data also reveal that trust development is subject to substantial inter-individual variability (see, e.g. 
Figure 2
). Thus, we sought to examine whether family experiences, particularly parenting, might explain this variability. Building on previous work using the same dataset 
34
  for visualization purposes. Shades denote 95% confidence interval (variance of the fixed effects).


Computational Modelling: Higher Irritability in those with greater adversity
In a next step, we examined a computational basis for the influence of family adversity on trust behaviour and its development. We deployed a series of mixed models 
(
   We next asked whether our trust measures at T1 (baseline) are predictive of the long-term development of the quality of peer relationships (T1q  T2q  T3q), and whether this longitudinal association is moderated by family adversity. The quality of friendships increased significantly with measurement time points (estimate(T1q  T3q)=-0.51, se=.08, F(2,1221.51)=24.47, p<.001, 
Figure 5A
). Intriguingly, we found participants who showed more a priori trust at T1 (in terms of round 1 investments in our task)
reported more pronounced positive peer relation quality (estimate=.06, se=.02, F(1,757.74)=5.27, p=.022; 
Figure 5B
, effect failed to reach significance for mean investments, p=.07). This indicates that initial ('unconditional') trust is associated with establishing and maintaining high-quality real-life social relationships. The latter is indeed a central developmental task in adolescence, a period of life where navigating the social world becomes independent.
In a final analysis step, we asked whether the impact of a-priori trust on the subsequent development of peer relations was moderated by family experiences. Strikingly, we observed a significant interaction of a priori trust and adversity with longitudinal development of friendships from T1q over T2q and T3q
(estimate=.05, se=.01, F(1,1050.70)=6.77, p=.009; 
Figure 5C
, see S- 
Table 10
 for full output of the model). As 
Figure 5C
 shows, those with higher family adversity expressed a stronger positive association of baseline a priori trust with a gain in the quality of peer relations. Taken together, these observations are consistent with the notion that unconditional trust acts as a resilience factor in those with higher adversity, enabling the establishment of adaptive peer relations in the face of more negative past family experiences.   
(16,
17)
. Others, including our previously published cross-sectional analysis of this study's baseline datasets, showed older participants manifest greater trust compared to younger participants 
(12,
37)
. Importantly, by disentangling cross-sectional age effects from longitudinal developmental effects, we extend upon these previous cross-sectional findings to show not only agerelated, but also within-person, increases in trust behaviour.
Trust necessarily entails risk 
(11,
38)
 related to an uncertainty regarding whether trust behaviour will be reciprocated by the other. In the context of an economic game this includes a financial (earning less money in this trial) as well a social component (e.g. a risk of being taken advantage of; loss of face). Our modelling analyses indicate that developmental changes in social risk preferences act as a key cognitive process contributing to an increase in trust across adolescence. Thus, social risk aversion decreased with age, and intriguingly, it also decreased intra-individually over a 1.5year longitudinal follow-up period.
Our data suggest that this developmental change was adaptive in so far as less social risk aversion on average lead to a higher total task pay-out. Put differently, in our sample younger participants subjectively valued money they kept more than money they invested and were repaid following a social interaction, even though this strategy entailed they earned less money. By contrast, within this same subject sample cross-sectional data on non-social risk-taking (gambling) indicated the absence of agerelated change in risk behaviour in the non-social domain. This speaks to a potential specificity of social risk development in adolescence, an interpretation in line with a proposal that adolescence is a period characterised by "hypersensitivity to social risk" 
(39)
(40)
(41)
. It is argued that (prima facie) irrational behaviours (as observed in our task by less advantageous investment behaviour) might reflect attempts to avoid occasions of social risk. Thus, one interpretation is that, for younger adolescents, being taken advantage of by a given amount is more painful than an equivalent degree of generosity is rewarding.
Despite, on-average, a significant cross-sectional and longitudinal increase in trust across our sample, we show this developmental effect is subject to substantial inter-individual variability. A key hypothesis in developmental psychopathology research proposes that previous family experiences are a source of variability for later social development 
(23)
(24)
(25)
(26)
(27)
. More specifically, experiences with primary caregivers are believed to provide a template for social behaviour that shapes later life interpersonal interactions 
(42)
. It is plausible this is relevant at an adolescent phase when confronting the developmental challenge of becoming more independent through establishment of extra-familial social relationships. In line with this, we show that scores on a retrospective self-report family experience factor impacted the longitudinal development of trust behaviour from adolescence through to young adulthood. More specifically, those reporting higher family adversity involving more negative parenting had an attenuated longitudinal gain in trust, as indexed by their investments in our multi-round trust game. This accords with the notion that a secure family environment serves as a basis for adaptive trust later in life (i.e., in adolescence). It also complements cross-sectional evidence from clinical populations, who had experienced more severe forms of interpersonal trauma than was the case for a majority of the current sample, where in the trust game previous extreme adverse interpersonal circumstances is linked to reduced trusting behaviour (43)
.
Building on our previously validated computational model 
(11,
12)
, we identified a computational basis for the influence of family adversity on trust behaviour, evident in higher modelling-derived Irritability estimates. This parameter indexes a propensity to enter an irritated state, whereby participants are more disposed to punish a partner when experiencing below-expectation trustee pay-backs. Importantly, as operationalized in our computational model 
(10,
11)
, this type of retaliation occurs in a state of 'mentalization breakdown' (35) or a 'hot emotional state' 
(11,
45)
. That is, irritability in our computational model is characterized by an absence of planning, forgoing potential gains from cooperation, a disregard for beliefs of the other player, as well as lack of guilt. Importantly, this form of retaliation differs from what might be called strategic retaliation, where the latter has an explicit aim to 'teach a lesson'. These findings are consistent with the Social Information Processing Theory which describes how social information processes shape social adjustment in children and adolescents 
(46)
. In line with this theory, adolescents who self-report higher levels of family adversity might perceive and interpret below-expectation trustee actions in a hostile way, thereby increasing a likelihood of retaliation rather than ignore the trustee's action or try to repair trust. In a vicious circle type of spiral, in consequence, this might lead to less satisfying social interactions. Such a hostile attribution/interpretation bias of ambiguous social situations is suggested to develop as a consequence of maladaptive parenting 
(47)
 or interpersonal trauma 
(48)
.
It is interesting to consider how effects of early family experience might play out in a task that involves an interaction with an unknown other. One interpretation is that effects of adversity play out in novel social situations, where a previously learnt template of how much to trust might inform decision-making more strongly than is the case for interactions with close others with whom an agent has specific social learning experiences. An interesting future avenue of research might be to experimentally contrast trust towards familiar others (e.g. friends, partners, family) with trust towards strangers, as tested here in a young population with a history of family adversity. Indeed, in other social decision-making contexts, it has been shown that friends differentially bias computations about risk in adolescents 
(49)
, and that adolescents show greater prosocial behavior towards their friends 
(50)
. At a clinical level, irritability in the face of mentalization breakdown is suggested as an important factor contributing to the development and maintenance of borderline personality disorder (BPD (51)), a condition often associated with adverse family experiences 
(52,
53)
 as well as altered trust behaviour in the trust game 
(7,
11,
54)
.
Trust is considered a core ingredient for establishing and maintaining social relationships 
(55,
56)
, and here we show that a priori trust in our task (i.e. round 1 investment at measurement time point T1) is predictive of the development of the quality of peer relationships until 3 years later. This extends previous findings showing that trust beliefs (as assessed via a questionnaire) negatively predict longitudinal changes in loneliness and maladaptive peer interactions during childhood and young adulthood 
(57,
58)
.
It also chimes with large-scale survey data showing a cross-sectional association of negative expectations about others and perceived loneliness 
(59)
. Further, we show that the association of trust with future peer relations was driven primarily by those with more adverse family experiences. This is suggestive that interpersonal trust acts as a resilience factor, enabling the development of more satisfying independent relationships also when past social interactions within one's own family are perceived as adverse.


Limitations
By design we have relied on retrospective, self-reported family experiences 
(34)
, and several biases are known to arise from retrospective self-reports of adverse experiences in the context of child maltreatment (See (60, 61) for discussion). However, previous work has found that negative childhood experiences are more likely to be under-as opposed to over-reported 
(62)
, while the clinical relevance of self-report measures is emphasized by a link between self-reported childhood adversity and early adult psychopathology 
(60)
. A further limitation is the fact that the majority of our sample reported low levels of negative family experiences and this might explain the modest effect sizes observed in our study, highlighting a need for large samples.


Conclusion
We show that trust increases from adolescence through to young adulthood, and that unconditional trust measured in the laboratory is predictive of a beneficial development in real-life peer relations 3 years later. We find evidence for an important role of past social family experiences on the evolution of trust, wherein those reporting higher family adversity had an attenuation in a gain of trust from adolescence through to young adulthood. Finally, our study showcases the power of large, multivariate, longitudinal studies in characterising the development of trust in adolescence (63), a period of life where the consolidation of social relationships is a key developmental challenge.


Materials and Methods


Sample
The experimental task ( 
Figure 1A)
 


Multi-Round Trust Task
Participants engaged in an iterated 10-round trust game, similar to that used in previous studies of adult healthy and psychiatric populations (6). The procedure is described in detail in 
(12)
. Participants took on the role of the "Investor" throughout the game and were instructed to play this role according to their own goals and preferences. Participants were led to believe they were playing with an anonymous peer (the "Trustee") from the same study, playing from another site, who would also be paid in proportion to their own winnings. No information was provided about name, gender or background of the partner. Note that with this experimental approach, we explicitly tested trust in an unfamiliar social situation, a scenario where we hypothesized general templates about how much to trust would play out most prominently.
Participants were informed that they would receive monetary rewards in proportion to their winnings. For details of the experiment, see 
Figure 1
.
In each of the ten rounds, the investor received an initial endowment of 20 play-coins, and then decided the amount (in whole coins) to transfer to a trustee. Participants knew that the amount invested would be tripled by the experimenter, before the trustee (in our case, unbeknownst to the participants, the computer algorithm) decided how many coins to return to the investor. The repayment by the trustee was not increased by the experimenter. After the trustee's action, the investor was informed of the outcome, and the next round started. At the end of the study, participants were debriefed that the Trustee had in fact been a computer algorithm that emulated the behaviour of healthy adult Trustees based on previous studies.


Childhood Family Experiences
Our approach is based on a previous publication using the same dataset where we applied Principal 


Principal Component Analysis
We calculated a multi-modal composite score for family adversity as described in a previous publication on the same dataset 
(28)
. We conducted a PCA on standard-normally transformed individual total scores of the MOPS the APQ subscales using the R Package Lavaan 
(68)
. From both analyses, we extracted individual scores for the first component to reflect retrospectively recalled childhood family experience scores.


Quality of Peer Relations
To evaluate the development of peer relation from baseline to follow up, we used the Cambridge Friendship Questionnaire (CFQ 
(28,
29,
36)
 freely available at https://osf.io/cf59r/), measured three times as part of the homepack questionnaire battery around the time of the behavioural task assessment (baseline), as well as at a median of 1 (T2q) and 2.3 years later (T3q). In a previous publication, this measure has been shown to be longitudinally linked to psycho-social resilience in this sample 
(28)
. See SI for details.


Statistical Analyses
All data were analysed using R and Rstudio 
(69,
70)
 . Mixed models for cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of trust and longitudinal analyses on reciprocity and parameters derived from our computational model were fit using the R package afex 
(71)
. P-values were calculated based on a Sattherthwaite approximation for degrees-of-freedom. Subject-specific slopes were estimated as random effects. We additionally fit ordinal mixed models using the R package ordinal 
(72)
 
15, 16
), see S- 
Figure 1
). Additionally, based on findings in the T1 dataset (12) we ran control analyses for all developmental mixed models including baseline IQ and socioeconomic status, results of which are reported in the Supplement, and which did not lead to substantial deviations of results reported in the main manuscript. All continuous predictors were centred on zero. Effect-coding was used for contrasts. Post-hoc contrasts were computed using the R package emmeans 
(73)
. Plots were generated using ggplot2 
(74)
.


Longitudinal Mixed Model
First, to disentangle longitudinal development from age effects, participants' age at the time where they completed our task was separated into within-subject (longitudinal) and between-subject (crosssectional) components (as recommended in 
(75,
76)
 For the analysis of round-by-round investments, trial number (1-10) was included as an additional regressor. Note that mirroring the results of the previously published cross-sectional analysis, we did not observe any significant quadratic effects of age (cross-sectional age²) or a significant interaction of cross-sectional age² and longitudinal age in our mixed models predicting i) trial-by-trial investments or ii) investment in trial 1 (all Fs<.21, all ps>.65), which is why quadratic age effects were not considered in all further analyses of inter-individual differences.
To analyse the impact of family experiences on trust, the factor-analytically derived family experience score (as well as 2-and 3-way interactions) was added as an additional regressor.
To analyse how baseline trust (measured at T1) influences the longitudinal development of peer relation quality, we predicted scores on the Cambridge Friendship Questionnaire (CFQ, baseline (T1) and 2
follow-up (T2q, T3q) measurements) with investments at T1, longitudinal and cross-sectional age at the time of questionnaire assessment (as well as their 2-and 3-way interactions) and gender as a covariate in mixed effects regression models. In a follow-up model, we added the family experience factor as a moderator. Note that in this analysis, we had more participants available, as we could include all subjects who had CFQ data as well as T1 trust task data available (i.e. those that dropped out for the second task measurement could be included). Note that as this analysis used CFQ data as a dependent variable, longitudinal/cross-sectional age (decomposed as described above) referred to the age of the participant when the CFQ questionnaires were completed in this analysis (T1q, T2q, T3q).


Computational Modelling


Computational Multi Round Trust Task Model
We model the subject's behaviour as an interactive partially observable Markov decision process (I-POMDP, see 
(77)
. This is a class of decision making models that includes a model of tactical depth of thinking, when performing a task with other agents. Thus, it provides a way of modelling what an agent thinks the other agents are thinking and how this will influence choices.
An I-POMDP consists of a set of possible states and beliefs (in our case defined by how trustworthy the partner appears, how sophisticated a participant's model of their partner is, whether participants act as investor or trustee and how close the end of the game is), possible actions (in our case, investment and repayment options) and possible observations (in our case, the choices made by the social partner).
Furthermore, an I-POMDP contains a set of transition probabilities, determining the likelihood of ending up in a new state after choosing an action and a set of observation probabilities, encoding the probabilities of making a given observation during a state transition. In the case of the multi round trust task, the transition and observation probabilities consist of the likelihoods of partner choices, based on the observed game history so far 
(10)
. During the interactions, information about the partner is encoded through Bayesian updating of their trustworthiness (their "inequality aversion type", see below), based on choice probabilities under certain parameters. In the case of the MRT model, there are 7 parameters, which determine the generative model of choices in the game, forming a vector =( , , , , , ( ), ).
See table 1 for a conceptual description of all parameters.
In the following, we will go through the parameters of the model validated in 
(11)
 and detail how they influence the interaction. Note that our estimation operates in a space of game trajectories rather than just the space of 10 investor's choices. Since reputation building and planning ahead are essential and all previous trials influence the belief state of the participants, we operate in a space of 21 (investortrustee choices per round) to the power of 10 possible game trajectories. Further methodical detail can be found in 
(10,
11)
. It follows from this formula that an inequality averse (α = 1) trustee will seek to repay an investor to the point where they both have equitable outcomes. Such a trustee can be considered "trustworthy"
(meaning they will reciprocate reliably) and the goal of an investor's beliefs and inferences in the MRT can be modelled as to be learning whether their partner falls into this category. Conversely, an inequality averse investor will invest at least a minimal amount in the trustee, opening up some possibility of the trustee to exploit them (since such an investor would keep investing, even if they discovered the trustee to be a poor reciprocator).
For computational reasons and also since the generated behavioural profiles do not change drastically as a function of small differences in inequality aversion(10)we use a discrete set comprised of 3 possible values of inequality aversion ∈ {0, 0.4, 1} and we assume agents to learn about the partner's inequality aversion setting, using a Dirichlet prior on a categorical distribution on the 3 values, with initial Dirichlet prior settings being ( 0 , 0.4 , 1 ) = 
(1,1,1
). During the interaction, our agents were modelled to update according to an approximate rule, using the probability ( |α) of the partner choosing an action given each respective inequality aversion value:
α = α + ( |α).
Furthermore, we specify that, since an investment of 5 yields no effect of inequality aversion (as both partners end up with an amount of 15 following the investor action), we only investors update their beliefs on trustee responses to investments greater than 5. The trustee has no uncertainty about the amount they will be receiving each round, but they do have an analogue parameter (ω), encoding their assumption on the investor's risk aversion, as a static nonupdated value, to be used in their planning.
Planning. The structure of the multi-round trust task is such that planning is an important part of the game dynamics 
(10,
78,
80)
. The planning parameter encodes the number of future interactions that are taken into account when making a decision. A planning value of = 1 encodes an agent which takes into account the effect of the current action on the expected payoffs in the next 1 rounds as well. was considered for values of ∈ {1,2,3,4}, since our model validation studies showed that beyond these values, behavioural preferences appear not to vary much anymore, and depth of planning is one of the most computationally costly parameters 
(10)
.
Theory of Mind. The tactical depth of thinking (i.e. the model of how the agent thought their partner was reasoning about them, see also 
(81,
82)
 was encoded in a separate parameter ∈ {0,1,2,3, 4}, also called "theory of mind level" or ToM. A level 0 agent holds static (non-learning) models of their partners (dubbed "level -1") and updates their beliefs about the partner based on those. A level agent models the partner as level 0 (i.e. they are aware the partner is learning about them) and updates their own beliefs based on these models. In general, a level k agent models their partner as level k-1 and updates their beliefs based on a set of level k-1 models for different possible parameter values. We already mentioned our agents are learning about their partner's inequality aversion (and therefore implicit "trustworthiness"). As described in 
(11)
, they are also assumed to learn about the partner's propensity to retaliate harshly (their "irritability").
Irritability. Irritability is a parameter with levels ∈ 0;0.25;0.5;0.75;1 that governs a shift from a "rational"
or "non-irritated" state to an "irritated" state. If an agent's investment or repayment is below what their partner expects (i.e. below the expected value calculated based on partner models) and the partner is irritable ( > 0), then the decision making policy of the irritable partner is shifted to a mixture policy (with
( ) = ) ℙ[ ] = (1 − ( ))ℙ[ | ] + ( )ℙ[ | ].
Here, the irritated choice probability is characterized by a planning horizon of 0 (no planning), an inequality aversion of 0 (no concern for fairness), a ToM level of -1 (no concern for partner beliefs) and a risk aversion of at least 1 (if the original risk aversion was below one), with the other parameters remaining the same.
If an already irritated agent becomes again irritated, their policy shifts even further (additively) towards the irritated policy ( ( ) = ( ) + ), with a maximum of 1 ( ( ) = 1, "fully irritated"). If, conversely, an investment or repayment above expectations is observed by the irritated agent, they shift back to the non-irritated policy at the same rate ( ( ) = ( ) − ).
Irritation Awareness. Being aware that partners may be irritable changes behaviour in the MRT considerably (agents try not to irritate partners, see ), therefore we model our agents as holding a belief about the partner's irritability and learning more during the interaction. We model the probabilities for different irritability settings as a categorical distribution, with a Dirichlet prior on it. For updating the Dirichlet prior, we use the same approximate updating rule as above. Unlike for inequality aversion, where all agents are assumed to start with a uniform prior, there exist five starting values for the irritability settings, which form the final parameter of the model, the irritability awareness (ζ) ∈ {0,1,2,3, 4}. The five settings correspond to being "irritation ignorant", "irritation unlikely", "irritation possible", "irritation likely" and "irritation certain" (see details in 
(11)
 Choice Stochasticity. How agents make choices in the trust task (choice making probability ℙ[ ]) is assumed to rely on a logistic softmax function, based on the expected utility ( ) of a current action (with the utility of future actions being obtained from a Bellman-equation mechanism (10, 80)):
ℙ[ ] = ß ( ) ∑ ß ( ) .
In this equation, the parameter ∈ { } is the temperature parameter, which encodes how stochastic the choice preferences of an agent are (lower values encoding higher stochasticity).
To estimate individual parameters, we employed a full search over the parameter space and used the combination of parameter values that produced the smallest negative loglikelihood of generating the observed sequence of choices, given the game's history of actions and responses. The parameters were kept on a discrete grid, for computational reasons (explicit coding of the beliefs and inferences in particular), a limitation that ongoing work is aiming to lift in the future. The parameter grids were determined from simulations and plausibility consideration (see explanations above as well as

 shows an overview including parameter ranges and a conceptual description of each free parameter used for the computational modelling analysis.


Model Selection
To validate our modelling approach, we also compared the full model as described above (M1) with reduced variants of this model within the largest available dataset (T1 baseline dataset). To do so, we constructed reduced models as follows: a model with irritability = 0 and irritation belief = 0 (M2), a model in which, additionally to fixing irritability and irritation belief as in M2, also risk aversion and stochasticity were fixed (risk aversion=1, softmax=1/3, compare (10)) (M3), and finally, a model which included all reductions of M3 and additionally set Theory of Mind = 0 (M4). We additionally include a full random model (M5) in the model comparison set. See 
(11)
 for a more detailed description of this model selection approach for the models and task at hand.
As in previous work 
(11)
 we evaluate the (average per model) negative log likelihood and use a where p denotes the number of parameters and 10 represents the 10 investor and trustee actions. As shown in 
Table 2
, the BIC score indicated that the winning model was the full model M1 (7 parameters) as described above. 


Simulation of Investment Behaviour and Posterior Predictive Checks
Based on our generative model and the individual parameter set derived for each participant, we simulated investment choices per participant and round. In a next step, we used this synthetic data to test for age, developmental and family experience effects based on the same mixed effects model we had used to analyse the empirical data. This reproduced the empirically observed findings very well (see

Questionnaires to assess Family Experiences and Quality of Friendships


Questionnaire to assess perceived quality of peer relations / friendships
We used the Cambridge Friendship Questionnaire (CFQ) to assess the perceived quality of peer relations (28), a measure available as part of a Home Questionnaire Pack delivered close in time to the in-lab measurements 
(64)
. The CFQ assesses the number, and quality of friendships via self-report (e.g.
"How often do you arrange to see friends other than at school, college or work?", "Do you feel that your friends understand you", "Can you confide in your friends"). Higher scores signify higher satisfaction with peer relations. This measure has been shown to predict psycho-social resilience in this sample 
(28)
.


MRI Acquisition, Processing and Analysis
Acquisition and processing. Participants were scanned on three identical Siemens Magnetom TIM Trio whole-body 3T MRI scanners in Cambridge and London using the multi-echo FLASH MPM protocol 
(87)
 N= 193 subjects of our sample underwent structural imaging twice, for n=101 only a baseline structural scan was available.
Acquisition parameters were identical across sites. Whole-brain multi-echo FLASH MT weighted contrast were acquired at 1 mm isotropic resolution (TR: 23.7, α = 6, 176 sagittal slices, FOV = 256 × 240 mm2, matrix = 256 × 240 × 176). Semiquantitative MT saturation maps were derived using biophysical models(88{Tabelow, 2019 #5415)} using the hMRI toolbox (www.hmri. info) for SPM (Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, London, UK, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Whole-brain MT maps for all subjects were then segmented into grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid, normalised to MNI space using geodesic shooting 
(89)
, and modulated to account for effects of normalisation using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/). Modulated grey matter maps thus reflect voxel-wise grey matter volume (GMV). GMV maps were finally spatially smoothed preserving GM/WM tissue boundaries (90) using a smoothing kernel of 6mm FWHM.


ROI Analysis
A recent coordinate-based meta-analysis

 where model parameter corresponds to the computational parameter of interest for following up our behavioural analyses (risk aversion, irritability).
To maximise sample size and thus power, all subjects undergoing MRI, including those that were scanned only at baseline were included in the MRI analysis, coding longitudinal age as "0" and crosssectional age as the mean-centred age at T1 (compare (92) (76) for a similar approach in the same dataset).


Supplementary Results
Longitudinal Modelling of additional reciprocity measures (φ, r)
Cross-sectional age predicted the direction (φ) of investor's responses to trustee's re-payments (F(1,566.00)=10.04, p=.002), with participants who were older on average responding in a more cooperative manner. There was no significant effect of longitudinal development on the magnitude r nor direction (angle φ) of investor's responses to trustee's actions (Fs<1.60, p>.20).


Retest Subsample -Testing for training vs. developmental effects in a 6-month follow up subsample of participants
To analyse whether the observed longitudinal differences were predominantly due to retest effects or development, we included a sample of participants who were also tested 6 months apart (judged to be a short time with respect to maturation, henceforth 'short follow-up'). This comprised a sub-sample of n=55 of the total group who were tested three times in total (baseline, 6-month 'short' follow-up, 1. 


Adjusting for IQ and socio-economic status as covariates when analyzing investment behaviour
In a set of control analyses, we included IQ at baseline to adjust for its effect on investment behaviour which we had reported in our previous publication 
(12)
. IQ was positively associated with investments both in trial 1 (1, 566.00=78.61, p<.001), as well as across the whole game F(1,566.00)=79.21, p<.001).
Reassuringly, the inclusion of IQ did not change the observed effects of cross-sectional age and longitudinal age on investment behaviour (all ps remained <.001).
In a further set of control analyses, we included socio-economic status (if available at all) at baseline to adjust for its effect on investment behaviour which we had reported in our previous publication. adjusting for socio-economic status (possibly due to reduced power to detect an interaction effect due to the reduced sample for which socioeconomic data were available), F(1,328)=3.52, p=.06).
Adjusting for IQ, gender and socio-economic status in the analysis of the effect of family experiences revealed that the interaction of family history and longitudinal age remained significant (interestingly showing a higher effect size than in the unadjusted analysis F(1,6599)=12.21, p<.001)


Brain-behaviour co-development


Association of risk aversion development with anterior insula development
To examine whether there were structural brain correlates for the observed developmental effects on trusting behaviour, we tested for the co-development of cognitive and brain indices in a relatively large subsample of subjects who underwent two experimental task sessions (baseline and ~18 months) and two structural MRI scan sessions (n=294, see Methods). Recall that in our study social risk aversion emerged as a key cognitive mechanism underlying the development of trust, leading us to hypothesise an association with anterior insula development. This brain region is consistently implicated in trust behaviour, and has been shown to play a role in social risk processing in the trust task 
(8,
9)
.
Consequently, we extracted grey matter volume values derived from a Voxel Based Morphometry analysis based on peak coordinates suggested by a recent meta-analysis (right Insula: 
MNI 42,
18,
4)
 using a 10mm radius 
(8)
. Insula grey matter volume then served as the dependent variable in a mixed model where we adopted the same longitudinal modelling approach detailed for our behavioural analyses. This enabled us to ask whether there were longitudinal and cross-sectional associations between risk aversion and insula grey matter volume, decomposing social risk aversion into its longitudinal and cross-sectional components and entering both as predictors ( 
92
 
Figure 3B
 shows, a general age-related decrease in right AI grey matter volume, observed at the group level, was attenuated in those that showed high levels of Irritability across both measurement time points.
When adding family adversity as a moderator, we did not observe any significant main effect of family adversity, nor any significant interaction of family adversity with Irritability on right AI development (all ps>.41). Thus, we did not find evidence for an association of family adversity with right AI grey matter development in our generally healthy adolescent population.


Computational Modelling: Posterior Predictive Checks


Comparison of simulated vs. empirically observed investment behaviour
We used the computational model along with the individual inferred parameter set to generate a synthetic investment trajectory per individual / measurement time point.
Validity of the model was confirmed by a posterior predictive check analysis, wherein we applied general mixed effect models that were used to predict age/developmental, as well as family adversity effects on investment behaviour, in the empirical data (see Main Methods) to the synthetic (simulated) investment data: This reproduced significant effects of cross-sectional age, longitudinal development as well as the interaction of both factors (all ps<.002, see S- 
Figure 6A
). We observed an interaction of childhood family experiences with longitudinal age on investment behaviour, which was, other than in the empirical data, significantly moderated by mean age in the simulated dataset (F(1,9696.00)=6.17, p=.013, see S- 
Figure   5B
) in a plausible manner; i.e., the strongest difference in trust development as a function of childhood family experiences was present in the youngest of the sample.
In order to map our computational modelling parameter "Irritability", and inter-individual differences therein, to choice behaviour, we determined a behavioural signature of retaliation: the degree of reduction in own investment behaviour after the participant has observed an unfair trustee action.
Unfairness in trustees was defined as a repayment which would leave the investor with less money than the trustee himself after an interaction 
(79)
. According to this definition, n=164 participants in the baseline assessment and n=97 participants in the follow-up assessment did not experience any unfair trustee action and where thus excluded from this proof-of-concept analysis. For the remaining participants, we 


Supplementary Discussion
Intriguingly, at a neurodevelopmental level, we observed thatover and above the effects of agea longitudinal decrease in social risk aversion was linked to a decrease in right anterior insula grey matter volume, a region meta-analytic studies have associated with trust, as well as with risk and uncertainty processing in non-social contexts 
(8,
91,
95,
96)
. Anterior insula development during adolescence has also been implicated in the development of cognitive control and a developmental shift in (non-social) risk taking preferences 
(97)
. These neural finding provide a degree of external, construct validity to our behavioural findings and extend the potential developmental significance of anterior insula grey matter change to include the domain of social risk preferences. In our sample, irritability estimates were not associated with grey matter insula volume per se, but did act to moderate an age-related decrease of insula grey matter volume. Thus, those with lower irritability estimates showed a normative age-related increase in grey matter volume, whilst this association was not apparent in those with higher irritability estimates. Although not within the primary scope of our investigation, we found no significant effect of family experience on right anterior insula grey matter. One reason might be that here we focused exclusively on right anterior insula as an a priori meta-analytically defined region of interest, based on its relevance for trust and risk behaviour 
(8,
9,
91)
 whereas longitudinal effects of family environment and parenting have been found predominantly in other regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus 
(98,
99)
, the amygdala and the OFC (100).

Longitudinal increase of trusting behaviour as a function of participants' age. Illustration of participants' mean round-by-round investments in their counterpart ('trustee'), used as an index of trust, increased with age as well as with longitudinal development. Longitudinal increase in trust (i.e., mean investments) is steepest for the youngest of the sample. For visualisation purposes alone, age is split up into four categories (based on quantiles) in the figure, whereas age entered the statistical model as a continuous regressor.

the partner's key characteristics. Thus, an agent considers what their partner believes about them, and, if they have sufficient theory of mind, what the partner believes about their own beliefs. They also take account of what the partner is likely to make of their own behaviour in the next few rounds, allowing them to 'signal' to the partner. For example, by avoiding investment reductions they might want to avoid the possibility of rendering the partner irritable (see methods and (11) for details and formal description of the model). Thus, in this model, investment decisions as a function of trustee repayment are captured by seven parameters; namely Social Risk Aversion, Theory of Mind, Planning, Guilt, Irritability, Irritation Awareness and Stochasticity (see methods,

investor reciprocity on round j was quantified as ΔIj -ΔRj-1, where ΔIj is the fractional change in investment from round jto j and ΔRj-1 is the last fractional change in repayment, relative to the money available to the trustee in this round (i.e., (Rj-1/( I j-1 x 3)-Rj-2/( I j-2 x 3))Thus, positive values denote benevolent reciprocity, i.e. investors being generous (sending more) in response to a defection by the trustee. Conversely, negative values denote malevolent reciprocity, the investor reacts to the trustee's generosity with a breach of trust. Considering all investments together, decisions on average were benevolent in this sample (two-sided t-test against zero, t(701)=7.07, p<.001). Similar to the analysis of investments, investor's trial-by-trial reciprocity values entered a mixed effects model as a dependent variable with longitudinal age, cross-sectional age and gender as predictors.Based on (84), we additional operationalized 4 different strategies in terms of reciprocity (trust honouring, trust disrupting, trust repairing, distrust reciprocating) as the four quadrants of a circle as given by ΔI and ΔR. We then calculated both the radius and the polar angle of this circle, where the polar angle φ, denotes the direction of the investor's reaction (dependent on the trustee's action; where positive values denote a higher degree of cooperation), and the radius r denotes the magnitude of the investor's reaction. for training effects in a 6-month follow up subsample of participants A subsample of n=55 participants completed the task three times, with an additional interim session after a ~6 month follow-up period. This "retest sample" allows us to index short-term changes (over ~6 months), indicative of training effects, from long-term changes (over ~1.5 years) indicative of developmental change.


Measure of Parenting Style:The MOPS is a self-report measure that assesses perceived parenting styles across three domains; indifference, over-control and abuse. Participants were asked to rate both their mother's and father's parenting behaviour on 15 statements, on a 4-point scale ('not true at all', 'slightly true', 'moderately true', 'extremely true'). The 'abuse' scale consisted of five items, asking whether maternal/paternal behaviours were verbally abusive, unpredictable, physically violent, elicited feelings of danger or elicited feelings of lack of safety. The 'overly controlling' scale consisted of four items where maternal/paternal behaviour was overprotective, over controlling, critical, or made the participant feel guilty. Finally, the 'indifference' scale assessed six items of maternal/paternal behaviour where the parent was 'ignoring, uncaring, rejecting, uninterested in, would forget about, or would leave the participant on his/her own a lot. Sum scores to responses in these items were calculated, with higherscores representing more abusive, over controlling or indifferent behaviour reported. Internal consistency was good for the maternal subscales (Cronbach's alpha maternal over control = 0.70, indifference = 0.86, abuse = 0.78). For paternal parenting, the internal consistency at baseline ranged from acceptable (Cronbach's alpha paternal over control = 0.65) to excellent (Cronbach's alphas paternal abuse = 0.88, paternal indifference = 0.93). Alabama Parenting Questionnaire: The APQ (85) measures parenting practices. In NSPN, the nine-item short-form(86) was used and the 'Corporal Punishment' (three items) and 'Involvement' scale (three items) were added. Participants were asked to rate how typical each item occurred or used to occur in their family home on a 5-point scale ranging from 'never', 'almost never', 'sometimes', 'often' to 'always'. We calculated sum scores for the five subscales: Positive Parenting, Inconsistent Discipline, Poor Supervision, Involvement, and Corporal Punishment, with higher scores reflecting higher frequency of the behaviour. Thus, high scores can indicate positive parenting (i.e. involvement, positive parenting) or negative parenting (i.e. inconsistent discipline, poor supervision, corporal punishment). Internal consistency at baseline was acceptable (inconsistent discipline & poor supervision: Cronbach's alpha > 0.62) and good (positive parenting, involvement, Corporal Punishment Cronbach's alpha > 0.71). Note that all results remained when the positive parenting scores (APQ positive parenting and APQ involvement) were removed from the analyses.


, based on 23 original publications reporting on fMRI during economic trust games, found that decisions to trust most consistently involved anterior insula (AI). Based on this and further meta-analytic evidence on the role of the anterior insula in trusting behaviours(9)  and risk processing (91), we hypothesized that anterior insula also plays important roles in the structural neuro-development of trust. Thus, mean grey matter volume (GMV) was extracted from the peak coordinates found in the meta-analysis (right AI MNI 44, 2, -42). These grey matter volume values were then entered into a mixed model as dependent variable, and predicted by social risk aversion (one regressor indexing cross-sectional (between-subject differences) and longitudinal (within-subject change) variance, respectively), as well as cross-sectional and longitudinal age. Additionally, two-way interactions of mean ("cross-sectional") social risk-aversion and both age components were included as predictors (please see(76, 92)  for a similar analytical approach in the same dataset). The same model was subsequently set up for the Irritability parameter, additionally including family adversity, following up on our behavioural results. Movement, gender, ethnicity, total intracranial volume and scanning site were included as nuisance regressors resulting in the following model specification for the ROI analysis:Right AI Grey Matter Volume ROI ~ model parameter longitudinal + model parameter cross-sectional + age longitudinal + age cross-sectional + model parameter crosssectional x age longitudinal + model parameter cross-sectional x age crosssectional + movement + gender + ethnicity + tiv + scanning site + (1|Subject)

years 'long' follow-up), in the same manner as per our main sample (see Main Methods). This allowed us to differentiate retest effects from developmental effects for our key analyses of interest.Round-by-round investment behaviour across the whole game. Testing for an effect of the factor time point (baseline, short follow-up, long follow-up) on round-by-round investments in the subsample that had completed all three measurements, revealed a significant effect of time point (F(2,1418.00)=4.77, p=.009). Critically, post-hoc analyses showed that investment behaviour increased significantly over the 18-month period (t=2.74, p=.006), and from the 6-month to the 18-month period (t=2.61, p=.009) but importantly did not do so significantly over the 6-month period from baseline (t=0.13, p=.90). This pattern does not support a mere training effect, as if this was the case we would expect a stronger change after 6 months than after 18 months. See S-Figure 1.Social Risk Aversion. Next, we analysed the effect of the factor time point (baseline, short follow-up, long follow-up) on social risk aversion in the short follow-up sample. We again observed a significant effectof measurement time point (F(2,106)=4.11, p=.02, S-Figure 1). Post-hoc analyses revealed that social risk aversion decreased significantly over the 18-month period (t=2.86, p=.005), but not significantly during the shorter periods (no significant effect from baseline to 6month follow-up (t=1.23, p=0.22), and from the 6-month to the 18 month follow up (t(106)=1.63, p=.11)).

determined the degree of reduction in investment in trials after an unfair trustee action. As expected, reductions of investments after unfair trustee actions correlated with the computational Irritability parameter (Spearman's rho=-.37, p<.0001). These investment reductions further served as a dependent variable in a mixed effects model with family adversity, cross-sectional and longitudinal development (and all 2 ways interactions) as predictors. We asked whether such punishment effects impact upon investment behaviour (i.e., the raw choice data). A linear mixed effects model predicting investment reductions after unfair actions by cross-sectional age, longitudinal age and family adversity as well as all 2-way interactions revealed no significant developmental or age effects, but showed a significant effect of family adversity on degree of retaliation, (b=-0.06, SE=0.03, F(1,540.15)=3.98, p=.047, r=.09, see S-, in line with the computational modelling findings.

Family Adversity and the longitudinal development of peer relations
, 36) see Methods). This sampling enabled us to examine whether the development of trust impacts on social relations later in adolescence, including establishing a capacity to form, and maintain, adaptive social relationships (1), in a period of life when individuals need to navigate social environments with greater independence. Thus, our longitudinal approach allowed us to test a hypothesis of whether trust, as measured in the laboratory via a standardized economic game, impacts the development of future social relationships in the longer term, and whether this is moderated by family experiences. Better family experience scores were associated with higher CFQ scores at T1q, but also predicted peer relation
(28, 29
We plot posterior estimates from the linear mixed model analysis. Whilst many participants show a
computational Irritability parameter=0, i.e., do not show this form of un-mentalized retaliation at all, it can
be seen that those with higher family adversity are over-represented with respect to higher Irritability
values
Trust, In our sample, quality of peer relationships was longitudinally assessed at 3 measurement time points
(T1q: around T1 of the task measurement, T2q: mean 1.13 (SD=.30) years after T1, T3q: 2.26 (SD=.262)
after T1q) using the Cambridge Friendship Questionnaire (CFQ, a measure independent of parenting
quality at the latest longitudinal time follow-up time point, ~2.3 years later (T1q: t(377)=-5.863, r=-0.289, p<.0001, T3q: t(377)=-3.305, r=-.168, p=.001). Thus, those with adverse past family experiences reported a lower satisfaction with their current peer relations, and self-report of past family adversity predicted lower satisfaction with future peer relations. This finding lends evidence to the general notion that social experiences across different developmental periods are interdependent, with past experiences impacting successive stages (23).


DiscussionLeveraging a large longitudinal sample of adolescents and young adults we detail typical developmental trajectories in trust behaviour, as well as inter-individual differences therein. Inter-individual differences in dimensions of adolescent trust development are associated with past family adversity and future peer integration. First, we show that trust increases from adolescence into young adulthood. Previous crosssectional studies, involving a comparable age range as our study (i.e., mid-adolescence to adulthood) have shown heterogeneous results, with some studies finding no evidence for age-related changes in trust behaviour
priori trust, longitudinal age and family experiences. Those with higher self-reported family adversity who showed a higher degree of a priori trust at baseline showed the strongest gain in peer relation quality over the longitudinal follow-up period. Longitudinal age was calculated with respect to age when the CFQ was completed (T1q, T2q, T3q)


was delivered as part of a task battery in a sample of community dwellers between the ages of 14 and 24 in Cambridgeshire and London, as part of the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN) project (64). All participants, and where participants were underage their legal guardians, provided written informed consent. The Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee approved the study (12/EE/0250). Data for this task was available from n=570 (285 female) participants for baseline and follow-up. Aspects of the baseline data, with a focus on computational modelling, have been reported previously (12). Participants were 14.10-24.99 years old (mean=19.05, sd=2.96) at baseline. Note that we use the term adolescence for the whole age range, in line with (65). Mean age at follow-up was 20.30 years (range: 15.11-26.48 years, sd=2.98). Mean time between first and second task assessment was 1.48 years (range: 0.99-2.6 years, sd = 0.29). Structural imaging and task data were available (and passed quality assessment) for n=294 participants. A subgroup of participants (n=55) underwent the task three times, allowing for an analysis of retest effects (see SI Methods and (29, 30, 66) for this approach).


to check for potentially deviating results due to the scaling of the computational parameters as outcome variables (Investor Irritability, Belief about Trustee's Irritability). This did not indicate any qualitative deviation from the linear mixed model (see S-Table 6-7 for results of the ordinal mixed models). In all mixed models, gender was included as a covariate, due to previous findings on gender differences in trust development in
adolescence ((12,


; See Supplementary Methods). Here, we observed a significant negative effect of age on right insular grey matter volume (F(1,285.26)=20.22, p<.001). Even more striking was evidence for correlated change of insula volume Given the important role of the Irritability parameter in relation to an enduring impact of family adversity, and paralleling our analysis on social risk aversion, we next tested for an association of Irritability with neurodevelopment of right AI whilst accounting for relevant covariates. We found a significant interaction of cross-sectional age with Irritability (F(1,265.64)=11.42, p<.001) on grey matter volume in right AI. As
and social risk aversion (F(1,180.51)=4.50, p=.035, S-Figure 8). In effect, a within-person developmental
decrease in social risk aversion was also associated with a developmental decrease of insular grey
matter volume, over and above the effect of age. See S-Table S-8 for full output of the model, including
covariates.
Contrary to the specific effects of social risk aversion, correlated change of mean investment behaviour
per se and anterior insula development did not reach significance (F=1, 181.86)=2.60, p=.11). Moreover,
a control analysis in a reference region, the ventral striatum, which had been implicated in social reward
processing in the trust game, and had been linked to early adversity in the rodent and human literature
(93, 94), did not reveal any significant associations with trust behaviour, nor family adversity (all ps
Fs<1.75, all ps>.187).
Irritability is associated with less age-related change in insula grey matter volume
