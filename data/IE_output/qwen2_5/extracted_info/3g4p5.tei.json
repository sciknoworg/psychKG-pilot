    "topic_or_construct": "Explore-exploit dilemma",
    "measured_by": "Multi-armed bandit tasks",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how multi-armed bandit problems assess the explore-exploit dilemma, where participants must choose between exploring new options and exploiting known rewards, with a specific focus on the impact of vanishing options."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Option loss aversion",
    "measured_by": "Vanishing bandit task",
    "justification": "The study utilizes a vanishing bandit task that introduces the possibility of options disappearing if not selected for a certain number of trials, revealing participants' tendency to preserve more options than necessary, indicating loss aversion."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reinforcement learning strategies",
    "measured_by": "Kalman filter model with Thompson sampling",
    "justification": "The reinforcement learning strategy employed by participants is quantitatively analyzed using a Kalman filter model with a Thompson sampling decision rule, which is shown to closely approximate human behavior in the bandit task, except when options can vanish."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Switching behavior",
    "measured_by": "Proportion of trials participants switched options",
    "justification": "The paper measures the tendency of participants to switch between options and compares it to the switching behavior predicted by the Kalman filter model, revealing differences in switching frequencies when option loss is introduced."
