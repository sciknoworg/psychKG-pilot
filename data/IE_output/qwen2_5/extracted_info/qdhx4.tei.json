    "justification": "The reinforcement learning task was used to evaluate risk sensitivity from experience, where participants made repeated choices between stimuli with different reward probabilities, capturing dynamic changes in apparent risk sensitivity."

    "measured_by": "Holt and Laury Method",
    "justification": "The Holt and Laury method was employed to evaluate risk sensitivity in decisions from description, eliciting a series of choices between gambles with varying expected values and variance, thus measuring continuous risk sensitivity."

    "justification": "The DOSPERT scale was administered to measure risk attitudes in more ecologically relevant settings, assessing participants' evaluations of activities on expected benefits, perceived riskiness, and preference for risky activities."
