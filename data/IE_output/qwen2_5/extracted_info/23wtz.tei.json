    "measured_by": "Free-response descriptions and coding",
    "justification": "Participants used free-response descriptions to report their regulation behaviors, which were then coded by blinded raters into categories such as reappraisal, distraction, and suppression. This method was used to capture spontaneous ER strategies used by participants during the haunted house experience in Study 1."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotion Regulation Strategy Choice",
    "measured_by": "Prediction tasks",
    "justification": "In Study 2, participants predicted which strategy they would use (reappraisal or distraction) based on descriptions of emotional events experienced by others in the haunted house. This method was used to assess how individuals forecast their ER strategy choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotion Regulation Strategy Use and Forecasting",
    "measured_by": "Mixed design strategy use/forecast conditions",
    "justification": "Study 3 used a mixed design where participants either reported the strategies they used (strategy use condition) or forecasted the strategy an average person would use (forecast condition) in response to video stimuli. This design allowed for a direct comparison between actual and predicted ER strategies."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Affective Intensity",
    "measured_by": "Self-report ratings on Likert scales",
    "justification": "Participants rated the intensity of their emotions on Likert scales both before and after exposure to stimuli. This self-report method was used to capture subjective emotional intensity as a predictor of ER strategies."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Regulation Success",
    "measured_by": "Self-report ratings of regulation effectiveness",
    "justification": "Participants reported the effectiveness of their ER strategies on subjective scales. This method was used to assess how successful different strategies were in regulating emotions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Load",
    "measured_by": "Remote Associates Test (RAT)",
    "justification": "The RAT was used to assess cognitive load before, during, and after exposure to stimuli. Changes in performance were used as an indicator of participants' cognitive resources throughout the study."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotion Regulation Tendencies",
    "measured_by": "Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)",
    "justification": "The ERQ was used to measure individual differences in ER tendencies, assessing the habitual use of specific strategies like reappraisal and suppression. This scale was included in some studies to control for individual differences."
