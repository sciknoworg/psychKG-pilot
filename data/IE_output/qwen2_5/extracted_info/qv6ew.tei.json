    "justification": "The study used a matching game task with different levels of difficulty to measure how participants chose to explore or exploit based on the Teacher's beliefs about their abilities. Specifically, the participants chose games labeled by the Teacher as 'not hard enough,' 'much too hard,' or 'just right,' which served as a measure of their explore-exploit decisions."

    "measured_by": "Manipulated Teacher statements and game evaluations",
    "justification": "The article mentions that the Teacher's beliefs about the learner's competence were manipulated by displaying the participant's performance on matching games in a manner that either underestimated, overestimated, or accurately represented their capabilities. This manipulation was used to measure how the Teacher's beliefs influenced the participant's subsequent decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Theory of Mind",
    "measured_by": "Participants' first and second choices of games",
    "justification": "The choices of games by participants act as a proxy for assessing their ability to understand and respond to the Teacher's beliefs about their abilities. For instance, participants chose games differently based on whether the Teacher overestimated, underestimated, or accurately assessed their competencies, hinting at their Theory of Mind capabilities."
