  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Intolerance of Uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "IUS-12",
    "justification": "The study validates the IUS-12 among French healthcare professionals, showing that it has two correlated factors: prospective and inhibitory IU. The scale's psychometric quality and factorial structure are supported by the data."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Intolerance of Uncertainty in a Medical Context",
    "measured_by": "IUS-12-H",
    "justification": "The IUS-12-H, adapted for the medical context, measures intolerance of uncertainty specific to healthcare professionals. The validation study demonstrates good psychometric properties and a similar two-factor structure as the IUS-12, with item 3 removed."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty Reaction in Physicians",
    "measured_by": "Physicians' Reactions to Uncertainty (PRU)",
    "justification": "The PRU measures four aspects of uncertainty reactions in physicians. The four-factor structure of the PRU was validated in the study, showing strong convergent validity with the IUS-12 and IUS-12-H scales."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty Tolerance in Medical Education",
    "measured_by": "Tolerance of Ambiguity in Medical Students and Doctors (TAMSAD)",
    "justification": "The TAMSAD measures the intolerance to ambiguity closely related to IU. The study found significant negative correlations between TAMSAD and the IU scales (IUS-12 and IUS-12-H), confirming its divergent validity."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotional Regulation Difficulties",
    "measured_by": "Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS-16)",
    "justification": "The DERS-16 measures difficulties in emotional regulation, which positively correlated with the IU scales. This suggests that those with higher IU also struggle with emotion regulation, indicating a related construct."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived Stress Levels",
    "measured_by": "Perceived Stress Scale (PSS10)",
    "justification": "The PSS10 assesses perceived stress levels, showing significant positive correlations with both IU scales. This indicates that intolerance of uncertainty is associated with higher levels of perceived stress."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Discomfort Intolerance",
    "measured_by": "Discomfort Intolerance Scale (DIS)",
    "justification": "The DIS evaluates discomfort intolerance related to two factors. Its factor 2 showed significant positive correlations with IU, demonstrating convergent validity and confirming the relationship between discomfort and uncertainty intolerance."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Need for Cognition",
    "measured_by": "Need for Cognition Scale (NFCO)",
    "justification": "The NFCO measures the enjoyment of engaging in higher cognitive activities. It showed negative correlations with IU scales, suggesting that individuals with higher IU tend to have lower need for cognition."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Need for Closure",
    "measured_by": "Need for Closure Scale (NFC)",
    "justification": "The NFC measures the cognitive need for definite answers and aversion to ambiguity. It correlated negatively with IU, showing that higher IU is associated with a lower need for closure."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Professional Uncertainty Management in Healthcare",
    "measured_by": "Questionnaire on Uncertainty in the Professional Environment (QIT)",
    "justification": "The QIT evaluates various aspects of professional uncertainty management, showing some item cross-loading with IU scales factors. Its differentiated factor structures provide further insight into uncertainty dynamics in healthcare professionals."
