    "measured_by": "Flanker task",
    "justification": "The Flanker task is used to assess the engagement in cognitive control by requiring participants to monitor conflict and inhibit incongruent information, thus measuring meta-control in cost-benefit analyses."

    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive control and decision-making",
    "measured_by": "two-stage Markov decision task",
    "justification": "The two-stage decision-making task is employed to capture the arbitration between model-free and model-based strategies, assessing participants' ability to weigh cognitive effort against expected value in making meta-control decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "cost-benefit trade-offs in children",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Effort Discounting paradigm",
    "justification": "The paradigm allows for estimating how much reward children are willing to forgo to conserve cognitive effort, thereby measuring their cost-benefit analyses."

    "topic_or_construct": "development of meta-control",
    "measured_by": "demand selection task (DST)",
    "justification": "The DST is used to show children's preference for less demanding tasks and how their meta-control abilities emerge with age when provided with necessary feedback."

    "measured_by": "conflict monitoring task",
    "justification": "Older adults demonstrate greater difficulties in conflict monitoring compared to younger adults, illustrating age-related cognitive control declines."
