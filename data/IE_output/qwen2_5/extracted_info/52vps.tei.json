    "measured_by": "Dual-process model using Dirichlet and multivariate Gaussian distributions",
    "justification": "The study describes using a dual-process model, which incorporates Dirichlet and multivariate Gaussian distributions, to represent frequency-based and value-based decision-making, respectively. This approach captures how participants rely more on frequency-based processing as uncertainty increases, supporting the examination of decision-making under uncertain conditions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reward frequency effects",
    "measured_by": "Decay model, Delta model",
    "justification": "The Decay and Delta models are mentioned as methods to measure reward frequency effects. The Decay model updates the expected value (EV) of an option with a decay rate, reflecting reward frequency sensitivity, while the Delta model updates EV based on recent prediction errors, capturing reward value differences."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value-based decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Multivariate Gaussian distribution",
    "justification": "The multivariate Gaussian distribution is used to estimate the expected value (EV) distribution of each option based on the reward's mean and variance. It captures value-based decision-making by focusing on the average reward values rather than reward frequencies."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Frequency-based decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Dirichlet distribution",
    "justification": "The Dirichlet distribution retains a tally of the number of successes for each option, tracking how many times each option yields a rewarding outcome. It is used to measure frequency-based decision-making by assigning higher probability mass to options that have been rewarded more frequently."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Risk-sensitive Delta model, mean-variance utility model",
    "justification": "The paper utilizes both the risk-sensitive Delta model, which applies asymmetric learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors, and the mean-variance utility model that discounts EV by estimated variance. These tools provide a means to measure participants' sensitivity to risk in decision-making scenarios."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Exploration vs. Exploitation",
    "measured_by": "Inverse log temperature parameter (c)",
    "justification": "The inverse log temperature parameter (c) is used to measure participants' tendency to balance exploration (trying new options) and exploitation (choosing known optimal options). Higher c values indicate a greater tendency to stick with theoretically higher EV options, capturing the decision-making dynamics as uncertainty varies."
