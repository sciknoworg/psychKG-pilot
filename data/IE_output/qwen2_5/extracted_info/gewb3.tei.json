    "justification": "The paper discusses how T D, the decision time, is defined within the drift diffusion framework. It is computed on the basis of parameters like boundaries (a), drift (v), and bias (z). The values of T D were estimated using the DDM and its parameters, indicating its use as a measurement instrument for decision time."

    "measured_by": "Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The paper extensively analyzes T 0, defined as the sum of the time needed to form an internal stimulus representation (T encoding ) and the time needed to execute the response (T response ). The T 0 is estimated using the DDM parameters fitted on RT and PMT data, showing the model's use for measuring T 0."

    "justification": "The paper describes how RT was decomposed into pre-motor time (PMT) and motor time (MT), based on muscle activity onsets revealed by EMG of the responding hand. EMG recordings were used to measure and analyze different phases of RT, demonstrating their use as a method for RT measurement."

    "justification": "The paper uses the DDM fitted on PMT to estimate T encoding, providing a reasonable measure of visual stimulus encoding processes by isolating motor processes. This isolation allows for the analysis of encoding processes independent of motor effects."
