    "measured_by": "Risk preference assessment",
    "justification": "The study assessed risk preference by measuring the proportion of choices of the risky option on decision trials between fixed and risky high-value options versus low-value options, revealing that participants are more risk-seeking for high-value choices over low-value choices when they involve extreme outcomes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Memory for extreme outcomes",
    "measured_by": "First outcome reported test",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to report the 'first outcome that came to mind' for each risky door in memory tests, indicating a greater likelihood of recalling extreme outcomes compared to non-extreme outcomes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Memory for extreme outcomes",
    "measured_by": "Frequency judgment test",
    "justification": "Participants judged the frequency of the occurrence of each potential outcome based on their experience, showing a tendency to report extreme outcomes as having happened more often than non-extreme outcomes, demonstrating better memory for the extreme values."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice behavior with extreme outcomes",
    "measured_by": "Risky choice between extreme and risky options",
    "justification": "Choice behavior was measured by participants' preference for risky options leading to potential high and low extreme outcomes in various decision trials, which revealed more risk-seeking behavior for gains than for losses involving extreme outcomes."
