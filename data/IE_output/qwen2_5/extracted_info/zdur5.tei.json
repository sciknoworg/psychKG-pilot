    "measured_by": "Habit Index (HI)",
    "justification": "The Habit Index (HI) was calculated by contrasting the proportion of responses that are slips of action in Context C2 with that in Context C1, effectively measuring behavioral inflexibility. This measure was used to detect the effect of overtraining on habit strength, showing higher HI values in overtrained participants, especially at early response times."

    "topic_or_construct": "habitual control",
    "measured_by": "custom Stan model",
    "justification": "A custom hierarchical Bayesian model was used to account for the generation of stage 3 response types (correct, slip errors, or random errors), capturing both the probability of engaging in the random strategy and the probability of producing slip errors under the on-task strategy. This model provided insights into the influence of overtraining on slips of action under the on-task strategy."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "goal-directed control",
    "measured_by": "performance accuracy and reaction times",
    "justification": "Participants' accuracy and reaction times were monitored to verify their ability to learn and use goal-directed behaviors effectively during the test phase. This ensured that any deviations from goal-directed control could be interpreted as deviations due to habitual impulses rather than poor learning."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "response inhibition",
    "measured_by": "number of response attempts",
    "justification": "The paradigm allowed for multiple response attempts to minimize response inhibition and encourage participants to make impulsive responses, revealing the influence of habits. Allowing multiple responses was crucial in observing habitual behavior, especially when compared to tasks that allowed only one response."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "hierarchical task structure",
    "measured_by": "embedded choices within a hierarchical multi-step trial structure",
    "justification": "The hierarchical structure was hypothesized to facilitate habit formation by encouraging deliberate selection of abstract plans followed by automated execution, making it less trivial for participants to override habitual impulses with goal-directed control."
