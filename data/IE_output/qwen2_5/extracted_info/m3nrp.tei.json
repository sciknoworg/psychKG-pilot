    "justification": "The paper uses specific items like 'I am angry at the HR specialist/the algorithm's discriminatory actions', 'I am outraged by the HR specialist/the algorithm's discriminatory actions', and 'I am disgusted by the HR specialist/the algorithm's discriminatory actions' to measure moral outrage. This is clearly stated in Study 2, where participants rated their agreement on a 0 to 100 slider for such items."

    "measured_by": "Perceived prejudiced motivation index",
    "justification": "The paper measures perceived prejudiced motivation using a composite index based on items like 'SigmaEvalu8/the HR specialist is sexist' which are averaged to form a Cronbach's \u03b1 reliability score (e.g., \u03b1 = .91 in Study 1). This is explicitly mentioned in the measurement of perceived prejudiced motivation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attribution of Prejudiced Motivation",
    "measured_by": "Items measuring prejudiced motivation",
    "justification": "In various studies, participants were asked how prejudiced they thought the algorithm or human agent was. For instance, in Study 7, participants rated four items to assess perceived prejudiced motivation. The paper notes a significant difference in perceived motivation when comparing algorithms to humans."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived Discrimination",
    "measured_by": "Perceived discrimination index",
    "justification": "Study 1 measured perceived discrimination with three items: 'SigmaEvalu8/the HR specialist discriminated against women', 'SigmaEvalu8/the HR specialist treated people differently according to their gender', and 'SigmaEvalu8/the HR specialist treated men and women differently'. These were averaged to create an index, cited as supporting the construct."

    "measured_by": "Perceived data-driven behavior index",
    "justification": "In Study 1, participants rated items related to objectivity such as 'SigmaEvalu8/the HR specialist is data-driven,' 'SigmaEvalu8/the HR specialist relies on facts,' and 'SigmaEvalu8/the HR specialist is unaffected by personal opinions.' These were averaged to form a Cronbach's \u03b1 reliability index (\u03b1 = .87)."
