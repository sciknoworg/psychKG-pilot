    "justification": "The article employs mouse tracking to measure hand movements during decision-making, specifically to detect hesitation and cognitive processes involved in (un)truthful responses under self-interest temptation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Self-interest concern",
    "measured_by": "Utility model parameter \u03b1",
    "justification": "The utility model's \u03b1 parameter quantifies the relative weight given to monetary payoffs for oneself versus others. It is used to assess an individual's concern for self-interest in decision-making scenarios."

    "measured_by": "Drift rate in Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The drift rate parameter from the DDM is used to indicate the speed of evidence accumulation towards a decision. In conflict trials, the drift rate helps differentiate between cognitive mechanisms for truthful and untruthful responses."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal processing in (dis)honesty",
    "measured_by": "Response Time (RT) analysis",
    "justification": "Response times (RT) are used to analyze the cognitive processing time required for truthful versus untruthful decisions, aiming to identify whether honesty or dishonesty is the default response."

    "topic_or_construct": "Moral tendency",
    "measured_by": "MAD (Maximum Deviation) and AUC (Area Under the Curve) indices",
    "justification": "These indices derived from mouse trajectories are used to reflect the complexity of decision-making patterns, revealing various aspects of a participant's moral inclination during honest and dishonest choices."
