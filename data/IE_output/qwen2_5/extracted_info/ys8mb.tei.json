    "topic_or_construct": "Attention-dependent criterion in perceptual decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Embedded category task",
    "justification": "The embedded category task design, as used by Denison et al., meets both criteria for distinguishing between a fixed and flexible criterion. It incentivizes subjects to shift their decision boundary based on changes in uncertainty, allowing researchers to infer the absolute criterion from task performance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision criterion and uncertainty relationship",
    "measured_by": "Signal Detection Theory (SDT)",
    "justification": "Researchers use SDT to investigate the relationship between the decision variable and decision criterion in detection paradigms, providing a quantitative framework for measuring how decision criteria may be fixed or flexible based on experimental conditions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Conscious perception decision criterion",
    "measured_by": "Subjective inflation phenomenon",
    "justification": "Studies on conscious perception, such as by Rahnev et al., utilize the subjective inflation phenomenon to suggest a fixed decision criterion, where observers report stimuli as seen more often in peripheral or unattended conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty-based decision criterion",
    "measured_by": "Orientation discrimination tasks",
    "justification": "Orientation discrimination tasks with a continuum of stimuli that subjects categorize into learned distributions allow researchers to investigate how attention-dependent uncertainty influences decision criteria and tasks with a determinate stimulus-to-decision variable mapping."
