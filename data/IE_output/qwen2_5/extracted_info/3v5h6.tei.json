    "measured_by": "3D-SDT model",
    "justification": "The paper develops a three-dimensional signal detection theory (3D-SDT) model to mathematically derive and visualize decision rules related to suspect, filler, and rejection memory signals in eyewitness identification tasks. This model is designed to overcome limitations of 2D SDT models by incorporating joint distributions of suspect and filler memory signals."

    "topic_or_construct": "Discriminability of memory signals",
    "measured_by": "d' (discriminability parameter)",
    "justification": "The paper uses the d' measure of discriminability as a key parameter for estimating the mean distance between different memory signal distributions (guilty vs. innocent suspects, etc.). This parameter reflects how well witnesses can distinguish between different types of lineup members, which is crucial for understanding eyewitness identification accuracy."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Lineup fairness",
    "measured_by": "Comparison of suspect and filler memory distributions",
    "justification": "Lineup fairness is measured by whether the memory signals for suspects and fillers follow similar distributions. A 'fair' lineup has the same mean and variance for innocent suspect and filler memory signals, which ensures that the suspect does not academically stand out, as defined by similar likelihoods of identification."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision rules in lineups",
    "measured_by": "MAX decision rule",
    "justification": "The MAX decision rule is used in the 3D-SDT model to predict how witnesses identify the lineup member with the strongest memory signal. This rule is based on the assumption that witnesses identify a lineup member if its memory signal exceeds both the decision criterion and the memory signals of other members."

    "topic_or_construct": "Estimation of model parameters",
    "measured_by": "Equations derived from joint distributions",
    "justification": "The paper derives equations to estimate parameters like decision criterion (\u03b3) and discriminability (d') using probabilities of eyewitness outcomes from lineup data. These equations are based on the joint distributions of suspect and filler memory signals and help quantify key aspects of eyewitness behavior."
