    "measured_by": "Aliveness classification task",
    "justification": "The aliveness classification task was used to assess participants' judgments on whether items were alive or not, replicating Goldberg and Thompson-Schill's (2009) rapid aliveness judgement task. The task involved participants judging the aliveness of different words representing various categories."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Familiarity",
    "measured_by": "Familiarity ratings",
    "justification": "Familiarity ratings were collected to assess how familiar participants were with the stimuli used in the study. Participants were asked to rate their familiarity with each word on a scale from 'very unfamiliar' to 'very familiar', providing insight into the impact of familiarity on aliveness judgements."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Imageability",
    "measured_by": "Imageability ratings",
    "justification": "Imageability ratings were obtained to determine how easy participants found it to visualize each word. Participants rated the ease of visualization on a scale that ranged from 'extremely difficult' to 'extremely easy', providing data on semantic richness and visual accessibility."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Movement characteristics",
    "measured_by": "Movement ratings",
    "justification": "Movement ratings were collected to understand various aspects of movement associated with different categories of items. These ratings covered likelihood of movement, speed, autonomy, and other features, shedding light on how movement influences judgments of aliveness."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Manipulability",
    "measured_by": "Manipulability ratings",
    "justification": "Participants rated the ease with which they could pick up and move objects. The ratings indicated the perceived manipulability of the items, providing insights into the interaction between object attributes and their classification as animate or inanimate."
