    "justification": "The measure of is_dwell on the instruction screen and fs_dwell on the feedback screen were used as proxies for language processing effort and perspective-taking effort, respectively, since they are established measures of cognitive processing effort in various cognitive domains."

    "measured_by": "X-flips and Maximum Deviation",
    "justification": "X-flips indicate the number of reversals in the direction of mouse movements along the horizontal axis, providing a measure of hesitation and indecision. Maximum deviation measures the cognitive pull towards non-selected options, indicating thinking and cognitive competition, making them appropriate metrics for assessing decision-making complexity in ambiguous communicative situations."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perspective Taking Effort",
    "measured_by": "Feedback Screen Dwell Time (fs_dwell)",
    "justification": "The dwell time on the pseudo-confederate's objects on the feedback screen (fs_dwell) was used as a measure of perspective-taking effort. It objectively reflects how much effort listeners exert to consider the speaker's perspective, as longer dwell times suggest greater investment in understanding the speaker's viewpoint."
