    "justification": "The study infers individuals' risk attitudes by observing their decisions in risky gambles, where they choose between a risky option with a potential higher reward and a risk-free option with a guaranteed smaller reward. This approach is based on the subjective expected value calculation and choice behavior, which reflects the individual's attitude towards risk."

    "measured_by": "Choice behavior observation",
    "justification": "The research assesses observational learning through the analysis of choice behavior of individuals when they observe another person making risky decisions. The inference about the observer's understanding of the observed person's risk attitude is based on observing and learning from the visible actions and decisions of the decision-maker during various simulated gambling scenarios."

    "topic_or_construct": "learning rate",
    "measured_by": "Variational Bayesian method and dynamic learning rate adjustments",
    "justification": "The learning rate is dynamically calculated using a variational Bayesian method, which updates the learner\u2019s posterior belief about the observed agent\u2019s risk attitude based on the observed behavior. The learning rate adjusts according to the learner\u2019s uncertainty, reflected in the variance of the posterior belief."

    "topic_or_construct": "Bayesian inference of risk attitudes",
    "measured_by": "Bayesian observer model",
    "justification": "The Bayesian observer model utilizes a generative model of risk-taking behavior to infer the risk attitude of the observed agent from their sequential choices. The model updates its belief about the individual\u2019s risk attitude based on the predicted error between expected and actual choices, suggesting a powerful method for estimating subjective risk attitudes."

    "measured_by": "Inverse reinforcement learning strategy",
    "justification": "The inverse reinforcement learning strategy was used in this context to infer the underlying reward structure and risk preferences of others from their observed behavior. The belief updates are based on prediction errors and are optimized for sequential learning of attitudes across multiple trials."
