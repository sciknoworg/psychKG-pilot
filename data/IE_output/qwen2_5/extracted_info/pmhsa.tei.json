    "justification": "Attentional bias was quantified through SB scores (SBoption, SBzero_outcome, SBnon-zero_outcome) derived from eye-movement recordings, incorporated as empirical attentional bias in the cognitive models to predict choice preference."

    "justification": "Participants completed the Risk Propensity Scale to measure their general risk-taking attitude, which was controlled for in the analysis to examine its effect on decision-making under risky choices."

    "measured_by": "Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis",
    "justification": "Choice preference was analyzed using Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis, comparing different attentional risk aversion (aRA) models to evaluate the impact of attentional biases on choices."

    "justification": "The attention allocation pattern was measured using attentional bias scores calculated from the dwell time within regions of interest for the certain and risky options, as well as their respective outcomes."
