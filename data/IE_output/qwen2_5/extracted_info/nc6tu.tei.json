    "measured_by": "Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT)",
    "justification": "The study consistently used the SRTT to measure reaction times, accuracy, and variability as indicators of motor sequence learning under free-choice conditions across experiments. Data analysis in both experiments showed changes in these measures as participants developed motor skills."

    "topic_or_construct": "Implicit Learning",
    "measured_by": "Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT)",
    "justification": "The SRTT was employed to examine implicit learning by determining if participants were able to improve their performance without explicit knowledge of the task's underlying structure. This is supported by findings from patient studies where performance improvements were observed despite an inability to verbally articulate the trained sequence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Preference Formation",
    "measured_by": "Proportion of High-Frequent Choices",
    "justification": "Experiment 2 documented a significant increase in the proportion of high-frequent choices over training conditions, suggesting that participants developed preferences for specific stimulus-response pairs within the provided sequences, highlighting the emergence of choice preferences through repetitive biased selections."
