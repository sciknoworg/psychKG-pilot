    "justification": "The WCST is commonly used to measure cognitive flexibility, an executive function that allows the switching between different behavioral strategies depending on external and internal conditions, as mentioned in the introduction and methods sections."

    "topic_or_construct": "goal-directed behavior",
    "measured_by": "Wisconsin Cards Sorting Test (WCST)",
    "justification": "The WCST assesses goal-directed behavior, particularly the flexible generation of effective associations between perceptions and actions. This is elaborated in the context throughout the paper as the test's primary purpose."

    "topic_or_construct": "executive functions",
    "measured_by": "Wisconsin Cards Sorting Test (WCST)",
    "justification": "The WCST is described as a neuropsychological test that measures various aspects of executive functions, including cognitive flexibility, decision-making, and working memory."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "working memory",
    "measured_by": "Wisconsin Cards Sorting Test (WCST)",
    "justification": "The WCST places strong demands on working memory, as it involves remembering and updating rules, as discussed in the sections about cognitive components and neural correlates."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Wisconsin Cards Sorting Test (WCST)",
    "justification": "The WCST requires participants to decide on card matching rules based on feedback, making it a tool to study decision-making processes, as noted in several sections analyzing model behavior."
