    "justification": "The article describes that in Study 1, latitudes were assessed by providing participants with a range of possible attitudes that other people might hold. Participants used sliders to mark the boundaries of their latitudes of acceptance on a 1-to-7 Likert scale, indicating the highest and lowest points considered acceptable. This method was described as assessing latitudes 'in the abstract' or 'decontextualized.'"

    "justification": "In Studies 2 and 3, the article introduces a new method for measuring 'contextualized' latitudes. Participants made judgments about the reasonableness and tolerance of opinions held by specific individuals rather than abstract opinions. This was done by presenting participants with hypothetical individuals holding specific opinions and asking whether those opinions were reasonable or acceptable."
