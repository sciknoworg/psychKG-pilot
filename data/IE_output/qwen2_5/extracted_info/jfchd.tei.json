    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Load",
    "measured_by": "Lexico-semantic task with high and low load conditions",
    "justification": "The study employed a Lexico-semantic task where words were presented under high-load (capital letters) and low-load (lowercase letters) conditions to assess cognitive load's effect on decision-making in L1 and L2."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotional Involvement",
    "measured_by": "Presenting negative and neutral words",
    "justification": "Emotional involvement was measured through the presentation of negative versus neutral words to trigger different levels of emotional processing which were then mapped to neural activation patterns."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Dorsal Striatum Activation",
    "measured_by": "fMRI scanning in response to gambling rewards",
    "justification": "The dorsal striatum was activated in response to cognitive load during gambling trials, indicating its role in reinforcement learning and reward evaluation in the context of bilingual decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Insula Activation",
    "measured_by": "fMRI scanning under different language and cognitive load conditions",
    "justification": "The insula\u2019s activation was measured using fMRI while participants performed tasks in L1 and L2 under various cognitive load conditions, revealing its role in emotional processing."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Amygdala Activation",
    "measured_by": "fMRI scanning in response to emotional stimuli",
    "justification": "The activation of the amygdala was captured using fMRI scans when participants processed negative and neutral words, highlighting its role in emotional reactions during decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Parahippocampal Gyrus Activation",
    "measured_by": "fMRI scanning under cognitive load in L2 context",
    "justification": "The parahippocampal gyrus activation was monitored using fMRI to evaluate memory processes involved in semantic access under cognitive load in the L2 context, especially when processing emotionally-neutral words."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Attitude",
    "measured_by": "Risk Attitude Scale",
    "justification": "The Risk Attitude Scale, ranging from conservative to adventure, was used to measure participants' general risk propensity, providing a baseline to correlate with neural measures during gambling tasks."
