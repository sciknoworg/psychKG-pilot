    "measured_by": "chimeric face procedure",
    "justification": "The chimeric face procedure, where participants choose between faces with emotional and neutral sides, was used to infer a preference for emotional processing in the right hemisphere (Levy, Heller, Banich & Burton, 1983)."

    "topic_or_construct": "visual search performance",
    "measured_by": "visual search paradigm",
    "justification": "The visual search paradigm with feature integration theory was employed to study asymmetries in visual search performance, demonstrating a robust effect for detecting targets defined by feature presence (Wolfe, 2001)."

    "topic_or_construct": "dual-task benefit",
    "measured_by": "telephonic message monitoring and doodling task",
    "justification": "Andrade (2010) used a dual-task set-up involving monitoring a telephonic message while doodling, but the current study found a dual-task decrement instead of the expected benefit."

    "topic_or_construct": "schema influence on memory",
    "measured_by": "house perspective narrative task",
    "justification": "The perspective narrative task utilized in Pichert & Anderson (1976) involved participants imagining a house scenario as a buyer or burglar to test the influence of schema on memory."

    "measured_by": "object encoding and recognition task",
    "justification": "Brady et al. (2008)'s object-based task involved participants viewing and counting object repetitions to assess the level of detail retained in long-term memory."

    "topic_or_construct": "feedback effects on learning",
    "measured_by": "trivia retention feedback conditions",
    "justification": "A trivia retention task with different feedback conditions (correct/incorrect or no feedback) as described by Pashler et al. (2015) was used to evaluate retention effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "decision-making in games",
    "measured_by": "Rock, Paper, Scissors game",
    "justification": "The study by Dyson et al. (2016) used a Rock, Paper, Scissors game to examine sub-optimal decision-making and operant conditioning principles such as lose-shift in participants."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "mental rotation",
    "measured_by": "shape categorization task",
    "justification": "Cooper & Shepard (1973) devised a shape categorization task to determine if mental rotation effort is analogous to physical rotation effort, showing reaction time differences based on degree of rotation."
