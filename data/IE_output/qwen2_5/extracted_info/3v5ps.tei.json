    "measured_by": "intertemporal choice task",
    "justification": "The intertemporal choice task is described as widely used in both humans and non-human animals to measure self-control. It involves choices between options that differ in delay and magnitude, with successful self-control being defined as choosing larger options with greater delay or effort costs over smaller, sooner rewards."

    "topic_or_construct": "self-control",
    "measured_by": "diet choice task",
    "justification": "The diet choice task is cited as a successful paradigm in which poor self-control is defined as choosing the tastier but less healthy item over a more nutritious alternative. This measure is used particularly in studies on humans and food-related decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "self-control",
    "measured_by": "reverse contingency tasks",
    "justification": "Reverse contingency tasks require animals to point to one of two rewards to obtain the other, assessing the animals\u2019 ability to override their immediate impulse for self-controlled decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "self-control",
    "measured_by": "accumulation tasks",
    "justification": "Accumulation tasks evaluate an animal's capacity to inhibit taking a reward that is continuously building, reflecting their self-control in delaying gratification for a larger reward."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "self-control",
    "measured_by": "exchange tasks",
    "justification": "Exchange tasks measure an animal's self-control by requiring them to keep a small reward for a while before trading it back for a larger reward, assessing the inhibition of the impulse to consume immediately."
