    "measured_by": "Iowa Gambling Task (IGT)",
    "justification": "The passage mentions that endogenous testosterone accounted for decision-making in the uncertainty phase of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), indicating its use in measuring risk-taking under framing."

    "measured_by": "Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)",
    "justification": "The article describes how females showed a positive relationship between baseline endogenous testosterone levels and decreased risk aversion, and the study by Ronay (2018) did not find the 2D:4D ratio mediating testosterone levels and risk-taking in the BART."

    "measured_by": "Willingness to Accept (WTA) and Willingness to Pay (WTP) ratio",
    "justification": "The text explicitly uses the WTA/WTP ratio to measure the endowment effect, identifying a higher ratio (WTA/WTP > 1) as a marker for this psychological construct."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk-taking behavior",
    "measured_by": "Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT)",
    "justification": "The study applies a modified CPT model to investigate how decisions under risk are influenced by testosterone. The paper specifies the CPT parameters used and how they fit into the Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach."
