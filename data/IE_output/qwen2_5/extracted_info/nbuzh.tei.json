    "justification": "The article mentions 'thought probes' presented to participants with 'responses given on a 4-point Likert scale' were used to measure the level of mind wandering. This connection is justified as the thought probes specifically ask about the participants' attention state during the SART task."

    "topic_or_construct": "executive control",
    "measured_by": "Timed Racing Diffusion Model (TRDM)",
    "justification": "The TRDM is used to measure parameters related to executive control, such as the rate for correctly identifying target (nogo) stimuli (\u03b3 nogo|nogo). The TRDM captures executive control needed to inhibit habitual responses to infrequent target stimuli, as explained in the context of mind wandering."

    "topic_or_construct": "selective attention",
    "measured_by": "Timed Racing Diffusion Model (TRDM)",
    "justification": "The TRDM parameters, including the mismatching rate (\u03b3 go|nogo) for non-target stimuli, reflect the participant's ability to selectively attend to task-relevant information. Variations in these parameters allow the study of selective attention, especially in the context of mind wandering."
