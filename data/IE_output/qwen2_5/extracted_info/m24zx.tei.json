    "topic_or_construct": "Optimism in uncertain decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Value weight (\u03b5)",
    "justification": "The study defines value weight as a parameter that captures the extent to which an individual is optimistic or pessimistic about the outcome value in vague gambles. Participants with \u03b5 > 0.5 were identified as more optimistic, indicating that they valued vague gambles higher than their expected value."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Aversion",
    "measured_by": "Risk preference (\u03c1)",
    "justification": "Participants' risk aversion was measured using a parameter \u03c1 in the mean-variance model, with estimates indicating that individuals were on average risk averse (\u03c1 < 0). This suggests that participants tend to avoid risky gambles with higher variability."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Ambiguity Aversion",
    "measured_by": "Ambiguity aversion (\u03b2)",
    "justification": "Ambiguity aversion was quantified by the parameter \u03b2, with participants showing a general aversion to ambiguous gambles (\u03b2 > 0). This means that individuals were less likely to choose gambles with unknown probabilities."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Dispersion Aversion",
    "measured_by": "Dispersion preference (\u03b1)",
    "justification": "Dispersion preference \u03b1 was used to measure sensitivity to the range of possible outcomes in vague gambles. Participants were found to be dispersion averse (\u03b1 < 0), meaning they disliked options with a wider range of possible values."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Realistic optimism",
    "measured_by": "Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R)",
    "justification": "The Revised Life Orientation Test was used to assess participants' self-reported optimism. However, this measure of optimism was not correlated with individuals' optimistic valuation of vague gambles, suggesting that these forms of optimism operate independently."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Impulsivity",
    "measured_by": "Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11)",
    "justification": "Impulsivity was evaluated using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. This measure was not correlated with ambiguity aversion or risk preference, indicating a distinct construct separate from these decision-making parameters."
