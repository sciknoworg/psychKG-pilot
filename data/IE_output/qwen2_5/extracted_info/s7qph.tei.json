    "justification": "The Empathy Selection Task was used to measure participants' choices between empathy-related and non-empathy-related tasks, allowing researchers to assess how motivational variables influence willingness to engage in empathy. Participants chose between different card decks like 'FEEL-OTHER' or 'FEEL-SELF,' indicating their empathetic responses."

    "justification": "IAPS images were presented during the Empathy Selection Task to evoke specific emotional responses, enabling researchers to study the participants' empathic reactions to standardized stimuli. These images are normed on valence scales, which helps in understanding the emotional impact of the task."
