    "topic_or_construct": "Pro-Black Bias in Social Judgment",
    "measured_by": "Academic Honor Society Admission Paradigm",
    "justification": "The paradigm involved participants making accept/reject decisions for applicants (Black and White) to an honor society, assessing differential criteria for selection. Observations confirmed a pro-Black bias where participants were more likely to accept Black candidates given similar qualifications, despite pro-White attitudes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Explicit Racial Attitudes",
    "measured_by": "Symbolic Racism 2000 Scale and Single-Item Preference Measure",
    "justification": "The Symbolic Racism 2000 scale and a single-item racial preference measure were used to evaluate participants' explicit attitudes towards Whites vs. Blacks. Both measures consistently indicated pro-White preferences but were weakly related to the observed pro-Black behavioral bias."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Implicit Racial Attitudes",
    "measured_by": "Implicit Association Test (IAT) and Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT)",
    "justification": "Implicit racial attitudes were measured using the IAT and BIAT, which revealed pro-White biases on average. Despite these pro-White implicit biases, participants still showed a pro-Black bias in the decision-making task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Internal and External Motivation to Control Prejudice",
    "measured_by": "Internal and External Motivation to Control Prejudice Scale",
    "justification": "The scale assessed participants' motivations to control prejudiced responses. While internal motivation showed a small correlation with criterion bias, external motivation was not reliably associated with it."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Affirmative Action Attitudes",
    "measured_by": "Affirmative Action Measure",
    "justification": "Participants' support for affirmative action policies was assessed through specific items. This measure showed some correlation with criterion bias but could not fully account for the pro-Black bias observed."
