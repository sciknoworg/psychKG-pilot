    "justification": "The article discusses using evidence accumulation models to study various aspects of human social cognition, highlighting several advantages and outlining how these models can offer a principled way to combine speed and accuracy, allowing more precise conclusions compared to traditional methods (Parker & Ramsey, 2023)."

    "measured_by": "Evidence Accumulation Models",
    "justification": "The paper utilizes evidence accumulation models to investigate the relationship between spatial attention and the preparation of eye movements in social and non-social cueing tasks, showing that drift rate can separate response caution from task difficulty, allowing for detailed analyses of attentional orienting (Parker & Ramsey, 2023)."

    "measured_by": "Evidence Accumulation Models",
    "justification": "Evidence accumulation models are suggested as a tool to understand social information processing, particularly complex social phenomena like discrimination based on attractiveness, with a study by Axt and Johnson (2021) using DDM to reveal biases in decision-making processes."

    "topic_or_construct": "social factors modulating decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Evidence Accumulation Models",
    "justification": "Within the domain of gaze-mediated orienting, studies like those reviewed indicate that factors such as gender, age, and personality influence attention. Evidence accumulation models allow quantification of the magnitude of these effects on the underlying cognitive constructs (Dalmaso et al., 2020)."

    "topic_or_construct": "individual differences in social cognitive processes",
    "measured_by": "Evidence Accumulation Models",
    "justification": "Evidence accumulation models provide a method to examine individual differences by comparing the best fitting model across individuals. This allows researchers to identify specific aspects of decision-making that characterize different patterns of performance, revealing the diversity of cognitive processes underlying social cognition (Evans & Wagenmakers, 2020)."
