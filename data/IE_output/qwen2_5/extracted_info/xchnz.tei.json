    "justification": "The hierarchical Bayesian models used in these projects make strong predictions about the relationships between brain activity and the speed of decision-making. These models typically make use of the drift-diffusion model (DDM) as their generative model of choice and reaction time data."

    "measured_by": "Neurocognitive Variational Autoencoder (NCVA)",
    "justification": "This novel approach can allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the triplet relationship between behavior, brain activity, and cognitive processes. Importantly, our NCVA enables both the prediction of EEG signals given behavioral data and the estimation of cognitive model parameters from EEG signals."

    "measured_by": "EEG",
    "justification": "The original study (Nunez et al., 2019) found strong relationships between N200 latency and choice-RT, and thus the N200 is a good validation of our model."

    "justification": "Behavioral measures, such as accuracy and speed of responses, reflect latent cognitive processes that underlie decision making that are not observed directly and must be inferred by cognitive models."

The bias towards correct or incorrect responses is fixed at 0.5, that is, the starting point is always unbiased."
