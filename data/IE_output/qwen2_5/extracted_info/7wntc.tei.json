    "topic_or_construct": "Peer influence in risky decision making",
    "measured_by": "Risky Decision Making Task",
    "justification": "The study uses a risky decision-making task that includes different choice options varying in monetary payout and odds of winning. This task is used to measure participants' risk preferences and peer-influenced decision-making, quantifying individual risk attitudes in adults and adolescents."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk preference",
    "measured_by": "Alpha parameter in computational model",
    "justification": "The study employs a computational model to estimate the Alpha parameter, which quantifies individual risk attitudes. A value of Alpha < 1 indicates risk aversion, showing how participants prefer safe options over risky ones with equal expected value."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Perspective taking",
    "measured_by": "Opposite and Desired Opposite conditions",
    "justification": "The Desired Opposite condition involves making decisions from a friend's perspective, while the Opposite condition involves making decisions for oneself. By contrasting these conditions, the study measures how participants weigh their friends' outcomes relative to their own, indicating their perspective-taking abilities."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Weighting of friend's outcome",
    "measured_by": "Weightfriend parameter in computational model",
    "justification": "The Weightfriend parameter represents how much participants value their friends' outcomes relative to their own, indicating the extent to which they incorporate friends' preferences in their decision-making process."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Accuracy of beliefs about peer preferences",
    "measured_by": "Comparison of Friend Predicted and Baseline conditions",
    "justification": "Participants' predictions about their friends' risk preferences in the Friend Predicted condition are compared with the actual choices made by their friends in the Baseline condition to measure the accuracy of these beliefs."
