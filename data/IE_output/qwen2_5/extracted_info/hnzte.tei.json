    "measured_by": "16S rRNA Metagenomics",
    "justification": "The composition of the microbiome was assessed using 16S rRNA metagenomics on stool samples, which allowed the researchers to characterize alpha and beta diversity as well as bacterial composition at various taxonomic levels, providing detailed information on the gut microbial community."

    "topic_or_construct": "Circulating Large Neutral Amino Acids (LNAA) Levels",
    "measured_by": "Blood Sample Analysis",
    "justification": "Blood samples were analyzed to assess levels of large neutral amino acids such as tyrosine and tryptophan, which are precursors of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, known to impact social decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Altruistic Punishment Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Rejection Rates in Ultimatum Game",
    "justification": "The tendency for participants to inflict altruistic punishments was measured as rejection rates for unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game, indicating changes in social decision-making behavior over time."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Dopamine Precursor Levels",
    "measured_by": "Tyrosine Plasma Levels",
    "justification": "The study measured tyrosine plasma levels as an indicator of dopamine precursor availability, which was linked to changes in altruistic punishment behavior following the dietary intervention."

    "measured_by": "Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) Ratio",
    "justification": "The F/B ratio was used as an indicator of baseline intestinal homeostasis, with a higher ratio linked to a greater impact of the dietary intervention on gut microbiome composition and social behavior."
