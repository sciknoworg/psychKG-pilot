    "topic_or_construct": "Fear of Movement-related Pain (FMRP)",
    "measured_by": "Eyeblink Startle Modulation",
    "justification": "The eyeblink startle modulation was used extensively in the reviewed studies to measure conditioned fear responses. It is an established proxy for measuring FMRP, as the startle response is increased when participants are exposed to a threatening stimulus associated with pain."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fear of Movement-related Pain (FMRP)",
    "measured_by": "Autonomic Responses (Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Skin Conductance)",
    "justification": "Autonomic responses represent physiological measures of fear and avoidance behavior. Studies showed significant changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, and skin conductance when participants were exposed to fear-evoking stimuli, providing reliable indicators of FMRP across different paradigms."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fear of Movement-related Pain (FMRP)",
    "measured_by": "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)",
    "justification": "fMRI studies mapped the neural correlates of FMRP, revealing activations in brain areas associated with pain processing, fear, and avoidance. These imaging results provided insights into the neural mechanisms underlying FMRP and its subconstructs like fear of reinjury and fear-avoidance beliefs."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fear of Movement-related Pain (FMRP)",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral Outcome Measures (Response Latency, Deviation from Intended Movements)",
    "justification": "Behavioral measures such as response latency and deviations from intended movements were used to assess avoidance tendencies. Participants with higher FMRP exhibited longer response latencies and greater deviations, reflecting the impact of fear on motor behavior in the presence of pain-related stimuli."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fear of (Re)injury",
    "measured_by": "Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)",
    "justification": "The TSK is used to assess fear of (re)injury. In several studies, its scores were correlated with neural activations, indicating a link between a higher fear of reinjury and specific brain responses to fear-inducing stimuli."
