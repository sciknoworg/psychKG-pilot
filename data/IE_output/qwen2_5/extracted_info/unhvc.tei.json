    "justification": "The article describes that the Cultural Consensus Theory for two-dimensional location judgments (CCT-2D) estimates the latent cultural truths of locations on maps and considers informants' competence and item difficulty. This method is specifically tailored to infer cultural consensus knowledge for unknown locations based on informants' judgments in x- and y-coordinates."

    "measured_by": "Logarithm of Competence Parameters (log E_i)",
    "justification": "The article mentions that informants' competence is modeled using the logarithm of competence parameters (log E_i). Lower values of log E_i indicate higher competence, as it reflects the variance of individual judgments around the cultural truth."

    "topic_or_construct": "Item Difficulty",
    "measured_by": "Vector-Valued Item Difficulty Parameters (\u03bb_k)",
    "justification": "The text explains that item difficulty is modeled using vector-valued parameters (\u03bb_k) for each item, with separate difficulty levels for x- and y-dimensions, reflecting the relative ease or difficulty of locating each item."

    "topic_or_construct": "Correlation of Judgment Errors Between Dimensions",
    "measured_by": "Error Correlation Parameters (\u03c1_k)",
    "justification": "The paper notes that judgment errors may correlate between the x- and y-dimensions for each item, which is captured by the error correlation parameters (\u03c1_k), extending the traditional one-dimensional model to account for spatial relationships."
