    "measured_by": "Trust calibration",
    "justification": "Trust calibration enables human experts to effectively apply their knowledge, leading to improved decision outcomes. However, trust calibration alone is insufficient to enhance AI-assisted decision-making; it also relies on the unique knowledge that humans can contribute to complement AI's shortcomings."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision quality",
    "measured_by": "Consumer trust and acceptance",
    "justification": "The precision of AI-generated information can influence consumer trust and acceptance of AI recommendations. The use of precise information formats results in higher evaluations and behavioral intentions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "AI-supported decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Trust in AI recommendations",
    "justification": "The interaction between AI and human supervision raises an important question: how does this collaboration affect the quality of decision-making? While AI can aid quick decisions through its analytical capabilities, there is a risk that such efficiency may limit deep understanding and creative thinking."

    "topic_or_construct": "Ethical decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Factors of dignity, justice, and doctor-patient relationship",
    "justification": "When incorporating AI into decision-making processes, factors such as dignity, justice, and the doctor-patient relationship must be carefully considered. The use of AI in decision-making can potentially challenge the principles of interactional justice and raise concerns about dehumanization."
