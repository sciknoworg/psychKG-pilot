    "topic_or_construct": "compositional generalization",
    "measured_by": "artificial language learning paradigm",
    "justification": "The study used an artificial language learning paradigm to assess participants' ability to infer and generalize compositional word meanings by manipulating affixation rules. This method directly measures the core psychological construct of compositional generalization."

    "topic_or_construct": "reliance on sequential order rules",
    "measured_by": "semantic priming task",
    "justification": "The semantic priming task measured participants' reaction times when primed with pseudo-words under different conditions (congruent, incongruent, mismatch). It assessed whether participants applied sequential order rules during real-time semantic processing."

    "topic_or_construct": "sequential order rule-based building behavior",
    "measured_by": "posttest assessment",
    "justification": "The posttest was used to explicitly assess participants' understanding of the compositional rules and categorize them into BUILDers or MIXers based on their ability to apply sequential order rules."

    "topic_or_construct": "general nonverbal intelligence",
    "measured_by": "Matrix Reasoning Test",
    "justification": "The Matrix Reasoning Test was employed to measure nonverbal intelligence, which was found to be a significant predictor of BUILDing behavior in the artificial language learning task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "receptive vocabulary skills",
    "measured_by": "Receptive Vocabulary Test",
    "justification": "The Receptive Vocabulary Test assessed participants' vocabulary size, which correlated with their tendency to adopt BUILDing strategies in inferring compositional meanings."

    "topic_or_construct": "linguistic rule generalization",
    "measured_by": "individual difference measures (working memory, grammar skills)",
    "justification": "Even though these measures did not directly correlate with BUILDing behavior, the non-linguistic working memory and grammar tests helped understand the broader cognitive context related to linguistic generalization."
