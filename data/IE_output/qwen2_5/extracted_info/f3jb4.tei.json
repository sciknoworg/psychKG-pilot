    "topic_or_construct": "AI Penalization effect",
    "measured_by": "Hypothetical compensation scenarios",
    "justification": "The article describes several studies where participants were asked to decide on hypothetical compensations for workers who either used AI or not. This method was used to measure the AI Penalization effect, which is the tendency of people to reduce worker compensation when workers use AI. The scenarios controlled for variables like worker status, type of work, and timing of payment to isolate the effect of AI use on compensation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Credit Deservingness",
    "measured_by": "Three-item scale",
    "justification": "The article specifies that credit deservingness was measured using a three-item scale where participants rated: (1) how much credit the worker deserves for the output; (2) how responsible the worker is for the output; and (3) how important the worker's role was. These items were averaged to reflect a composite index of credit deservingness, supporting its role as a mediator between AI use and reduced compensation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Permissibility of Compensation Reduction",
    "measured_by": "Manipulated scenarios involving contracts vs. past behavior",
    "justification": "The permissibility of reducing compensation was manipulated in Study 4. In this study, researchers presented scenarios where compensation reductions were either less permissible (due to employment contract stipulations) or more permissible (based on past behavior). This manipulation allowed the researchers to examine its moderating effect on the AI Penalization effect via credit deservingness."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Workers' Use of AI",
    "measured_by": "Scenario manipulation and real AI use",
    "justification": "The article used various means to measure workers' AI use, including manipulating scenarios to inform participants whether workers used AI or not. Additionally, in Study 6, real workers used AI (ChatGPT) to create social media posts, and managers were told whether AI was used. These methods effectively isolated and measured the impact of AI use on subsequent compensation decisions."
