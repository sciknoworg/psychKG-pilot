    "measured_by": "Ratings of control and intentionality on 7-point scales",
    "justification": "The paper reports using 7-point scales for subjects to rate the control and intentionality of different mental states such as emotions, desires, beliefs, and evaluations. This methodology is used to assess the degree to which ordinary people view these mental states as controllable and intentional."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotions",
    "measured_by": "Subjects' ratings of control and intentionality",
    "justification": "In Studies 1-3, the research found that emotions, such as anger or happiness, were rated lower on controllability compared to other mental states such as desires and beliefs, though still higher than uncontrollable reactions like shivering. These ratings were collected through subjects' assessments of the mental states on control and intentionality scales."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Desires",
    "measured_by": "Subjects' ratings of control and intentionality",
    "justification": "Across Studies 1-3, desires, like wanting or craving, were judged as less controlled than beliefs and evaluations but more so than emotions, suggesting people perceive desires as moderately controllable based on their ratings using the 7-point scale."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Beliefs",
    "measured_by": "Subjects' ratings of control and intentionality",
    "justification": "In similar fashion to other mental states, beliefs like thinking something is true, were rated by subjects on scales assessing control and intentionality. Beliefs were perceived as highly controllable mental states relative to emotions and desires."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Evaluations",
    "measured_by": "Subjects' ratings of control and intentionality",
    "justification": "Evaluations, such as loving or hating, were compared with other mental states. Subjects rated these evaluations similarly to beliefs in terms of controllability and intentionality, showing a moderate-to-high degree of perceived control."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Responsibility and Blame for Mental States",
    "measured_by": "Ratings of responsibility and blameworthiness on 7-point scales",
    "justification": "The studies measured how much subjects thought a person was responsible or blameworthy for holding particular mental states by asking them to rate these constructs on a 7-point scale. The ratings revealed that higher perceived control of mental states was associated with higher attributions of responsibility and blame."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Character Relevance of Mental States",
    "measured_by": "Judgments on how much mental states reveal about a person's character",
    "justification": "Subjects were asked to rate how much a mental state revealed about a person's moral character. These ratings showed a correlation with perceived control, suggesting that more controlled mental states were seen as more indicative of a person's character."
