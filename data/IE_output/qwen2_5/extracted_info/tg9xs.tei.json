    "justification": "The study uses a composite measure of moral character based on eight traits, 'trustworthy', 'fair', 'kind', 'prudent', 'dishonest' (R), 'unjust' (R), 'mean' (R), and 'irresponsible' (R), taken from character traits studied by Dahlsgaard, Peterson, & Seligman (2005)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Emotional investment of donors",
    "measured_by": "Composite of emotional investment items",
    "justification": "In Study 2, participants rated the emotional investment on three items such as 'Who do you think feels a stronger personal connection with animals?', forming a composite measure. The scale reliability was high (\u03b1 = .88)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived praiseworthiness",
    "measured_by": "Vignette comparison rating scale",
    "justification": "Praiseworthiness was measured using a 11-point scale (-5 to 5) where participants were asked to compare two acts within a vignette (e.g., 'Which of these two acts do you think was more morally praiseworthy?'). This method allows direct comparison of the perceived praiseworthiness of the acts."

    "measured_by": "Self-report scale on time and money associations",
    "justification": "In Study 2, a novel self-report scale was used to measure individual differences in the belief that time is a deeper reflection of the self compared to money. The scale reliability was found to be acceptable (\u03b1 = .66)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Utilitarian tendencies",
    "measured_by": "Oxford Utilitarianism Scale",
    "justification": "The Oxford Utilitarianism Scale was used to measure individual differences in utilitarianism, comprising two components: impartial beneficence and instrumental sacrifice. The scale included items like 'People should care about the well-being of all equally' and showed satisfactory reliability (\u03b1 = .73 and .77)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Interpersonal moral judgments",
    "measured_by": "Trait ratings on moral and psychological attributes",
    "justification": "Study 3 utilized multiple regression models where participants rated various interpersonal judgments, such as 'morality', 'trustworthy', or 'fun', based on hypothetical donor profiles. These measures were used to evaluate the perceived moral character of the donor in dating and employment contexts."
