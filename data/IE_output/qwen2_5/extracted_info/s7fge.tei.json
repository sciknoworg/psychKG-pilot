    "measured_by": "mathematical model with affective vectors",
    "justification": "The article defines telotopic negentropy as a function of the angular dispersion between affective vectors and the telos, balance between conative and inhibitory forces, and a primacy coefficient. This formal definition enables the measurement of emotional coherence and alignment toward the hierarchical telos."

    "topic_or_construct": "emotional alignment",
    "measured_by": "telotopic negentropy metric",
    "justification": "The telotopic negentropy metric quantifies how well an individual's emotional forces (both conative and inhibitory) are aligned with the situational goal or telos. The higher the telotopic negentropy value, the greater the emotional alignment."

    "measured_by": "telotopic negentropy framework",
    "justification": "Obedience is conceptualized as the maximization of telotopic negentropy, where emotional forces are coherently aligned toward a shared command or role expectation within the hierarchical interaction. This framework measures the degree of coherence and affective alignment."
