    "topic_or_construct": "Trustworthiness/Communion",
    "measured_by": "Low-dimensional face ratings and spontaneous content taxonomy",
    "justification": "The article mentions that dimensionality reduction of face ratings across numerous traits results in two relatively orthogonal evaluative dimensions: Trustworthiness/Communion and Dominance, even across 41 countries. It further leverages a spontaneous content taxonomy to better capture face impressions, suggesting that these constructs are central and measured with both traditional scales and more nuanced, data-driven approaches."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Dominance/Agency",
    "measured_by": "Low-dimensional face ratings and spontaneous content taxonomy",
    "justification": "Dominance, linked to Agency, is described as one of the orthogonal dimensions resulting from face ratings. The taxonomy developed in the study includes these dimensions, suggesting a broader conceptualization of face impressions beyond traditional measures."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Facial Youthfulness",
    "measured_by": "Spontaneous content taxonomy",
    "justification": "Recent models have advanced additional dimensions, such as youthfulness. The taxonomy introduced in the article likely captures this dimension in face impressions through open-ended measures and AI text analysis, expanding beyond limited low-dimensional models."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Facial Femininity",
    "measured_by": "Spontaneous content taxonomy",
    "justification": "The taxonomy also likely includes facial femininity as a dimension, as recent models have advanced additional dimensions like femininity. The study's approach using AI-generated face photographs and text analysis is intended to provide a nuanced taxonomy covering these recently developed dimensions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Morality",
    "measured_by": "Dictionary coding",
    "justification": "The dictionary coding method used in the study includes 'Morality' as one of the assessed dimensions. This measurement tool helps to evaluate the prevalence and directionality of morality impressions in face judgments."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Sociability",
    "measured_by": "Dictionary coding and text embeddings",
    "justification": "The article notes that Sociability is one of the prevalence dimensions derived from dictionary coding and text embeddings analyses. This suggests that these tools effectively capture Sociability impressions within the taxonomy."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Ability",
    "measured_by": "Dictionary coding",
    "justification": "Dictionary coding was used to identify the prevalence of dimensions like Ability in face impressions. These dictionaries consist of words semantically associated with the dimension, aiding in the assessment of face-related abilities."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Assertiveness",
    "measured_by": "Dictionary coding",
    "justification": "Assertiveness was included as one of the dimensions in the dictionary coding method, capturing its prevalence in face impressions and allowing for an evaluation of the directionality of these impressions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Health",
    "measured_by": "Dictionary coding",
    "justification": "The dictionary coding approach included Health as a dimension, assessing its prevalence in face impressions. The study's findings suggest that Health is a relevant dimension, though it may not arise spontaneously as frequently as some others."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Uniqueness",
    "measured_by": "Dictionary coding and text embeddings",
    "justification": "The taxonomy includes Uniqueness as a dimension, measured using dictionary coding and text embeddings. This dimension reflects how perceivers assess the distinctiveness of a face, though it may occur less frequently than more prevalent dimensions like Appearance and Sociability."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotion",
    "measured_by": "Dictionary coding and text embeddings",
    "justification": "Text embeddings and dictionary coding were employed to measure the Emotion dimension of face impressions, identifying its prevalence and facilitating the characterization of its direction in face evaluation."
