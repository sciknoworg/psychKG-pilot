    "measured_by": "Proportion of risky choices in framed conditions",
    "justification": "Risk preference was also measured by analyzing the proportion of risky choices participants made in the gain frame versus the loss frame within the FST. This behavioral measure helped gauge individual tendencies toward risk-seeking or risk-averse behavior in specific framing contexts."

    "justification": "The FST was used to document participants' preferences for gain frames vs. loss frames by allowing them to choose which frame they would encounter before making risky choices. A significant preference for the gain frame was observed in the results."
