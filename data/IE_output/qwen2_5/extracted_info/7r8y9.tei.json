    "justification": "The text discusses using the geometric framework, particularly the simplex model, to represent and measure multialternative choice decisions by modeling how support for each alternative interacts within a multidimensional space. This representation allows for optimizations of decision strategies depending on the set of available alternatives."

    "measured_by": "hyperplanes in decision space",
    "justification": "The text details how the use of hyperplanes in the decision space to define choice boundaries is a central measurement tool in the geometric framework for understanding how evidence accumulation leads to decisions. Each alternative has its boundary described by a vector orientation and an orthogonal hyperplane."

    "topic_or_construct": "evidence accumulation process",
    "measured_by": "Wiener diffusion process",
    "justification": "Evidence accumulation in the decision-making process is described using the Wiener diffusion process that models the continuous sampling of evidence and its influence on decision states moving towards choice boundaries. This method effectively measures the dynamics of evidence accumulation over time."

    "measured_by": "accumulation against individual thresholds",
    "justification": "The absolute stopping rule is measured by comparing the evidence for each alternative independently against a criterion threshold, theta_abs. It represents a common approach used by accumulator models to halt evidence accumulation."

    "topic_or_construct": "relative stopping rule",
    "measured_by": "thresholds adjusted for inter-alternative similarity",
    "justification": "Relative stopping rules are measured using adjusted thresholds based on the inter-alternative similarity relations. This ensures that the evidence accumulation halts when one alternative's support is significantly stronger compared to others."
