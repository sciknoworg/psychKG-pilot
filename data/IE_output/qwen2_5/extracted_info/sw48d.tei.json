    "justification": "Study 2 measures the subjective value assigned to different decision criteria (subjective value vs financial costs) for transformative decisions like becoming a parent.

    "measured_by": "Correlation between Information Sufficiency and Importance",
    "justification": "The evaluability bias is measured by observing the correlation between the perceived adequacy of information on subjective value and the importance placed on it. The results show that participants deemed subjective value more important when they felt they had adequate information to assess it."
