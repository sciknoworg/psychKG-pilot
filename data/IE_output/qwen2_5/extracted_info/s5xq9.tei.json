    "justification": "The S-IGT, an adaptation of the Iowa Gambling Task, was developed to assess the influence of facial cues on social learning and decision-making. It specifically examines how facial cues of trustworthiness affect the decision-making process when participants encounter congruent or incongruent facial cues with advantageous or disadvantageous choices."

    "measured_by": "Social Iowa Gambling Task (S-IGT)",
    "justification": "The S-IGT was used to investigate satisficing behavior by showing that participants in the congruent-social condition initially performed better due to reliance on facial cues, indicating a tendency towards satisficing, which involves accepting choices that meet minimum requirements without exhaustive evaluation."

    "measured_by": "Social Iowa Gambling Task (S-IGT)",
    "justification": "The S-IGT included conditions where participants were presented with faces that were experimentally manipulated to be trustworthy or untrustworthy. This design allowed researchers to measure how trustworthiness cues from faces influence decision-making in the context of repeated interactions."

    "measured_by": "Social Iowa Gambling Task (S-IGT)",
    "justification": "The S-IGT was used to study social decision-making by incorporating social elements (facial cues of trustworthiness) into a decision-making scenario. The task aimed to explore how participants make decisions based on intrinsic biases and schemas influenced by facial cues."
