    "topic_or_construct": "confidence leak",
    "measured_by": "4-point confidence rating scale",
    "justification": "The confidence serial dependence, or confidence leak, was measured using a 4-point confidence rating scale where 1 is the lowest and 4 is the highest confidence rating after subjects indicated their choice about Gabor patch orientation."

    "topic_or_construct": "motor effort on confidence",
    "measured_by": "left vs. right hand response latency",
    "justification": "Motor effort's impact on confidence was measured by comparing response latencies (RTs) when subjects used their left (non-dominant) versus right (dominant) hand to respond. A significant difference in RTs showed lower confidence on non-dominant hand responses."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "confidence serial dependence strength",
    "measured_by": "beta value in lag-1 linear regression",
    "justification": "The strength of confidence serial dependence was quantified using the beta value from a lag-1 linear regression analysis comparing previous trial confidence ratings with the current trial's confidence ratings."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "motor cost effects on confidence leak",
    "measured_by": "left vs. right-hand response trials",
    "justification": "The influence of motor cost on confidence leak was assessed by analyzing confidence ratings from trials where subjects used their non-dominant (left) hand versus dominant (right) hand for responses, indicating decreased confidence leak with increased motor effort."
