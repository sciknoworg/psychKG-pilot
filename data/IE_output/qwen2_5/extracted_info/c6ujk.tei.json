    "measured_by": "Gabor-Bandit task with pupil diameter measurements",
    "justification": "The study used the Gabor-Bandit task combined with pupil diameter measurements to investigate how uncertainty over stimulus discriminability (belief state) modulates the pupil response to prediction errors, demonstrating that phasic pupil-linked arousal reflects prediction errors weighted by the belief state."

    "measured_by": "Regression model analysis of pupil diameter",
    "justification": "A regression model was applied to analyze the feedback-related pupil dilation, revealing that state uncertainty modulates pupil responses to prediction errors, with larger contrast differences (lower state uncertainty) leading to increased pupil dilation for a given prediction error."

    "topic_or_construct": "Learning rate adaptation",
    "measured_by": "Sliding-scale updates and prediction error calculations",
    "justification": "Participants' belief updates were measured using a sliding scale, and prediction errors were calculated based on the difference between rewards received and participants' expectations, allowing the researchers to quantify how participants adjusted their learning rates based on belief states."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceptual uncertainty and arousal",
    "measured_by": "Pupillometry data analysis",
    "justification": "The study employed pupillometry to track pupil diameter as an index of arousal, finding that higher states of perceptual uncertainty led to modulated pupil responses to prediction errors, suggesting that arousal systems play a key role in how the brain processes uncertain information."
