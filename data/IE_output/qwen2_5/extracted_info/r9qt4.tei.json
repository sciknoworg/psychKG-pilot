    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty Intolerance",
    "measured_by": "Self-report measures",
    "justification": "Uncertainty intolerance is typically measured through self-report measures that assess beliefs about, emotional reactions to, and frequency of behaviors to avoid or reduce uncertainty. These measures aim to capture traits like the tendency to avoid uncertain situations, often linked to generalized anxiety disorder and excessive worry."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Tolerance",
    "measured_by": "Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) Scale",
    "justification": "Risk tolerance is often assessed using the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) Scale, which evaluates attitudes and behaviors related to risk across various domains, including health/safety, recreation, social, financial, and ethical contexts."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Ambiguity Intolerance",
    "measured_by": "Self-report measures",
    "justification": "Self-report measures are used to assess an individual's tolerance or intolerance for ambiguity. Participants rate their comfort level during various ambiguous situations, indicating how they perceive and react to uncertainty in the present moment."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Perception and Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Laboratory tasks involving hypothetical choices",
    "justification": "Behavioral studies assess risky decision-making by presenting participants with hypothetical choices involving varying levels of risk in the laboratory setting, allowing researchers to observe and quantify decision patterns in risk-related scenarios."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Prediction Error",
    "measured_by": "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalogram (EEG)",
    "justification": "Prediction error, a neural response associated with discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes, is measured using fMRI (via blood-oxygen-level-dependent, or BOLD, signals) and EEG (via event-related potentials such as the error-related negativity, or ERN), often identifying brain regions and neural mechanisms involved in prediction under uncertainty."
