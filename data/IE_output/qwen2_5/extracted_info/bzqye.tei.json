    "measured_by": "Gut-level Beliefs Scale",
    "justification": "The study used a gut-level belief measure, adapted from Windschitl, to assess participants' intuitive beliefs about the likelihood of their baby's survival after seeing survival rates presented via icon arrays. This scale involved participants estimating their baby's chances of survival on a slider scale without numeric anchors, which effectively captured their optimistic biases."

    "measured_by": "Treatment Decision Measure",
    "justification": "The treatment decision measure asked participants to choose between intensive care and palliative care for their hypothetical baby. This decision was influenced by their gut-level beliefs about survival chances, demonstrating how motivated reasoning shapes decision-making under uncertain conditions related to survival rates."

    "measured_by": "Reflection Questions",
    "justification": "The reflection questions were presented in either a frequency format (reporting number of survivors out of 100) or a probability format (estimating personal survival probability), allowing the researchers to examine how different representations of survival rates impact people's interpretation and optimism in survival beliefs."
