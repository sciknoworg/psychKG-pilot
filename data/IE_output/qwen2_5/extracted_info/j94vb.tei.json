    "topic_or_construct": "Consumption and reward simulations",
    "measured_by": "Feature listing task",
    "justification": "The feature listing task was used to detect features suggesting that participants simulated a consumption experience, indicating that consumption and reward simulations play a key role in desire and behavior. The task was quick and effortless, reflecting subconscious simulations that become evident in the listed situated features."

    "topic_or_construct": "Consumption simulations and desire",
    "measured_by": "Salivation to food cues",
    "justification": "Salivation to food cues was used as a physiological measure of desire, showing that consumption simulations are stronger for attractive foods and trigger increased salivation, especially when foods are attractive. This supports the role of simulations in enhancing the desire for food."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Outcome expectancies",
    "measured_by": "Self-report questionnaires and indirect tasks",
    "justification": "Outcome expectancies in the domain of alcohol consumption and food labels were measured using self-report questionnaires and indirect tasks that assess memory associations related to outcome expectancies. The degree to which people represent an appetitive stimulus through simulations of consuming and enjoying it predicted desire and intake."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Habits as situated conceptualisations",
    "measured_by": "Self-Report Habit Index",
    "justification": "The Self-Report Habit Index was used to measure the perceived habit strength of drinking water and sugary drinks, indicating that habitual behaviors are linked to reward expectations. Participants with strong habits of consuming sugary drinks demonstrated increased consumption even when typical situations changed, supporting the idea that habits are flexible behaviors motivated by reward."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Simulations in planning for behavior change",
    "measured_by": "Implementation intentions and action planning techniques",
    "justification": "Implementation intentions, as a behavior change technique, were conceptualized as forming situated conceptualizations of planned behaviors through vivid mental imagery. Participants who used vivid mental imagery in planning showed greater effectiveness of these planning methods."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Simulations in social norms",
    "measured_by": "Scenario-based simulations and participant reports",
    "justification": "Scenario-based simulations of social responses to behavior were used to understand how social norms guide behavior by anticipating approval or disapproval. These simulations underlie the effects of social norms, motivating people to conform based on anticipated rewards of social acceptance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Role of simulations in mindfulness interventions",
    "measured_by": "Decentering techniques and mindfulness training",
    "justification": "Decentering techniques, a key aspect of mindfulness training, were used to induce a meta-cognitive re-appraisal of consumption and reward simulations. This decoupled the link between simulations and motivated behavior, reducing reactivity to appetitive cues over time."
