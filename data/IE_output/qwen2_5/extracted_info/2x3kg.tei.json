    "justification": "The study analyzes how performers integrate information sources based on expected precision using Bayesian computations, as indicated by the findings that performers rely more on precise information sources (e.g., when current sensory information is uncertain, they rely on prior contextual info\u2014see discussion on Principle 2)."

    "justification": "Active inference is used as a theoretical framework to explain and predict anticipatory behavior in sports. The models portray the brain\u2019s use of internal models to minimize prediction errors and adaptatively integrate information from various sources (discussed in \u2018Active inference\u2019 and \u2018Discussion\u2019 sections)."

    "justification": "The paper uses simulations and empirical metrics to demonstrate that congruent information sources positively impact anticipation accuracy, whereas incongruent information can initially impair performance but is eventually learned to be down-weighted (referencing simulations in Figures 3 and 4)."
