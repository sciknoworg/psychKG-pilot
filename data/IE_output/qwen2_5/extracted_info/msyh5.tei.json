    "topic_or_construct": "mentalization",
    "measured_by": "Sally-Anne test",
    "justification": "The Sally-Anne test is mentioned as an early method used to study theory of mind in the brain. The test involves images and vignettes as task conditions, providing a basis for understanding mentalization."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "strategic behavior",
    "measured_by": "matching pennies or Prisoner's dilemmas games",
    "justification": "These strategic games are used as laboratory tasks in decision neuroscience and neuroeconomics to study mentalization. By using well-specified games with monetary rewards, researchers can provide a mechanistic interpretation of activity in the social brain network."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "belief-based learning",
    "measured_by": "computational models of first-order beliefs",
    "justification": "Subjects estimate the opponent\u2019s historical choice distribution (first-order beliefs) and try to choose actions that are optimal given this distribution. Neural evidence suggests that regions like the dmPFC or ACC may be involved in this tracking process."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "mentalization-driven prediction errors",
    "measured_by": "TPJ activity",
    "justification": "Increased levels of reasoning linked to mentalization are associated with higher activity in the social brain regions. Disruption of the TPJ using TMS can lead to diminished use of high-order beliefs, indicating its role in mentalization-driven prediction errors."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "second-order beliefs",
    "measured_by": "TPJ activity",
    "justification": "The TPJ's activity often correlates with second-order belief updates, indicating that the TPJ is linked to mentalization processes, including the formation of complex beliefs about others' reactions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "individual and social value",
    "measured_by": "ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and lateral frontopolar cortex activity",
    "justification": "The vmPFC encodes expected rewards for the individual, while the lateral frontopolar cortex encodes group utility. These regions reflect the dissociation between individual and social rewards in strategic decision-making contexts."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "belief updating mechanisms",
    "measured_by": "dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) activity",
    "justification": "The dmPFC is linked to updating first-order beliefs about the opponent's actions and general sensitivity to their actions. Its activity is modulated by computational model parameters reflecting belief-updating strategies."
