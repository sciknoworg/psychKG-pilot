    "topic_or_construct": "Functional Generalization",
    "measured_by": "Feature-based Multi-Armed Bandit (FMAB) Task with High and Low Value Conditions",
    "justification": "Functional generalization is assessed by participants' choice behavior toward a novel option with indicated high vs. low expected rewards, revealing their ability to generalize from prior functional knowledge."

    "topic_or_construct": "Functional Uncertainty Guidance",
    "measured_by": "Feature-based Multi-Armed Bandit (FMAB) Task with Exotic vs. Ordinary Novel Options",
    "justification": "Participants' choices between exotic novel options (unfamiliar features) and ordinary novel options (familiar features) test their tendency to explore options with higher functional uncertainty."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Function Learning",
    "measured_by": "Functional Knowledge Task",
    "justification": "The functional knowledge task directly assesses whether participants have learned the reward function by choosing among new options without feedback, distinguishing function learners from reward trackers."

    "justification": "The UCB strategy in the Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GP-UCB) model assesses how participants adjust their choices based on the uncertainty about expected rewards, represented by adding bonuses to uncertain options."

    "measured_by": "Modified FMAB Task with Different Introduction Methods for Novel Options",
    "justification": "Variations in how the novel option is introduced (e.g., flickering, fading-in) and participant's reaction times test the impact of attention on novelty processing and decision-making in the FMAB task."
