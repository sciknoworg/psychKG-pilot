    "measured_by": "Likert scale ratings of efficacy beliefs, likelihood of trying treatment, and likelihood of giving treatment to a child",
    "justification": "The experiments employed a Likert scale to assess participants' beliefs about the effectiveness of medical treatments after exposure to different combinations of statistical and anecdotal information. These scales measured participants' judgments on the perceived efficacy of treatments like B-12 injections and women\u2019s health treatments, supporting the relationship between the constructs and the measurement method."

    "measured_by": "Posttest questionnaire responses in experiments",
    "justification": "Participants\u2019 posttest responses indicated their changed beliefs and attitudes after exposure to negative anecdotes alongside statistical information. The researchers assessed these effects by evaluating differences in responses across conditions where negative anecdotes were present or absent."

    "topic_or_construct": "Impact of icon arrays on understanding statistical information",
    "measured_by": "Post-experiment efficacy attitudes and behaviors",
    "justification": "Icon arrays were included in some conditions to assess whether they improved participants\u2019 integration of statistical information. The analysis of post-test questionnaire efficacies and behavioral intentions allowed the researchers to evaluate if icon arrays mitigated the impact of anecdotal information."
