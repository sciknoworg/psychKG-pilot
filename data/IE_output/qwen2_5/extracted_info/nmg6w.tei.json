    "measured_by": "Shifted Wald model",
    "justification": "The decision difficulty was measured using the Shifted Wald model, which was selected as the standard DDM model is not well suited for tasks with very few errors. Parameters like the drift rate, threshold, and non-decision time were estimated using this model, reflecting the differences in decision difficulty across conditions."

    "measured_by": "HsMM-MVPA analysis",
    "justification": "Perceptual processing was measured using the HsMM-MVPA method, which detected specific stages corresponding to non-decision stages. These stages, including the stimulus processing stage characterized by a P2 component, fit the non-decision components identified by the EAMs."

    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive processing stages",
    "measured_by": "HsMM-MVPA analysis",
    "justification": "Cognitive processing stages were measured using the HsMM-MVPA method, allowing the discovery of stages like pre-attention, stimulus processing, familiarity-driven recognition, decision making, and response execution. These stages were inferred based on the observed scalp topography and timing of EEG signals."

    "topic_or_construct": "decision time",
    "measured_by": "Shifted Wald model",
    "justification": "Decision time was measured using the Shifted Wald model, which decomposed decision times into specific stages identified by HsMM-MVPA analysis. The stages 3-5 of the HsMM-MVPA analysis corresponded to the decision time calculated from the shifted Wald model."

    "topic_or_construct": "non-decision time",
    "measured_by": "Shifted Wald model",
    "justification": "Non-decision time was measured using the Shifted Wald model and was represented in the first two stages of HsMM-MVPA analysis. These stages include attentional and stimulus encoding processes."
