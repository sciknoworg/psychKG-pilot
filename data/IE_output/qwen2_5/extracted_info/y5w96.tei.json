    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive effort costs",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Effort Discounting (Cog-ED) task",
    "justification": "The Cog-ED task is used to estimate the subjective value (cost) of cognitive effort, whereby participants choose between higher and lower effort tasks based on monetary rewards. It has been shown to provide stable and consistent within-person measurements in both younger and older adults."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "daily life mental demand",
    "measured_by": "Experience Sampling Method (EMA) protocol",
    "justification": "The EMA protocol is used to track participants' daily activities and their mental demands through random prompts over a fixed 12-hour window, complementing the Cog-ED findings by relating laboratory measures to real-life behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "intrinsic motivation for cognitive activities",
    "measured_by": "self-reported ratings of motivation for daily activities",
    "justification": "Participants in the EMA protocol rated their level of motivation toward each activity they engaged in, helping to gauge their intrinsic motivation's role in daily engagement."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "engagement in mentally demanding activities",
    "measured_by": "self-report measures of activity endorsement",
    "justification": "Participants reported on the activities they engaged in and rated their mental demand, showing a link between their engagement in such activities and their measured cognitive effort costs."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "age-related changes in motivation",
    "measured_by": "Cog-ED in loss and gain incentive contexts",
    "justification": "Using the Cog-ED in different framing conditions (gain vs. loss), the study investigates variations in cognitive effort discounting and its influence on age-related differences in motivation."
