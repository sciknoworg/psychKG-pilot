This indicates the FACES database was used to assess facial trustworthiness."

    "justification": "The paper notes, 'Learning follows a 'continuum of certainty'... Both disadvantageous decks (A and B) were always located on the left... advantageous (C and D) were always... right. The two faces associated with specific advantageous and disadvantageous decks, respectively, were counterbalanced in the CS-IGT. Thus, participants were pseudo-randomly assigned.' The CS-IGT was designed to study trust learning using congruent facial cues."

    "justification": "The text states, 'The IS-IGT refers to the incongruent social task condition in which advantageous decks are paired with untrustworthy faces and disadvantageous decks are paired with trustworthy faces.' This task was designed to assess how participants learn in the presence of incongruent trustworthiness cues."
