    "measured_by": "Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The DDM was used to investigate how peer influence affects moral decision-making by assessing changes in value accumulation related to money and pain. This was demonstrated through the computation of drift rate parameters for relative money and pain."

    "topic_or_construct": "Moral Preferences",
    "measured_by": "Harm Aversion Parameter (\u03ba)",
    "justification": "The harm aversion parameter \u03ba was estimated from participants' choices in the moral decision-making task, indicating their relative prioritization of money over the receiver's pain. Changes in \u03ba after observing peers were analyzed to assess peer influence."

    "measured_by": "7-point Likert Scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with statements about peers' goals on a 7-point Likert scale, assessing whether they correctly inferred the peers' goals (money maximizing vs. shock minimizing)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Similarity Between Self and Peer",
    "measured_by": "Perceptual and Objective Similarity Measures",
    "justification": "Objective similarity was defined based on the difference between the participant's and the peer's baseline harm aversion. Subjective similarity was assessed through self-reported ratings on a continuous scale."

    "topic_or_construct": "Awareness of Peer Influence",
    "measured_by": "Continuous Visual Analog Scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated their perceived shift in moral preference after observing a peer using a continuous visual analog scale, evaluating the extent to which they were aware of peer influence on their behavior."
