    "justification": "The study directly uses self-sacrificial moral dilemmas to investigate how the moral Foreign Language Effect influences participants' willingness to self-sacrifice. These dilemmas are designed to create scenarios where both moral inclinations\u2014deontology and utilitarianism\u2014lead to the same choice, which helps isolate the effect of language on moral judgments."

    "measured_by": "CNI (Consequences, Norms, Inaction) model",
    "justification": "The CNI model measures deontology by its N parameter, which reflects sensitivity to moral norms, as mentioned in the article. This is evident from the study's discussion of the moral Foreign Language Effect's impact on normative considerations."

    "topic_or_construct": "Utilitarianism",
    "measured_by": "CNI (Consequences, Norms, Inaction) model",
    "justification": "The CNI model measures utilitarianism by its C parameter, which reflects sensitivity to the consequences of actions. The article discusses this in relation to the influence of foreign language on the balance between deontological and utilitarian considerations."

    "measured_by": "Process Dissociation model",
    "justification": "The Process Dissociation model is mentioned to measure sensitivity to harm (D parameter) and sensitivity to consequences (U parameter), which are related to deontology and utilitarianism, respectively. This model is used in research related to the moral Foreign Language Effect."
