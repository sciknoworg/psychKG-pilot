    "measured_by": "Motivated Learning Task",
    "justification": "The paper describes the use of the Motivated Learning Task to investigate how varying reward magnitudes affect memory strength. Participants learn stimuli associated with rewards, and later recognize them, with memory strength calculated based on hits and false alarm rates per reward level."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reward effects on decision-making strategies",
    "measured_by": "Reward expectations and criterion calculation",
    "justification": "The experiments employed participants' reward expectations and calculated decision criterion (criterion) to determine how reward information during testing influences decision-making strategies. The reward expectations and the resulting criterion were analyzed to distinguish decision-making from memory strength effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reward influence on memory retrieval",
    "measured_by": "Drift-diffusion models",
    "justification": "Drift-diffusion models were utilized as an alternative analysis strategy to understand the effects of reward on memory retrieval. These models considered reaction times and parameters like boundary separation, drift rate, and non-decision time to provide additional insights."

    "topic_or_construct": "Source memory for stimulus-reward associations",
    "measured_by": "Expected reward ratings",
    "justification": "In Experiment 1, participants were asked to rate their expected reward for items they identified as old during the recognition phase. This provided insights into participants' source memory for the stimulus-reward associations learned during the initial phase."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Influence of reward congruency",
    "measured_by": "Congruent and incongruent conditions",
    "justification": "Experiments 2a and 2b manipulated the congruence between the reward shown during learning and testing. By comparing congruent and incongruent conditions, the paper explored how presentation of reward information at retrieval modulates memory and decision-making."
