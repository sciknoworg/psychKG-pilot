    "justification": "The RL task was used to investigate context-dependent value encoding by presenting participants with abstract cue pairs representing lotteries, where the outcomes had to be inferred from experience. The results showed suboptimal preferences in the \u2206EV = 1.75 context across all countries, indicating context-dependent value rescaling."

    "measured_by": "Lottery task (description-based decision-making task)",
    "justification": "The Lottery task was used to assess risk aversion and compare it with the RL task. It involved choices between lotteries with known expected values. The task helped to demonstrate that risk aversion, as inferred from standard lottery tasks, could not explain the preferences observed in the RL task."

    "measured_by": "Comparison of RL and Lottery task performance across countries",
    "justification": "The study compared performance on the RL task and the Lottery task across 11 countries with different socio-economic and cultural makeup. It found that the RL task showed more culturally stable patterns, while the Lottery task revealed significant cross-cultural variability."

    "topic_or_construct": "Socioeconomic and cultural makeup of participants",
    "measured_by": "Socioeconomic, cultural, and cognitive questionnaires",
    "justification": "Participants completed several questionnaires to assess dimensions of their sociocultural background, including Individualistic and collectivistic tendencies inventory, perceived Socioeconomic status in childhood, adulthood and social hierarchy questionnaire, and the Centrality of religiosity questionnaire. These provided context for the cross-cultural analysis."
