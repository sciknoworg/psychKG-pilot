    "measured_by": "Trolley dilemma scenarios",
    "justification": "The article discusses the trolley dilemma as a tool to study moral judgment in hypothetical moral dilemmas and notes that affirmative responses to these dilemmas are considered utilitarian according to utilitarianism (Mill, 1998)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Emotional arousal",
    "measured_by": "Skin conductance response (SCR)",
    "justification": "The study monitored electrodermal activity as an index of arousal and somatic state activation, with higher SCR indicating greater emotional arousal in response to VR versus text-presented dilemmas."

    "topic_or_construct": "Utilitarian decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Participant's behavioral responses in VR dilemmas",
    "justification": "The proportion of utilitarian decisions made by participants was calculated based on their behavior in virtual reality (VR) moral dilemmas, indicating how contextual saliency influences moral choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Judgment-behavior discrepancy",
    "measured_by": "Comparison of text vs. VR sessions",
    "justification": "Participants exhibited a discrepancy between moral judgments in text-based scenarios and moral behavior in VR dilemmas, with stronger utilitarian choices emerging in the latter format."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive conflict resolution",

    "justification": "The study explored the role of emotions and dilemma presentation formats on cognitive conflict resolution, examining how these factors influenced utilitarian versus non-utilitarian decision patterns."
