    "justification": "The paper discusses the Concealed Information Test (CIT), specifically its response time (RT) variant, which measures the concealment of information based on reaction times. The test detects the concealing of information by observing differences in the time it takes to correctly classify items examinees are trying to recognize as relevant or irrelevant."

    "measured_by": "Response Time Concealed Information Test (RT-CIT)",
    "justification": "The article mentions that the RT-CIT is used to evaluate deception detection by analyzing responses to concealed information items. Knowledgeable examinees are identified as those who have significantly longer response times for relevant (probe) items compared to irrelevant ones, suggesting they are attempting to hide their knowledge."

    "topic_or_construct": "Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff",
    "measured_by": "Manipulation of Instructions in RT-CIT",
    "justification": "The study investigates the effect of speed versus accuracy instructions on the RT-CITs effectiveness. The manipulation of these instructions tests whether focusing on speed or accuracy influences the validity of the test, thereby probing the speed-accuracy tradeoff in deception detection tasks."
