    "justification": "The Sally-Anne Task (SAT) is specifically described as a measure to assess Theory of Mind, evaluating children's ability to understand false beliefs by determining if they can correctly predict Sally's actions. The paper validates its use in this context as it is part of their main exposure variable assessing social cognition."

    "justification": "The Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) is introduced as a neuropsychological tool used to measure risk-taking behavior in adolescents outside of a learning context. In this study, it is specifically employed to assess the dimension of risk adjustment (RA), which involves adjusting decisions under risk based on new information."

    "topic_or_construct": "Overall Risk-Taking (RT)",
    "measured_by": "Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT)",
    "justification": "The CGT is also used to measure broad risk-taking behavior, providing a broader measure of decision-making compared to the specific RA dimension. The paper contrasts RA results with those for overall risk-taking from the same task."
