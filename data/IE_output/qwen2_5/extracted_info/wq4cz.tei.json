    "measured_by": "Iowa Gambling Task (IGT)",
    "justification": "Computational studies such as Chan et al. (2014) used the IGT to find impaired choice performance in AN, suggesting potential deficits in learning and memory rather than unusual reward preferences."

    "measured_by": "Computational Set-shifting Model",
    "justification": "Filoteo et al. (2014) implemented a computational model that assumed set-shifting depends on competition between explicit hypothesis testing and implicit learning systems in participants with weight-restored AN, identifying increased perseveration parameters and decreased unusual rule selection parameters."

    "justification": "Jenkinson et al. (2023) used the BART modified by linking rewards with changes in body size, showing that participants with AN became more risk-tolerant when rewards led to a slimmer body image, highlighting context-specific changes in risk aversion."
