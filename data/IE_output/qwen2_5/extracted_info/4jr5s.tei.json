    "measured_by": "fMRI studies",
    "justification": "The paper describes using fMRI studies to map neural activity in relation to bystander apathy, highlighting changes in regions like the pre-central gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex as the number of bystanders increases."

    "topic_or_construct": "emotional and motivational aspects of helping behavior",
    "measured_by": "Virtual Reality (VR) simulations",
    "justification": "The study by Zanon et al. (2014) utilized VR technology to examine the neural mechanisms of helping behavior, showing the importance of the medial prefrontal cortex in this process, which helps understand the dispositional influences on bystander apathy."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "sympathy and personal distress",
    "measured_by": "behavioral and neuroimaging techniques",
    "justification": "The paper mentions using behavioral and neuroimaging methods to study sympathy (other-oriented compassion) and personal distress (self-oriented discomfort), showing their influence on helping behavior and the bystander effect."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reflexive helping behavior",
    "measured_by": "neuroimaging findings",
    "justification": "Research findings suggest that certain forms of helping behavior are automated or reflexive based on the automatic activation of preparatory responses in salient situations, supported by neuroimaging data examining brain region activation during emergencies."
