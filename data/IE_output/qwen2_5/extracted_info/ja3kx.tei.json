    "topic_or_construct": "Conative Force",
    "measured_by": "Emotional intensity scale (1 to 5)",
    "justification": "The paper specifies using an emotional intensity scale ranging from 1 to 5 to quantify the conative forces that push an individual to action. In the Heinz dilemma example, factors like moral urgency and emotional urgency are rated on this scale to estimate the conative vector."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Inhibitory Force",
    "measured_by": "Emotional intensity scale (1 to 5)",
    "justification": "An emotional intensity scale (1 to 5) is also used to quantify inhibitory forces that discourage action. For instance, in the Heinz dilemma example, fears of legal consequences and respect for social norms are rated to estimate the inhibitory vector."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Axiotype",
    "measured_by": "Value and m\u00e9motion ratings",
    "justification": "The axiotype is characterized by the evaluation of values and m\u00e9motions. This involves assessing the long-term value structures and the transient short-lived memory traces that influence immediate decisions using rating scales."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Probability of Action",
    "measured_by": "Sigmoid function applied to emotional score",
    "justification": "The probability of action is determined by applying a sigmoid function to the emotional score (difference between conative and inhibitory vectors). This value reflects the likelihood of taking action beyond binary choices and is calibrated based on k sensitivity."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Sensitivity Parameter (k)",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral tests combined with physiological measurements",
    "justification": "The k parameter is calibrated through behavioral tests and physiological data such as heart rate variability or hormonal assays. These measurements help in adjusting the model's sensitivity to vary among impulsive and reflective profiles."
