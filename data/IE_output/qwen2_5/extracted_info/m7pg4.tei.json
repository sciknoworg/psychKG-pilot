    "measured_by": "Risky Gambling Task with Intentional Temporal Structure",
    "justification": "The study describes a gambling task designed to capture changes in risk-taking behavior at three timescales: immediate, neighborhood, and global. The task variables, such as previous outcomes, shifts in value, and cumulative earnings, were used to assess the effects of temporal context on risky decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Strategy Effects",
    "measured_by": "Instructional Conditions ('Ignore Context' vs. 'Act Natural')",
    "justification": "Participants were randomly assigned to either a strategic condition, where they were instructed to ignore contextual influences, or a natural condition, where they were told to approach decisions as they would naturally. The impact of these different approaches on risk-taking behavior is analyzed through choices made during the gambling task."

    "topic_or_construct": "Emotion Regulation Use",
    "measured_by": "Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Reappraisal Subscale)",
    "justification": "The habitual use of cognitive reappraisal was assessed using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire's reappraisal subscale. The study explores how individual differences in habitual reappraisal habits relate to the impact of cognitive strategies on temporal context effects in risky decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Working Memory Capacity",
    "measured_by": "Operation Span Task, Symmetry Span Task",
    "justification": "Two established complex span tasks, the Operation Span task and Symmetry Span task, were used to measure individual differences in working memory capacity. The study evaluated the influence of working memory on the ability to implement a cognitive strategy during risky decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Motivation",
    "measured_by": "Self-Reported Motivation Ratings",
    "justification": "Participants self-reported their overall motivation during the task. The study examines whether an individual\u2019s level of motivation influences the success of using a cognitive strategy to alter temporal context effects on risk-taking."
