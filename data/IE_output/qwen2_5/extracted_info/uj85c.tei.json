    "justification": "The Deep Exploration model was used to measure directed exploration by calculating the information bonus associated with choosing an option, which reflects how participants bias their choices towards more uncertain or informative options. This information bonus was estimated through a stochastic simulation process that varied with the number of samples used by participants (Figure 2 and related text)."

    "measured_by": "Deep Exploration Model",
    "justification": "The Deep Exploration model also captured random exploration via the decision noise parameter. This component of the model reflected the stochastic nature of participants' choices, where randomness in the decision process made the highest value option less likely to be chosen consistently. The level of decision noise was estimated based on the slope of the choice curve at the indifference point (Figure 2 and related text)."

    "measured_by": "Infinite Bandits Task",
    "justification": "The Infinite Bandits Task was specifically designed to investigate the explore-exploit tradeoff by having participants choose between a known and an unknown option. The task quantified the tradeoff across participants and conditions (e.g., ITI manipulation) by examining the relation between explore and exploit choices, the number of samples used in Deep Exploration simulations, and their resulting choice probabilities and reaction times (Figures 3 and 4 and related text)."

    "justification": "The \u03b8-\u03c3 model captured directed exploration through the information bonus parameter (\u03b8) and random exploration through the decision noise parameter (\u03c3). The correlation between these parameters across participants provided evidence of a tradeoff between directed and random exploration. The model fit individual choice curves and estimated these parameters from participants' behavior in the Infinite Bandits Task (Figure 6 and related text)."
