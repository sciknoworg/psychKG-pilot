    "justification": "The paper uses Bayesian models of inductive inference to analyze how participants adjust their generalizations as they receive additional data points, specifically by examining changes in generalization gradients as sample size increases."

    "measured_by": "participant responses under different sampling scenarios",
    "justification": "The experiments manipulate whether participants are instructed with scenarios implying strong or weak sampling, and their responses are analyzed to infer their implicit sampling assumptions."

    "topic_or_construct": "category learning",
    "measured_by": "judgments about novel exemplars' category membership",
    "justification": "Participants make judgments about whether novel items belong to a certain category based on previously observed positive examples, which is used to measure their category learning."

    "topic_or_construct": "conservatism in learning",
    "measured_by": "participant behavior in adjusting beliefs",
    "justification": "The study examines how rapidly participants adjust their beliefs (or not) in response to additional data, reflecting conservative versus more liberal updating of beliefs."
