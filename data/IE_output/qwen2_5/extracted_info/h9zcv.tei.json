    "topic_or_construct": "polarization",
    "measured_by": "Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD)",
    "justification": "The paper uses KLD to measure the difference between the observed information distribution and the expected information distribution, providing a metric for polarization as it quantifies divergence from a representative sample."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "extremism",
    "measured_by": "Variance Ratio",
    "justification": "The variance ratio is used to assess extremism by comparing the variance of the information sampled by participants to the expected variance from a representative sample, indicating whether participants collected more extreme information than expected."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "information sampling",
    "measured_by": "Number of clicks on the sampling button",
    "justification": "The number of clicks on the sampling button is used as a measure of the amount of information participants choose to gather before making a decision, indicating their information sampling behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "dogmatism",
    "measured_by": "Self-report measure of dogmatism",
    "justification": "A self-report measure of dogmatism is used to assess participants' cognitive rigidity and openness to new information, which is related to their decision-making strategies and polarization."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "personal need for structure",
    "measured_by": "Personal Need for Structure (PNS) scale",
    "justification": "The PNS scale measures participants' desire for clear and predictable structures, which is analyzed for its relationship with information sampling and polarization in decision-making tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision-making goals",
    "measured_by": "Choice vs. Estimation conditions",
    "justification": "Participants are manipulated to be in either choice or estimation conditions which influence their information sampling strategies and thus their levels of polarization and extremism."
