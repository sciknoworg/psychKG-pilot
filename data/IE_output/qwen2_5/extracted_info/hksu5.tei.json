    "measured_by": "Dictator Game paradigm",
    "justification": "The paper uses a modified Dictator Game paradigm to measure advantageous inequity aversion, which is defined as the aversion to having more resources than another person. Participants were asked to decide how to allocate resources between themselves and others in various scenarios, and inequalities in resource allocation were quantified."

    "topic_or_construct": "disadvantageous inequity aversion",
    "measured_by": "Dictator Game paradigm",
    "justification": "The same Dictator Game paradigm used for advantageous inequity aversion was also employed to measure disadvantageous inequity aversion. This concept refers to the aversion to having fewer resources than another person, which was examined through participants' decisions in the same task with different self-to-other exchange rates."

    "topic_or_construct": "mentalizing (theory of mind)",
    "measured_by": "right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) activity",
    "justification": "The research indirectly measures mentalizing using rTPJ activity. It implies that the rTPJ is causally important for mentalizing, which involves understanding the thoughts, feelings, and intentions of others. The study employs TMS targeting the rTPJ to investigate its role in decisions involving sharing resources with others."
