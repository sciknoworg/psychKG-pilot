    "justification": "In pure description paradigms, risk preferences are assessed by presenting two options with explicit probability distributions of outcomes without providing any feedback, allowing researchers to evaluate risk preferences based on stated probabilities and outcomes."

    "justification": "Pure experience paradigms test risk preferences by presenting subjects with abstract cues without prior information, but with outcomes provided on a trial-by-trial basis, allowing for the assessment of risk preferences through reinforcement learning processes."

    "justification": "In this hybrid paradigm, risk preferences are measured by providing explicit representations of probabilities and outcomes, followed by outcomes on a trial-by-trial basis, blending elements of descriptive and experiential learning to evaluate risk preferences."

    "topic_or_construct": "Prospect Theory Features",
    "measured_by": "Visual Cues Carrying Symbolic Information",
    "justification": "Prospect theory features such as loss aversion and subjective probability weighting can be measured in monkeys using visual cues similar to those presented to humans, such as pie-charts, to test for compatibility with human decision-making patterns."

    "measured_by": "Token Paradigm Implementing Losses",
    "justification": "Loss aversion can be measured by using a token paradigm in monkeys, which allows for implementing losses by subtracting previously acquired rewards, thereby facilitating the cross-species study of loss aversion in decision-making."
