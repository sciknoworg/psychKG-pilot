    "measured_by": "Button presses",
    "justification": "The study measured the timing and accuracy of perceptual change-of-mind decisions using button presses from participants who indicated their choices after evaluating flickering gray squares with different levels of absolute evidence."

    "topic_or_construct": "Initial decision accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Accuracy rates across absolute evidence conditions",
    "justification": "Initial decision accuracy was measured through the proportion of correct choices in the high and low absolute evidence conditions, demonstrating whether increases in absolute evidence led to reduced accuracy, an outcome assessed through empirical accuracy rates."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Initial response time",
    "measured_by": "Response time measurements",
    "justification": "Initial response times were recorded using the time when participants first pressed a button to indicate their decision, with analysis revealing faster response times in conditions of high absolute evidence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Change-of-mind frequency",
    "measured_by": "Frequency of changes in response choices",
    "justification": "The frequency of change-of-mind decisions was measured by calculating the proportion of trials where participants altered their initial button press choices post-initial responses within a set timeframe."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Response consistency",
    "measured_by": "Double-pass agreement analysis",
    "justification": "Choice consistency across repeated stimulus presentations was analyzed using a double-pass agreement method, aimed at understanding the internal and external variability within participants\u2019 decision processes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Timing of changes of mind",
    "measured_by": "Change-of-mind latency quantiles",
    "justification": "The latency of change-of-mind decisions was assessed by analyzing the time intervals from the initial button press to the subsequent change-of-mind responses across absolute evidence conditions."
