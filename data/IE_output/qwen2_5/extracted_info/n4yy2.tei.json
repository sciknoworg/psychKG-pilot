    "measured_by": "value-based decision-making model",
    "justification": "The paper proposes viewing self-control as value-based decision-making, suggesting it involves selecting behavior consistent with a focal goal among alternatives. This model accounts for the integration of subjective values of options, including gains and costs, and predicts decision times and outcomes dynamically and stochastically."

    "measured_by": "neurobiological activity patterns in brain regions",
    "justification": "The research highlights that self-control involves specific patterns of brain activity in regions like the ventral striatum, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and lateral prefrontal areas. These regions represent the subjective value of options and contribute to self-control by influencing the weights given to decision attributes rather than purely inhibiting other regions."

    "topic_or_construct": "self-control",
    "measured_by": "phenomenological reports of effort and conflict",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how self-control is characterized phenomenologically by feelings of effort and conflict, which can be seen as a part of the value-based decision-making process. These subjective experiences may follow from the decision-making process properties rather than from dual-competitive processes."

    "measured_by": "economic and psychological models of value",
    "justification": "Self-control is explained using models from economics and psychology that describe subjective value as a weighted sum of choice-relevant attribute values, integrating insights from diverse fields like decision-making and neuroscience."

    "topic_or_construct": "self-control",
    "measured_by": "strategies for integrating immediate and delayed rewards",
    "justification": "Dual-process models consider the conflict between immediate and delayed rewards, exemplifying decisions such as choosing between a salad or burger. The article highlights the need to overcome immediate impulses for long-term goals, illustrating various strategies including value integration and behavioral interventions."
