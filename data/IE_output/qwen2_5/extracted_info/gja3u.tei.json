    "justification": "The paper discusses how the diffusion model (DM) and the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) are used to explain decision-making processes, including response probabilities and response times. The models' parameters, such as thresholds, growth rates, and starting points, are analyzed to evaluate their roles in explaining behavior."

    "justification": "The paper explores the implications of intertrial variability in growth rates for the DM and LBA, showing that such variability allows these models to fit diverse data patterns and can even render other components, like startpoint variability, unnecessary. The growth-rate distributions are varied to match different model predictions."

    "justification": "The paper demonstrates with generalized models (gDM and gLBA) that startpoint variability can be eliminated from the original models while still producing matching predictions. This is achieved by adjusting the growth-rate distributions within these generalized models."

    "justification": "The paper assesses the impact of retaining the selective influence assumption (SI2) on the flexibility of the models by constraining growth-rate distributions and diffusion rates, while still observing equivalent model predictions with or without mechanisms like startpoint variability."

    "justification": "The crossover pattern of median reaction times between correct and incorrect responses under different conditions (e.g., speed vs. accuracy) is used to evaluate the necessity of model components like startpoint variability, showing that even without it, the gDM can reproduce the pattern as accurately as the DM."
