    "justification": "The article proposes DAF as a method to evaluate algorithmic fairness by modifying the concept of differential item functioning (DIF) from psychometrics. DAF assesses the fairness of algorithms by analyzing conditional dependence between algorithmic decisions and group membership given a fair attribute."

    "justification": "Statistical parity is reviewed as a common measure of algorithmic fairness requiring that an algorithm's decisions be independent of protected group membership. This measure is used in the empirical example to contrast with the DAF approach."

    "justification": "DIF detection methods such as the Mantel-Haenszel test, logistic regression, and residual-based DIF are used to detect item bias in psychometrics. The article adapts these methods to assess DAF in algorithms, highlighting their ability to detect uniform and nonuniform DAF."
