    "topic_or_construct": "Apathy",
    "measured_by": "Apathy and Motivation Index (AMI)",
    "justification": "The study utilizes the AMI behavioral subscale specifically to capture behavioral apathy, which is then used in factor analysis to understand its relationship with other constructs like anhedonia and worry."

    "measured_by": "Temporal Experience of Pleasure (TEPS) anticipatory hedonia subscale",
    "justification": "The paper reports the use of the TEPS anticipatory hedonia subscale to measure anticipatory anhedonia. This scale is then used in bifactor analysis and its impact is analyzed within the computational models that follow."

    "justification": "The PSWQ is explicitly mentioned as a part of the set of questionnaires included in the factor analysis to capture the cognitive dimension of anxiety, specifically focusing on worry."

    "justification": "The study describes the reward version of the EBDM task which measures participants' willingness to exert effort in pursuit of rewards. It is used to evaluate the relationship between effortful reward pursuit and latent dimensions of depression and anxiety."

    "topic_or_construct": "Effortful avoidance of threat",
    "measured_by": "Effort-based decision-making task (EBDM) - threat version",
    "justification": "The threat version of the EBDM task assesses participants' willingness to exert effort to avoid aversive outcomes. The behavior during this task is contrasted with the reward pursuit version to examine differences influenced by different latent factors."
