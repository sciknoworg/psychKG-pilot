    "justification": "The study reveals that visual fixations during the choice stage were guided by both value and estimation uncertainty derived from the Kalman filter model, indicating that relative fixation time in the choice stage can be used as a measure of estimation uncertainty influencing decisions."

    "measured_by": "Unsigned Prediction Error",
    "justification": "The unsigned reward prediction error guided fixation time in the outcome stage. This suggests that unsigned prediction error can serve as an indirect measure of uncertainty during the learning process, as it reflects both estimation and irreducible uncertainty."

    "topic_or_construct": " value",
    "measured_by": "Relative Fixation Time",
    "justification": "Value influenced relative fixation times during the choice stage. This indicates that relative fixation time also reflects the subjective value assigned to each option by the participants, making it a valid measure of perceived value."

    "measured_by": "Lazy Kalman Filter Learning with UCB Choice Rule (KFL-UCB)",
    "justification": "The KFL-UCB model, which combines a lazy Kalman filter for learning with an upper confidence bound choice rule, outperformed other models in describing participants' choices. This indicates that the KFL-UCB model effectively captures the learning and choice processes involved in reinforcement learning tasks."

    "measured_by": "Total Fixation Duration",
    "justification": "Total fixation duration was used to measure visual fixation during both the choice and outcome stages. In the choice stage, the duration of fixation on each option was influenced by value and estimation uncertainty, while in the outcome stage, fixation duration was related to the unsigned reward prediction error."
