    "measured_by": "Scene Grammar Violation",
    "justification": "The text discusses how scene grammar violations affect memory. It mentions that scenes with violations generally lead to worse memory as they negatively impact scene perception and memory, although the exact impact may vary depending on task paradigms. These violations involve objects and object organization that do not align with learned scene expectations."

    "topic_or_construct": "Visual Memory",
    "measured_by": "Object Saliency",
    "justification": "Saliency is identified as a factor that significantly impacts visual memory. More salient objects within a scene are better recalled because they attract visual attention during scene perception, even if observers do not spend longer looking at the salient objects."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Scene Memorability",
    "measured_by": "Memorability Scores",
    "justification": "An image's intrinsic memorability can be measured using memorability scores obtained from memory experiments where observers judge images they previously encoded as either old or new. These scores reflect memory performance and indicate consistency in which scenes observers tend to remember."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Scene Grammar",
    "measured_by": "Schema Knowledge",
    "justification": "Scene grammar violations lead to worse memory in a scene construction task, but the semantic knowledge within observed scenes can also affect memory by guiding attention during viewing. Scene grammar can be seen as derived from schema knowledge which represents common spatial configurations."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Spatial Memory",
    "measured_by": "Boundary Distortion",
    "justification": "Observers display a tendency for boundary extension or contraction in scene memory depending on scene properties and prior expectations. This distortion can be measured empirically, e.g., by asking observers to reproduce scenes from memory."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Scene Categorization",
    "measured_by": "Functional Connectivity (Brain Imaging)",
    "justification": "Scene category processing and recognition can be linked to specific regions in the brain like the VVS, with the ability to be derived from connectivity between regions such as the hippocampus and the RSC during encoding."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Visual Long-Term Memory (VLTM)",
    "measured_by": "Scene Complexity & Clutter",
    "justification": "Observations show VLTM integrates with scene memorability through high-level features, whereas highly cluttered scenes may impair accurate memory initiation due to low-level feature processing issues."
