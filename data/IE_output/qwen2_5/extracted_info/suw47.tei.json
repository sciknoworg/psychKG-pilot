    "justification": "The paper emphasizes that covering values, such as research value and teaching value, which can be measured using citation counts or student satisfaction ratings, are incommensurable. It argues that attributes like conscientiousness and extraversion can be compared only within a specific covering value, suggesting that their rankings reflect the incommensurability between different covering values."

    "measured_by": "ranking and weightings of attributes",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how different attributes (e.g., h-index and teaching quality) are measured in terms of rankings and weightings but are not comparable across different covering values. This is because each attribute contributes differently to incommensurable covering values, such as research value and teaching value, indicating the incommensurability of attributes."

    "topic_or_construct": "decision-making strategies",
    "measured_by": "simple heuristics and rank-based models",
    "justification": "The paper highlights the use of simple heuristics and rank-based models in decision-making processes where attributes are measured and compared in the context of incommensurable covering values. The efficacy of these heuristics suggests that decision-makers adapt to incommensurability by employing rank-based approaches."

    "topic_or_construct": "goal-based decision-making",
    "measured_by": "attribute weightings based on goals",
    "justification": "The paper refers to goal-based decision-making where the measurement of decision-making involves varying attribute weightings based on a decision-maker's specific goals. The presence of multiple conflicting goals requires different weightings and attest the role of goals in shaping decision strategies."
