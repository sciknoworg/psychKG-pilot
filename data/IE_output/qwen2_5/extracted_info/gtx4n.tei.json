    "justification": "The Anticipated Food Scarcity Scale (AFSS) was specifically developed to capture perceptions of future food resources becoming less available among the general population. Studies included in the paper aimed to psychometrically validate the scale, showing that it forms a strong, unidimensional measure with good psychometric properties, distinct from measures of actual food insecurity."
