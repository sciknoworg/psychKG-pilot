    "topic_or_construct": "accuracy prompts",
    "measured_by": "Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) parameters",
    "justification": "The study uses the drift-diffusion model to formalize and test how accuracy prompts affect sharing discernment, focusing on the decision boundary and weight-on-accuracy parameters. This approach is designed to separate influences of deliberation and attention."

    "topic_or_construct": "deliberative thinking",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)",
    "justification": "The Cognitive Reflection Test measures the ability to override intuitive responses with more analytic answers, reflecting deliberative thinking. Performance on CRT correlates with discerning true vs. false news and sharing higher-quality news."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "attention to accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Weight-on-accuracy parameter (\u03b21) from DDM",
    "justification": "The weight placed on accuracy when deliberating (\u03b21) parameter in the DDM indicates how much attention is directed towards accuracy. It was found that accuracy prompts increased this parameter, supporting the attention-based account."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "sharing discernment",
    "measured_by": "Proportion of true headlines shared minus proportion of false headlines shared",
    "justification": "Sharing discernment is quantified as the difference in proportions of true and false headlines shared, which was used to evaluate the impact of accuracy prompts on the quality of news shared."
