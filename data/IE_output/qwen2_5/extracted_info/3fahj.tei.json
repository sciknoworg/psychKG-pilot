They validate this approach by showing that the network-similarity measure correlates with subjective similarity judgments.

    "justification": "Centrality was measured using network properties like local clustering coefficients and connection strength. PCA was used to reduce these measures into principal components, with PC1 and PC2 representing the main axes of variation. These were then used in the statistical models predicting decision-making.

    "justification": "The authors used the network model to compute the connection strength (the average edge weight) within each set of items being evaluated. This measure was intended to reflect the similarity of the items within a set. It was tested as a predictor of choice behavior but ultimately found to have little impact.

    "justification": "Participants rated their preference for individual items on a scale from 1 to 100. These ratings were used directly in the models predicting choice behavior and as the basis for constructing the association network. (Section: 'Results: Participants tended to select the option that aligned with their reported liking ratings.')"
