    "measured_by": "Multi-Round Trust Game",
    "justification": "The study uses a Multi-Round Trust Game to measure trust as participants decide how much of an initial endowment to invest in a trustee. This game quantifies inter-individual differences in the risk-benefit tradeoff for trust and measuring trusting behavior in an unfamiliar social situation. (See Results section and Materials and Methods)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Family Adversity",
    "measured_by": "MOPS and APQ subscales through Principal Component Analysis",
    "justification": "Family adversity is assessed using principal component analysis on scores from the Multi-disciplinary Observation of Parenting Scales (MOPS) and the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ) subscales. The composite score represents retrospectively recalled childhood family experiences that influence trust development. (See Methods section on Childhood Family Experiences)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Quality of Peer Relations",
    "measured_by": "Cambridge Friendship Questionnaire (CFQ)",
    "justification": "The quality of peer relations is measured using the CFQ, which assesses the number and quality of friendships via self-report. Higher scores on the CFQ indicate higher satisfaction with peer relationships, linking initial trust to future social relationships. (See Methods section on Quality of Peer Relations)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social Risk Aversion",
    "measured_by": "Computational model parameter derived from the Multi-Round Trust Game",
    "justification": "Social risk aversion, a key mechanism in the development of trust, is modeled as a preference for keeping money over investing it in the computational model. This parameter shows age-related decreases and is associated with decreased anterior insula grey matter volume. (See Computational Modelling and Main Discussion)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Irritability",
    "measured_by": "Computational model parameter from the Multi-Round Trust Game",
    "justification": "Irritability is a behavioral signature of retaliation characterized by computational modeling from the trust game. Specifically, it captures a shift from rational behavior to harsh punishment when participants experience below-expectation trustee actions. Higher irritability estimates were linked to greater family adversity. (See Results and Computational Modelling)."
