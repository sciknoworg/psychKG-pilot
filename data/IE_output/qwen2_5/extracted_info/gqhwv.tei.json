    "justification": "The article mentions studies where reading time increases at event boundaries, indicating that narrative comprehension is facilitated within events versus across event boundaries, as evidenced by changes in reading times in response to narrative shifts."

    "measured_by": "Memory Tests",
    "justification": "The paper discusses experiments where memory access and recognition are slower and less accurate after an event boundary compared to within the same event, showing the effect of segmentation on memory retrieval. Memory tests were used to assess facilitation within and across event boundaries."

    "topic_or_construct": "Event Segmentation",
    "measured_by": "Neural Activation",
    "justification": "The article mentions neuroimaging data that shows brain responses to event boundaries during passive viewing, indicating the neural mechanisms underlying event segmentation. This suggests that neural activation is used as a measurement of how the brain processes event boundaries."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Event Segmentation",
    "measured_by": "Transition Probabilities and Serial Transitions",
    "justification": "The paper highlights that studies on verbal recall and unconstrained free recall indicate that transition probabilities between recalled items are more common within events than across boundaries. This supports the use of these probabilities as a measure of event encoding and memory structure."

    "measured_by": "Predictive Accuracy and Neural Signals",
    "justification": "The article describes studies where participants watched movie clips and predicted future events, showing a drop in prediction accuracy and changes in neural signals at event boundaries. These measures are used to understand the psychological mechanisms of event segmentation."
