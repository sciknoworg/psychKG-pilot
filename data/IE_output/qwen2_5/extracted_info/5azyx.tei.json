    "justification": "The attention drift-diffusion model (aDDM) is used to model decision-making where the drift rate changes every time a participant visually fixates on one option or another, as described in the Methods section. This model is illustrated and analyzed for its parameter recovery accuracy."

    "justification": "The relative starting-time drift-diffusion model (stDDM) is used to model decision-making where one attribute's evidence accumulation may start before another, such as in food items with healthiness and palatability. The model incorporates this timing and the results show accurate parameter recovery."
