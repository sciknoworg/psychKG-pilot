    "justification": "The paper describes a survey methodology where participants rated their likelihood to engage in behaviors represented as verb phrases, using a 7-point Likert scale. The survey collected a large dataset of behavior propensity ratings, which was then used to train machine learning models for predictive modeling."

    "measured_by": "USE and BERT Models",
    "justification": "The research created vector representations of behavior phrases using transformer models like the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). These representations were used as inputs for predicting behavioral propensities and comparing model performance."
