    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Effort Avoidance",
    "measured_by": "Demand Ratings using the NASA TLX scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated how mentally demanding each choice was using the NASA TLX scale, which captured their subjective cognitive effort, demonstrating that high-demand risky choices were rated as more demanding."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Effort Avoidance",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported Decision Confidence",
    "justification": "Participants reported their confidence in making the best choice after each decision on a 1-7 scale. The results showed lower confidence ratings for high-demand risky choices, linking subjective effort with confidence."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Effort Avoidance",
    "measured_by": "Response Times (RTs)",
    "justification": "Slower decision-making response times were observed for high-demand compared to low-demand risky choices, indicating increased cognitive effort investment."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Effort Avoidance",
    "measured_by": "Task-Evoked Pupillary Responses (TEPRs)",
    "justification": "TEPRs were used as an index of effort investment, with larger response magnitudes occurring during low-demand compared to high-demand choices, suggesting effort withdrawal in more difficult decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Effort Avoidance",
    "measured_by": "Demand Avoidance Task",
    "justification": "Participants preferred stimuli associated with low-demand risky choices over high-demand choices, demonstrating avoidance of cognitively demanding decision-making situations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Effort Avoidance",
    "measured_by": "Gaze Patterns and Shifts",
    "justification": "More frequent gaze shifts between options were observed during low-demand choices, indicating greater effortful comparison and information sampling in simpler decisions."
