    "measured_by": "Hypocritical blame index",
    "justification": "The paper operationalized moral hypocrisy as hypocritical blame, quantifying it using a 'hypocritical blame index' calculated from participants' moral decisions and subsequent judgments about others' behavior in similar scenarios. This index captures discrepancies between participants' behavior and their moral judgments."

    "topic_or_construct": "Moral standards",
    "measured_by": "Blameworthiness judgments",
    "justification": "Neural responses to moral standards were measured through participants' blameworthiness judgments of harmful choices in the moral judgment task. These trial-wise blameworthiness judgments were used to operationalize moral standards based on participants' behavior and judgments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Feelings of moral conflict",
    "measured_by": "Self-report conflicted feeling scale",
    "justification": "Participants reported their subjective feelings of moral conflict on a 7-point Likert scale after completing the moral decision-making task. This self-report measure was used to assess the level of conflicted feelings experienced during moral decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Guilt",
    "measured_by": "Guilt-Related Brain Signature (GRBS)",
    "justification": "The study utilized an independently trained multivariate brain-based classifier, the Guilt-Related Brain Signature (GRBS), to identify and measure guilt-related neurocognitive processes during moral decision-making tasks without directly asking participants to report their feelings of guilt."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Moral decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Incentivized moral decision-making task",
    "justification": "Participants' moral decisions were measured through an incentivized task where they chose between options involving money for themselves and electric shocks for another person or themselves. This task allowed researchers to quantify participants\u2019 harm aversion and moral choices."
