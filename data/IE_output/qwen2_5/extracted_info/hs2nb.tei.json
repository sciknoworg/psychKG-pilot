    "measured_by": "Lee and Moray's (1994) two-item questionnaire",
    "justification": "Participants rated their level of confidence in their face matching ability and their trust in the simulated automated facial recognition system on a 0-10 scale. These ratings were then used to calculate a relative trust in automation score by subtracting self-confidence from trust in automation, consistent with Lee and Moray's methodology."

    "measured_by": "Glasgow Face Matching Test 2 (GFMT2-S)",
    "justification": "The GFMT2-S was used to assess participants' ability to match unfamiliar faces, consisting of 80 pairs divided into two sets of equal difficulty. Participants completed the task both unassisted and with assistance from a simulated automated facial recognition system."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived accuracy and trust",
    "measured_by": "Exploratory questionnaire items",
    "justification": "Participants answered questions about their perceived accuracy, trust in the automated system, and their confidence in face matching at various points in the study. These responses were then correlated with actual performance to analyze individual differences."
