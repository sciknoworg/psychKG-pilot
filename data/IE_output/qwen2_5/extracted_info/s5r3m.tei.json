    "measured_by": "Motion coherence task",
    "justification": "The motion coherence task was used to assess visual motion processing. It requires participants to discriminate the direction of motion carried by coherently moving signal dots in a field of randomly moving noise dots, which quantifies how autistic individuals process visual motion cues."

    "measured_by": "Direction integration task",
    "justification": "The direction integration task was used to assess visual motion processing. It involves participants discriminating the average direction of dots moving in directions sampled from a Gaussian distribution, with difficulty manipulated by increasing the variability of dot directions."

    "measured_by": "Diffusion model",
    "justification": "Diffusion models were applied to analyze accuracy and response time data, decomposing performance into distinct processing stages like drift-rate, boundary separation, and non-decision time, providing insight into the decision-making parameters of autistic individuals."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Perceptual decision-making parameters",
    "measured_by": "Drift rate, boundary separation, non-decision time",
    "justification": "These specific parameters from the diffusion model were extracted to quantify the rates of evidence accumulation (drift rate), response cautiousness (boundary separation), and sensory encoding/response generation time (non-decision time) in autistic children compared to typically developing children."

    "justification": "Empirical investigations of sensory processing in autism have used psychophysical thresholds to measure differences in sensitivity between autistic and non-autistic individuals, covering how sensory information is processed."
