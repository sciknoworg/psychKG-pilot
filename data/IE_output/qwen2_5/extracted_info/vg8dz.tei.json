    "topic_or_construct": "Enjoyment/Intrinsic Reward",
    "measured_by": "Subjective Ratings",
    "justification": "Across three video games (Robozzle, Trackmania, and Super Mario Maker), the authors used subjective ratings from players as an indicator of intrinsic reward, finding an inverted U-shaped relationship between difficulty and enjoyment. These ratings were used to analyze players' preferences and perceptions of fun in the games."

    "topic_or_construct": "Enjoyment/Intrinsic Reward",
    "measured_by": "Engagement Behavior",
    "justification": "The study utilized engagement behavior as a measure of enjoyment, particularly in the guessing game and the grid exploration game. In these experiments, the number of guesses or tiles players opened served as an approximation of their intrinsic motivation and perceived enjoyment."

    "topic_or_construct": "Learning Progress",
    "measured_by": "Engagement in Guessing Game",
    "justification": "In the guessing game experiment, learning progress was measured by the number of guesses participants made with each machine. A Kalman filter simulation was used to assess the learning progress dependent on the variance of the machines, and participants' engagement was highest with intermediate variance, reflecting learning progress."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Learning Progress",
    "measured_by": "Grid Exploration Activity",
    "justification": "In the grid exploration game, learning progress was indirectly measured through the number of tiles participants opened. The higher the learning progress, indicated by intermediate levels of smoothness in grids, the more exploration and opening of tiles occurred, suggesting that learning progress influenced engagement."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Difficulty-Expectation Disparity",
    "measured_by": "Difference Between Expected and Calculated Difficulty",
    "justification": "The authors examined the influence of the difficulty-expectation disparity by looking at the mismatch between players' prior expectations about difficulty and the actual calculated difficulty. In the Super Mario Maker dataset, this was shown to influence ratings, with players preferring levels where expectations matched reality."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Success",
    "measured_by": "Number of Correct Guesses in the Guessing Game",
    "justification": "The authors noted the influence of success as another factor contributing to enjoyment. In the guessing game, the number of correct guesses indicated the success factor; participants were more engaged when they were successful in guessing numbers from these distributions."
