    "measured_by": "Goal perseverance paradigm",
    "justification": "The study measures intentional commitment using the 'goal perseverance' paradigm, defined as the persistence in pursuing the initially intended goal even when unexpected disruptions render it suboptimal. This implicit bias is neither mentioned nor required in the task and can even hurt the main task performance, making it a valid measure of commitment."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social context impact on commitment",
    "measured_by": "Presence of others in different experimental contexts",
    "justification": "The study manipulates the social context with a second person present, an AI playing alongside participants, and another human participant to measure the impact on commitment. Results show that the presence of others enhances 'goal perseverance,' indicating that social context affects commitment strength."

    "topic_or_construct": "Theory of mind and conflict avoidance",
    "measured_by": "Bayesian Theory of Mind (BToM) model",
    "justification": "A Bayesian Theory of Mind (BToM) model is used to infer human intentions from actions. The model reveals that participants tend to reveal their intentions faster in the presence of others and avoid conflicts by choosing different destinations, demonstrating the use of theory of mind in spontaneous coordination."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Spontaneous intention coordination",
    "measured_by": "Conflict avoidance behavior",
    "justification": "The study measures coordination through 'conflict avoidance', observing the tendency of participants to choose a different destination from the other agent. Results indicate that individuals avoid pursuing the same goals as others, even in independent tasks, indicating spontaneous intention coordination."
