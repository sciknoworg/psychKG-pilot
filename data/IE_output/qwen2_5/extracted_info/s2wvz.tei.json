    "measured_by": "Figures and experimental tasks",
    "justification": "The paper describes various perceptual illusions, such as the shape-from-shading (Figure 1b) and orientation illusions, which are measured using figures and detailed experimental tasks designed to reveal how sensory illusions can be understood through statistical properties of natural scenes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Economic decision-making bias",
    "measured_by": "Lottery choice experiments",
    "justification": "The paper discusses biases in economic decisions using examples from lottery choice experiments, where participants' preferences for safer lotteries with lower expected value reveal risk aversion. This illustrates how behavioral economic choices deviate from expected utility maximization."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Bayesian inference in perception",
    "measured_by": "Population coding model",
    "justification": "The paper utilizes a population coding model that emulates Bayesian inference in the brain to explain perceptual phenomena. It combines sensory likelihoods with prior beliefs, offering a computational framework to model perceptual inferences and biases."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Efficient coding in visual perception",
    "measured_by": "Neural tuning curve changes",
    "justification": "Efficient coding is discussed as a principle driving the shape of neural tuning curves, particularly in how neurons efficiently represent natural statistics. This model is used to explain perceptual biases and repulsive biases in orientation judgments (Figure 2b)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Heuristic-based tasks",
    "justification": "The paper explores cognitive decision-making using heuristic-based tasks like the card selection task (Figure 1e) to illustrate how humans might use simpler decision strategies that are adaptive in real-world scenarios. This illustrates how heuristics can be viewed as regularized versions of optimal policies."
