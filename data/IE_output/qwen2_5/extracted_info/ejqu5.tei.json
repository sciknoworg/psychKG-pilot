    "measured_by": "SubjectiveRatingScale",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to rate their subjective freedom of choice using a scale ranging from 'completely dependent on the stimulus' to 'completely independent of the stimulus,' allowing researchers to assess their perceived ability to detach from sensory stimuli."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "ObjectiveAbilityForDetachment",
    "measured_by": "ResponseCongruency",
    "justification": "The objective ability of participants to make choices independent of the stimulus was measured by the proportion of responses congruent with or incongruent to the dominant motion direction of the dot-motion stimulus during 'detach' trials."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "FreedomFromSensoryInfluence",
    "measured_by": "ReverseCorrelationAnalysis",
    "justification": "An objective measure of freedom from sensory influence was derived using a reverse correlation analysis of motion energy data, which helped researchers assess the relationship between signal strength and response type across trials."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "ResponseInhibition",
    "measured_by": "Adhere-and-OpposeTrials",
    "justification": "Participants' ability to inhibit prepotent responses was assessed through adhere and oppose conditions, where they either followed or opposed the dot-motion stimulus. The subjective sense of freedom differed based on whether participants adhered or opposed."
