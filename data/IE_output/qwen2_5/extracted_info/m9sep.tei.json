    "measured_by": "prosocial choice task",
    "justification": "The prosocial choice task is used to demonstrate prosociality in primates, simulating a scenario where individuals choose between a selfish action that greatly benefits the actor but slightly harms others, and a prosocial action that modestly benefits everyone. This task evaluates the tendency of individuals to act for the benefit of others even at a personal cost."

    "topic_or_construct": "Ingroup favoritism",
    "measured_by": "minimal group paradigms and naturalistic intergroup contexts",
    "justification": "These paradigms are used to identify evidence that ingroup favoritism is driven by social norms. They involve observing individuals' tendencies to predominantly benefit members of their own group, compared to outgroup members, across various experimental and observational settings."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Stickiness",
    "measured_by": "field and laboratory studies",
    "justification": "Field and laboratory studies demonstrate how people continue to adhere to established norms even when they seem disadvantageous or arbitrary. For example, laboratory studies show that people stick to a prosocial norm induced by a tax even after the tax is removed."

    "topic_or_construct": "Self-reinforcement",
    "measured_by": "lab experiments and empirical work",
    "justification": "These methods are used to observe how individuals align their preferences with arbitrary norms manipulated by experimenters. Empirical work on climate change shows that people are more likely to adopt environmentally friendly practices if others do, indicating rapid change once a critical threshold of group support is reached."

    "topic_or_construct": "Local conformity / global diversity",
    "measured_by": "field studies and simulations",
    "justification": "Field studies and simulations are used to illustrate the tendency of local groups to exhibit uniform behavior, while overall diversity is maintained across different groups. For example, conventions like language remain similar within a local community but differ widely across communities."
