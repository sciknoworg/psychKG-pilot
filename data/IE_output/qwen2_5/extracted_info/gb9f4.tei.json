    "justification": "The article calculates metacognitive efficiency using signal detection theory approach and maximum likelihood estimation (Meta-d'/d') to assess how well participants' confidence ratings were calibrated to their actual performance. This measure was used to evaluate the improvement of metacognitive efficiency in adolescents compared to pre-adolescents."

    "topic_or_construct": "Advice taking",
    "measured_by": "Propensity to follow advice and resistance to false advice",
    "justification": "The article measures advice taking through calculating overall propensity to follow advice and resistance to false advice based on participants' behavior when receiving conflicting advice. These measures were used to assess how advice was integrated into participants' decision-making process and how it was influenced by their developmental stage."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive bias",
    "measured_by": "Mean confidence rating across trials",
    "justification": "Metacognitive bias was quantified by calculating the mean confidence rating across all trials in which confidence ratings were given. This allowed the researchers to assess overall confidence levels in participants and identify trends, such as heightened confidence in early adolescents."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making performance",
    "measured_by": "Staircase procedure (Space Explorers task)",
    "justification": "The researchers used a staircase procedure within the Space Explorers task to match participants' performance across different age groups. This ensured that any differences in metacognitive abilities could be attributed to changes in confidence calibration rather than differences in task performance."
