    "justification": "The study uses eye-tracking to measure gaze patterns during the Pavlovian learning phase, specifically classifying participants as sign-trackers based on higher dwell time on the reward-predictive cue compared to the reward location. This method supports the attribution of higher incentive value to the conditioned stimulus in sign-trackers. (See: Gaze index analysis and sign-trackers/goal-trackers categorization in the Methods section)"

    "topic_or_construct": "goal-tracking behavior",
    "measured_by": "eye-tracking analysis",
    "justification": "Similar to sign-tracking behavior, goal-tracking behavior is measured via eye-tracking analysis, where participants categorized as goal-trackers were identified by their tendency to look directly at the location of the reward rather than the cue. This classification is based on lower gaze index values. (See: Gaze index analysis and sign-trackers/goal-trackers categorization in the Methods section)"

    "topic_or_construct": "incentive value attribution",
    "measured_by": "pupil dilation analysis",
    "justification": "Pupil dilation is used as a psychophysiological indicator of incentive value attribution to conditioned stimuli (CSs). The increase in pupil dilation in response to CSs+ compared to CS- is regarded as an index of the incentive value of these CSs in sign-trackers. This measurement supports the differential processing of reward-related cues between sign-trackers and goal-trackers. (See: Pupil dilation analysis section)"

    "measured_by": "Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) paradigm",
    "justification": "The PIT paradigm examines how Pavlovian cues influence instrumental decision-making. The study finds that sign-trackers exhibit greater maladaptive Pavlovian bias in decision-making compared to goal-trackers, particularly when a reward cue associated with a poor option is presented. This bias is observable through an increased percentage of suboptimal choices in sign-trackers during the transfer phase. (See: Transfer phase and Computational model sections)"

    "topic_or_construct": "rate of cue value updating",
    "measured_by": "computational modeling (Pavlovian \u03b1)",
    "justification": "Computational modeling is employed to estimate the learning rate for conditioned stimulus (CS) value updating (Pavlovian \u03b1). The results indicate that sign-trackers exhibit a lower Pavlovian \u03b1, reflecting a slower updating of cue value compared to goal-trackers. This suggests that sign-trackers are less able to adjust their response strategies based on current reward contingencies. (See: Computational model and Computational model Bayesian Informative Hypotheses sections)"
