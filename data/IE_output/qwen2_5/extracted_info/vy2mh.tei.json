    "justification": "The \u03b1 parameter in the LF model is interpreted as reflecting decision stability, with increases in \u03b1 indicating greater consistency in strategy execution as participants gain experience. Systematic changes in \u03b1 with practice support this psychological interpretation."

    "justification": "The article discusses the DDM as a fundamental model of simple decision-making, where parameters such as drift rate and boundary separation capture the process of accumulating evidence in perceptual decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Fast error patterns",
    "measured_by": "L\u00e9vy Flights (LF) model",
    "justification": "The LF model accounts for fast errors in decision data through the \u03b1 parameter, which shifts the accumulation process towards incorrect boundaries due to sudden jumps, reflecting genuine decision dynamics."
