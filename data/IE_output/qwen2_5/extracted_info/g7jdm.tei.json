    "measured_by": "conflict negativity (CN) ERP",
    "justification": "The authors utilized the conflict negativity (CN), a negative-going ERP, to measure decision conflict during financial decisions. This was based on previous neuroscience research indicating that the CN reflects neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) related to conflict monitoring (Di Domenico et al., 2016; Nakao et al., 2010). The CN was operationalized by measuring the mean amplitude in a 0 to 100 ms window post-response at electrode Cz."

    "topic_or_construct": "behavioral indecision",
    "measured_by": "mean reaction time",
    "justification": "Participants' behavioral indecision was measured using mean reaction time, which was found to increase during high conflict trials compared to low conflict trials (especially for high expected value options). This finding aligns with the hypothesis that decisions between similarly good options lead to greater behavioral indecision."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "affective responses to conflict",
    "measured_by": "self-reported positive and anxious feelings",
    "justification": "Participants rated their feelings (positive and anxious) on a scale from 1 to 10 after each set of decisions. The study found that high objective conflict led to slightly lower positive feelings compared to low conflict, and subjective conflict increased anxious feelings. These self-reported measures provided insight into the affective impact of decision conflict."

    "topic_or_construct": "subjective value of investment options",
    "measured_by": "online pre-test questionnaire",
    "justification": "Subjective impressions of the eight companies (liking, trust, and perceived good investment) were assessed through an online pre-test questionnaire using 5-point Likert scales. These subjective values were used to understand how personal preferences impact financial decision-making processes."
