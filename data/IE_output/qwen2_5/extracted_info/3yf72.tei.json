    "justification": "The article utilizes the NFCS scale to measure individual differences in need for cognitive closure, which influences susceptibility to partisan role bias. This is supported by the statement: 'We found that participants with higher NFC scores were far more susceptible to partisan role bias than those with lower NFC scores.' The NFCS measures preferences for order, discomfort with ambiguity, decisiveness, and closed-mindedness."

    "measured_by": "Consider-the-opposite (CTO) de-biasing prompt",
    "justification": "The CTO de-biasing prompt was used to reduce partisan role bias in predictive judgments. The effectiveness was measured based on whether participants' arbitral predictions were affected by their assigned role: 'We found that all law students\u2014even high-NFC students\u2014could be prompted to be less biased\u2014at least in their predictive judgments.' This intervention aimed to de-bias judgments by encouraging subjects to consider weaknesses in their case."

    "justification": "Participants' predictive judgments were measured by their estimations of the judge's arbitral award. The article reports: 'Although students' arbitral predictions were only marginally affected by their assignment to the role of plaintiff's or defendant's counsel, their fairness assessments were, on average, highly influenced by their role assignment.' This indicates the measurement method used for assessing predictive judgments."

    "justification": "Participants' fairness assessments were measured by their estimations of fair settlement values. The article states: 'Their fairness assessments were, on average, highly influenced by their role assignment.' The estimation of fair settlement value is used as a metric for gauging fairness assessments, showing significant partisan differences."
