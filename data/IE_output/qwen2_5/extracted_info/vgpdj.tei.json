    "topic_or_construct": "Risk-taking behavior",
    "measured_by": "1-step lookahead variance",
    "justification": "The paper proposes a new algorithm measuring risk as the variance of expected outcomes after an opponent's immediate response, which accounts for adversarial risk in chess games."

    "topic_or_construct": "Expertise effects in risk preference",
    "measured_by": "Player ELO ratings and log standard deviation of risk",
    "justification": "The study groups players by ELO ratings and analyzes mean risk taken (log standard deviation), showing a clear decrease in risk-taking behavior by stronger players, indicating expertise impacts risk preference."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Opponent-dependent risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "Mean riskiness for each player/opponent ELO combination",
    "justification": "By binning players by ELO and calculating mean riskiness for each player versus opponent ELO match-up, the study reveals that risk preferences vary depending on the opponent's skill level."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "State-dependent risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "Game state value prior to each move",
    "justification": "The paper evaluates the value of the game state before each move, demonstrating that players take more risk when in winning or losing positions, aligning with theories like 'house money' and 'break-even'."

    "topic_or_construct": "Increased risk-taking following mistakes",
    "measured_by": "Stockfish evaluations post-blunder",
    "justification": "Stockfish evaluations of game states are used to identify blunders and subsequent moves, revealing that players increase risk-taking following significant mistakes in an attempt to recover."
