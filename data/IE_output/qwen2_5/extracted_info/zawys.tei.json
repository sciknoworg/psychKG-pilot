    "measured_by": "5-trial Choice Problems with Goals",
    "justification": "The paper employs a 5-trial choice task design with goals to assess risk taking. Participants made repeated choices between two risky options until a time horizon was reached, aiming to reach a specified goal. This method is used to investigate framing effects in goal-based risky decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Outcome Domain Effect",
    "measured_by": "Gain vs. Loss Outcomes",
    "justification": "The study manipulates the outcome domain by presenting options with either gain outcomes or loss outcomes. This allows for the testing of gain-loss framing effects on goal-based risk taking in accordance with classic framing theories."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "State Domain Effect",
    "measured_by": "Positive vs. Negative Initial Resource States",
    "justification": "The paper investigates the effect of the state domain on risk taking by manipulating the initial resource state as positive, negative, or zero. This manipulation helps to assess how different initial conditions influence risky choices with goals."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Optimality",
    "measured_by": "Expected Advantage Calculation",
    "justification": "The optimal model's predictions were compared against participants' choices using a continuous measure of advantage. The advantage a of the risky option over the safe option was calculated for all states and trials, helping to assess choice optimality."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Task Performance",
    "measured_by": "Goal Achievement Rate",
    "justification": "Participants' success rate in achieving the goal across different choice problems was measured, allowing an evaluation of how various factors (like framing) affected their overall task performance."
