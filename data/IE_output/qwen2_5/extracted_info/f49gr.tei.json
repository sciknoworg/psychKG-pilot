    "justification": "The study measures internalizing symptoms using both the AQ10 for autism-related traits and the STICSA-T for trait anxiety, tying these measures to performance in the interactive predator-prey task."

    "measured_by": "ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS)",
    "justification": "The ASRS was used to measure inattentive/neurodevelopmental symptoms, which were linked to greater accuracy in task predictions due to increased use of model-based strategies."

    "topic_or_construct": "Externalizing symptoms",
    "measured_by": "Externalising Symptom Inventory Short Form (ESI-SF)",
    "justification": "The ESI-SF is utilized to capture externalizing symptoms, which correlate with poorer prediction accuracy and lower use of model-based strategies in the task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Transdiagnostic symptom dimensions",
    "measured_by": "Exploratory factor analysis (EFA)",
    "justification": "The hierarchical structure of symptom dimensions is established through EFA, which operates on a range of questionnaires (AQ10, ASRS, etc.), showing how these dimensions relate to task performance."
