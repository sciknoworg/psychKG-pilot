    "justification": "The Adaptive Gain model was used to explain human behavior in tasks with variable evidence strength and reliability. EEG data supported the model's predictions about the encoding of decision variables, prediction error, and time elapsed."

    "measured_by": "Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT)",
    "justification": "The SPRT model was applied to investigate how evidence was accumulated for decision-making. While behaviorally similar to the Adaptive Gain model, the SPRT's specific predictions about neural encoding of logarithmic posterior ratios were not supported by EEG data."

    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal context in decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Global Urgency Signals",
    "justification": "The study examined how time elapsed affected decision-making through the presence of urgency signals in beta-band neural activity, suggesting time-dependent urgency influenced choices independently of accumulating evidence."

    "topic_or_construct": "Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Reaction time distributions and stopping behavior",
    "justification": "The DDM was applied to model decision latencies but provided a poor fit to the experimental data in heteroscedastic environments, emphasizing the importance of evidence weighting and temporal dynamics."
