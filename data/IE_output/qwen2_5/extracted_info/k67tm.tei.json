    "justification": "The two-step task with graded rewards (modified from the traditional version) is used to induce a path-based terminal state representation, allowing researchers to disambiguate control by model-free RL from control by action sequences. The task's results suggest that participants exhibit MF-like behavior in the form of a main effect of reward on Stage 1 choice, indicating the involvement of model-free RL in habitual behavior."

    "measured_by": "Two-step task with graded rewards",
    "justification": "The two-step task with graded rewards is employed to provide unique signatures of MF RL in experiment settings. Participants' Stage 1 choices being influenced by rewards received during rare transitions suggest the presence of model-free control, supporting the notion that model-free RL plays a role in some aspects of decision-making."

    "measured_by": "Analysis of Stage 2 choices and reaction times",
    "justification": "The presence of action sequences is evidenced through the analysis of Stage 2 choices and reaction times after common transitions. The positive two-way interaction between last trial's reward and this trial's Stage 1 choice suggests that participants repeat action sequences, particularly after being rewarded, indicating that action sequences are being employed."

    "measured_by": "Two-way and three-way interactions in Experiment 2",
    "justification": "The use of model-based control for action sequences is demonstrated through the observed lack of a two-way interaction between Stage 1 choice and last trial's reward after rare transitions, coupled with a significant three-way interaction, indicating that participants use model-based control specifically for selecting action sequences."
