    "measured_by": "Multi-Round Trust Task (MRT)",
    "justification": "The article describes how the multi-round trust task (MRT) was used to quantify the evolution of the willingness to trust strangers across ages 14 to 25, focusing on social investment behavior in a strategic economic exchange setting."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Aversion",
    "measured_by": "MRT Parameter (\u03c9)",
    "justification": "Risk aversion was measured with the parameter \u03c9 within the MRT model, which quantifies an investor's relative valuation of certain and invested assets, and was found to explain a substantial portion of variability in investment behavior across participants."

    "topic_or_construct": "Inequality Aversion",
    "measured_by": "MRT Parameter (\u03b1)",
    "justification": "Inequality aversion, measured with the parameter \u03b1 in the MRT model, was used to quantify sensitivity to advantageous unequal outcomes, showing that males tended to invest less in unknown others compared to females."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Theory of Mind",
    "measured_by": "MRT Parameter (k)",
    "justification": "Theory of mind, measured with the parameter k in the MRT model, captured the mentalizing steps an investor employed to model the interaction. It was found that investors with higher IQ had significantly lower theory of mind level."

    "topic_or_construct": "Planning Horizon",
    "measured_by": "MRT Parameter (n)",
    "justification": "The planning horizon, represented by the parameter n in the MRT model, quantified the number of future exchanges considered by the investor. It was found that higher socioeconomic status correlated with a longer planning horizon."

    "topic_or_construct": "Irritability",
    "measured_by": "MRT Parameter (\u03b6)",
    "justification": "Irritability was measured with the parameter \u03b6 in the MRT model, representing a potential state shift to and from an irritated state due to unmet expectations by a partner. Participants tended to reduce their irritability concern with age."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Irritation Belief",
    "measured_by": "MRT Parameter (\u03b6*)",
    "justification": "Irritation belief, measured with the parameter \u03b6*, represented a subject's sensitivity to the possibility of partner irritability. It was found that irritation beliefs decreased with age among participants."
