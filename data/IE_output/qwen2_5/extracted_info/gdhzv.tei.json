    "measured_by": "four-choice risky decision task with risky and safe options",
    "justification": "The paper employs a four-choice risky decision task where participants choose between risky and safe options. This task is used to measure risk-taking behavior in response to sensory prediction errors."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "option switching",
    "measured_by": "percentage of trials with repeated choices",
    "justification": "Option switching is measured by calculating the percentage of trials where participants choose the same option as the previous trial, revealing the impact of sensory prediction errors on repetitive choice patterns."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "sensory prediction errors",
    "measured_by": "auditory stimuli with common and rare tone sequences",
    "justification": "Sensory prediction errors are elicited through the use of auditory stimuli featuring 'common' and 'rare' sequences, which participants hear before making risky decisions. This method allows researchers to study how unexpected sensory events influence decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "risk taking under uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Prospect Theory model with Risky Bias parameter",
    "justification": "To model the influence of sensory prediction errors on risk taking independent of option value, the researchers use a Prospect Theory model with a Risky Bias parameter, which fits choice behavior well across various experiments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "choice perseveration",
    "measured_by": "Perseveration parameter in the Risky Bias model",
    "justification": "The researchers introduce a Perseveration parameter to their Risky Bias model to quantify and explain the increased option switching observed when participants encounter rare auditory sequences."
