    "measured_by": "Multi-round trust game",
    "justification": "The study used the multi-round trust game as an economic exchange task to systematically investigate how adolescents sustain cooperation with different types of partners, including fixed computer algorithms, adaptive computer algorithms, and human peers."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Adolescent Social Skills",
    "measured_by": "Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2)",
    "justification": "The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) was used to measure social skills in adolescents, which was found to predict cooperation behavior in social versus non-social conditions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Intelligence (IQ)",
    "measured_by": "Differential Ability Scales-second edition (DAS-II) and Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence Second Edition (WASI-II)",
    "justification": "The study measured IQ using either the DAS-II at Yale University or the WASI-II at George Washington University. IQ scores were included as a predictor of cooperation behavior, showing a significant effect on cooperation frequency and generosity."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Adaptivity in Cooperation",
    "measured_by": "Iterative trust game with fixed and adaptive computer partners",
    "justification": "Participants\u2019 adaptation and cooperation behaviors were observed and analyzed when they played the trust game with fixed partners (70% and 30% reciprocation rates) versus adaptive computer partners, which could mimic human behavior and promote sustained cooperation over time."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Sustained Cooperation",
    "measured_by": "Computational modeling of behavior",
    "justification": "Computational models, including variants of tit-for-tat (t4t) and reinforcement learning (RL) models, were used to describe participants\u2019 cooperation strategies and their ability to sustain cooperation over time, particularly under different conditions of adaptivity and social contexts."
