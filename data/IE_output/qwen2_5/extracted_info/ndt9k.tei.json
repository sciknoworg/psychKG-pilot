    "topic_or_construct": "Chronic loneliness",
    "measured_by": "UCLA Loneliness Scale",
    "justification": "The study mentions collecting measures of chronic loneliness using the UCLA Loneliness Scale during the online screening, which is a widely used and validated measure for assessing chronic loneliness."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "State loneliness",
    "measured_by": "Self-report questionnaires",
    "justification": "Participants self-reported their feelings of state loneliness at multiple points during the isolation sessions. This self-report method was consistently used throughout the study to assess changes in state loneliness in response to the experimental manipulations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward seeking",
    "measured_by": "Effort-based Decision Making (EBDM) task",
    "justification": "Reward seeking was measured through the EBDM task, where participants' response times to decide whether to undertake effortful tasks for rewards were used as a measure of reward seeking behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward learning",
    "measured_by": "Probabilistic reinforcement and reversal learning (RL) task",
    "justification": "The RL task was used to measure participants' ability to learn from feedback and reverse learned associations. Performance on this task was analyzed using computational models to derive learning parameters."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Neural reward sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task combined with fMRI",
    "justification": "Neural reward sensitivity was assessed using the MID task during functional MRI scanning, focusing on neural activity in regions associated with reward processing. Both univariate and multivariate measures were derived from this task."
