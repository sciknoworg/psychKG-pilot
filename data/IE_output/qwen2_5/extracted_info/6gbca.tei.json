    "measured_by": "Cumulative Format",
    "justification": "The paper indicates that participants' judgments were influenced by cumulative scores when data were presented in a cumulative format, leading to a favoring of the frequently leading competitor, thus demonstrating the cumulative redundancy bias."

    "topic_or_construct": "Performance Slope Bias (PSB)",
    "measured_by": "Incremental Format",
    "justification": "The bias favoring the trailing competitor with a steeper upward performance slope was observed when data were presented in an incremental format, highlighting the impact of performance slopes on participants' judgments."

    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive Flexibility",
    "measured_by": "Favorability Ratios on Performance Ratings",
    "justification": "The study's experimental design manipulated the context and presentation of performance data, revealing how participants could flexibly switch between relying on ranking frequency (CRB) and performance slopes (PSB), depending on the stimuli."
