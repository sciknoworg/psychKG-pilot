    "measured_by": "Functional Trajectory Analysis (FTA) via mouse-tracking",
    "justification": "Mouse-tracking data analyzed with FTA reveals discrete trajectories characteristic of impulse inhibition, where initial impulses toward temptation are followed by a correction back toward the long-term goal, supporting this measure of the construct."

    "measured_by": "Functional Trajectory Analysis (FTA) via mouse-tracking",
    "justification": "Mouse-tracking data analyzed with FTA shows continuous trajectories, indicating a simultaneous push-pull between goals and temptations until one wins out, supporting this measure of the construct."

    "measured_by": "Functional Trajectory Analysis (FTA) via mouse-tracking and quasi-hyperbolic discounting model",
    "justification": "Analysis with FTA identifies subclusters of impulse inhibition and dynamic competition. Additionally, using the quasi-hyperbolic discounting model parameters, researchers found that more present-biased individuals are more likely to rely on impulse inhibition, showing how the measurement captures differences in self-control strategies."
