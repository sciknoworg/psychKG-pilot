    "justification": "Sensitivity to outcome devaluation is a hallmark of goal-directed behavior. Friedel et al.

    "justification": "The insensitivity to outcome devaluation is a hallmark of habitual behavior. Studies using the two-step task combined with selective devaluation, such as Friedel et al. (2014), showed no correlation between habitual responding and model-free learning, suggesting that these methods highlight the nature of habitual actions."

    "measured_by": "Two-step Task",
    "justification": "The two-step task is used to index model-based RL. Participants' propensity for model-based behavior in the two-step task was correlated with goal-directed behavior, suggesting that this task measures an agent's ability to update their action selection according to task contingencies and outcomes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Model-Free Reinforcement Learning",
    "measured_by": "Two-step Task",
    "justification": "The same two-step task also measures model-free RL, where participants' behavior is driven by direct, trial-and-error learning with no consideration of the task\u2019s underlying structure, highlighting the balance between model-based and model-free approaches."

    "topic_or_construct": "Goal-Directed Actions",
    "measured_by": "Contingency Degradation Task",
    "justification": "Behavioral evidence suggests that goal-directed actions are sensitive to contingency degradation; participants alter their responses when the action-outcome relationship breaks down, supporting the use of the contingency degradation task to measure goal-directed behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Habitual Actions",
    "measured_by": "Contingency Degradation Task",
    "justification": "Habitual actions are typified by insensitivity to contingency degradation; participants persist with their responses despite changes in the action-outcome relationship, illustrating that the contingency degradation task can capture habitual action."
