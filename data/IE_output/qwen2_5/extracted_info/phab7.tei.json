    "justification": "The study examined mate choice rationality using various transitive models. The models were compared against intransitive models to evaluate the transitivity of mate preferences. The Bayesian model selection approach indicated that transitive models, particularly strong stochastic transitivity, best fit the data for both sexes and in both long-term and short-term mating contexts."

    "measured_by": "Lexicographic semiorder models and saturated model",
    "justification": "The lexicographic semiorder models and the saturated model were used to test decision-making patterns that allow for intransitive preferences. These models were compared with transitive models to assess whether participants' mate preferences were transitive. The results showed that fewer participants were best fit by the lexicographic semiorder models compared to the transitive models."

    "measured_by": "Face images and annual income levels",
    "justification": "Physical attractiveness was assessed using face images selected from the Oriental Face Database, which were rated by independent participants for attractiveness. Financial resources were indicated by different levels of annual income. Profiles were created varying in these attributes to study their impact on mate selection."
