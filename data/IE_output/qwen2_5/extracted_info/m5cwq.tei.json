    "justification": "The paper introduced and validated the Speciesism Scale to measure speciesism as a psychological construct. The scale was developed based on rigorous factor analysis and psychometric validation, including EFA and CFA, and shown to have high internal consistency and test-retest reliability. It explicitly captures the moral discrimination based solely on species membership."
