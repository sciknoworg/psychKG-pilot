    "topic_or_construct": "Prediction accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Duration of pre-move fixations",
    "justification": "Prediction accuracy was assessed through the duration of participants' fixations at empty squares prior to the actual move, with longer fixation times on the correct square interpreted as higher accuracy (as detailed in the prediction accuracy calculation method)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Move probability",
    "measured_by": "Linear myopic gameplay model",
    "justification": "The move probability was calculated using a linear myopic model trained on the gameplay of strong AI players, which generated a probability distribution over likely next moves, providing a measure of schema-consistency."

    "topic_or_construct": "Schema use at retrieval",
    "measured_by": "Retrieval fixations and linear regression",
    "justification": "Schema use at retrieval was indexed by participant fixations on likely moves during the recall phase, analyzed using a linear regression model where coefficients for likely moves reflect schema reliance."

    "topic_or_construct": "Episodic memory encoding",
    "measured_by": "Participants' response accuracy and confidence",
    "justification": "Episodic memory encoding quality was evaluated based on participants' response accuracy and confidence levels when recalling moves, suggesting stronger encoding when both were higher."

    "topic_or_construct": "Memory precision",
    "measured_by": "Fixations on the correct move during retrieval",
    "justification": "The extent to which participants fixated on the precise correct move during the retrieval phase served as a measure of memory precision, indicating higher precision with more fixations on the correct location."
