    "topic_or_construct": "Speed-accuracy trade-off preference",
    "measured_by": "Drift-diffusion model (DDM) parameters",
    "justification": "The paper uses the DDM to estimate participants' decision threshold, which directly governs their speed-accuracy trade-off preference. The threshold in this model represents how much evidence an individual requires to make a decision, thereby indexing their preference for speed or accuracy."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social information use",
    "measured_by": "Social drift-diffusion model (SDDM) parameters",
    "justification": "The SDDM extends the DDM by adding a social drift rate parameter that reflects the influence of a partner's choice on an individual's decision. This parameter quantifies the degree to which participants rely on social information during decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Leadership in decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Probability of being the leader or follower",
    "justification": "The paper calculates the probability of a participant being the leader or follower in a pair, influenced by factors like within-pair differences in decision thresholds and personal drift rates. This operationalizes who drives the decision process in group interactions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Threshold coordination",
    "measured_by": "Changes in decision threshold",
    "justification": "The study examines changes in individual decision thresholds from the personal to the social condition and how pair members adjust their thresholds reciprocally, indicating a form of coordination in social interactions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Adjustment of social information use",
    "measured_by": "Social drift rate variation",
    "justification": "Participants' social drift rates are analyzed to determine how they adjust the use of social information based on their relative decision threshold compared to their partner, indicating adaptive behavior in social decision-making."
