    "justification": "Participants made a series of choices between smaller, sooner (SS) amounts of money available 'today' and larger, later (LL) amounts available at various delays using the Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ), as described in the methods section of the paper."

    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence in intertemporal decisions",
    "measured_by": "6-point confidence scale",
    "justification": "After each decision in the MCQ, participants answered a question on a 6-point scale from 1 (not at all confident) to 6 (absolutely certain) to assess their confidence that the choice they made was the right one for them."

    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective value of delayed rewards",
    "measured_by": "Bidding task",
    "justification": "The Bidding task was used to independently estimate the time-discounted subjective value of the larger, later rewards. Participants completed questions such as 'I feel that receiving $25 in 98 days would be about the same as receiving $___ today', providing an independent index of subjective value."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice consistency",
    "measured_by": "Deviations from a global computed preference function and changes of mind",
    "justification": "The paper operationalized choice inconsistency as deviations from a global computed preference function and as changes of mind when presenting the same intertemporal choice question twice. Lower confidence predicted greater choice inconsistency."
