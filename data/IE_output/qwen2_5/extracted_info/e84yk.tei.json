    "measured_by": "Vicarious Reward Learning",
    "justification": "Vicarious reward learning involves the observer learning by observing another agent making decisions and experiencing outcomes. The observational reward prediction error (oRPE) is a key computation underlying this process, with brain areas such as vmPFC and dorsal striatum having been identified as involved."

    "topic_or_construct": "Observational Learning",
    "measured_by": "Action Imitation",
    "justification": "Action imitation learning is where people learn by observing and mimicking the actions performed by another agent. It is supported by action prediction errors encoded in brain areas like dmPFC, dlPFC, and inferior parietal lobule, and is explained in a reinforcement learning framework."

    "measured_by": "Emulation Learning",
    "justification": "Emulation learning involves inferring other agents' intentions, goals, beliefs, and hidden mental states. Recently, it's suggested to use Bayesian inference and has been observed to involve brain areas like TPJ, pSTS, and dmPFC that overlap with the mentalizing network."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Strategic Social Interactions",
    "measured_by": "Game Theory of Mind",
    "justification": "Game theory of mind combines game theory predictions with recursive belief inference during strategic interactions. It models behavior where one player tries to infer and maximize outcomes based on the other's inferred mental states, tested in tasks like the p-Beauty Contests game."

    "topic_or_construct": "Strategic Social Interactions",
    "measured_by": "Stage-Hunt Game Models",
    "justification": "The stag-hunt game has been used to model recursive belief inference. Computational models with different levels of sophistication were fit to data, with dynamic theory of mind models best fitting the data, implicating mentalizing processes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Strategic Social Learning",
    "measured_by": "Influence Learning Model",
    "justification": "The inspector game utilizes models of no mentalizing, elementary mentalizing (fictitious play), and sophisticated mentalizing (influence learning). The influence learning model assumes second-order beliefs and best explains participants' behavior, with fMRI confirming brain activity fitting predictions."
