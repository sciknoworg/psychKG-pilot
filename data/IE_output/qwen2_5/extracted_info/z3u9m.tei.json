    "justification": "The study uses the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) model to assess the role of forgetting in enhancing the effectiveness of recognition heuristic (RH) and fluency heuristics (FH) in medical diagnostics. The model maps environmental regularities onto a mental currency called 'activation' and is used to simulate the memory processes involved in recognizing disease symptoms."

    "topic_or_construct": "Recognition heuristic (RH)",
    "measured_by": "Production rules in clinical diagnostic decision-making",
    "justification": "The paper specifies production rules that implement the recognition heuristic in clinical settings. These rules are applied when physicians need to decide on the relevance of diseases based on the patient's symptoms, simulating how RH aids in rapid decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fluency heuristic (FH)",
    "measured_by": "Retrieval time differences",
    "justification": "The effectiveness of the fluency heuristic is measured by differences in retrieval times for disease information stored in memory. A lower retrieval time implies faster recognition, allowing for quicker diagnostic decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Memory chunks activation",
    "measured_by": "Activation function in ACT-R",
    "justification": "The activation of memory chunks, which are basic units of declarative knowledge in the ACT-R model, is calculated using equations that factor in the frequency and recency of encounters with the symptoms, as well as the decay parameter reflecting the level of forgetting."
