    "justification": "N200 latencies reflect the time needed for visual encoding before the accumulation of evidence. Researchers have found a relationship between N200 latencies and visual encoding time, with the latency component between 150 to 275 ms after stimulus onset reflecting VET."

    "measured_by": "Centro-Parietal Positivities (CPP)",
    "justification": "CPP steadily increases at a certain rate and is assumed to reflect the integration of evidence towards a specific bound to make a decision. Its slope is related to the drift rate parameter in decision-making models."

    "measured_by": "N200 latencies",
    "justification": "In certain models, N200 latencies were used to represent the visual encoding time component of non-decision times. These models assume that N200 latencies describe trial-to-trial variability in non-decision times."

    "justification": "CPP slopes were proposed as markers for trial-to-trial variability in drift rates. Some models suggest that CPP slopes can be used as scaled descriptors of drift rates during evidence accumulation."
