    "justification": "The RulEx-J model quantifies reliance on similarity-based processes in predicting judgments, as outlined in the formal similarity-based process section. This model measures similarity-based predictions by computing a weighted average of exemplars' criterion values, each weighted by its normalized similarity to the object being judged."

    "topic_or_construct": "Rule-based process",
    "measured_by": "RulEx-J cognitive model",
    "justification": "The RulEx-J model also incorporates a rule-based approach in multiple-cue judgments, using a linear regression model to predict an object's criterion value from its cues. The rule-based predictions are derived by computing a weighted sum of the object's cue values, capturing reliance on rule-based processes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Similarity versus rule usage",
    "measured_by": "Looking-at-nothing eye tracking",
    "justification": "The study found that participants who displayed more looking-at-nothing (fixating blank exemplar locations) relied more on similarity-based processes, according to the cognitive modeling parameter \u03b1. This correlation suggests that eye tracking of looking-at-nothing effectively captures reliance on similarity versus rules."

    "topic_or_construct": "Exemplar retrieval",
    "measured_by": "Looking-at-nothing with eye tracking",
    "justification": "Looking at nothing, measured by eye tracking participants' gaze to blank exemplar locations, reflects the retrieval of exemplars during judgment tasks. This behavior peaks when the test stimuli match exemplars, indicating a link to exemplar retrieval processes."
