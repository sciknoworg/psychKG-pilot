    "justification": "Article II uses data containing self-management techniques to demonstrate a conceptually important model of behaviors and their influences as a network. The network representation introduces a shift from conventional component-dominant dynamics to interaction-dominant dynamics."

    "topic_or_construct": "Intrinsic motivation and autonomous regulation",
    "measured_by": "Self-determination theory",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how self-determination theory conceptualizes motivation, including intrinsic motivation and integrated regulation, which are linked to high-quality adaptive performance. These forms of motivation are empirically connected to better behavioral and well-being outcomes."

    "measured_by": "Attractor landscapes and recurrence network methods",
    "justification": "The paper introduces the concept of attractor landscapes and recurrence network methods to better understand the dynamics of complex systems in behavior change. These tools are used to analyze system state changes and interactions over time."

    "justification": "The study employs ecological momentary assessment to collect repeated, time-specific data on motivation and behavior. This methodology captures intra-individual variability and helps assess system dynamics at different scales."
