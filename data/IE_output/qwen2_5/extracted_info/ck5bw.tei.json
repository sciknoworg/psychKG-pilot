    "justification": "The paper describes the clicking task as a physical effort task used to measure people's risk preferences for effort. Participants had to click on a black response circle presented at randomly selected locations on the screen. The task was designed to study the interaction between probability and magnitude of effort changes."

    "measured_by": "monetary-gambles",
    "justification": "This control experiment used monetary gallbles to measure risk preferences and establish a baseline comparison against the effort-based tasks. Participants chose between options for different amounts of money to ensure that the results of the effort tasks were analyzed in a comparable manner."
