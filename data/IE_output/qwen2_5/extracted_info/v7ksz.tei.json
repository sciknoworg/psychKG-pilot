    "measured_by": "Academic Judgment Bias Task (JBT)",
    "justification": "The Academic Judgment Bias Task (JBT) is designed to measure discrimination in social judgment by evaluating participants' decisions regarding applicants' qualifications while varying the presence of irrelevant demographic information such as physical attractiveness or political affiliation. The study uses sensitivity and criterion measures derived from JBT performance to understand the noise and bias components of discrimination."

    "topic_or_construct": "Noise in Judgment",
    "measured_by": "Sensitivity and Overall Accuracy of JBT",
    "justification": "Noise in judgment, reflecting the overall number of errors in evaluation, is measured using the sensitivity metric derived from JBT performance. Higher sensitivity indicates fewer errors, equating to reduced noise. Conditions that influence participants' ability to process outcome-relevant information, such as time pressure or response delays, impact the level of noise."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Bias in Judgment",
    "measured_by": "Criterion Differences in JBT",
    "justification": "The criterion measure in the Academic JBT indicates the relative likelihood of committing certain types of errors favoring some groups over others; this reflects the bias component of discrimination. Manipulations that alert participants to social dimensions or motivate avoidance of favoritism can influence the bias in judgment."

    "topic_or_construct": "Automaticity and Cognitive Resources in Bias",
    "measured_by": "Time Pressure Conditions in JBT",
    "justification": "The study employs different time pressure conditions (e.g., high, moderate, low) in the JBT to investigate how cognitive resources influence noise and bias. Results show that time pressure primarily affects noise but not bias, suggesting that automatic processes governing bias are not easily altered by manipulating cognitive resources."

    "topic_or_construct": "Individual Differences in Thinking Styles",
    "measured_by": "Faith in Intuition Scale and Need for Cognition Scale",
    "justification": "To assess how individual differences in thinking styles relate to noise and bias, participants complete scales measuring their faith in intuition and need for cognition. These measures provide insight into how participants' cognitive tendencies predict their performance on the JBT regarding sensitivity and criterion bias."

    "topic_or_construct": "Discrimination Reduction Interventions",
    "measured_by": "Bias Warning and Response Delay Conditions",
    "justification": "Interventions such as warning participants about potential biases and requiring response delays are tested within the JBT framework. These interventions specifically target noise or bias. For instance, a bias warning reduces bias without affecting noise, while a delay increases sensitivity (reduces noise) without impacting bias."
