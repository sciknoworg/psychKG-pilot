    "topic_or_construct": "Conditional cooperation",
    "measured_by": "Public Goods Game (PGG)",
    "justification": "The study used a modified Public Goods Game (PGG) to examine how participants make cooperative decisions in both gain and loss contexts in response to partners with different reciprocal reputations, directly assessing conditional cooperation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reciprocal reputation",
    "measured_by": "Trust Game (TG) followed by PGG",
    "justification": "Participants first played the Trust Game (TG) as a Trustee, which quantified their reciprocal behavior towards investors. Then, data from TG were used to assign participants into different reputation groups in the subsequent Public Goods Game (PGG), making reciprocity a key measure influencing cooperative decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social cooperation in gain and loss contexts",
    "measured_by": "Framed gain or loss Public Goods Game",
    "justification": "The study utilized a framing mechanism within the Public Goods Game (PGG) to create distinct gain and loss contexts, thereby measuring how individuals' cooperative behaviors and neural activations varied depending on the incentivized monetary gain or loss situations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Neural processing of reputation",
    "measured_by": "fMRI activation patterns in anterior insula and dorsal ACC",
    "justification": "Neuroimaging results highlighted that the right anterior insula (rAI) and left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) showed increased activity as the partner's reciprocal reputation improved, indicating their role in neural processing related to reputational information."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward processing in cooperation",
    "measured_by": "fMRI activation in bilateral striatum",
    "justification": "The study found that increased bilateral striatum activation was positively correlated with cooperation when paired with partners of higher reciprocal reputation in the gain context, suggesting this brain region's involvement in reward processing in cooperative decisions."
