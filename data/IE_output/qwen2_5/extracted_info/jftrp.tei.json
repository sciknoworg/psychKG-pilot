    "topic_or_construct": "anhedonia",
    "measured_by": "Mini-MASQ-AD (Mini Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire - anhedonic depression subscale)",
    "justification": "The article explicitly states that the MASQ anhedonic depression subscale was used to measure anhedonia symptoms. This is corroborated by the results section where correlations between anhedonia scores and reinforcement learning performance are reported."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reward-guided behavior",
    "measured_by": "reward learning tasks",
    "justification": "The study employed several different reward learning tasks to assess reinforcement learning performance. The association between performance on these tasks and anhedonia symptoms is a key focus of the article, indicating these tasks as instruments to measure reward-guided behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reinforcement learning performance",
    "measured_by": "two-armed bandit reinforcement learning task",
    "justification": "In study 3, a two-armed bandit reinforcement learning task was used, which is described as a commonly used paradigm to measure reinforcement learning performance. The resulting learning performance was significantly correlated with anhedonia scores, demonstrating the task's role in assessing the construct."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "anxiety-depression symptom factor",
    "measured_by": "STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory)",
    "justification": "Although not directly tied to anhedonia, the article mentions measuring anxiety-depression symptoms, which includes the STAI inventory. The non-association with these symptoms is mentioned to strengthen the unique link found between anhedonia and reinforcement learning."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "apathy",
    "measured_by": "AES (Apathy Evaluation Scale)",
    "justification": "The AES was part of the mental health questionnaire battery used to measure various depression-related symptoms. Its inclusion supports the distinction of anhedonia found in the study."
