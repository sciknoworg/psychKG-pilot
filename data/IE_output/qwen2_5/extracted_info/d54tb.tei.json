    "measured_by": "Affective Slider",
    "justification": "Participants reported their subjective emotional valence using an Affective Slider every 3-5 trials throughout the task. The slider allowed participants to rate their current emotional state from 'extremely unhappy' to 'extremely happy', providing a measure of their affective state during decision-making."

    "justification": "Participants completed a task that presented them with choices between cards with varying reward magnitudes and probabilities, allowing the researchers to analyze their risk preferences based on their selections."

    "topic_or_construct": "within-person fluctuations in emotional valence",
    "measured_by": "between-participants variance component",
    "justification": "The within-person variance in emotional valence was measured by decomposing participants' individual self-reported emotional states into within-person fluctuations around their own average emotional valence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "between-person differences in emotional valence",
    "measured_by": "between-participants variance component",
    "justification": "Participants' average emotional valence was quantified across the entire sample, and a between-participants variance component was created by normalizing the participant-average emotion self-reports against the overall sample mean and standard deviation."
