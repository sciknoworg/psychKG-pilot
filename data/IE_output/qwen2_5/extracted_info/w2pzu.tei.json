    "justification": "The authors allocated an 8000-word interactive novel using Twine to participants. By embodying a student character at a party, participants made various choices in risky situations, assessing risk-taking behaviours through participation in an engaging, realistic narrative."

    "measured_by": "one-item risk-taking tendency scale",
    "justification": "Dohmen et al.'s (2011) one-item scale was used to measure the general risk-taking tendency of participants. Participants rated their willingness to take risks on an 11-point scale, a scale validated for predicting real-life risk-taking."

    "topic_or_construct": "domain-specific risk-taking",
    "measured_by": "French version of the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale",
    "justification": "The researchers employed the Frenchadapted version of the DOSPERT scale (Blais & Weber, 2006) to evaluate projected risk-taking across five domains, using a 7-point scale for each of the 30 items, though only 24 items were assessed in this study."

    "measured_by": "self-report risk-taking questionnaire",
    "justification": "A self-report risk-taking questionnaire mirroring the interactive novel's scenarios was created. Participants rated their frequencies of engaging in specific risk-taking behaviours over the last six months, offering a six-month temporal context for real-life risk correlation."
