    "justification": "The hyperbolic discounting model was fitted to choice and pricing data, with the model indicating significantly different discounting rates depending on whether choice or pricing data were analyzed."

    "justification": "Choice impulsivity is assessed through binary choice trials where participants generally favor the smaller-sooner (SS) option over the larger-later (LL) option."

    "justification": "An adapted version of the price accumulation model was used to account for systematic choice-price preference reversals by incorporating the anchoring effects of payoffs and delays."
