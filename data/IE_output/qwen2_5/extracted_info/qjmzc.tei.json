    "measured_by": " Approval ratings of self and partner",
    "justification": "Participants rated their approval of themselves and their partner after each triad of rounds. The paper reports that participants showed a self-positivity bias, approving more of themselves than their partners, indicating self-positivity bias was measured through these approval ratings."

    "justification": "The paper describes a belief-based evaluation model where people evaluate their partner based on how well their decision-making matched an 'ideal partner' policy. This model includes a 'partner positivity bias' parameter to evaluate the extent of biased evaluations."

    "measured_by": "Reinforcement-learning models based on weighted sum of outcomes",
    "justification": "The paper employs reinforcement-learning models, where evaluations depend on a weighted sum of both recent and past outcomes for self and other. These models outperformed others in explaining evaluations, making them an appropriate instrument for measuring self-and other-evaluations."

    "measured_by": "Reinforcement-learning evaluation models",
    "justification": "The paper details that reinforcement-learning models that account for outcomes achieved a superior fit in explaining self-evaluations compared to ideal Bayesian decisions, thus indicating the use of these models as a crucial tool for measuring self-evaluations in the context of social interaction."
