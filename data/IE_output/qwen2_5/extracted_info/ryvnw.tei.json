    "justification": "The paper demonstrates that in binary decision problems where individuals are on average more often correct than not, an individual's average percentage agreement in decisions with others (decision similarity) is tightly correlated with their decision accuracy. This is supported by both analytical arguments and empirical data across several domains, indicating that decision similarity can be used as a proxy for accuracy."

    "topic_or_construct": "Collective decision accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Average decision similarity within a group",
    "justification": "The study shows that the average decision similarity among members of a group is positively correlated with the group's collective accuracy under the majority rule. This relationship is evident across different data sets and backed by both numerical simulations and empirical analyses, indicating that groups with high internal decision similarity tend to have higher collective accuracy."

    "topic_or_construct": "High-performing individuals",
    "measured_by": "Decision similarity threshold",
    "justification": "The paper indicates that selecting individuals based on their decision similarity can reliably identify high performers. By using a cross-validation procedure with different similarity thresholds, the researchers found that individuals with higher decision similarity values in the training set showed substantially above-average performance in the test set, validating decision similarity as a measure to detect high performers."
