    "justification": "The actual progress in the decision-making process was modeled using the drift rate parameter within the Drift Diffusion Model. The drift rate represents the actual rate of evidence accumulation and reflects the actual progress at the time of decision."

    "justification": "Expected progress was quantified by an expected drift rate in the extended affectDDM model. This parameter reflects participants' expectations about the rate of evidence accumulation prior to the decision, enabling the measurement of anticipated progress."
