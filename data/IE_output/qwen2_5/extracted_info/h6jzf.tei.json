    "measured_by": "Conviction Narrative Theory",
    "justification": "The Conviction Narrative Theory (CNT) posits narratives as core to decision-making, especially under conditions of uncertainty. It suggests that narratives coordinate causal, analogical, temporal, and valence information in a unified mental model to guide decision-making, providing a structured approach to evaluate decision behaviors in uncertain contexts."

    "topic_or_construct": "emergent collective behavior",
    "measured_by": "agent-based cognitive models",
    "justification": "Agent-based cognitive models integrate cognitive mechanisms at the individual level to explain how collective behaviors emerge. These models simulate interactions among agents using rules derived from cognitive theories and allow for the study of phenomena like social group formation and social dynamics."

    "topic_or_construct": "market dynamics and conscious behavior",
    "measured_by": "Coordination Dynamics",
    "justification": "Coordination Dynamics provides a framework for understanding the interaction and coordination between various components of complex adaptive systems, including markets. By studying information exchanges and the reciprocal causality of these systems, it helps in uncovering the reflexive nature of markets and their connection to individual consciousness."

    "topic_or_construct": "economic decision-making",
    "measured_by": "lab experiments, econometric data analyses, and interviews",
    "justification": "Various sources of evidence support Conviction Narrative Theory. This includes laboratory experiments (which control variables for cognitive processes underpinning narratives), large-scale econometric data analyses (revealing patterns in economic behavior influenced by narratives), and interviews with financial decision-makers (providing insight into real-world narrative-based decision-making)."
