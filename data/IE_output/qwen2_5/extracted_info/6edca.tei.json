    "justification": "Cluster analysis was applied to movement trajectories from Spivey et al. (2005) to identify distinct types of trajectories, revealing at least five qualitatively distinct types that better represent the underlying cognitive process than aggregate trajectories."

    "justification": "Prototype-matching analysis was employed to detect trajectory mixtures more reliably than k-means clustering, leading to a clearer differentiation of trajectory types and allowing for a characterization of the cognitive process based on the distribution of trajectory types."
