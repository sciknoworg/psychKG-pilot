    "justification": "The article discusses how monetary values like buying prices, selling prices, or certainty equivalents give insight into preference-based judgements and decisions by assigning observed features of an item to a single value on an external scale."

    "measured_by": "Utility derived from monetary gambles",
    "justification": "The article discusses how the attributes of an item, like a monetary gamble, are transformed into a utility, which is multiplied by their (weighted) likelihood to compute an overall value, highlighting the method of eliciting value comparisons impacts their apparent preference order."

    "topic_or_construct": "Endowment effect",
    "measured_by": "Asymmetric utility between willingness to pay and willingness to accept",
    "justification": "The difference in buying and selling prices is attributed to an asymmetric utility between items that are received (buying) as opposed to given away (selling), with reference points shifting based on the perspective of the decision maker."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Preference reversals",
    "measured_by": "Choice conditions versus price conditions",
    "justification": "The article states that utility and prospect theory models posit a static view of monetary value which is contradicted by reversals in apparent preferences depending on whether monetary gambles are presented as a choice or a price, suggesting that response processes substantially influence manifest preferences."
