    "topic_or_construct": "belief bias",
    "measured_by": "relational reasoning problems with conflicting rule-and belief-based processing",
    "justification": "The study used relational reasoning problems specifically designed to create conflicts between rule-based reasoning and belief-based reasoning, allowing for the measurement of belief bias. These tasks were manipulated to have conditions where rule and belief aligned or conflicted."

    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive abilities",
    "measured_by": "Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM)",
    "justification": "The authors used Raven's APM, a high g-loading test of fluid intelligence, to assess cognitive abilities. This measure was chosen for its ability to capture individual differences in fluid reasoning and general intelligence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "working memory capacity",
    "measured_by": "operation span task",
    "justification": "The operation span task was utilized to measure working memory capacity. It provides a method for evaluating memory recall and processing efficiency in individuals during complex tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive reflection",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)",
    "justification": "Participants completed the CRT which consists of problems designed to elicit intuitive but incorrect answers. Performance on the CRT is often used as an indicator of an individual's reflective thinking abilities."

    "topic_or_construct": "need for cognition",
    "measured_by": "Need for Cognition (NFC) scale of the Rational-Experiential Inventory (REI)",
    "justification": "The need for cognition scale, a sub-measure of the Rational-Experiential Inventory, was applied to assess individual's disposition to engage in effortful cognitive processing and reflective thinking."
