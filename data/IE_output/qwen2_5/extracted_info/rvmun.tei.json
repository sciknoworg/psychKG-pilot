    "topic_or_construct": "Working Memory Capacity",
    "measured_by": "Digit Span, Visual Array, Symmetry Span, Operation Span",
    "justification": "The researchers measured working memory capacity using these tasks, examining components of both storage and control. These assessments aimed to explore any relationship between working memory limitations and recency effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "Adaptive Decision Strategy",
    "measured_by": "Recency model parameter adjustments across tasks",
    "justification": "Participants' ability to adjust their recency parameter to suit the changing task structures was assessed as an indication of an adaptive decision strategy, suggesting flexibility in response to environmental changes."
