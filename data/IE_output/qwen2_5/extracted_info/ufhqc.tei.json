    "justification": "Participants completed the Motivation and Pleasure Scale (MAP-SR) to assess their levels of motivation and pleasure over the past week. The total score on this measure reflects greater motivation and pleasure. Higher scores on this scale were related to an increased reliance on model-free (MF) learning."

    "measured_by": "Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)",
    "justification": "The CES-D scale was used to measure depression symptoms in the participants. The scale evaluates symptom experiences over the prior week, with higher scores indicating greater depression symptoms. However, in this study, depression scores did not predict either model-free or model-based learning."

    "measured_by": "Running Span Task",
    "justification": "The Running Span task was employed to assess working memory by requiring participants to remember a series of letters. The total number of correctly recalled letters served as the outcome measure. The analysis showed that better working memory capacity had a strong positive relationship with model-based (MB) learning."
