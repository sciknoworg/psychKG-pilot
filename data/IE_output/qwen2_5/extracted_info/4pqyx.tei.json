    "measured_by": "Diffusion Decision Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The DDM was used to measure the memory bias by analyzing the decision-making process where participants had to recall snacks and choose between remembered and forgotten options. The model quantified shifts in the choice and response time curves based on the subjective value of remembered snacks, supporting how memory influences valuation and choice processes."

    "measured_by": "Single-Process Diffusion Model (SPDM)",
    "justification": "The SPDM was specifically developed to assess the single-process account of memory bias, comparing a reference value with the value of remembered options. The model predicted shifts in both choice and response time curves that were associated with the memory bias, demonstrating its ability to explain how memory affects valuation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "dual-process account of memory-based decisions",
    "measured_by": "Dual-Process Diffusion Model (DPDM)",
    "justification": "The DPDM was employed to measure how two separate processes, a heuristic process and a utility-maximizing process, might contribute to memory-based decisions. The model predicted distinct patterns in response times and choices compared to the SPDM, indicating its role in evaluating how memory interacts with both heuristic and utility-based decision-making."
