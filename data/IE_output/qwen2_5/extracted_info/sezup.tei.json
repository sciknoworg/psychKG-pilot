    "measured_by": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) model with valence-dependent credit assignment parameters (V-LR, V-CA)",
    "justification": "The study employed a RL model with valence-dependent credit assignment parameters to capture how precisely participants attributed credit (outcomes) to specific states (stimuli) in social and nonsocial tasks. This was essential for understanding the differences in learning profiles due to the precision of credit assignment."

    "measured_by": "Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)",
    "justification": "RSA was used to measure the content and fidelity of neural state representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during choice and feedback phases. This allowed researchers to link neural representation fidelity to credit assignment precision in learning."

    "topic_or_construct": "Task state representation",
    "measured_by": "Whole brain searchlight analysis",
    "justification": "The whole brain searchlight analysis was used to create neural representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) to measure state representations in the PFC during the choice and feedback phases of the social and bandit tasks. It revealed a positive relationship between state representation fidelity and credit assignment precision."

    "measured_by": "Valence-based Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)",
    "justification": "The valence-based RSA examined how positive versus negative prediction error (PE) trials differentially modulated the strength of state encoding during feedback, demonstrating that reward enhances state representation encoding during positive outcomes compared to negative outcomes."

    "measured_by": "Cross-timepoint Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)",
    "justification": "This method evaluated the shared representational geometry of stimulus identity between choice and feedback phases in the PFC, highlighting that increased alignment of neural patterns predicted greater credit assignment precision."
