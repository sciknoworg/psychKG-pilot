    "measured_by": "Operation Span Task",
    "justification": "The study used an operation span task based on ability to manipulate and remember a sequence of letters given a mathematical task interference as a measure of working memory capacity, as described in the methods section."

    "topic_or_construct": "Non-native Mandarin Tone Category Learning",
    "measured_by": "Category Learning Task",
    "justification": "Participants completed a Category Learning Task involving six blocks per session. They categorized Mandarin tone speech sounds into four categories (high-flat, low-rising, low-dipping, high-falling) based on pitch patterns. Feedback was provided during the task to facilitate learning."

    "topic_or_construct": "Generalization of Knowledge to New Talkers",
    "measured_by": "Generalization Blocks with Novel Stimuli",
    "justification": "To assess generalization, participants were presented with novel stimuli from new talkers they did not encounter during training. The ability to apply learned knowledge to these new stimuli was measured without any feedback being given on correct category."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Maintenance of Category Knowledge Over Time",
    "measured_by": "Performance on Adjacent Blocks Across Sessions",
    "justification": "Maintenance of learning was assessed by comparing participants' accuracy on adjacent blocks that were separated by delays (one or two months) between sessions. This allowed the researchers to examine the retention of category knowledge over time."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Efficiency of Evidence Accumulation in Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Drift Diffusion Modeling Parameters",
    "justification": "The study applied drift diffusion models to analyze decision-making processes. The evidence accumulation rate (drift rate) was estimated, reflecting how efficiently participants gathered information to make decisions about speech categories."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Response Caution During Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Decision Thresholds in Drift Diffusion Model",
    "justification": "Response caution was quantified using the decision threshold parameter in the drift diffusion model, indicating the amount of evidence gathered before making a decision. Higher thresholds signify more cautious behavior."
