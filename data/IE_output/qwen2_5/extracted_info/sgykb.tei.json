    "measured_by": "Padilla et al. cognitive model",
    "justification": "The paper discusses the application of the Padilla et al. cognitive model to identify and analyze cognitive processes involved in decision-making with visualizations, providing a structured method to understand the underlying mental mechanisms in this context."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Visual Array",
    "measured_by": "Visual system anatomy understanding",
    "justification": "The text explains that understanding the anatomy of the eye and the visual system is crucial for grasping how people reason with visualizations, which is a fundamental aspect of the 'visual array' in the cognitive model."

    "topic_or_construct": "Bottom-up Attention",
    "measured_by": "Salience and Itti et al. model",
    "justification": "Salience, which can be computed using approaches such as the Itti et al. model, is emphasized as a key concept to evaluate elements of a visualization that capture attention involuntarily, indicating its role in bottom-up attention."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Top-down Attention",
    "measured_by": "Eye fixations and viewer's knowledge",
    "justification": "Top-down attention is described as being influenced by the viewer's deliberate direction of gaze based on task knowledge, and its impact was measured through eye fixations in studies, showing how awareness and knowledge shape attention."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Working Memory",
    "measured_by": "Pupillometry and behavioral manipulations",
    "justification": "The paper mentions that direct measures of working memory include pupillometry and behavioral manipulations, suggesting these as methods to assess the working memory demands of visualizations."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive schemas",
    "measured_by": "Task-based assessment",
    "justification": "The case study illustrates how specific tasks were designed to evaluate the influence of mental schemas on the interpretation of ensemble hurricane forecast visualizations, highlighting the practical methods used to examine cognitive fit."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making",
    "measured_by": " Participant judgments and behavior",
    "justification": "Based on the paper, decisions made by participants in response to different visualization designs are analyzed, illustrating the impact of cognitive processes on decision outcomes, with behaviors reflecting the decision-making process."
