    "measured_by": "Timed Racing Diffusion Model (TRDM)",
    "justification": "The TRDM was used to assess the speed-accuracy tradeoff in perceptual decision and lexical decision tasks. The model demonstrated that participants adjust their 'clock speed' (the drift rate of the timing accumulator) under time pressure, which reproduces the qualitative trends of the speed-accuracy tradeoff: faster responses are less accurate when the timing process is given priority over evidence accumulation."

    "measured_by": "Timed Racing Diffusion Model (TRDM)",
    "justification": "The TRDM was applied to data sets involving decisions made under different levels of time pressure. The model showed that participants strategically adjust the rate of evidence accumulation, non-decision time, and the timing process to accommodate time pressure, highlighting the importance of the timing mechanism in explaining the effects of time pressure on decision-making behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "response to deadlines (explicit deadlines)",
    "measured_by": "Timed Racing Diffusion Model (TRDM)",
    "justification": "The TRDM was tested on decision-making tasks with explicit deadlines, demonstrating its ability to predict the timing of responses accurately. It explained the behavior by the timing process calibrating its expected finishing time near the deadline, ensuring that decision processes do not exceed the allowable time."

    "topic_or_construct": "response to deadlines (implicit deadlines)",
    "measured_by": "Timed Racing Diffusion Model (TRDM)",
    "justification": "In tasks with implicit deadlines, the TRDM explained participants' behavior by integrating a timing mechanism that prevents too much time from being spent on individual decisions, especially for high difficulty ones, without requiring dynamic adjustments to evidence thresholds."

    "topic_or_construct": "individual differences in timing precision",
    "measured_by": "Timed Racing Diffusion Model (TRDM)",
    "justification": "The study found that the timing precision parameter of the TRDM in decision-making tasks positively correlated with the timing precision parameter in interval production tasks, suggesting a relationship between an individual's timing precision in decisions and timing tasks measured independently."
