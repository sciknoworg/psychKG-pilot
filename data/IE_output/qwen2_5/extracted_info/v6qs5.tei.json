    "justification": "The study measures the representativeness heuristic by observing participants' choices between different types of lottery tickets, such as Random, Distinctive, Previous, and Distant Previous tickets. Participants' preferences were used to assess their susceptibility to the heuristic, as their choices indicated their belief in the likelihood of specific sequences being drawn."

    "measured_by": "Hypothetical RH Puzzles",
    "justification": "The representativeness heuristic was also measured using classic puzzles in the lab experiment, such as the Linda problem and the taxi problem. The responses to these puzzles provided insights into whether participants' reasoning aligns with the predictions of the representativeness heuristic."

    "measured_by": "Demographics and Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)",
    "justification": "The study attempted to link individual differences in susceptibility to the representativeness heuristic with various demographic characteristics and cognitive styles. The inclusion of the Cognitive Reflection Test aimed to assess the participants' tendency towards analytical thinking, which could indicate a lower susceptibility to the heuristic."
