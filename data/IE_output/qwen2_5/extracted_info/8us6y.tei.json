    "topic_or_construct": "psychological models of trial evidence interpretation",
    "measured_by": "Story Model",
    "justification": "The Story Model is prominently used to explain how jurors construct a chronological narrative from the presented evidence, using prior associations, schemas, and stereotypes to integrate and interpret information. This method helps in understanding the cognitive processes jurors use to organize disjointed facts into a cohesive narrative."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "jury group decision-making process",
    "measured_by": "DISCUSS Model",
    "justification": "The DISCUSS Model is employed to dissect the deliberation process among jurors, indicating the importance of participation parameters such as speaking frequency and influence distribution. It underscores the dynamics within deliberations where certain jurors, based on demographics like race and gender, tend to dominate discussions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "jury competence",
    "measured_by": "judges' hypothetical verdicts comparison (judge-jury agreement)",
    "justification": "The method compares judges' likely verdicts with those made by juries, revealing agreement rates around 75% to 80% in civil and criminal cases. This assesses jury performance against legal experts' judgment, providing a metric for evaluating the rationality of jury decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "jury competence through evidence evaluation",
    "measured_by": "strength-of-evidence correlation",
    "justification": "Studies correlate the strength of the evidence with jury verdicts, indicating the impact of evidence quality on decision outcomes. Such analysis offers reassurance that jurors synthesize and judge evidence in accordance with the weight of trial evidence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "jury fairness and biases",
    "measured_by": "mock jury experiments",
    "justification": "Mock jury experiments provide controlled conditions to study effects of various factors like emotional reactions and stereotypes on jurors. For instance, they show that gruesome photos can cause disgust and impact jurors' punitive decisions, illustrating how biases influence legal judgments."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "juror understanding of legal instructions",
    "measured_by": "post-trial surveys and interviews",
    "justification": "These qualitative methods gather in-depth data about jurors' perceptions of legal instructions. By assessing the accuracy of jurors' discussions related to these instructions, researchers evaluate juror comprehension and treatment of complex legal information."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "representativeness of juries",
    "measured_by": "proxies for diversity like race and socioeconomic status",
    "justification": "Research evaluates jury diversity by examining the representation of different racial and socioeconomic backgrounds to determine the impact on deliberation quality, verdicts, and inclusivity in the legal process. This helps in understanding how diverse perspectives influence decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "impact of preexisting biases on juror decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Implicit Association Test (IAT)",
    "justification": "The IAT is used to measure implicit racial preferences that can influence judgments of tort injuries, with higher IAT scores correlating with less liability for White defendants and lower awards for Black plaintiffs facing the same injuries, indicating the presence of racial biases in legal decision-making."
