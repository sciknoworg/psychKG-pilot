    "measured_by": "Diffusion Decision Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The paper explicitly states that sequential sampling theory is often applied using the diffusion decision model (DDM) to analyze binary decision tasks, where decision-making processes are decomposed into parameters with psychological meaning. This application captures key data patterns and explains response time and accuracy data."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Binary Decision Tasks (BDT)",
    "justification": "Binary decision tasks (BDT) are described as laboratory tasks requiring participants to choose between two alternatives. These tasks are well-suited to model-based analyses, particularly using the DDM, which has been validated in several studies to represent psychological constructs."

    "measured_by": "Urgency Signal Model with Hyperbolic Drift Rate",
    "justification": "The urgency signal model with a hyperbolic drift rate is specified as a variant of sequential sampling models. The drift rate in this model increases over time, reflecting an urgency signal, which is parameterized using a hyperbolic function. This model's parameters are estimated through the simulation-based method described in this paper."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making with Information Leakage",
    "measured_by": "Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Model",
    "justification": "The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model is used when there is assumed to be leakage in the accumulation of decision-related information over time. The drift rate is formulated as a location-dependent function, making this model suitable for measuring decision-making scenarios with decaying information."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making under Time Pressure",
    "measured_by": "Collapsing Boundaries Models",
    "justification": "Collapsing boundaries models are utilized when the decision boundaries themselves change over time, often narrowing. This is applicable in situations where time pressure impacts decisions, with the linear collapse model being a specific application discussed in the paper."
