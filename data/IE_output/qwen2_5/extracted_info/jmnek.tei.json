    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive distancing",
    "measured_by": "Probabilistic selection task (PST)",
    "justification": "The study used a probabilistic selection task (PST) to assess how cognitive distancing affects reinforcement learning parameters, such as inverse temperature and loss learning rates, indicating its role in cognitive processes related to emotion regulation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Transdiagnostic psychiatric symptom dimensions",
    "measured_by": "78-question psychiatric battery",
    "justification": "The transdiagnostic factors were measured using a subset of 78 questions selected from various questionnaires, including the Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale, Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, designed to predict factor scores for compulsory behavior, anxiety/depression, and social withdrawal."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reinforcement Learning",
    "measured_by": "Q-learning models (single and dual learning rate)",
    "justification": "The study utilized single and dual learning rate Q-learning models in a probabilistic selection task to decompose the components of reinforcement learning affected by cognitive distancing, such as the learning rate parameter (\u03b1) and inverse temperature (\u03b2)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotion regulation difficulties",
    "measured_by": "Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy",
    "justification": "These therapies are mentioned as strategies enabling the targeting of emotion regulation difficulties, which are linked to various disorders. However, the current study used a computational reinforcement learning approach rather than direct measures of these therapies."
