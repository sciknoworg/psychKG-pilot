    "justification": "Post-error speeding is identified when there is a negative value in the difference between average reaction time post-error and post-correct, as seen in certain conditions of Notebaert et al's Experiment 1."

    "measured_by": "Median Response Time (RT)",
    "justification": "The data from Experiment 2 showed a significant slowing of post/win RT due to the presence of direct feedback, suggesting that decision time modulation occurs following positive outcomes."
