    "topic_or_construct": "Probability weighting",
    "measured_by": "Partial-feedback paradigms",
    "justification": "The study used a partial-feedback paradigm where participants made choices between safe and uncertain options in separate periods of gain and loss domain trials. This allowed the direct measurement of participant probability weightings through choice patterns without the need for an intervening model."

    "topic_or_construct": "Probability weighting",
    "measured_by": "Equivaluable safe vs. uncertain options trials",
    "justification": "The study included trials where participants chose between 'equivaluable safe and uncertain options' (with equal expected values but different probabilities). This setup allowed researchers to isolate the effect of probability weighting on choice behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Outcome extremeness influence",
    "measured_by": "Variable expected value tasks",
    "justification": "The study manipulated the expected values across different experiments to observe how extreme outcomes influenced probability weighting. Different expected values were used in Experiments 1, 2, and 3 to examine their impact on uncertainty preferences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Sampling error effects",
    "measured_by": "Training blocks with predetermined sampling",
    "justification": "The task included training blocks to ensure participants adequately sampled and experienced the probabilities associated with uncertain options, allowing researchers to rule out sampling error as a confounding factor."

    "topic_or_construct": "Choice reaction times",
    "measured_by": "Choice reaction time measurements",
    "justification": "Choice reaction times were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA to understand the cognitive processes underlying decisions involving uncertainty, revealing that uncertain options elicited longer reaction times compared to certain options."
