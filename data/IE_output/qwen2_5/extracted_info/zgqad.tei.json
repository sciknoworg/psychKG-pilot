    "measured_by": "Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ), Positive-DBQ",
    "justification": "The DBQ and its updated version, the Positive-DBQ, have been used to differentiate prosocial or aberrant driving styles. Competitive driving style involves driving errors, lapses, violations, and aggression, which are captured through the questionnaire items assessing these specific behaviors."

    "topic_or_construct": "Prosocial Driving Style",
    "measured_by": "Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ), Positive-DBQ",
    "justification": "The DBQ and Positive-DBQ include items that assess positive driving behaviors, such as courteous and cooperative behaviors. The Positive-DBQ specifically assesses actions like adjusting speed to help other drivers and thanking drivers with a friendly wave, which are indicative of a prosocial driving style."

    "measured_by": "Schwartz Values Instrument",
    "justification": "The Schwartz Values Instrument was used to assess basic values, specifically the values of benevolence and power. Benevolence includes traits like helpfulness and caring, whereas power involves dominance and status. These values were linked to driving styles and moral decision-making behaviors."

    "measured_by": "Trolley Dilemma Scenarios",
    "justification": "The study employed trolley dilemma scenarios (adapted from the Moral Machines project) to assess how individuals would make moral decisions in hypothetical crash situations involving pedestrians and barriers, serving as a measure of participants' ethical reasoning in driving crises."

    "measured_by": "Driving Simulator Experiment",
    "justification": "In Study 3, a driving simulator was used to present participants with real-time crash scenarios (e.g., hitting a pedestrian vs. veering into a barrier). Participants' crash decisions were recorded to evaluate their tendencies to choose self-sacrifice or self-preservation."
