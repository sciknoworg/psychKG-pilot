    "measured_by": "Uncertainty induction task",
    "justification": "The paper describes using Van den Bos's procedure to induce uncertainty by asking participants to think of aspects of their life that make them feel uncertain and respond to open-ended questions related to their thoughts and feelings about being uncertain, thereby measuring the concept of uncertainty salience."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Accessibility of episodic future thoughts",
    "measured_by": "Event fluency task",
    "justification": "The event fluency task required participants to imagine and generate as many future events as possible within a given timeframe (next week, month, and year), assessing the accessibility of their episodic future thoughts, which provided insight into the impact of uncertainty salience on this construct."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Direct and generative modes of future event production",
    "measured_by": "Word cueing paradigm",
    "justification": "The word cueing paradigm, used in Experiment 2, involved participants producing specific future events in response to cue words and indicating whether these events came to mind directly or required generative production. This method served to measure the mechanisms by which uncertainty salience impacts the production of future thoughts."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Belief in the occurrence of future events",
    "measured_by": "Event ratings on belief scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated their belief that imagined future events would actually occur using a scale from 1 to 7. This measurement helped to evaluate how uncertainty salience influenced their confidence in the future scenarios they generated."
