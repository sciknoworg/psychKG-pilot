    "topic_or_construct": "Eating Attitudes",
    "measured_by": "Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26)",
    "justification": "The EAT-26 was used to assess eating attitudes in participants, with higher scores indicating greater concerns about eating. Participants were grouped based on their EAT-26 scores, with scores 14 or above indicating 'eating disorder' characteristics, supporting the use of EAT-26 as the measurement instrument."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making Processes",
    "measured_by": "Custom patch-leaving task based on Optimal Foraging Theory",
    "justification": "The experiment utilized a custom decision-making task designed to measure how long participants exploit an option before disengaging, based on principles of Optimal Foraging Theory. This task was used to investigate decision-making in restrictive EDs, with the aim of testing hypotheses related to altered decision thresholds."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Motor Vigour under Time Pressure",
    "measured_by": "Reaction Times (RTs) in the Patch-leaving Task",
    "justification": "Exploratory analyses found that participants with restrictive ED symptoms showed a stronger reduction in reaction times over time in the patch-leaving task, indicating higher motor vigour under time pressure. The eating attitudes factor was the best predictor of this effect, emphasizing the task's ability to measure corresponding psychological processes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Appearance Anxiety",
    "measured_by": "Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI)",
    "justification": "Appearance anxiety was one of the psychological factors measured using the AAI, which was included in the extensive questionnaire battery completed by participants. This instrument provided a direct measure of how appearance anxiety contributes to the broader factor structure used in the analysis."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Eating Disorder Symptoms",
    "measured_by": "Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q)",
    "justification": "The EDE-Q was used to assess eating disorder symptoms, particularly in distinguishing between levels of eating disorder tendencies among participants. Scores from the EDE-Q were analyzed alongside other factors to form a comprehensive representation of eating disorder symptoms."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty Sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS)",
    "justification": "Uncertainty sensitivity was measured using the IUS, which assessed participants' intolerance towards uncertainty. This scale helped delineate the psychological characteristics associated with restrictive eating symptoms and their relation to decision-making processes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Anxiety and Depression",
    "measured_by": "State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)",
    "justification": "Anxiety and depression were measured using the STAI and BDI-II, contributing to a broader factor labeled 'Anxiety & Depression.' These instruments provided essential information on the participants' psychological status relevant to restrictive eating symptoms."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Obsessive-Compulsive Tendencies",
    "measured_by": "Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI)",
    "justification": "The OCI was used to measure obsessive-compulsive tendencies among participants. This scale helped determine the extent to which these tendencies factor into restrictive eating disorders, as anticipated by the factor analysis conducted in the study."
