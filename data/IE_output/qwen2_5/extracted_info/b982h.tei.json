    "topic_or_construct": "Expected pain",
    "measured_by": "Scale ratings (0-10)",
    "justification": "Participants rated the pain event's intensity on a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10, which assessed their expected pain levels. The scale was displayed with anchors '0' and '10' and interval tick-marks, used to identify three stimulations corresponding to low, medium, and high pain (approximately scale values of 3, 5, and 7)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk aversion",
    "measured_by": "Choice between gambles and sure options",
    "justification": "Risk aversion was assessed by participants' choices between gambles (50% chance of avoiding pain) and sure options (sure reduction of pain intensity). Participants' selection patterns in response to different levels of expected pain allowed for the determination of risk aversion, with more likely selection of sure options as expected pain increased."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social proximity influence",
    "measured_by": "Comparison of bids and pain ratings between stranger and romantic partner conditions",
    "justification": "The effect of social proximity was measured by comparing bids and pain assessments for romantic partners vs. strangers. Higher bids and pain ratings for others indicated prosocial behavior and empathetic response modulation by the target's relationship to the participant."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Probabilistic pain stimuli (0.1 to 0.9 probabilities)",
    "justification": "The role of uncertainty was captured using probabilistic pain stimuli with probabilities ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. These probabilistic cues were used in trials to manipulate the uncertainty level during pain decision-making, allowing for the examination of its influence on participants' risk preferences and pain assessment."
