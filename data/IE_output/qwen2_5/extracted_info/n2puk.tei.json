    "measured_by": "Short State Anxiety Inventory (SSAI)",
    "justification": "The paper mentions that state anxiety was measured using the Short State Anxiety Inventory (SSAI) in multiple studies. For example, in Study 1, state anxiety was measured with the SSAI, and participants indicated their COVID-19-related anxiety on a continuous visual analogue scale. This tool was used consistently to assess anxiety levels."

    "measured_by": "State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)",
    "justification": "In Study 2a, trait anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) after participants completed the Stock Market Task. This scale is used to measure individual differences in trait anxiety levels to correlate with information-seeking behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "COVID-19 Related Anxiety",
    "measured_by": "Continuous visual analogue scale",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to rate their anxiety regarding several COVID-19 related concerns (health, loved ones, lockdown, income, exercise, supplies, socialization) on a scale from 0 to 100. These scores were aggregated to create an Anxiety Index Score that was used to link to information-seeking behavior related to the pandemic."

    "topic_or_construct": "Induced Anxiety",
    "measured_by": "Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) modification",
    "justification": "Induced anxiety was manipulated using a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in Study 2b. The TSST included a threat of public speaking and solving difficult math problems to induce anxiety. The effectiveness of the manipulation was measured using the SSAI before and after the manipulation."
