    "topic_or_construct": "pain intensity",
    "measured_by": "subjective ratings on a 0-10 scale",
    "justification": "The text mentions that pain is typically measured by patients' subjective ratings, including a common 0-10 scale ranging from 'no pain' to 'most pain imaginable,' indicating its use in quantifying pain intensity."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "pain unpleasantness",
    "measured_by": "subjective ratings on a 0-10 scale",
    "justification": "Similar to pain intensity, pain unpleasantness is also assessed using patients' subjective ratings. This method is consistent with the International Association for the Study of Pain definition, which respects verbal descriptions as indicative of the experienced pain."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "nociception",
    "measured_by": "objective noxious stimuli",
    "justification": "The paper describes nociception as 'the neural process of encoding and processing noxious stimuli,' suggesting that it is measured through objective parameters such as temperature or intensity delivered to participants."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "pain utility function",
    "measured_by": "participants' willingness to accept monetary rewards paired with painful stimuli",
    "justification": "Slimani et al. [69] used a method where participants indicated their willingness to accept monetary rewards paired with different levels of painful electrical stimulation, which allowed the estimation of the utility function of pain based on indifference points."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reward-related decision-making",
    "measured_by": "behavioral choices and neural activation in reward regions",
    "justification": "The paper compares the anticipation of pain with reward by observing elevated neural activation in regions like the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in response to cues predicting high versus low pain, similar to reward anticipation."
