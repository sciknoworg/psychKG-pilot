    "justification": "The study uses the Choice-Based Learning (CBL) model to examine CIPC in IDM. The models were fitted to actual behavioral data, demonstrating that the values of both chosen and rejected items changed without relying on subjective ratings, confirming CIPC during IDM."

    "measured_by": "Novel Contour Shapes Preference Judgment Task",
    "justification": "The study employs a preference judgment task using novel contour shapes to assess IDM. The task is designed to minimize initial preference differences among stimuli, allowing for computational modeling of value updates during IDM."

    "topic_or_construct": "Learning Rate",
    "measured_by": "CBL Model Parameters",
    "justification": "The CBL models incorporate a learning rate parameter that measures the degree of value update. Computational model analyses were conducted to estimate this parameter from participants' choice behavior data during the IDM task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value Updating Mechanism",
    "measured_by": "CBL Model Variants",
    "justification": "Various CBL model variants (e.g., CBL\u03b1c, CBL\u03b1r, CBL\u03b1cr, CBL\u03b1c\u03b1r) are used to explore different hypotheses about how the values of chosen and rejected items are updated. Model comparisons based on actual behavioral data reveal the updating mechanisms during IDM processes."
