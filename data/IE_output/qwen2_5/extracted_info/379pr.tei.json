    "justification": "Response times are used to model test engagement behaviors as they can identify whether individuals are engaged or disengaged during low-stakes tests. This method helps to improve parameter estimation by considering test taking motivation, which is crucial when classical IRT models may not be sufficient."

    "measured_by": "Response Times",
    "justification": "Ulitzsch et al. (2020) modeled missing responses due to low engagement using response times. This approach captures how individual response times can reflect whether a test taker is engaged or disengaged by assessing the duration of their responses."

    "measured_by": "DLC-SL-IRT Model",
    "justification": "In the DLC-SL-IRT model, latent engagement probability is modeled as a logistic regression dependent on response time, indicating that response times help infer an individual's engagement level for each item."

    "topic_or_construct": "Engagement Probability",

    "justification": "The DLC-TL-IRT model introduces an individual engagement difficulty parameter alongside response times, capturing how individual differences in engagement propensity influence test responses."

    "measured_by": "ILC-RE-IRT Model",
    "justification": "The ILC-RE-IRT model connects engagement probabilities through individual latent variables rather than directly through response times. It models different response time distributions for engaged and disengaged responses, providing a more nuanced understanding of engagement."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Engagement Probability",
    "measured_by": "ILC-RI-IRT Model",
    "justification": "The ILC-RI-IRT model assumes a random intercept for response times, indicating that individual response speeds have an effect on engagement even in disengaged situations, and that engagement effects are fixed across individuals."
