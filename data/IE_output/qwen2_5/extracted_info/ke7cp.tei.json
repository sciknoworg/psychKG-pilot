    "measured_by": "Implicit Association Test (IAT)",
    "justification": "The IAT is used to capture unconscious or 'implicit' evaluations or beliefs that are uncontrollable and influence behavior outside conscious awareness, such as attitudes towards race, gender, or other social groups. This is demonstrated in the paper by how the IAT measures response times and accuracy in sorting target concepts with positive or negative attributes, with faster responses indicating stronger associations."

    "topic_or_construct": "Individual Differences in Decision-Making Processes",
    "measured_by": "Geometric Similarity Representation - Diffusion Decision Model (GSR-DDM)",
    "justification": "The GSR-DDM decomposes performance on the IAT into parameters such as similarity, drift rates, and thresholds, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of individual differences in decision-making processes underlying IAT task performance. The model improves test-retest reliability and predictive validity compared to simpler models, indicating it captures relevant cognitive components."

    "measured_by": "Conceptual Similarity Parameter (\u03b3) in GSR-DDM",
    "justification": "The conceptual similarity parameter in the GSR-DDM directly quantifies the degree of associative strength between concepts (e.g., race and valence) by estimating the cosine similarity between concept vectors. This parameter showed high test-retest reliability and discriminant validity, highlighting its ability to isolate the core associative component that drives IAT performance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Control and Response Caution",
    "measured_by": "Threshold Parameter (\u03b8) in GSR-DDM",
    "justification": "The threshold parameter in GSR-DDM represents the level of caution or control participants apply when making decisions, which can vary between conditions. Participants who set higher thresholds, especially in incompatible block trials, exhibit greater control over their responses, which was found to be relevant for outcomes like motivation and contact with minoritized groups."
