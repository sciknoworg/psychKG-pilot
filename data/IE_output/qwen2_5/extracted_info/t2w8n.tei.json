    "justification": "The study assessed participants' perception of risk in avalanche terrain by asking them to judge how safe or dangerous scenarios were on a 7-point scale with 'Not at all safe' to 'Completely safe' for the safety frame and 'Not at all dangerous' to 'Completely dangerous' for the danger frame. This scale directly measured their risk perception under different framing conditions."
