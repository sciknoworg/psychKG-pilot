    "justification": "The article describes an experiment where children of different ages were presented with jars containing different proportions of blue and white eggs, selecting a cup to infer probabilistic outcomes. This task is used to measure children's ability to quantify probabilities based on proportions."

    "justification": "The article discusses a study by T\u00e9gl\u00e1s et al. (2007, 2011, 2015) where infants' looking times were recorded as they observed objects moving in a virtual urn, indicating their ability to infer probabilities. However, the reliability of this measure for larger quantities is questioned."

    "justification": "The paper refers to a study by Girotto et al. (2016) where 3- and 4-year-olds were presented with jars containing different quantities of preferred and less preferred objects. Children were observed to determine if they relied on proportions to estimate probabilities."
