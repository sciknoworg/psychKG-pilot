    "measured_by": "Diffusion Decision Model (DDM) Drift Parameter",
    "justification": "The paper discusses that the drift rate parameter of the DDM reflects task difficulty, noting that as task difficulty increases, the drift rate decreases and vice versa. This is supported by the empirical analysis showing the drift rate aligns with the task difficulty sequence."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Caution and Speed-Accuracy Emphasis",
    "measured_by": "Diffusion Decision Model (DDM) Threshold Parameter",
    "justification": "The threshold parameter in the DDM captures subjects' decision caution, which is manipulated by emphasizing speed versus accuracy. The study found that under accuracy instructions, the threshold parameter generally increases, while it decreases under speed instructions, reflecting how these psychological constructs are mapped via the model's threshold estimates."

    "measured_by": "DDM Non-decision Time Parameter (\u03c4)",
    "justification": "The non-decision time parameter \u03c4 in the DDM accounts for processes like stimulus encoding and motor responses that occur outside the decision-making process. This aspect was specified in the paper as relevant but was less targeted by experimental manipulations."

    "topic_or_construct": "Practice Effects in Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Non-stationary Diffusion Decision Model (NSDDM)",
    "justification": "The NSDDM framework captures how parameters evolve over time. The paper discusses practice effects evident in drift rates steadily increasing throughout the experiment, except during the most difficult tasks, which the model discerns without direct context."
