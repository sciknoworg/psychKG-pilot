    "justification": "The study utilized eye-tracking data to examine how attention was modulated by the presentation of zero outcomes framed as 'win \u00a50' or 'lose \u00a50.' This link is justified by the analysis of dwell times on different regions of interest (ROIs), showing that framing zero outcomes asymmetrically influenced attention allocation."

    "justification": "Attention allocation was measured through the setup of eight non-overlapping rectangular ROIs covering choice attributes. Dwell times within these ROIs revealed how framing zero outcomes as 'win \u00a50' or 'lose \u00a50' altered attention towards risky options versus certain options."

    "measured_by": "Bayesian logistic regression model",
    "justification": "Choice preference was quantified using a simple Bayesian logistic model regressing choices on task domain, probability levels, frame of zero outcome, and their interactions. This model provided insights into how different frames of zero outcomes influenced participants' preferences for risky options."

    "justification": "The additive aDDM combined with Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) was used to model the behavioral data. The model parameters indicated that the mutable-zero effect arose from starting point and attentional bias parameters, suggesting attentional mechanisms."

    "justification": "Risk preference was analyzed under conditions where zero outcomes were presented as 'win \u00a50,' 'lose \u00a50,' or hidden. The choice data revealed that framing zero outcomes made individuals either more risk-averse ('win \u00a50') or more risk-seeking ('lose \u00a50') depending on the domain and probability level."
