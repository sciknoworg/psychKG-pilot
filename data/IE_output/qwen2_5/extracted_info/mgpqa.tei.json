    "justification": "The study uses a hierarchical Bayesian framework to estimate parameters and calculates intraclass correlations to measure the stability of computational phenotype parameters over 12 weeks. The ICC values provide evidence for the reliability of these parameters across time."

    "measured_by": "Power law function and state models",
    "justification": "Practice effects are modeled using a plateauing power law and state effects are accounted for in the dynamic model. The analysis reveals that almost all parameters in the computational phenotype are affected by practice effects over time."

    "measured_by": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on daily survey responses",
    "justification": "Principal component analysis was used to extract affective valence and arousal from participant surveys. These factors were then included in the dynamic model to show their influence on the computational phenotype parameters."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Dynamic computational phenotype",
    "measured_by": "Dynamic computational model including practice, affective state, and noise effects",
    "justification": "The dynamic model incorporates practice effects, affective state (valence and arousal), and noise to account for temporal variability in cognitive task parameters. This model provides a more nuanced understanding of the sources of variability in the computational phenotype."

    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal variability in cognitive parameters",
    "measured_by": "Weekly cognitive task performance and parameter estimation",
    "justification": "Participants completed seven cognitive tasks weekly over 12 weeks. The estimated parameters from each task were used to analyze changes in computational phenotypes and identify sources of temporal variability."
