    "measured_by": "Florida-And-Georgia (FLAG) Gambling Task",
    "justification": "The FLAG task was designed to examine sensitivity to outliers, demonstrating participants' tendency to undervalue large gains but overvalue large losses, which is consistent with Prospect Theory. The task effectively isolates and measures this cognitive bias by presenting a variable distribution of gains and losses."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Bias: Loss Aversion",
    "measured_by": "Florida-And-Georgia (FLAG) Gambling Task",
    "justification": "While the study was designed to measure loss aversion through the FLAG task, it did not replicate the expected outcomes. This suggests that the task can measure loss aversion, but the findings indicate that loss aversion may not be robust when other decision features are present. This null result supports the utility of the task in examining this bias."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Bias: Primacy-Recency Effect",
    "measured_by": "Florida-And-Georgia (FLAG) Gambling Task",
    "justification": "The FLAG task was used to measure the primacy-recency effect. The results showed that most participants placed greater weight on recent outcomes, confirming the recency bias. This finding aligns with the task\u2019s ability to capture how earlier or more recent outcomes influence decision-making."
