    "measured_by": "Pupillometry",
    "justification": "The article connects cognitive arousal with changes in pupil size, stating that pupil dilation is associated with arousal states and related neural systems like the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system. Changes in pupil size therefore indirectly measure cognitive arousal."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Mental effort",
    "measured_by": "Pupillometry",
    "justification": "The text references that pupillometry can measure mental effort, with the pupil size reflecting the load on cognitive capacity as proposed by Kahneman's psychophysiological model."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attention",
    "measured_by": "Pupillometry",
    "justification": "The article suggests that pupillometry indexes attentional processes by describing the relationship between orienting responses and changes in pupil size."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotional processing",
    "measured_by": "Pupillometry",
    "justification": "The use of pupillometry to measure emotional states is referenced, indicating that emotional components can be inferred from changes in pupil dynamics."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fatigue",
    "measured_by": "Pupillometry",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how pupillary measures relate to fatigue and sleepiness, noting the existence of slow oscillations in pupil size associated with these states."
