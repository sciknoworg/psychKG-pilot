    "justification": "The article describes using a maze task with varying numbers of doors in multi-action rooms M_R and M_L to assess participants' exploration behavior. Participants' choices of doors are analyzed through their p_R value (bias towards the right door), which reflects their sensitivity to long-term consequences of actions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal discounting in exploration",
    "measured_by": "Variations in maze depth relative to the start state (S)",
    "justification": "The research employs variations in the depth of maze structures to measure how the delay between actions and their long-term consequences affects human exploration. Changes in p_R values with varying maze depths illustrate the impact of temporal discounting on exploratory behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Quality of directed exploration",
    "measured_by": "p_repeat values at state M_R",
    "justification": "The study uses p_repeat, the probability of repeating the same choice in consecutive visits of state M_R, to differentiate between 'good' and 'poor' directed explorers. Lower p_repeat values indicate directed exploration, while higher values suggest random exploration or other biases."

    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty-driven exploration dynamics",
    "measured_by": "Learning dynamics (p_R(t) over episodes)",
    "justification": "The article records changes in the bias towards right choices (p_R) over episodes to study how exploration dynamics evolve. Transient peaks followed by declines in p_R suggest that human exploration is driven by uncertainty reduction."
