    "measured_by": "Binary variable indicating identical choices in repetitions",
    "justification": "The authors measured choice consistency using a simple binary variable that indicates whether identical choices were made when a decision was repeated, providing a straightforward method to evaluate decision consistency."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reaction time",
    "measured_by": "Linear regression analysis",
    "justification": "To examine whether the increase in consistency was associated with reaction time changes, the authors used a linear regression analysis across trial blocks, indicating reaction times fell as tasks progressed."

    "topic_or_construct": "Adherence to decision rules",
    "measured_by": "Mixed model linear regression",
    "justification": "The researchers assessed the use of various decision rules through mixed model linear regression, analyzing average adherence rates over trial blocks to see if participants' choices aligned with specific rules or heuristics."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risky decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Monetary gambles task",
    "justification": "Participants made choices between monetary gambles with different outcomes and probabilities, adapted from previous studies, illustrating a controlled environment to study risky decision-making."
