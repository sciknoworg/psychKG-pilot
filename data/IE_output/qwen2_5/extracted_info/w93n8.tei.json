    "justification": "The research measures trait indecisiveness using the well-established 15-item Indecisiveness Scale, which is the most common measure for assessing indecisiveness. State indecisiveness was adapted from this scale for use in the mobile surveys to refer specifically to the decision at hand."

    "measured_by": "Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (German version by Gerlach et al., 2008)",
    "justification": "The study used the German version of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale with 18 items to assess trait IU at baseline. For state IU, three items from this scale were adapted to measure IU in relation to specific decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decisional Safety Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Custom Safety Behavior Assessment",
    "justification": "Participants reported any uncertainty-reducing behaviors they used and rated these behaviors on items representing criteria of problematic safety behavior. This includes factors like cost and excessiveness, uncertainty motivation, and feeling forced, providing a detailed measure of safety behavior in decision-making contexts."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Importance",
    "measured_by": "Decision Importance Ratings",
    "justification": "Participants rated the importance of their decision using specific items capturing the perceived significance, consequences, and relevance of the decision, helping researchers assess how decision features interact with IU and indecisiveness."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decisional Uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Uncertainty Rating Item",
    "justification": "A single item directly assessed the extent of uncertainty participants felt was involved in the decision, contributing to the overall evaluation of uncertainty's role in decision-making processes."
