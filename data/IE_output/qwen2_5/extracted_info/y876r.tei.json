    "justification": "The study used the 'tracking fluctuating intentions' task involving the MIIL model to test children's ability to detect and adapt to fluctuating cooperativeness and competitiveness of an Artificial Agent. The MIIL model, which calculates decision values based on competitive and cooperative mechanisms, best explained the behavior of older children aged 8-9 years in this task."

    "justification": "The Bayesian Sequence Learners (BSL0 and BSL1) models were used to assess children's simpler learning strategies. The BSL0 model, which computes the mean and variance of the probability of the correct choice, best fitted the majority of younger children aged 3-7 years, indicating they relied on Bayesian inference rather than mentalizing mechanisms."

    "measured_by": "Win-Stay/Lose-Switch (WSLS) model",
    "justification": "The WSLS heuristic, which involves staying with the same choice if it was successful and switching otherwise, represented a marginal strategy for some children. Its presence suggests some participants relied on this simple decision rule rather than more complex mentalizing mechanisms."

    "measured_by": "Mixed-Intentions Influence Learning (MIIL) model",
    "justification": "The article states that by around 8 years old, the majority of children were best explained by the MIIL model, suggesting they had developed the ability to mentalize and track the intentions of others, which is a key component of Theory of Mind."

    "topic_or_construct": "Strategic decision-making mechanisms",
    "measured_by": "Computational models (MIIL, BSL0, BSL1, QL, WSLS)",
    "justification": "The researchers compared multiple computational models, including the MIIL, BSL0, BSL1, Q-Learning, and WSLS models, to analyze how children adapt their strategies in response to cooperative and competitive interactions. Different models best suited different age groups, revealing developmental changes in strategic decision-making mechanisms."
