    "measured_by": "AUC2 (Area Under the Type 2 ROC function)",
    "justification": "AUC2 was described as one of the popular measures for assessing metacognitive ability, which evaluates the area under the Type 2 ROC function plotting Type 2 hit rate vs. Type 2 false alarm rate, reflecting the confidence ratings' ability to discriminate correct from incorrect responses."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive ability",
    "measured_by": "Gamma (Goodman-Kruskall Gamma coefficient)",
    "justification": "Gamma measures metacognitive ability through a rank correlation between trial-by-trial confidence and accuracy, making it a popular choice in memory research. It is based on straightforward intuitive appeal."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive ability",
    "measured_by": "Phi (Pearson correlation between trial-by-trial confidence and accuracy)",
    "justification": "Phi assesses how well trial-by-trial confidence ratings correlate with actual accuracy. As a Pearson correlation, it provides another perspective on the metacognitive capability compared to rank-based Gamma."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive ability",
    "measured_by": "\u0394Conf (difference between average confidence on correct and error trials)",
    "justification": "\u0394Conf quantifies metacognitive ability by calculating the difference in average confidence ratings between correct and error trials, offering a simple yet potentially informative measure."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive ability",
    "measured_by": "M-Ratio (meta-d' divided by d')",
    "justification": "M-Ratio is normalized form of meta-d', a sensitivity measure of confidence ratings relative to task performance, often used to mitigate dependence on task difficulty in metacognition."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive ability",
    "measured_by": "AUC2-Ratio, Gamma-Ratio, Phi-Ratio, \u0394Conf-Ratio (normalized ratios)",
    "justification": "These measures were developed to normalize AUC2, Gamma, Phi, and \u0394Conf using SDT-based predicted values, aiming to provide measures of metacognitive ability adjusted for task performance."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive ability",
    "measured_by": "Meta-noise (lognormal meta noise model parameter)",
    "justification": "Meta-noise is derived from a process model that incorporates lognormally distributed metacognitive noise affecting confidence criteria. This parameter is used as a measure reflecting metacognitive ability."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive ability",
    "measured_by": "Meta-uncertainty (second-order uncertainty parameter from the CASANDRE model)",
    "justification": "Meta-uncertainty results from the CASANDRE process model that accounts for uncertainty about internal representations. It serves as another process-based measure for assessing metacognitive ability."
