    "justification": "The study utilizes the modified version of the Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) paradigm to assess how Pavlovian cues can alter optimal decision-making strategies. The presence of maladaptive decision-making in the presence of Pavlovian cues is used as an indicator of Pavlovian bias (Experiment 1, 2, and 3)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Optimal decision-making strategy",
    "measured_by": "Reward matching behavior",
    "justification": "The optimal decision-making strategy is measured through reward matching behavior, where participants allocate their choices in proportion to the reward probabilities associated with each option. Deviations from this strategy, particularly in the presence of Pavlovian cues, are used to assess suboptimal decision-making (Experiment 1, 2, and 3)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Pavlovian learning",
    "measured_by": "Liking ratings on 9-point Likert scale",
    "justification": "The efficacy of Pavlovian learning is measured by participants' explicit liking ratings over fractal images (CSs) before and after Pavlovian learning, indicating the association between cues and reward outcomes (Experiments 1, 2, and 3)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Suboptimal behavior",
    "measured_by": "Overall reward income",
    "justification": "The suboptimal influence of Pavlovian cues is quantified by the overall reward income during the transfer phases. Lower overall reward income in specific conditions indicates that the presence of certain Pavlovian cues leads to suboptimal performance (Experiment 1, 2, and 3)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Instrumental learning",
    "measured_by": "Percentage of Responses for Rich and Poor Options",
    "justification": "The acquisition of instrumental learning is measured by the percentage of responses directed towards the rich and poor options during the instrumental learning phase. The data analysis focuses on verifying if participants differentiate their choices based on the probabilities of obtaining rewards (Experiment 1, 2, and 3)."
