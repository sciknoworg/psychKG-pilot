    "justification": "The moral reasoning task included personal high-conflict moral dilemmas that required participants to decide whether to personally harm someone to save multiple lives. The task was adapted from Koenigs et al. (2007) for this study."

    "topic_or_construct": "Affective response to personal high-conflict moral dilemmas",
    "measured_by": "Feeling ratings (1 to 5 scale)",
    "justification": "Participants rated how they felt about their moral decisions on a scale from 'Extremely Bad' (1) to 'Extremely Good' (5), specifically after making decisions in personal high-conflict moral dilemmas."

    "measured_by": "Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ)",
    "justification": "The Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ) was used to assess participants' ability to identify socially appropriate and inappropriate behaviors, which reflects their social conceptual knowledge. This questionnaire measures understanding of social rules and norms."

    "measured_by": "Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis",
    "justification": "VBM analysis was used to assess gray matter integrity in various brain regions, particularly in patients with bvFTD, allowing researchers to correlate structural brain changes with moral reasoning abilities."

    "justification": "DTI analysis measured fractional anisotropy (FA), a marker of white matter integrity, particularly in tracts like the uncinate fasciculus, which connects the orbitofrontal/mPFC to the anterior temporal lobes."
