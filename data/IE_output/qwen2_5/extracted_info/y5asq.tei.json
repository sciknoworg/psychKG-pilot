    "measured_by": "Resting-State Functional Connectivity (rsFC) measured by EEG",
    "justification": "The study focuses on MDD and uses resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) via EEG to analyze how MDD affects brain networks, providing insights into the intrinsic connectivity of the brain during rest."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Intrinsic Connectivity Networks",
    "measured_by": "PDC and ffPDC",
    "justification": "PDC and ffPDC were used to identify EEG biomarkers for MDD by assessing the temporal synchronization of neural activity across brain areas, yielding the best classification results with F1-scores up to 0.790."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Alpha Frequency Band Activity",
    "measured_by": "Electroencephalography (EEG)",
    "justification": "Increased rsFC in the alpha frequency band, as measured by EEG, was found to be associated with depressive symptoms, particularly in frontal and posterior brain regions."
