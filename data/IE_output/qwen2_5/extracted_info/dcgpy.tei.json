    "measured_by": "Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) Scales",
    "justification": "The studies measured participants' willingness-to-pay to improve their chances of a positive outcome, demonstrating that people value improvements differently based on initial probabilities. This usage of WTP scales indicates the evaluation of improvement decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Conditional Regret (Focusing on Bad Outcomes)",
    "measured_by": "Framing Manipulations",
    "justification": "In Study 2a, participants' valuations of improvements were affected by how the improvement was framed, especially when emphasized as a reduction in bad outcomes. This shows the conditional regret model where people focus on bad outcomes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Regret Sensitivity in Improvement Decisions",
    "measured_by": "Severity of Consequences Manipulation",
    "justification": "Study 2b examined the impact of consequence severity on decision-making, showing that participants' sensitivity to regret is increased when outcomes are more severe. This highlights how regret influences valuations of improvements."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Suboptimal Choices in Improvement Decisions",
    "measured_by": "Choice Trials in Different Domains",
    "justification": "Study 3 had participants choose between different improvement options across various domains like medicine and gig work, revealing a tendency to make suboptimal choices influenced by the anticipation of regret."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Expertise on Improvement Decisions",
    "measured_by": "Comparative Analysis between Experts and Laypeople",
    "justification": "The data demonstrate that even experts in their fields can make suboptimal improvement decisions, suggesting that expertise does not necessarily mitigate the biases linked to valuing improvements."
