    "topic_or_construct": "Facial Trustworthiness",
    "measured_by": "Oosterhof and Todorov prototypes",
    "justification": "The study used computer-generated face prototypes created by Oosterhof and Todorov (2008) to manipulate perceived trustworthiness, which reflects a high and low score on perceived trustworthiness to measure how facial trustworthiness influenced sentencing decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Facial Trustworthiness",
    "measured_by": "Physiognomic belief scale",
    "justification": "Physiognomic beliefs were measured using the scale developed by Jaeger et al. (2019b) to assess participants' explicit beliefs that personality traits can be accurately judged from facial appearances. This scale was used in Study 1 to gauge changes in these beliefs after interventions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Racial Implicit Bias",
    "measured_by": "Implicit Association Test (IAT)",
    "justification": "Although not explicitly detailed in the content provided, the IAT is commonly used in research cited, such as studies by Greenwald and colleagues, to measure implicit racial biases, which are relevant to discussions of judicial decision-making and stereotyping."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Confidence",
    "measured_by": "9-point Likert scale",
    "justification": "Participants indicated their confidence in their verdicts on a scale from 1 (not confident at all) to 9 (extremely confident), allowing researchers to measure how confident participants were in their decisions. This is a direct measure of confidence in legal decision-making influenced by facial stereotypes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Facial Stereotypes",
    "measured_by": "Manipulated Facial Features in Legal Sentencing Paradigm",
    "justification": "The legal sentencing paradigm created by the researchers presented participants with manipulated face images, reflecting trustworthy or untrustworthy facial features, to test for the influence of facial stereotypes on sentencing decisions, integrating both experimental control and real-world application."
