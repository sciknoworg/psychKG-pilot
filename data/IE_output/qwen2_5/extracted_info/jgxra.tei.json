    "measured_by": "online experiment with varying state prior probabilities",
    "justification": "An online experiment was conducted where participants made choices between safe and risky options, with the risky option payout depending on voter distribution. The experiment varied the prior probabilities through different states to measure risk preferences under different prior knowledge contexts."

    "justification": "The logistic regression of the posterior value of the risky option on choice confirms that people\u2019s choices are influenced by the prior probabilities in the optimal way, as evidenced by positive and significant \u03b2 coefficients in both conditions."
