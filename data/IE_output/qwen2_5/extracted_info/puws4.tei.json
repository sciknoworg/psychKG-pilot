    "measured_by": "Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)",
    "justification": "The paper discusses SHAPS as a widely used tool for measuring anhedonia, focusing on overall hedonic capacity across various pleasurable activities. It confirms this usage with validations involving the 3-arm bandit reinforcement learning task alongside SHAPS scores."

    "topic_or_construct": "Anhedonia",
    "measured_by": "Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS)",
    "justification": "The paper highlights DARS as a more recent instrument for assessing anhedonia with domain-specific granularity, covering social interaction, physical sensations, hobbies, and food/drink. Both SHAPS and DARS scales were used in the study alongside the 3-arm bandit task to provide a multi-faceted view of anhedonia."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reward Learning and Motivation",
    "measured_by": "3-arm Bandit Task (3AB)",
    "justification": "The 3AB task was employed in this study as a reinforcement learning paradigm to assess reward learning and sensitivity. The task aimed to investigate learning mechanisms related to reward and punishment in anhedonic and non-anhedonic groups, complementing the self-report measures of anhedonia."
