    "justification": "The study measures self-serving bias by presenting participants with a scenario involving the allocation of a ventilator between an older and a younger patient, and observing their decisions to allocate based on age. Participants tended to favor rules that aligned with their own self-interest (e.g., older participants favoring 'first-come, first-served' principles), which is an indicator of self-serving bias."

    "justification": "The effect of veil-of-ignorance reasoning is measured using a two-stage experimental paradigm. First, participants engage in a veil-of-ignorance exercise where they consider giving equal weight to all affected parties without knowing their identity. Then, they respond to the moral judgment regarding ventilator\u5206\u914d. This method aims to eliminate self-serving biases in their judgments."

    "measured_by": "Dichotomous and scale measures of moral judgment",
    "justification": "Utilitarian judgment is measured using a dichotomous measure asking if participants find it morally acceptable to allocate the ventilator to the younger patient, and a scale measure assessing the extent of this acceptability. These measures reveal whether participants favor a utilitarian decision to maximize life-years saved."
