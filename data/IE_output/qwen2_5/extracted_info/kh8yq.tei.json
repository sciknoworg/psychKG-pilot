    "topic_or_construct": "Experience of effort",
    "measured_by": "Self-report ratings on a visual analogue scale",
    "justification": "The experience of effort is indexed through self-report ratings upon completion of the workload, using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 100, reflecting the subjective experience of effort after completing the task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Preference for effort",
    "measured_by": "Decision-making tasks",
    "justification": "The preference for effort can be measured through decision-making tasks where participants weigh effort cost against reward, allowing researchers to assess the anticipatory component of effort processing."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Effort exertion",
    "measured_by": "Reaction time and physical tasks with grip force measurement",
    "justification": "Effort exertion can be measured using reaction time in cognitive tasks or through physical tasks, such as grip force measurements, to quantify the vigor with which participants exert effort."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Apathy",
    "measured_by": "Apathy Motivation Index (AMI)",
    "justification": "The Apathy Motivation Index (AMI) measures multiple facets of apathy, including social motivation, which was used to explore its relationship with the preference for progress feedback in this study."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Depression symptoms",
    "measured_by": "Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)",
    "justification": "The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to measure symptoms of depression, which allowed the researchers to examine the relationship between mental health factors and the preference for progress feedback."

    "topic_or_construct": "Intolerance of uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12)",
    "justification": "The Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12) was included as an additional measure, aiming to explore whether an aversion to the uncertainty of lacking progress feedback influenced participants' choices."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Individual differences in personality traits",
    "measured_by": "Big Five Inventory (BFI-2)",
    "justification": "The Big Five Inventory (BFI-2) was used to assess personality traits such as emotional volatility, which was hypothesized to influence the value placed on progress feedback."
