    "topic_or_construct": "Interoceptive Sensibility",
    "measured_by": "Self-report questionnaires such as the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA)",
    "justification": "The text describes how interoceptive sensibility (often described as any self-report measure of interoception) can encompass a range of behaviors, from the self-perceived ability to detect internal signals to regulatory ability. The MAIA, an example of such a questionnaire, explicitly covers these aspects and is widely used."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Interoceptive Accuracy/Detection",
    "measured_by": "Performance-based tasks like Heartbeat Counting Task (HCT) and Heartbeat Discrimination Task (HDT)",
    "justification": "The article discusses these tasks for measuring objective interoceptive accuracy/detection. For example, HCT requires subjects to count their heartbeats mentally for a specific duration, providing a measure of their ability to detect internal cardiac signals."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Interoceptive Awareness/Insight",
    "measured_by": "The correspondence between objective task performance and self-reported confidence in that performance",
    "justification": "This dimension involves comparing how well an individual\u2019s own estimation of performance in interoceptive tasks matches objective performance metrics. It requires a combination of behavioral task outcomes and participant self-ratings."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Interoceptive Attention",
    "measured_by": "Neuroimaging measures (e.g., fMRI)",
    "justification": "The text explains that research on interoceptive attention often uses neuroimaging techniques to observe brain activation when participants focus attention on internal sensations like heart rate or breathing."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Interoceptive Magnitude",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported ratings of perceived intensity of internal bodily signals",
    "justification": "Magnitude involves participants rating their perceived intensity of internal sensations, such as heartbeats or breath sensations, in response to specific stimuli, indicating subjective perception of signal strength."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Interoceptive Discrimination",
    "measured_by": "Localization tasks or assessments of differentiation between internal and external sensations",
    "justification": "The ability to localize sensations within the body or differentiate between interoceptive and exteroceptive sensations is assessed through experimental procedures where participants identify the origin or type of stimuli."
