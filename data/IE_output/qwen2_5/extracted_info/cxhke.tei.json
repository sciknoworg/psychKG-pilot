    "measured_by": "PSi (People Supported Intelligence) algorithm implementation",
    "justification": "The PSi algorithm is designed to facilitate scalable deliberative decision-making by reducing the number of ideas discussed in each round exponentially. It demonstrates how group size can be managed while maintaining effective communication, with empirical evidence from the abortion rights debate experiment showing that constructive discussions can occur even among large groups of 300 participants."

    "topic_or_construct": "deliberative decision-making",
    "measured_by": "dot voting within PSi platform",
    "justification": "The PSi method includes dot voting as a mechanism for participants to express their preferences over ideas discussed in small groups. This method allows for capturing the mean and variance of preference distribution, enabling a nuanced aggregation of individual judgments in the collective decision-making process."

    "topic_or_construct": "idea diversity",
    "measured_by": "Universal Sentence Encoder for semantic variance computation",
    "justification": "The diversity of submitted ideas in a PSi discussion was calculated using the Universal Sentence Encoder to embed ideas, which were then scored for semantic similarity using cosine similarity. The variance of these scores indicated the diversity of ideas, showcasing how computational methods can measure the range of viewpoints raised within a deliberative forum."

    "topic_or_construct": "social influence in large groups",
    "measured_by": "PSi's reliance on small-scale parallel discussions",
    "justification": "The PSi method limits the influence of any given individual on the final group decision by ensuring that interactions are small-scale and occur in parallel. This design aims to reduce the disproportionate impact of any one person, addressing concerns about dominant speakers in large group discussions harming the deliberation process."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "polarization",
    "measured_by": "polarization score calculation based on voting patterns",
    "justification": "The polarization score is computed based on the fraction of participants from opposing political camps (in this case, Republicans vs. Democrats) who voted for each idea. The inverse correlation between the polarization score and the number of votes an idea received suggests that less polarizing ideas tend to be more favored in deliberative discussions."
