    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Probability judgment discrimination scores",
    "justification": "Yates and colleagues found higher metacognitive sensitivity in Chinese than US populations as measured by probability judgment discrimination scores, indicating the ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect trials using confidence ratings."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Meta-cognition",
    "measured_by": "Performance-controlled laboratory tasks",
    "justification": "The study utilized performance-controlled laboratory tasks to measure meta-cognitive capacity, specifically the relationship between confidence and performance devoid of first-order performance differences."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive bias",
    "measured_by": "Average confidence ratings",
    "justification": "The metacognitive bias was measured via average confidence ratings in general knowledge questions, showing that Chinese populations report higher confidence compared to US/UK populations."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive evaluation",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral task with post-decision evidence",
    "justification": "Chinese participants demonstrated heightened metacognitive evaluation when processing post-decisional evidence, showing more susceptibility to modifying confidence ratings based on new evidence after making errors."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive insight",
    "measured_by": "Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS)",
    "justification": "The BCIS was used to measure cognitive insight, evaluating the participants' recognition that experienced reality may differ from objective truth. Chinese participants had higher baseline levels of self-reported cognitive insight compared to UK participants."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive efficiency",
    "measured_by": "Meta-d'/d' ratio",
    "justification": "Metacognitive efficiency was quantified using the meta-d'/d' ratio, calculated within a hierarchical model fitted to the final confidence ratings data, showing higher efficiency in Chinese participants in all three datasets."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive ability",
    "measured_by": "Psychophysical task with random-dot kinematograms (RDKs)",
    "justification": "Participants judged the direction of dot motion in RDKs, coupled with post-decision evidence, allowing the measurement of metacognitive ability via confidence ratings and their relationship with task performance."
