    "topic_or_construct": "temporal discounting",
    "measured_by": "Kirby (2009) 27-item questionnaire",
    "justification": "The paper mentions that the Kirby (2009) questionnaire is a simple and widely used passive approach for measuring temporal discounting. It is easy to administer but not always very informative as many questions are far from indifference points for most participants."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "delay discounting",
    "measured_by": "Bayesian adaptive design method",
    "justification": "The paper introduces a novel Bayesian adaptive design method for measuring delay discounting that uses real-time data collection. It is shown to be more efficient and accurate in determining the discount rates compared to existing fixed or heuristic approaches, providing the most informative trial sequences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "magnitude effect in delay discounting",
    "measured_by": "Hyperbolic discount function with magnitude effect incorporated",
    "justification": "The paper extends the standard hyperbolic discounting model to include the magnitude effect, where the discount rate varies linearly with the log of the reward magnitude. It demonstrates the model's applicability in more accurately reflecting real-world discounting behavior that varies based on reward size."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "probability discounting (risky choice)",
    "measured_by": "Hyperbolic discount function applied to probability",
    "justification": "The paper applies the hyperbolic discount function to measure probability discounting. It shows that the discounting of probabilistic delayed rewards can also be well described using the same mathematical form, allowing for the measurement of risk sensitivity in decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "combined delay and probability discounting",
    "measured_by": "Multiplicative interaction model of delay and probability discounting",
    "justification": "The paper proposes a combined model that uses a multiplicative interaction between delay and probability discount rates to measure decision-making when both factors are present. It demonstrates the adaptability of their computational toolbox to handle multi-dimensional discounting scenarios."
