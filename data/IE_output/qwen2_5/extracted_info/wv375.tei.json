    "justification": "The study uses the trolley dilemma scenarios, specifically the bystander and footbridge versions, to measure moral judgments. Participants' willingness to accept sacrificial harm in these scenarios is assessed using a visual analog scale ranging from 1 'Not at all acceptable' to 7 'Totally acceptable'."

    "measured_by": "Framing manipulation in positive and negative conditions",
    "justification": "The experiment manipulates the framing of the outcomes in the trolley dilemma (positive vs. negative frames) to assess how this influences participants' acceptance of sacrificial harm, thus measuring susceptibility to framing effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reliability of moral decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Framing effect presence",
    "justification": "The study investigates the reliability of moral judgments by assessing the framing effect in moral dilemmas. Smaller framing effects indicate higher reliability, as participants' decisions are less influenced by superficial differences in wording."
