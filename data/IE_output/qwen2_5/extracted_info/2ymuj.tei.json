    "topic_or_construct": "Interoception",
    "measured_by": "Viscerosensory signals",
    "justification": "Interoception includes modeling the sensory signals from innervated visceral organs, which are conveyed via unmyelinated or lightly myelinated ascending fibers in the lamina 1 spinothalamic tract, as explained in the introduction."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Regulated Resources",
    "measured_by": "Levels of oxygen, glucose, carbon dioxide in blood",
    "justification": "The article describes how the regulated resources such as blood glucose, blood oxygen, etc., are used as variables to determine the state of the body in an ever-changing world. Their levels are kept within a viable range through the internal model."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Controlled Processes",
    "measured_by": "Heart rate and blood pressure regulation",
    "justification": "It explains that controlled processes like heart rate and blood pressure are modulated by central commands from the brain to maintain the required levels of oxygen, glucose, and carbon dioxide for optimal bodily function."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Allostasis",
    "measured_by": "Baroreflex modulation",
    "justification": "The brain aims to anticipate and prepare for the body's future physiological needs through interoceptive processes like baroreflex modulation, which adjusts cardiovascular variables based on the body's predicted requirements."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Predictive Homeostasis",
    "measured_by": "Glucagon and Insulin levels",
    "justification": "Predictive homeostasis is measured by assessing the effectiveness of hormonally regulated processes like glucagon and insulin in regulating blood glucose levels, demonstrating the anticipatory adjustments of the body."
