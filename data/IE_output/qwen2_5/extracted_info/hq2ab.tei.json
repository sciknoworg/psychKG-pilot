    "measured_by": "Identity Judgment Scale",
    "justification": "Facial examiners' facial expertise was assessed using a 7-point identity judgment scale developed in consultation with forensic face experts. This scale allows participants to express their judgments of facial comparisons ranging from strongly disagreeing to strongly agreeing it's the same person."

    "topic_or_construct": "Facial Expertise of Super-recognizers",
    "measured_by": "Identity Judgment Scale",
    "justification": "Super-recognizers' expertise was evaluated using the same 7-point identity judgment scale, revealing they frequently selected the most extreme points, indicating high confidence in their judgments."

    "measured_by": "Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC)",
    "justification": "Accuracy in facial recognition for facial examiners and super-recognizers was quantified using the AUC, based on the identity judgments provided for each comparison, demonstrating similar levels of accuracy between the two groups."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence in Facial Judgments",
    "measured_by": "Difficulty Rating Scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated the difficulty of each facial comparison on a 5-point scale, which, along with the absolute value of their identity judgments, was used to measure their confidence in their judgments."

    "topic_or_construct": "Agreement Among Face Specialists",
    "measured_by": "Cohen's Kappa Weighted for Ordinal Data",
    "justification": "Inter-rater reliability of identity judgments among facial examiners and super-recognizers was measured using Cohen's Kappa, offering insights into the consistency of judgments within each group."

    "justification": "Metacognitive ability was assessed by analyzing the relationships between participants' confidence levels, their rated difficulty of the comparisons, and their overall accuracy, showing that both groups had an awareness of their own performance."
