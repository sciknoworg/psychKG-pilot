    "measured_by": "Thought probes",
    "justification": "Thought probes are self-report measures commonly used in the mind wandering literature to assess participants' attention during task performance. They ask participants to report whether they were focused on the external task or off-task, providing a method to quantify mind wandering during cognitive tasks such as the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Task-related decision process",
    "measured_by": "Rhythmic race model (RRM)",
    "justification": "The RRM is used as a cognitive process model that accounts for decision behavior by modeling a competitive race between a stimulus-related decision process and an unconditionally triggered rhythmic response process. It offers a direct test of how well the stimulus-related decision process is separately estimated from contaminant data generated by the rhythmic process."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Response variability",
    "measured_by": "RT coefficient of variation (RTCV)",
    "justification": "RTCV is measured by examining the variability in response times, which typically increases during phases of off-task thoughts. This measure highlights that mind wandering is associated with more variable responding in cognitive tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Commission errors",
    "measured_by": "Go responses on no-go trials",
    "justification": "The probability of commission errors (incorrect go responses on nogo trials) increases during self-reported off-task thoughts, reflecting decreased attention to task goals."
