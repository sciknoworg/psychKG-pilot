    "topic_or_construct": " Predictive uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Gaze variability",
    "justification": "The study demonstrates that gaze variability during the pre-stimulus interval was inversely related to predictability at both block and trial levels, suggesting that oculomotor behavior carries information about the precision of internal predictive distributions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Adaptive learning rate",
    "measured_by": "Gaze-based prediction error",
    "justification": "Participants showed evidence of adaptive learning across blocks based on the integration of multiple previous observations, which was assessed through the change in gaze-based prediction error, indicating learning rate adaptation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Prediction accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Predictive gaze position",
    "justification": "The predictive gaze position at the time of digit onset was used as a measure for prediction accuracy, reflecting the central tendency of participants' internal predictive probability distribution."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Change point detection",
    "measured_by": "Post-change-point gaze variability",
    "justification": "Gaze variability transiently increased after change points in the generative mean, which was measured as the Cohen's D effect size for each post-change-point trial, indicating participants' ability to detect changes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward influence",
    "measured_by": "First post-stimulus saccade dynamics",
    "justification": "Reward availability did not influence the velocity or latency of the first saccade after digit onset, suggesting limited direct effects of reward on initial oculomotor dynamics."
