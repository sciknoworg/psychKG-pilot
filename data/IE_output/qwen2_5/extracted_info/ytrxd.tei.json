    "measured_by": "Error-related Negativity (ERN)",
    "justification": "The error-related negativity (ERN) is a fronto-central negative voltage deflection that peaks 50 to 100 ms after erroneous responses in speeded choice reaction time tasks. It is consistently observed in EEG studies as a robust and reliable neural substrate of error monitoring and subsequent recruitment of cognitive control."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Feedback-related Negativity (FRN)",
    "justification": "The FRN is an EEG component observed when negative and unexpected feedback is received. It is considered to index the computation of prediction errors, reflecting the brain's ability to update action values based on feedback."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Control",
    "measured_by": "FMRIs and EEG studies",
    "justification": "Neuroimaging studies, including fMRIs and EEG, have consistently shown that cognitive control processes, particularly those involving performance monitoring and adaptation, are associated with activity in the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC), mainly the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Conflict Processing",
    "measured_by": "N2 component in EEG",
    "justification": "The N2 component in EEG signals is related to response conflict. It increases in frontocentral regions when the resolution of competing response tendencies is required during actions, indicating the need for cognitive control."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward Prediction Errors",
    "measured_by": "fMRI and single neuron recordings",
    "justification": "Neural activity in the aMCC during feedback processing appears to reflect reward prediction errors (RPEs), as indicated by consistent findings from fMRI and single neuron recording studies in humans and animals."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Action Value Prediction",
    "measured_by": "Single neuron recordings in aMCC",
    "justification": "Single neuron recordings in the aMCC suggest that neurons in this region encode predictions about action outcomes, facilitating mechanisms such as reinforcement learning and adaptive behavior under changing environments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Error Neurons Activity",
    "measured_by": "Single-neuron Spiking Responses",
    "justification": "In the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), error-related neurons have been identified through single-neuron recordings, producing more spikes after errors compared to correct trials, signaling error detection."
