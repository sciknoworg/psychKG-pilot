    "measured_by": "damage ratings",
    "justification": "The collocation effect was measured by participants' damage ratings given to hypothetical offshore oil platforms, wherein the presence of a single hurricane path intersecting a platform led to higher damage estimates compared to platforms not intersected, demonstrating the effect's influence on decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "collocation effect",
    "measured_by": "ensemble display with varying ensemble members",
    "justification": "Increasing the number of ensemble members in the displayed visualization reduced the collocation effect, as participants' damage ratings were less influenced by a single intersecting path when more paths were present, highlighting a way to measure and mitigate this effect."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "collocation effect",
    "measured_by": "task-specific instructions",
    "justification": "The effectiveness of reducing the collocation effect was measured by providing participants with task-specific instructions, which significantly decreased the bias by teaching participants to disregard individual intersecting paths and focus on the general distribution of ensemble paths."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "collocation effect",
    "measured_by": "visualization instructions",
    "justification": "The study determined the impact of visualization instructions on the collocation effect by giving participants information on how the ensemble forecasts were generated. These instructions aimed to reduce the effect, though less effectively than task-specific instructions, indicating a measurement of the impact on viewers' interpretation."
