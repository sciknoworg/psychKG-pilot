    "topic_or_construct": "motivational conflict",
    "measured_by": "approach-avoidance conflict tasks",
    "justification": "The article discusses how approach-avoidance conflicts are studied in the laboratory, using tasks where subjects must navigate the decision between approaching a reward source under threat. For example, rats are made to traverse a runway where rewards are paired with potential punishment, representing a classic motivational conflict scenario."

    "topic_or_construct": "appetitive motivational states",
    "measured_by": "sign-tracking and goal-tracking behaviors",
    "justification": "In the context of Pavlovian conditioning, sign-tracking (approaching a visual signal that predicts reward) and goal-tracking (approaching the actual reward source) are used to measure different aspects of appetitive motivation. The article explains that these behaviors can compete within a motivational system and demonstrates how they are distinct yet related in neurological underpinnings, thereby reflecting different motivational substates."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "active versus passive defensive behaviors",
    "measured_by": "fear conditioning paradigms",
    "justification": "The article describes how fear conditioning studies (using tones signaling shock) can measure distinct defensive behaviors like freezing (passive) versus escape responses (active), reflecting competing states in aversive motivation. These behaviors are shown to be mediated by different neural circuits."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "paraventricular thalamus role in behavior",
    "measured_by": "optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations",
    "justification": "The article uses manipulations of the PVT (such as excitation or inhibition) to assess its role in various motivational conflicts. For instance, it explains how PVT silencing affects behaviors in approach-avoidance paradigms, and these behavioral outcomes are directly attributed to the manipulations performed on the PVT."
