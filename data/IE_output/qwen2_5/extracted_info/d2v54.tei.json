    "justification": "The article discusses how behavioural measures such as eye fixations during naturalistic reading and key-presses in a self-paced reading task have been instrumental in advancing the understanding of human sentence processing. These measures help reveal areas of processing difficulty and their relation to predictability in context."

    "measured_by": "Alien Game",
    "justification": "The Alien Game is mentioned as an experimental task used to explore categorisation and abstraction processes, conversational dynamics, and the interactions between individuals and dyads in autistic and non-autistic populations. It is used to investigate relevant cognitive components involved in categorising novel stimuli and how they could be modelled."

    "justification": "The group utilized Bayesian hierarchical models to analyse belief updates and distributions during job negotiation simulations. Onward, a negotiation agent developed using ACT-R provided insights into core dynamics like inferring negotiation strategies and responding effectively based on opponent\u2019s actions."

    "justification": "Reinforcement learning models are employed to investigate the dynamics between humans and cockatoos concerning bin-opening and protective interventions. These models utilise the same principles for both parties, showing their efficacy in elucidating the complex interplay of such behaviours."
