    "topic_or_construct": "Construal Level",
    "measured_by": "Natural Language Processing Analysis",
    "justification": "Study 7 used NLP techniques to analyze the semantic proximity of words to the concepts of fast and slow, finding that concrete words are more associated with fast than slow."

    "topic_or_construct": "Construal Level",
    "measured_by": "Action Verb Pairs",
    "justification": "Study 8 measured participants' perceptions of the speed of change with different action verbs (DAVs, IAVs, SVs, ADJs), finding an association between higher-level construals and slower perceived changes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Construal Level",
    "measured_by": "Action Description Choices",
    "justification": "In Study 9, participants chose high-level or low-level action descriptions for behaviors imagined as slow or fast, indicating that slow stimuli are construed at a higher level."

    "topic_or_construct": "Communication Distance",
    "measured_by": "Auditory Speed Manipulation",
    "justification": "Studies 10a and 10b used varying speeds of recorded messages to demonstrate that slow-paced speech is perceived as directed to more distant and larger audiences."

    "justification": "Study 11 explored the perception of a speaker's regulatory scope based on the speed of their speech, finding that slow speech signals an expansive regulatory scope."
