    "measured_by": "Computational models of discounting",
    "justification": "Sensitivity to delay can be measured in individuals using computational models of discounting, as described in studies by Green et al. (1996, 1994) that demonstrate the value of delayed rewards based on individuals' tendencies to be patient or impatient."

    "topic_or_construct": "Effort-based decision making",
    "measured_by": "Effort-discounting parameter",
    "justification": "Various experimental paradigms have been used to manipulate effort, and the discounting parameter in these efforts can vary in shape, capturing the impact of effort on the value of rewards. Studies like those by Bia\u0142aszek et al. (2017) and Hartmann et al. (2013) showcase how this discounting parameter measures cognitive and physical effort during decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decisions under uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Risk and ambiguity tasks",
    "justification": "Distinct subregions in the medial and orbitofrontal cortex are involved in decisions involving risk versus ambiguity, separating them within tasks that manipulate uncertain outcomes. For example, the monetary incentive delay task separately assesses risky decisions from ambiguous decisions by altering the known probabilities of uncertain options (Figure 1D)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward processing",
    "measured_by": "Monetary Incentive Delay task",
    "justification": "Studies using the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task have shown that the striatum, receiving strong input from the ventral tegmental area, is involved in anticipating reward outcomes. This is supported by the meta-analyses of brain activity during reward anticipation, receipt, and learning from outcomes across various ages."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reinforcement learning",
    "measured_by": "Basic reinforcement learning tasks (e.g., probabilistic reward association tasks)",
    "justification": "Basic reinforcement learning tasks require participants to associate their actions with outcomes like rewards or punishments to measure learning rates. These tasks, such as those used in studies by Pessiglione et al. (2006), effectively differentiate learning abilities across developmental stages."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward anticipation",
    "measured_by": "Monetary Incentive Delay task (MID)",
    "justification": "The MID task, pioneered by Knutson et al. (2000), measures neural responses during reward anticipation and delivery. It separates cue anticipation and reward feedback, allowing researchers to assess activity in the striatum and related regions during both phases."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social reward valuation",
    "measured_by": "Experimental paradigms comparing social vs. non-social outcomes",
    "justification": "Data comparing activity in brain regions like the nucleus accumbens during social versus financial outcomes indicate differences in social reward sensitivity across age groups. For instance, older adults show increased nucleus accumbens activity during social reward delivery compared to younger adults."
