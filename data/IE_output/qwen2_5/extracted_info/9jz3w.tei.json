    "justification": "The Sj\u00f8r prototype was designed to facilitate TSA by enabling crew members to mark points of interest (POIs) for collaborators, which supports sharing of situation awareness information. The feature of marking POI pins for collaborators was found useful for communication, facilitating TSA as mentioned in the qualitative results of the study."

    "justification": "The study\u2019s qualitative results indicated that participants perceived the Sj\u00f8r prototype as a tool to enhance SA by making information more accessible and reducing head-down time. This is achieved through functions like POI pins of vessels and sea markers, which support SA of vessels and navigational aids respectively."

    "measured_by": "Sj\u00f8r prototype",
    "justification": "The Sj\u00f8r prototype supports TDM by facilitating communication about SA. Participants used the prototype to communicate SA to build TSA, either through multiple AR users or by cross-referencing with conventional ship navigation systems. This demonstrates that the prototype\u2019s features contribute to TDM."

    "justification": "For multiple crew members using AR, the crosshair and marking of pins were found useful for pointing and sharing SA, enhancing communication within the team. This indicates the Sj\u00f8r prototype promotes better communication in maritime settings."
