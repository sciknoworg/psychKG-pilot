    "justification": "The article states that 'Impulsive action is the first subdomain of neurocognitive impulsivity, associated with deficits in rapid response inhibition. It is usually measured by Stop Signal Tasks (SST) involving cancellation of an already initiated motor response (i.e., action cancellation).'"
