    "justification": "The STRAIN is an interview-based system that quantifies major stressors individuals experience over their lifetimes. It assesses various stressor types across different life domains and calculates total lifetime stressor count and severity, as used in this study for assessing stress exposure."

    "measured_by": "Economic decision-making paradigm (ambiguous lottery choices)",
    "justification": "The study used an experimental economic decision-making task where participants chose between certain and uncertain outcomes. Ambiguity was manipulated by occluding winning probabilities, making the probability of winning partially unknown. This method quantifies participants' tolerance for ambiguity, independent of risk."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "Economic decision-making paradigm (risky lottery choices)",
    "justification": "The economic decision-making task included risky lottery options where the probability of winning different amounts was explicitly known. Participants' choices between certain and risky options provided a measure of their risk preference."
