    "measured_by": "HEXACO Assessment of Personality",
    "justification": "The paper used the six-factor HEXACO assessment to measure personality traits, including Honesty-Humility, which is specifically linked to unselfishness (values and behaviors related to seeking personal gain at others' expense). High levels of Honesty-Humility were found to best distinguish real-world extraordinary altruists from typical adults, highlighting their unselfish nature."

    "topic_or_construct": "Unselfish Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Social Discounting Task",
    "justification": "The social discounting task was employed to assess the subjective value of resources for others versus the self across varying social distances. Results showed that altruists discounted less than controls, indicating a greater willingness to forgo resources for others, thus reflecting unselfish decision-making patterns."

    "topic_or_construct": "Empathy",
    "measured_by": "Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)",
    "justification": "The IRI was used to measure self-reported empathy. Although prior research often linked self-reported empathy to altruism, this study found that empathy measures like Empathic Concern did not distinguish altruists from controls, suggesting it may not be as central to unselfish behavior as Honesty-Humility."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Taking and Risk Perception",
    "measured_by": "Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT)",
    "justification": "The DOSPERT scale assessed risk-taking tendencies and perceptions across various domains. However, these measures did not significantly differentiate altruists from controls, suggesting that unselfish traits rather than risk-taking tendencies better characterize extraordinary altruists."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Psychopathy",
    "measured_by": "Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Short Form (PPI-SF)",
    "justification": "The PPI-SF was administered to assess psychopathy traits. The study indicated that traits related to psychopathy do not distinguish altruists from controls, further supporting that unselfish traits like Honesty-Humility are more relevant characteristics of altruists."
