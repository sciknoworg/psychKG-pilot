    "measured_by": "State-Trait Anxiety Inventory trait scale (STAI-T)",
    "justification": "The STAI-T, while primarily reflecting negative affect, was used alongside the STICSA-T to assess various dimensions of trait anxiety. It is a widely used trait anxiety measure with high internal consistency."

    "measured_by": "State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety trait scale (STICSA-T)",
    "justification": "The cognitve subscale of STICSA-T was used to measure the cognitive dimension of anxiety, which includes symptoms associated with thought processes such as rumination and worry."

    "measured_by": "Two-armed Bandit Task",
    "justification": "The study employed a two-armed bandit task with varying volatility and uncertainty to measure directed exploration, which involves favoring uncertain options to gain information."

    "topic_or_construct": "Random Exploration",
    "measured_by": "Two-armed Bandit Task",
    "justification": "The two-armed bandit task was also used to measure random exploration, reflecting increased choice stochasticity when facing high total uncertainty."

    "justification": "Participants' self-report reward predictions and confidence ratings were used to estimate their subjective relative uncertainty, which was found to be underestimated in those high in trait somatic anxiety."
