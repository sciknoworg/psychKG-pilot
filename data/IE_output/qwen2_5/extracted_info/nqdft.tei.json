    "justification": "According to the passage, 'To measure decision-making styles, we used Scott and Bruce (1995) General Decision Making Style (GDMS) scale that assesses five different decision-making styles: rational, intuitive, avoidant, spontaneous and dependent.' This indicates that the GDMS is specifically designed to measure the decision-making styles discussed in the article."
