    "topic_or_construct": "Sampling biases on optimal stopping tasks",
    "measured_by": "Bayesian ideal observer model",
    "justification": "The study uses the Bayesian ideal observer model to compare participants' sampling behaviors, highlighting whether they oversample or undersample compared to the model's predictions, particularly in different task conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Ability to choose the best option in sequences (optimal stopping)",
    "measured_by": "Number of samples before choice",
    "justification": "The key dependent variable used in the studies is the number of samples before choice, which reflects participants' behavior in deciding when to stop sampling new options and commit to a decision."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective value of options",
    "measured_by": "Attractiveness ratings",
    "justification": "In Pilot Study 2 and the 'full' condition of the Main Study, participants rated the attractiveness of smartphone prices on a scale from 1 to 100, helping to measure their subjective value of the options."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Objective value distribution learning",
    "measured_by": "Rating phase",
    "justification": "Participants' subjective values were measured via a rating phase, as seen in Pilot Study 2 and the 'full' condition, enabling the model to use these to update its prior distribution and better understand participants' decision-making process."
