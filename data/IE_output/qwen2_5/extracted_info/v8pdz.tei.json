    "measured_by": "Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)",
    "justification": "The Non-reactivity facet of the FFMQ was found to be related to Stroop performance. Specifically, participants with high Non-reactivity scores tended to have slower reaction times overall on the Stroop task."

    "measured_by": "Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS)",
    "justification": "MAAS scores were negatively correlated with the Self-reported Inappropriate Negotiation Strategies Scale (SINS) and positively correlated with insight problem-solving, reflecting broader aspects of mindfulness including ethical decision-making and problem-solving."

    "topic_or_construct": "Insight problem-solving",
    "measured_by": "Insight problems from Schooler, Ohlsson, & Brooks (1993)",
    "justification": "Insight problem-solving was correlated with certain mindfulness facets, as demonstrated by the positive correlation with the MAAS and specific FFMQ subscales."

    "justification": "Decentering, measured by the Experiences Questionnaire, was found to mediate the relationship between mindfulness facets and psychological health measures such as stress, anxiety, and depression."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceptual accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Temporal judgment task",
    "justification": "Perceptual accuracy was assessed via a temporal judgment task, and significant correlations were observed between task performance and certain mindfulness facets, such as the Observing facet."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive control",
    "measured_by": "Stroop task",
    "justification": "Cognitive control was assessed through the Stroop task, which measured reaction times that were then analyzed in relation to specific mindfulness facets, particularly Non-reactivity and Observing."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Problem-solving",
    "measured_by": "Non-insight and insight problems",
    "justification": "Different aspects of problem-solving were assessed using non-insight and insight problems. The study found specific mindfulness facets to be related to these types of problem-solving."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Ethical decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported Inappropriate Negotiation Strategies Scale (SINS)",
    "justification": "The SINS scale was used to measure willingness to use unethical negotiation strategies, showing correlations with mindfulness facets such as Acting with Awareness."
