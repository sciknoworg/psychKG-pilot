    "justification": "The study utilized the dots task, a perceptual task that creates a conflict between accuracy and profit maximization. It assesses accuracy violations, which is a proxy for behaviors such as lying and cheating."

    "measured_by": "repeated decision tasks",
    "justification": "Research findings indicate that choice behavior is more sensitive to the frequency of experienced outcomes than their magnitude. The repeated decision-making tasks in the study demonstrate this through participants' reactions to enforcement strategies."

    "topic_or_construct": "self-maintenance theory",
    "measured_by": "behavioral ethics tasks",
    "justification": "Findings in behavioral ethics, including the utilized dots task, support that individuals engage in certain mechanisms to maintain their sense of morality even when committing violations, which aligns with self-maintenance theory."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "economic perspective on enforcement",
    "measured_by": "experimental economics studies",
    "justification": "The economic perspective, as tested in experimental economics studies, uses cost-benefit analysis to predict behaviors where expected utility affects the decision to commit violations."
