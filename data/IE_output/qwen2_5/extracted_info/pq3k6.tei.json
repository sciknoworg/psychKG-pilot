    "measured_by": "Positive and negative frames in goal framing scenarios (adapted breast self-exam scenario)",
    "justification": "Participants were exposed to goal framing scenarios adapted from Meyerowitz and Chaiken's breast self-exam scenario, allowing researchers to measure variations in framing effects by age."

    "topic_or_construct": "Framing effect",
    "measured_by": "Positive and negative frames in risky choice framing scenarios (variation of Asian Disease Problem)",
    "justification": "Researchers utilized a variation of Tversky and Kahneman's Asian Disease Problem to evaluate risky choice framing effects across different age groups."

    "topic_or_construct": "Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST)",
    "measured_by": "Positive and negative frames across the age span",
    "justification": "The SST was addressed through the framing effects observed, with older adults prioritizing positive information to align with their present-oriented goals, as manifested in responses to various framing types."

    "measured_by": "Participants' responses to framed scenarios as age changes",
    "justification": "The dual-process model was explored through participants' willingness to accept a riskier option in negative frames as they aged, influenced by both affective and deliberative systems."
