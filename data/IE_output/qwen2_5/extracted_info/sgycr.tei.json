    "measured_by": "Viewing Time and Delay Interactions",
    "justification": "The study investigates how the time spent viewing visual information and the time it is retained jointly impact VWM performance, showing an interaction between viewing time and delay where performance deteriorates more slowly following longer viewing times in a naturalistic VWM task."

    "measured_by": "Copying Task",
    "justification": "The experiment utilized a copying task, which included recreating an arrangement of items by dragging and dropping them into a workspace. This task allowed participants to freely choose their viewing times and delays, aiding in measuring naturalistic VWM performance."

    "measured_by": "Continuous Color Report Task",
    "justification": "Experiment 2A and reanalysis of Donkin et al. (2015) employed a continuous color report task with fixed presentation times and delays to measure the precision of VWM representations, showing that precision increased with longer presentation times but did not show the same interaction effect found in naturalistic tasks."
