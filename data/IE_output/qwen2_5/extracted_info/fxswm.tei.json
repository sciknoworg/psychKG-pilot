    "topic_or_construct": "Overprecision",
    "measured_by": "Confidence intervals",
    "justification": "The text mentions that researchers commonly assess overprecision by comparing confidence intervals with actual accuracy. It states that when participants offered 80% confidence intervals around forecasts, those forecasts included the truth less often than expected, indicating overprecision."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Overprecision",
    "measured_by": "Item-confidence judgments",
    "justification": "The paper describes how item-confidence judgments, where participants estimate the probability of selecting the correct answer from options, have been used in various studies. These judgments are intuitive for participants but can reveal overprecision in their confidence levels."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Overprecision",
    "measured_by": "Histogram elicitation method",
    "justification": "The study notes that histogram methods, where participants estimate the likelihood of each bin in a histogram, have shown to produce better-calibrated judgments than confidence intervals. However, it also demonstrates overprecision when using this method."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Overprecision",
    "measured_by": "Response to asymmetric payoffs",
    "justification": "In the paper, a method involving asymmetric penalties for errors in estimation is discussed. Participant responses were less influenced by these incentives than expected, implying overprecision in their confidence levels."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Overprecision",
    "measured_by": "Probability distributions over bins",
    "justification": "Study 1 in the paper assesses overprecision by having participants estimate probabilities over bins of equal size. The difference between peak confidence and mean hit rate is calculated as a measure of overprecision."

    "justification": "The overprecision of the AI system Watson in the game show Jeopardy is analyzed using its recorded confidence levels and accuracy rates, revealing significant overprecision in its judgments."
