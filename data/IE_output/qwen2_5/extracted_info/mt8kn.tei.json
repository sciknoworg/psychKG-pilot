    "justification": "The Disgust Scale includes items relevant to physical contagion beliefs, such as the reluctance to drink soup stirred by a used flyswatter, indicating its use as a tool to measure physical contagion sensitivity. (Haidt et al., 1994; Olatunji et al., 2007; Rozin et al., 1984)"

    "justification": "The authors developed a new 12-item SCS Scale specifically to measure spiritual contagion sensitivity, confirming its three-factor structure related to negative, positive, and neutral spiritual contagion components. This measure was validated through various studies and comparison with existing measures. (Studies 1-3 in the paper)"

    "justification": "A short-form (3-item) version of the SCS scale was also developed for more efficient use in research settings, demonstrating similar utility and predictive validity as the full 12-item scale. (Table 5, developmental studies)"
