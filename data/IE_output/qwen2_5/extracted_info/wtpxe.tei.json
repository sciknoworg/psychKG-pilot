    "measured_by": "Bayesian decision-making model",
    "justification": "The study used a Bayesian decision-making model to evaluate participants' performance in a temporal decision-making task involving different gain functions. The model incorporates timing and spatial variance to assess risk sensitivity and optimality."

    "topic_or_construct": "risk sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Relative Optimality (RO)",
    "justification": "Risk sensitivity in participants\u2019 decision-making was studied using Relative Optimality (RO), which is the observed mean point divided by the optimal point. The researchers used this metric to assess whether participants achieved optimal performance in different risk conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "adaptive risk-return control",
    "measured_by": "adjustments in movement direction at each trial",
    "justification": "Participants were able to adjust the shape of the gain function (i.e., movement direction) in a trial-by-trial fashion, which forms part of adaptive risk-return control. Changes in the movement direction were tracked to understand how they compensated for timing variance."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "performance optimality",
    "measured_by": "Optimal timing response and movement direction",
    "justification": "The study measured performance optimality by determining the optimal timing response (`t opt`) and optimal movement direction (`r opt`) for each participant in various experimental conditions. This was used to evaluate how closely participants' decisions matched the Bayesian model's predictions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "risk-seeking vs. risk-averse behavior",
    "measured_by": "Difference between mean observed timing response and optimal timing response",
    "justification": "Risk-seeking and risk-averse behaviors were differentiated by comparing participants\u2019 mean observed timing responses to the optimal timing responses. Positive differences in risk-after and negative differences in risk-before conditions were used to determine the risk preferences."
