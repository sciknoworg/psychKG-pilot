    "justification": "The Reason factor was strongly positively correlated with Rationalism from the Epistemic Orientation Short Scale (Palma et al., 2018) in Study 2, indicating that those trusting reason also scored high on rationalism."

    "justification": "The Intuition factor was strongly positively correlated with Intuitionism from the Epistemic Orientation Short Scale (Palma et al., 2018) in Study 2, showing convergent validity between these constructs."

    "measured_by": "Empiricism from Epistemic Orientation Short Scale",
    "justification": "Scores on the Personal Experience factor showed moderate correlation with Empiricism from the Epistemic Orientation Short Scale (Palma et al., 2018) in Study 2, suggesting that reliance on personal experience relates to valuing empiricism to some extent, though the measure\u2019s precision for this factor remains a challenge."

    "measured_by": "HEXACO Openness to Experience Scale",
    "justification": "The Culture factor was moderately correlated with the HEXACO Openness to Experience Scale (Ashton & Lee, 2009) in Study 2, suggesting that individuals who trust cultural knowledge also tend to be open to new experiences."

    "measured_by": "Epistemic Pluralism Scale",
    "justification": "Scores on the Foundations of Knowledge Questionnaire, particularly Reason, Personal Experience, Culture, and Intuition, correlated positively with the Epistemic Pluralism Scale, indicating that those who value multiple foundations also tend to embrace epistemic pluralism."
