    "topic_or_construct": "Acute stress effects on decision-making performance",
    "measured_by": "Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and knapsack decision task (KDT)",
    "justification": "The study used the TSST to induce acute stress and the KDT as a complex decision task to assess performance. The TSST is a reliable method for inducing stress, and the KDT measures decision-making quality and time across varying levels of computational hardness."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cortisol levels as a biological marker of stress",
    "measured_by": "Salivary cortisol samples",
    "justification": "Cortisol levels were measured through salivary samples collected at various time points post-stressor. This biological measure is a key indicator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation, which is a primary physiological response to stress."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective stress and affect levels",
    "measured_by": "Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), self-reported stress scale",
    "justification": "The PANAS and a self-reported stress scale were used to assess participants' subjective experiences of stress and affect. These instruments are commonly used to quantify subjective states and their changes under stress."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Sympathetic nervous system activation during stress",
    "measured_by": "Skin conductance level (SCL)",
    "justification": "Skin conductance was measured as an indicator of sympathetic nervous system activity. It is a physiological measure that typically increases in response to acute stressors, providing insight into the stress response."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attention and gaze behavior",
    "measured_by": "Eye-tracking measures",
    "justification": "Eye-tracking data were collected to analyze participants' attention and gaze behavior. Measures such as items attended to, dwell time per visit, and visit rate helped to understand how stress affects visual attention allocation during decision-making."
