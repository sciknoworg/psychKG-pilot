    "justification": "The researchers used 5-trial adjusting probability tasks adapted to ethical outcomes by exchanging monetary amounts for ethical consequences such as compliance with personal morals and ethics. This method was chosen for its efficiency in obtaining an indifference point that can be used to generate a rate of ethical probability discounting."

    "measured_by": "probability matching task",
    "justification": "The study employed a probability matching task involving four, 10-trial blocks where participants could choose between options with varying probabilities. This task isolated the influence of probability on choice and allowed researchers to analyze parameters such as sensitivity and bias in the context of ethical decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "ethical theory preference",
    "measured_by": "multiple-stimulus-without-replacement (MSWO) preference assessment",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to rank five ethical theories from most-to-least important using a modified MSWO procedure. This method allowed researchers to determine participants' a priori preferences for ethical theories, providing insight into the principles guiding their ethical behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "probability discounting of monetary outcomes",
    "measured_by": "5-trial adjusting probability tasks",
    "justification": "For monetary outcomes, the 5-trial adjusting probability tasks involved choices between hypothetical monetary amounts, with probabilities adjusted between trials to determine participants' discounting rates for both gains and losses."
