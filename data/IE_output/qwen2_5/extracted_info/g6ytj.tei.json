    "topic_or_construct": "Visual Search Efficiency",
    "measured_by": "Gaze Transition Entropy",
    "justification": "Entropy measures the randomness of eye movements and indicates whether the performer is performing a structured or random search pattern. Lower entropy values suggest a more efficient search due to a more systematic scan pattern."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Gaze Control Effectiveness",
    "measured_by": "Fixation Duration and Search Rate",
    "justification": "Fixation duration and search rate were used as metrics where longer fixation durations and lower search rates are typically associated with a more efficient and expert-like use of gaze, indicating better gaze control."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Structured Visual Search",
    "measured_by": "Percentage of Antipersistent Saccades",
    "justification": "Lower percentage of antipersistent saccades suggests fewer return saccades, indicating a more structured and efficient visual search strategy, aligned with exemplary performance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Search Strategy Adherence",
    "measured_by": "Search Order Met",
    "justification": "This measure evaluates whether participants adhered to a systematic search pattern by checking the proportion of trials where participants focused on the back wall before other corners, exemplifying trained search order."

    "topic_or_construct": "Task Performance Metrics in VR Room Clearance",
    "measured_by": "Failures to Inhibit Fire, Time to Shoot All Hostiles, Proportion of Hostiles Cleared",
    "justification": "These performance measures assess the participants' accuracy and decision-making capabilities, reflecting their overall effectiveness in executing the room clearance task in a virtual environment."

    "topic_or_construct": "Eye Movement Control and Learning",
    "measured_by": "Feed-forward Eye Movement Training (FFEMT) and Feed-back Eye Movement Training (FBEMT)",
    "justification": "These training methods were used to assess how observing expert gaze strategies (FFEMT) or playback of one\u2019s own gaze movements (FBEMT) affects the improvement of visual search and decision-making skills."
