    "measured_by": "Diffusion Decision Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The authors used the Diffusion Decision Model (DDM) to analyze how non-decision time, starting point, and drift rate contribute to the gaze cueing effect, suggesting these parameters reflect underlying cognitive mechanisms of the effect (see Introduction and Method sections)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Attentional Orienting",
    "measured_by": "Non-decision Time in DDM",
    "justification": "The study shows that non-decision time in the DDM tends to be the parameter providing the best account for the gaze cueing effect, indicating an early reflexive shift of attention towards the gazed-at location (see General Discussion)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Resource Allocation",
    "measured_by": "Starting Point in DDM",
    "justification": "The starting point parameter in the DDM suggests short-lived allocation of information processing resources to the cued location, as some participants showed fits better with this component (see Results and Discussion section)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Sustained Information Processing",
    "measured_by": "Drift Rate in DDM",
    "justification": "Analysis shows less support for drift rate as a viable model component, implying that there is little evidence for a sustained influence on information processing driven by gaze cues (see General Discussion and Results for Data Sets)."
