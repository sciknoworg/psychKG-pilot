    "justification": "The study utilizes self-reports of guilt and embarrassment as indicators of psychological states post-transgression, and decision-making attributes such as monetary compensation and probability of video contact to infer approach-avoidance motivations. The temporal dynamics of these motivations are analyzed using participant choice trajectories and mouse-tracking data."

    "topic_or_construct": "Interpersonal transgressions",
    "measured_by": "Customized experimental paradigm",
    "justification": "The study employs a proactive experimental task designed to induce different levels of guilt and responsibility in participants by varying the scenarios where they cause harm to another player ('victim'). The paradigm includes decisions about monetary compensation and social avoidance to measure the transgressors' reactions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Guilt and embarrassment levels",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported ratings after each trial",
    "justification": "Participants rate their feelings of guilt and embarrassment on a scale from 0 to 10 following each trial of the social transgression task, allowing quantification of the emotional states of the transgressors."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision processing dynamics",
    "measured_by": "Mouse tracking and computational modeling",
    "justification": "The temporal dynamics of decision-making attributes (monetary compensation and contact avoidance) were analyzed using the horizontal velocity of the mouse movement, totaling 100 time bins per trial. Computational models including event-related time points (ESTPs) further quantify processing speed and prioritization."
