    "topic_or_construct": "perception of food healthiness",
    "measured_by": "ratings on characteristics and perceived healthiness",
    "justification": "The study uses a psychometric paradigm where respondents rate food products on various characteristics (e.g., fat content, sugar content, etc.) and overall healthiness. These ratings provide insight into how people perceive the healthiness of foods based on different attributes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive representations of food products",
    "measured_by": "principal component analysis (PCA)",
    "justification": "PCA was applied to the aggregated ratings of food products on various characteristics to identify the key dimensions that structure respondents' cognitive representations of food products, such as 'naturalness,' 'animal protein,' 'energy,' and 'refined carbs.'"
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "developmental differences in food perception",
    "measured_by": "comparison of adolescents, adults, and experts",
    "justification": "The authors directly compare the cognitive representations and healthiness judgments of adolescents, adults, and nutrition experts. This comparison reveals developmental differences, particularly that adolescents have less nuanced perceptions of food healthiness compared to adults and experts."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "association between food characteristics and healthiness judgments",
    "measured_by": "mixed-effects regression",
    "justification": "Mixed-effects regression analyses were used to predict individuals' healthiness judgments based on the principal component scores derived from the cognitive representations of food products. This helped identify which attributes most strongly\u5f71\u54cdhealthiness perceptions across different groups."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "group differences in perception patterns",
    "measured_by": "3-way principal component analysis (3MPCA)",
    "justification": "3MPCA was employed to analyze individual differences within adolescents, adults, and experts in their perceptions of food products. This method revealed unique patterns and variations in how each group structures their food-related cognitive representations."
