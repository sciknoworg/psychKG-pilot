    "topic_or_construct": "Reinforcement learning behaviors",
    "measured_by": "Empirical studies utilizing EMA and ADO-based decision-making tasks",
    "justification": "The paper notes that EMA and adaptive design optimization (ADO) techniques can predict future smoking behavior and changes in computational markers like ambiguity aversion and delay discounting, highlighting their role in assessing reinforcement learning behaviors over time."
