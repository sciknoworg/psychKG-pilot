    "measured_by": "Simplified multiple price list task designed for adolescents",
    "justification": "The paper uses a truck task, a simplified version of the Coller and Williams (1999) multiple price list task, to measure time preferences. This task involves decisions between receiving a smaller amount of money sooner (e.g., \u20ac10 tomorrow) or a larger amount later (e.g., \u20ac10 + x one week later). The simplified task makes it more understandable for adolescents, capturing their time preference behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Preferences",
    "measured_by": "Simplified Holt-Laury (2002) lottery task",
    "justification": "Risk preferences are measured using a gumball machine representation of a lottery task based on Holt and Laury (2002). It involves six decisions between a riskless option and a risky option with varying probabilities, adapted to be easier for teenagers to understand. The task assesses their willingness to take risks by choosing between lotteries with different payoffs and probabilities."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Abilities",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) adapted for teenagers",
    "justification": "The CRT test measures cognitive abilities, particularly focusing on reflective thinking to avoid intuitive responses. Adolescents answer three questions that require deeper cognitive processing to understand the correct answers. High scores in CRT are linked to more sophisticated time and risk preferences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Probability Understanding",
    "measured_by": "Probability knowledge test (adapted from Delavande and Kohler, 2009)",
    "justification": "This test evaluates students' understanding of probability through a series of questions about the likelihood of an event. The results show that higher accuracy in this test correlates with more sophisticated economic preferences, indicating the importance of cognitive skills in adolescents' decision-making processes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social Network Effects on Economic Preferences",
    "measured_by": "Average preferences of friends (friendsAP for time, friendsAR for risk)",
    "justification": "The study computes the average patience (friendsAP) and risk preferences (friendsAR) of each subject's friends within their classroom network. These measures demonstrate social contagion, where an adolescent's preferences are influenced by their friends' average preferences, suggesting that social networks play a role in the formation of economic preferences."
