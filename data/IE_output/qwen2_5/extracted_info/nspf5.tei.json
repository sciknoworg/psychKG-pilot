    "justification": "The study applies the RL-DDM approach to quantify learning and decision dynamics in methamphetamine users, using parameters such as positive and negative learning rates (\u03b7+ and \u03b7-), drift rate (v), and decision thresholds (a) to explain group differences in cognitive processes."

    "measured_by": "Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS)",
    "justification": "The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale is used to measure impulsivity; higher scores indicate greater impulsivity, with this scale applied to correlate impulsivity with decision-making and learning parameters."
