    "justification": "The study employs the iterated Ultimatum Game to investigate dyadic interactions and expressions of reciprocity. This game allows players to adapt and express their reactions to the opponent's behavior over multiple rounds, enabling the measurement of reciprocal tendencies as players strive for a desirable outcome."

    "justification": "The study uses an adapted reciprocity model to estimate round-by-round expected utility (EU), incorporating the degree of reciprocity shown by each interactant. This model allows for the quantification of utility evaluations influenced by a player's reaction to their opponent's prior behavior, reflecting reciprocal interactions."

    "measured_by": "Ultimatum Game (UG) Results",
    "justification": "The Ultimatum Game's design (both one-shot and iterated) facilitates the measurement of responses to offers that reflect inequity aversion, where players reject offers they deem unfair. Neuroimaging results (e.g., activity in aMCC and AI) indicate brain regions implicated in subjective fairness evaluations and social information processing."
