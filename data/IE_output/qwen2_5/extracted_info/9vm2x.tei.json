    "measured_by": "Repeated-choice gambling task",
    "justification": "The paper describes a repeated-choice gambling task where participants choose between safe and risky options, providing a structured environment to study how individuals learn and make decisions under uncertainty. The specific choices and feedback from this task are used to measure constructs related to learning and decision-making processes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Environmental Representation and Hypothesis Generation",
    "measured_by": "Sequence generation task",
    "justification": "In both experiments, participants were asked to generate sequences of outcomes after completing the repeated choice task. This task measures how participants represent the temporal structure of the task and forms hypotheses about its underlying patterns."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal Structure Perception",
    "measured_by": "Hazard Rate Calculation",
    "justification": "The hazard rate derived from participants' generated sequences is used as a measure of their temporal expectation about the outcomes. This reflects their perceived temporal structure of the task, specifically their expectations about when bad outcomes might occur."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Preference",
    "measured_by": "Proportion of Risky Choices",
    "justification": "The proportion of risky choices made by participants in the repeated-choice gamble is used to measure risk preference. This indicates how participants weigh the potential rewards and losses associated with their decision-making under uncertainty."
