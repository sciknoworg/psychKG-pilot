    "justification": "Participants reported their momentary subjective affect using an Affective Slider on a bipolar scale ranging from 'extremely unhappy' to 'extremely happy', providing a measure of their emotional state following decision feedback."

    "measured_by": "Computational Model Calculations",
    "justification": "Reward prediction errors were calculated as the difference between the actual reward and the expected value of a chosen card, fit within a hierarchical Bayesian computational model to assess their influence on subjective affect."

    "topic_or_construct": "Outcome Amount (Gain/Loss)",
    "measured_by": "Task Reward Points",
    "justification": "The gain or loss of points from the chosen card in the risky choice task was directly measured and used as an appraisal variable to determine its impact on participants' subjective affect."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Outcome Control",
    "measured_by": "Free-Choice vs. Forced-Choice Trials",
    "justification": "Whether participants freely chose an option or had a card randomly chosen for them by a 'dealer' in the task served as a measure of participants' perceived control over the outcomes, examining how this moderated the effects of RPEs on affect."

    "topic_or_construct": "Counterfactual Feedback",
    "measured_by": "Presence/Absence of Unchosen Option Outcomes",
    "justification": "The presentation or absence of information regarding the unchosen card's outcome during trials manipulated counterfactual feedback to determine its effects on subjective affect and the modulation of RPE effects."
