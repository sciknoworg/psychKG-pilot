    "measured_by": "Preference strength ratings scale (-30 to +30 for Experiment 1 and -10 to +10 for Experiment 2)",
    "justification": "The preference strength ratings are used to analyze the strength of preference ratings over time as participants considered gift card pairs (Experiment 1) and monetary gambles (Experiment 2). The results indicate oscillations in preference strength, depending on whether participants made a choice or not prior to the preference rating."

    "measured_by": "Choice and no-choice conditions experimentation",
    "justification": "The article compares choice and no-choice experimental conditions, where participants either selected a preferred option or performed an unrelated motor response. This comparison was used to explore how making a choice affects subsequent preference ratings, revealing that choice stabilizes preferences and reduces oscillation amplitude."

    "measured_by": "Open system model combining Markov and quantum components",
    "justification": "The open system model incorporates both classical Markov and quantum walk properties to describe epistemic uncertainty in preference states and ontic uncertainty within decision-makers. This hybrid approach better accounted for the oscillatory patterns observed in preference and diverging preference evolution post-choice."

    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal preference pattern",
    "measured_by": "Polynomial regression and Gaussian process regression",
    "justification": "To analyze temporal patterns in preference strength, polynomial regression and Gaussian process regression were employed. These statistical techniques provided insights into how preferences evolved over time, revealing oscillatory patterns and differences between choice and no-choice conditions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Preference evaluation",
    "measured_by": "Pairwise preference ratings task",
    "justification": "Participants rated their preference between pairs of gift cards and monetary gambles on a scale, which was used to assess how preference ratings changed depending on whether or not they first made a decision between the options."
