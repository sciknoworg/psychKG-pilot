    "justification": "The article proposes using Signal Detection Theory (SDT) to study unfairness detection, especially in the context of AI-based systems. SDT helps in quantifying how effectively humans can detect unfairness by disentangling sensitivity and response bias, ultimately aiming to enhance the fairness of AI systems."

    "measured_by": "Signal Detection Theory (SDT)",
    "justification": "SDT is presented as a framework for measuring error detection in AI-based systems. The theory uses measures of sensitivity and response bias to analyze human performance in detecting errors, thereby promoting better human-AI collaboration."

    "measured_by": "Error Detection Metrics through SDT",
    "justification": "The effectiveness of human oversight over AI systems hinges on accurate error detection. SDT metrics like sensitivity (d') and response bias (c) provide a way to measure and understand how humans detect errors, supporting effective oversight."
