    "justification": "The paper measures the influence of cumulative earnings on risk-taking at a global timescale, considering it as a component of temporal context. The cumulative earnings are quantified relative to expectations to understand their impact on risk-taking behavior. (See model 4a and the corresponding analysis)"

    "measured_by": "Skin Conductance Responses (SCRs)",
    "justification": "Skin conductance responses were used as an objective measure of physiological arousal. The study analyzed SCRs to outcomes and during the decision phase to explore connections between arousal and temporal context effects in risky decision-making. (Procedure and Skin conductance responses section)"

    "measured_by": "Outcome amounts on the previous trial",
    "justification": "The influence of previous trial outcomes is measured by including `outcomet-1` in the regression models, capturing the immediate feedback context on subsequent risky choices. This temporal effect was shown in models 2 and 3a. (Risk-taking section)"

    "topic_or_construct": "Neighborhood timescale context effects",
    "measured_by": "Positive and negative shifts in expected value of runs",
    "justification": "The neighborhood context is operationalized through changes in the expected value of trial runs. The positive and negative shifts were analyzed to determine their impact on risk-taking behavior, as explained in models 3a-c. (Task and Risk-taking section)"
