    "justification": "The paper proposes the use of DAF detection methods, specifically the generalized Mantel-Haenszel test, generalized logistic regression (GLR), and regularized group regression (rgDAF), to assess whether an algorithm functions differently across subgroups defined by protected variables. These methods are described for integrating the concept of intersectionality within the DAF framework."

    "measured_by": "Interactive DAF",
    "justification": "The paper introduces the concept of interactive DAF to evaluate how protected variables interact to influence algorithmic decision-making across intersectional subgroups. This is achieved by measuring whether an algorithm's functioning varies depending on different levels of one protected variable after accounting for another."

    "justification": "The paper suggests that regularized group regression with group MCP or SCAD penalties is particularly useful for detecting subtypes of DAF, including interactive DAF, under certain conditions, thereby facilitating the assessment of fairness."

    "justification": "The paper uses the GLR method to distinguish between different subtypes of DAF, such as uniform, nonuniform, and interactive DAF, by employing specific test statistics (GLR UNI, GLR NUNI, GLR INT) to detect these patterns in algorithmic decision-making."
