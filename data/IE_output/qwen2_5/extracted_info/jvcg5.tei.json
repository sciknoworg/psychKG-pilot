    "justification": "The Decoy task was designed to examine the existence of the attraction effect and its strength, as well as the influence of the decoy's location in value distance on the strength of the attraction effect. Subjects made choices between lotteries in a Basic condition, a Decoy condition, and Filler conditions, with the observed choice proportions used to measure the attraction effect."

    "measured_by": "Gestalt Task",
    "justification": "The Gestalt task aimed to measure each subject's threshold for differentiating between two stimuli, based on the Gestalt law of proximity. Participants judged whether two sets of dots were identical or different, and the threshold for discriminating between stimuli was calculated, serving as a measure of their sensitivity to physical proximity."
