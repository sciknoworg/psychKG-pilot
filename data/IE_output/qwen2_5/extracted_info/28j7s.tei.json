    "justification": "The article discusses that the late posterior positivity (LPP) is proposed as an electrophysiological marker of recollection-based recognition because its amplitude is larger when an item is recognized with high confidence compared to when it is not."

    "topic_or_construct": "recollection-based memory",
    "measured_by": "Late Posterior Positivity (LPP)",
    "justification": "The text mentions that the LPP's sensitivity to memory confidence and source memory makes it a candidate to index recollection-based memory, though it may also reflect decision-making processes."

    "topic_or_construct": "mnemonic decision confidence",
    "measured_by": "Late Posterior Positivity (LPP)",
    "justification": "The study found that the LPP dynamics are sensitive to both recollection-based memory and the evidence accumulation process for recognition decisions, with the LPP amplitude scaling with subjective confidence irrespective of memory signal presence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "evidence accumulation for mnemonic decisions",
    "measured_by": "Late Posterior Positivity (LPP)",
    "justification": "The research indicates that the LPP tracks the dynamics of mnemonic decision, with its amplitude building up to a threshold reached at the time of the recognition decision, similar to the centro-parietal positivity (CPP) in perceptual decisions."
