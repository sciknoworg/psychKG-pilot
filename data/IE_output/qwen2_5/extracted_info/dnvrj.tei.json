    "topic_or_construct": " Cognitive Control",
    "measured_by": "Stroop, Eriksen flanker, and Simon tasks",
    "justification": "The paper describes that cognitive control is measured using tasks like the Stroop, Eriksen flanker, or Simon task, where the best course of action is unambiguous, but choosing requires engaging control processes to suppress automatic tendencies."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value-Based Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Choice between gambles, food items, or consumer goods",
    "justification": "The paper highlights that value-based decision-making is studied using experimental paradigms requiring participants to choose between various options like gambles, food items, or consumer goods, necessitating the weighing of relevant costs and benefits."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Goal-Driven Attention in Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive control tasks like Stroop or flanker tasks",
    "justification": "The integration of cognitive control insights into decision-making research has provided ways to consider how the parameters of the decision process are adjusted, including which neural circuits, such as those involved in Stroop or flanker tasks, underlie analogous control adjustments."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice-Related Neural Activity",
    "measured_by": "BOLD (Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent) fMRI activity",
    "justification": "The note mentions the use of BOLD fMRI activity to measure correlates of choice value within specific brain regions like the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum, reflecting choice adjustments based on task goals or participant instructions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Threshold Adjustment",
    "measured_by": "Tasks with predetermined decision bounds and varying outcome uncertainty",
    "justification": "The paper describes how decision thresholds are measured and influenced in studies using tasks with set decision bounds, observing how factors like time limits or reward rates can alter the threshold for decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Performance Monitoring Processes",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive conflict tasks and monitoring paradigms",
    "justification": "Performance monitoring during decision-making is explored using conflict tasks and monitoring paradigms, showing how signals like uncertainty and confidence are dynamically updated based on the decision process and used for future decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Value and Option Appraisal",
    "measured_by": "Neural activity across ventral and dorsal value networks",
    "justification": "The dissociation between goal-directed choice processing and overall value appraisal is measured by neural activity in ventral and dorsal regions of thevaluation network, respectively, showing differing responses to task requirements."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Strategy Adjustments",
    "measured_by": "Experimental tasks that manipulate option set sizes and contexts",
    "justification": "Adjustments in choice strategies are measured using tasks that alter the number of choices available or the decision context, revealing how individuals strategically adjust their decision processes based on context."
