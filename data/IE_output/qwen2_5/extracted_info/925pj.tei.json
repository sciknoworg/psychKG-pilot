    "measured_by": "Token-reinforcement system",
    "justification": "The paper discusses using a token-reinforcement system where subjects (both pigeons and humans) made risky choices based on the number of tokens received, which determines the final reward. This system was used to measure and compare risk preferences across high-value and low-value choices."

    "measured_by": "Colour-coded choices",
    "justification": "In the experiments, pigeons and humans were given choices between different coloured circles or panels that corresponded to varying levels of rewards and risks. Their selection of these colours was used to assess their risk preference for high-value versus low-value options."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Aversion to Zero Outcomes",
    "measured_by": "Choice between options with zero or non-zero outcomes",
    "justification": "The experiments manipulated the presence of zero (no reward) outcomes in the choice options to determine whether pigeons or humans showed altered risk preferences in avoiding zero options. Differences in choices were analyzed when zero outcomes were or were not present."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Extreme Outcome Rule Sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Catch trials with or without low-extreme outcomes",
    "justification": "Catch trials incorporated choices with and without low extreme values to observe if humans and pigeons overweighted these extreme outcomes. The results provided insight into which species were more affected by the extreme values in their choice behavior."
