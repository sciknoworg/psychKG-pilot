    "topic_or_construct": "Adolescent self and identity development",
    "measured_by": "Functional neuroimaging studies (e.g., fMRI)",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how self-evaluation processes in adolescence, involving explicit reflection on traits and attributes, have been studied using fMRI. These studies reveal increased activation in the vmPFC and rostral/perigenual ACC during self-evaluations compared to evaluating others."

    "topic_or_construct": "Value-based decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Computational and neural processes",
    "justification": "The value-based decision-making model is described as involving a dynamic integration of diverse gains and costs represented in the brain, with a focus on vmPFC activity. The model considers the role of various value inputs, including self-related values, in adolescent decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Relational identity processes",
    "measured_by": "Self-reference effect in memory studies",
    "justification": "The paper mentions cross-sectional studies focusing on the self-reference effect in memory, which show increasing activity in the rostral/perigenual ACC across ages during self versus other evaluations. This highlights the neural correlates of self-evaluation in adolescence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Self-consciousness and social self-evaluation",
    "measured_by": "Neural response studies (e.g., VS activity)",
    "justification": "Adolescents' greater concern with others' perceptions of the self is linked to neural activity in the ventral striatum (VS) during direct and indirect self-evaluations, such as thinking about what peers think of their social abilities."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Development of self-evaluation and identity",
    "measured_by": "Longitudinal fMRI studies",
    "justification": "The paper cites a longitudinal fMRI study examining children at age 10 and 13, which observed stable responses in rostral/perigenual ACC during self-evaluations over time, indicating developmental changes in neural correlates of self-evaluative processes."
