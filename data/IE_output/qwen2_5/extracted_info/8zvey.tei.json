    "measured_by": "Eye tracking data and choice/response time measures",
    "justification": "Eye tracking data served as a proxy for selective attention, while choice/response time data provided insights into decision-making processes. The interplay among selective attention, learning, and memory was critically assessed through these measures, enabling the researchers to examine how attention influenced decision making and learning dynamics."

    "measured_by": "Fully Constrained by Representation computational model",
    "justification": "The Fully Constrained by Representation model was used to infer participants' learned dimension relevance from their gaze patterns during the task. This model linked attentional focus, representations of dimension relevance, and decision-making behavior, reflecting how participants learned to prioritize different dimensions for categorization decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attention Traps",
    "measured_by": "Simulated Fixation Proportions and Accuracy Data",
    "justification": "Simulations showed that participants initially overestimated the relevance of moderately goal-relevant dimensions, leading to attention traps. This was measured by analyzing the fixation proportions and accuracy levels, highlighting the traps through deviations from optimal attentional focus."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Representation Traps",
    "measured_by": "Simulated Fixation Proportions and Accuracy Data",
    "justification": "The study identified representation traps when participants learned relevance patterns that became less accurate in changed environments. This was analyzed using simulated fixation proportions and accuracy during phases of the experiment where dimension relevance was altered."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Dynamic Updating of Representations",
    "measured_by": "Computational Model Updates Post-Feedback",
    "justification": "The model tracked how participants' internal representations of dimensions evolved with feedback. The evolution of these representations, constrained by eye fixation data, was directly tied to the model's updating mechanism after corrective feedback."
