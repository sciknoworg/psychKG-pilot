    "measured_by": "Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The DDM is used to deconfound observed variables of speed and accuracy in decision-making tasks, allowing the recovery of generating parameters (drift rate and decision boundary), which can help isolate participant sensitivity from SATOs (such as in Ratcliff & McKoon's findings that accuracy better reflects drift rate than response time)."

    "measured_by": "Efficiency Scores",
    "justification": "Efficiency scores are calculated by dividing search time by search accuracy in visual search tasks, although the authors caution against their use due to assuming a linear relation between speed and accuracy, which contradicts the curvilinear relationship found in explicit SATO characterizations."

    "measured_by": "Balanced Integration Score (BIS)",
    "justification": "Liesefeld and Janczyk advocate for the BIS as an alternative to linear correction methods sensitive to SATOs, noting that combining speed and accuracy remains a complex problem, especially in the presence of SATOs."

    "measured_by": "EZ-DDM (EZ model)",
    "justification": "The EZ-DDM is employed in simulations for its computational efficiency and demonstrated performance matching the full DDM in several situations, making it a practical alternative for assessing participant drift parameters despite simpler assumptions."
