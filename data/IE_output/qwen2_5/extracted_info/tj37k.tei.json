    "measured_by": "Behavioral data and fMRI activation patterns",
    "justification": "The study analyzed participants' gambling choices and associated fMRI activation patterns in response to positive and negative emotional feedbacks presented in both L1 and L2, providing insights into how languages influence access to emotions during decision-making."

    "measured_by": "Oxford Placement Test (OPT)",
    "justification": "Participants' language proficiency in L2 was assessed using the Oxford Placement Test (OPT), which consists of 25 multiple-choice questions and a cloze test to evaluate their English language skills."

    "measured_by": "Gambling task feedback processing and neural activation",
    "justification": "The study employed a Gambling task with emotionally valenced feedback words presented in L1 and L2, combined with fMRI measurements, to examine how emotional processing differs in the first and second languages."
