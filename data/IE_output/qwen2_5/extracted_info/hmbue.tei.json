    "justification": "The study by Hutcherson et al. (2015) examined decisions about different allocations of monetary rewards between oneself and an anonymous partner and found that choice behavior and reaction times were well-captured by the Multi-attribute Drift-Diffusion Model, indicating its use as a measurement tool for this construct."

    "justification": "Hsu et al. (2008) investigated decision-making between donation plans to children in Uganda and found that the dorsal striatum encoded information about efficiency while the insula encoded information about inequity, demonstrating how these areas can be used to measure different aspects of the construct."

    "justification": "Studies by Christopoulos & King-Casas (2015), Lockwood et al. (2016), and Sul et al. (2015) showed that the ventral striatum tracks reward prediction errors when learning for others, while prediction errors specific to others were found in the thalamus/caudate, vmPFC, and sgACC, illustrating how these brain regions can be used as measurement instruments."

    "measured_by": "self-reported leadership scores",
    "justification": "Edelson et al. (2018) found that in a decision-making task involving leadership, patterns of connectivity among brain regions encoding task-relevant variables predicted leadership decisions and self-reported leadership scores, indicating the use of these scores as a measurement tool for social preference."

    "justification": "Suzuki et al. (2015) and Fukuda et al. (2019) utilized functional connectivity analysis to examine how multiple computational variables are integrated in brain regions like the posterior dACC and vmPFC during social decision-making, showing how this analytical method serves as a measurement tool for understanding integration processes."
