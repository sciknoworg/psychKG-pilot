    "measured_by": "Bayesian mean tracker (BMT)",
    "justification": "The BMT is used as a reinforcement learning (RL) model to estimate expected rewards and associated uncertainties, updating based on prediction errors. This model tracks how participants balance exploration and exploitation strategies during decision-making tasks under varying time pressures."

    "measured_by": "Softmax choice model",
    "justification": "The softmax model is used to predict choice probabilities based on expected rewards, uncertainties, and a stickiness bonus. It helps analyze how value-directed and uncertainty-directed behaviors are influenced by time pressure."

    "measured_by": "Bayesian mixed effects regression",
    "justification": "RTs are influenced by reward expectations and uncertainties. Bayesian mixed effects regression is applied to understand how these factors and time pressure affect the speed of decisions."

    "measured_by": "Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) model",
    "justification": "The LBA model estimates decision thresholds and drift rates to analyze how evidence accumulates for each option under time pressure. It reveals how time pressure impacts the processing speed and thresholds for decision-making."
