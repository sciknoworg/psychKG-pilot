    "measured_by": "Inverted Y-shaped tube task",
    "justification": "In Experiments 1-3, the study used the inverted Y-shaped tube task to assess children's ability to plan for mutually exclusive future outcomes, requiring them to cover both openings to catch a marble dropped into the tube's top opening. The task measures understanding of possible future events and actions needed to prepare for those outcomes."

    "measured_by": "Marble-catching action observation trials in Experiment 1",
    "justification": "The video-based action observation trials presented actors using optimal and suboptimal strategies to catch marbles from the inverted Y-shaped tube. Children\u2019s recognition of the optimal strategy, despite not performing it, indicates their ability to represent possible actions under uncertain future possibilities."

    "measured_by": "Marble Catch trials in Experiment 2 (Intervention condition)",
    "justification": "Children who watched video demonstrators using optimal and suboptimal marble-catching strategies themselves used the optimal strategy at higher rates compared to those without demonstration. This demonstrates the role of action observation in influencing children's selection of appropriate actions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Over-imitation and action relevance understanding",
    "measured_by": "Parallel tubes task in Experiment 3",
    "justification": "Children who chose the actor demonstrating the optimal coverage strategy did not over-imitate this strategy in a context where it wasn\u2019t relevant (parallel tube task). This indicates that children could distinguish the optimal strategy\u2019s relevance based on the context."
