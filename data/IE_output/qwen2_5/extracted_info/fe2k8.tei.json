    "topic_or_construct": "cognates",
    "measured_by": "semantic relatedness judgement task",
    "justification": "The semantic relatedness task requires participants to judge whether a pair of words is semantically related, which accesses the shared meaning representation of cognates across languages. This is shown by no significant difference in processing speed between cognates and English controls."

    "topic_or_construct": "interlingual homographs",
    "measured_by": "semantic relatedness judgement task",
    "justification": "The task demonstrated an interlingual homograph inhibition effect, where participants responded more slowly and made more errors when processing interlingual homographs compared to English controls. This indicates challenging semantic access due to language competition."

    "measured_by": "semantic relatedness task with priming in one language",
    "justification": "Exposure to a cognate in one language influences subsequent processing in the other language, supporting the shared representation hypothesis. However, the effect was weaker than expected, suggesting that priming was facilitative but subtler than hypothesized."

    "justification": "Primed interlingual homographs showed a subtle disruptive effect, reinforcing the notion of shared orthographic representation and separate semantic representations causing lexical-semantic competition."
