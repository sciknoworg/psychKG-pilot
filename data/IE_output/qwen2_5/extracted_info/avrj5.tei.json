    "justification": "The article describes experiments where participants were asked to imagine performing harmful actions and rate their justification and affect. The reported likelihood of performing the harmful actions increased when participants imagined them as morally justified and felt better about it, supporting the connection between episodic simulation and moral judgment."

    "topic_or_construct": "moral justification of harm",
    "measured_by": "ratings of moral justification",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to rate how morally justified they believed the harmful behavior was on a scale. The degree of reported justification moderated the effect of imagining performing harm on reported likelihood of harming, highlighting the role of moral justification in the simulation process."

    "topic_or_construct": "affective response to imagined harmful actions",
    "measured_by": "affect ratings after episodic simulations",
    "justification": "Participants reported their affective response on a Likert scale after imagining harmful behaviors. The improvement in affect when imagining morally justified harms mediated the effect on reported likelihood of performing harm, indicating that positive affect is a key mechanism."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "simulation vividness of harmful actions",
    "measured_by": "ratings of scene vividness and detail",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to generate detailed simulated scenarios and rate their vividness. The vividness of imagined scenes was found to correlate with the reported likelihood of performing the harm, particularly for justified harms, suggesting that detailed simulations can increase the perceived likelihood of performing harm."
