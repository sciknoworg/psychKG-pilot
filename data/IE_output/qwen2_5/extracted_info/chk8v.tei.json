    "measured_by": "Cognitive Effort Discounting paradigm (Cog-ED)",
    "justification": "The study utilized the Cog-ED to assess participants' decisions between high-effort, high-reward and low-effort, low-reward options across two distinct cognitive domains (working memory and speech comprehension). This paradigm was employed to examine the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive effort-based decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Difficulty",
    "measured_by": "Proximity metric and GAM contrast",
    "justification": "Decision difficulty was measured using a proximity metric as a trial-by-trial index of subjective value differences between choices. Additionally, a pre-registered GLM with GAM contrasts was used to compare 'hard' vs. 'easy' trials based on decision difficulty."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value Comparison in Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Proximity metric and multilevel modeling",
    "justification": "Value comparison was examined through the proximity metric, which reflects the relative subjective value of choice options, and via multilevel modeling to assess how changes in the relative value influenced decision-making and brain activity in regions like dACC and dmPFC."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Domain-General Cognitive Effort Costs",
    "measured_by": "Task-specific subjective value estimates",
    "justification": "The study found that individual differences in cognitive effort costs were highly correlated across working memory and speech comprehension domains, supporting a domain-general mechanism."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Generalized linear mixed effect models",
    "justification": "Models were used to predict choice behavior based on variables like relative subjective value, task load, domain, and reaction time. This captured the degree of preference for high-effort options and guided analysis of how these preferences related to brain activity."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Brain Activity in dACC during valuation and decision phases",
    "measured_by": "fMRI BOLD activity and model estimates",
    "justification": "Activity in the dACC region was assessed via fMRI BOLD signals during valuation and decision-making phases. The analysis showed that dACC activity was inversely related to the value of the high-effort option, indicating its role in value comparison."
