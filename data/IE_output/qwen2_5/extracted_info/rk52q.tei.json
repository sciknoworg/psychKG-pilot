    "justification": "The study applies RL models to assess how participants adjust their beliefs about bandit values based on biased feedback from different sources. The accuracy of debiasing is quantified using model parameters and simulated participant behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive biases related to source bias learning",
    "measured_by": "Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model",
    "justification": "SDT is employed to model participants' classification of sources as positive, neutral, or negative, alongside quantifying sensitivity and bias parameters which reveal variations in perception and classification accuracy over phases."

    "topic_or_construct": "classification of information source biases",
    "measured_by": "source rating tasks with confidence ratings",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to classify sources as underestimating, around, or overestimating the true value, alongside providing confidence ratings, allowing assessment of their explicit source bias awareness."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "learning rate in debiasing",
    "measured_by": "differences in learning rate parameters from Phase 1 to Phase 2",
    "justification": "The learning rate in the RL models varies between Phases 1 and 2, allowing the study to assess cognitive resource allocation and prioritization between learning biases and bandit values."

    "topic_or_construct": "contrastive classification effects in neutral source perception",
    "measured_by": "ordinal multinomial logistic regression model",
    "justification": "This model quantifies how the pairing of a neutral source with a highly biased source influences participants' classification of the neutral source, indicating cognitive mechanisms for source bias classification."

    "topic_or_construct": "systematic undercorrection of biased feedback",
    "measured_by": "mean debias parameters estimated from RL models",
    "justification": "The estimated debias parameters reveal that participants undercorrect negative and overcorrect positive biases, indicating limitations in their ability to perfectly debias information."
