    "measured_by": "Trust_willingness_scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated their willingness to trust the robot to perform tasks involving objects such as cleaning, doing laundry, watering plants, cooking, and handling valuables, capturing the construct of trust in the care of inanimate objects. The items were composited into a measure with strong internal consistency (\u03b1 = .87)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Trust in Care of Agents",
    "measured_by": "Trust_willingness_scale",
    "justification": "Participants reported their degree of willingness to trust the robot to care for different types of living agents, including pets, elderly people, teenagers, young children, and infants, generating a composite measure of Trust in Care of Agents (\u03b1 = .90). This measure directly assesses trust in the robot's ability to care for living beings."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Trust in Care of Information",
    "measured_by": "Trust_willingness_scale",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to report their willingness to trust the robot to care for sensitive personal information such as bank account details, credit and debit card numbers, online passwords, and healthcare-related information. This resulted in a measure of Trust in Care of Information with high internal consistency (\u03b1 = .97)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Robot Likability",
    "measured_by": "Likability_appraisal_scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated their appraisals of the robot's likability with items like 'The robot seems friendly' and 'I like this robot,' which were correlated (r = .71), forming a measure of perceived likability. Likability was shown to be positively associated with trust in various domains involving living agents."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Robot Intelligence",
    "measured_by": "Intelligence_appraisal_scale",
    "justification": "Intelligence appraisals were measured using items such as 'The robot seems intelligent' and 'The robot seems responsible,' with a moderate correlation observed (r = .74). Participants\u2019 appraisals of robot intelligence were positively associated with trust in care of objects and information."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Robot Aliveness",
    "measured_by": "Aliveness_appraisal_scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated the robot's perceived aliveness using items like 'The robot seems conscious' and 'The robot seems alive,' which were highly correlated (r = .83). These ratings were positively associated with trust in the care of living agents, possibly reflecting intuitive attributions of life-like qualities."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Robot Nurturance",
    "measured_by": "Nurturance_appraisal_scale",
    "justification": "Nurturance was measured using items like 'The robot seems nurturing' and 'The robot seems warm.' Strongly correlated items (r = .77) were used to form an overall measure of perceived nurturance, relevant for gender presentation effects not observed in this study."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Perfect Automation Schema (PAS)",
    "measured_by": "PAS_scale",
    "justification": "Individual differences in beliefs regarding the performance of automated systems were measured using a two-dimensional PAS scale, including High Expectations in automated systems (PAS-HE) and All-or-None beliefs regarding performance errors (PAS-AN). High PAS-HE scores were associated with greater trust in robot care outcomes."
