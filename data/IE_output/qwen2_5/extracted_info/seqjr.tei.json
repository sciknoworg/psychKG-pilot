    "justification": "The article uses the Weight of Advice (WoA) as a metric to quantify how much an individual shifts their estimate towards the advice given. This is measured as a proportion of the difference between their original estimate and the advice, providing a precise way to assess advice integration during decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Egocentric discounting",
    "measured_by": "Weight of Advice (WoA)",
    "justification": "Egocentric discounting is evaluated using the Weight of Advice (WoA), indicating the degree to which people favor their own judgment over external advice. The observed WoA is compared to the optimal WoA to show how participants underweight advice, reflecting egocentric discounting."

    "measured_by": "Relative Favorability model",
    "justification": "The Relative Favorability model is used to determine how people adjust their advice integration based on the perceived relevance and quality of information from different perspectives. It indicates that participants are capable of assessing and integrating advice based on its favorability relative to their own viewpoints."

    "measured_by": "Mean Absolute Error (MAE)",
    "justification": "The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is calculated as the absolute difference between the participants' estimates and the true number of objects in the jar. This measure is used to assess participants' estimation accuracy from different viewing angles and perspectives."
