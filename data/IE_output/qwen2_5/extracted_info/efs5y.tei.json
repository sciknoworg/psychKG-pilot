    "justification": "Participants rated the welfare (better off, worse off, or same) of buyers, sellers, and traders in various exchange scenarios. The measures were on a scale from -5 (worse than before) to +5 (better than before), capturing perceptions of win-lose, win-win, or neutral outcomes of transactions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Win-win denial",
    "measured_by": "Proportion of transactions perceived as win-win",
    "justification": "The study assessed the percentage of transactions participants perceived as benefiting both parties (win-win), neither party (zero-sum), or one party at the expense of the other (win-lose). This measurement validated whether participants acknowledged mutual gains in economic exchanges."

    "topic_or_construct": "Mercantilist thinking",
    "measured_by": "Comparison of welfare ratings in money-frame vs. time-frame conditions",
    "justification": "Mercantilist thinking was measured by comparing participants' assessments of buyer and seller welfare in transactions described in monetary terms versus time-based terms. The difference in win-win denial between these frames indicated reliance on mercantilist value intuitions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Theory of mind limitations",
    "measured_by": "Impact of providing reasons or cues for buyers' preferences",
    "justification": "The influence of giving participants empty or content reasons for buyers' choices was assessed on the perception of transaction benefits. Results showed that cues prompting consideration of buyers' mental states mitigated win-win denial."

    "measured_by": "Effect of varying price levels on ratings of buyer and seller welfare",
    "justification": "Manipulating the price of goods influenced participants' judgments of who benefited from transactions. Participants substituted the question of welfare for a heuristic of whether the buyer got a good deal."
