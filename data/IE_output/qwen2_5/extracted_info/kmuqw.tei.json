  {
    "topic_or_construct": "social influence in decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Bayesian aggregation model",
    "justification": "The researchers use a Bayesian aggregation model to compare participants' confidence changes against normatively prescribed confidence changes, revealing biases in social information processing."

    "topic_or_construct": "social information distortion",
    "measured_by": "inverted Bayes theorem",
    "justification": "The inverted Bayes theorem is applied to infer participants' perceived social information, demonstrating a self-serving bias in how participants interpret and use their partners' opinions."
