    "measured_by": "Full-frequency Partial Directed Coherence (ffPDC)",
    "justification": "The study utilized ffPDC features derived from EEG data as the input to a CNN model to distinguish between participants with MDD and healthy controls, achieving an F1-Score of 0.815. The high performance suggests that ffPDC effectively captures relevant biomarkers for MDD classification in children and adolescents."

    "measured_by": "Power Spectral Density (PSD)",
    "justification": "The research explored differences in relative PSD across various frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma) between individuals with MDD and healthy controls. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between the groups in specific brain regions and frequency bands, indicating that changes in PSD can be useful in identifying MDD-related neurophysiological markers."

    "measured_by": "Resting-State Functional Connectivity",
    "justification": "The study employed MVARICA modeling to estimate functional connectivity among different brain regions using resting-state EEG data. This approach revealed distinct connectivity patterns in MDD patients compared to healthy controls, such as stronger low-frequency brain connections between frontal and temporal areas, which align with typical symptoms of depression like rumination and cognitive difficulties."

    "measured_by": "Regions of Interest (ROI) analysis",
    "justification": "By analyzing the importance of various ROIs using methods such as Integrated Gradients and Permutation Feature Importance, the study found that the Center and OL ROIs showed stronger connectivity in MDD participants, while the FR ROI was more prominent in healthy controls. This ROI-based analysis revealed key brain regions involved in the pathology of MDD."
