    "measured_by": "self-report measures",
    "justification": "The paper indicates that the primary measures used to study SWB have been self-reports, based on existing literature like Diener et al. (1985, 2010, 2018) and Pavot et al. (1991). These references support that self-report instruments are the standard approach used in prior SWB research."

    "topic_or_construct": "precision of prior beliefs over states",
    "measured_by": "experimental paradigms measuring perceptual belief precision and sensory precision estimates",
    "justification": "The text discusses how these paradigms can quantify individual differences in precision of prior beliefs and sensory precision, exploring their links to computational phenotypes. However, it notes that no studies have specifically employed them with SWB measures in social decision tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "learning rates and forgetting rates",
    "measured_by": "perceptual learning tasks and multi-arm bandit tasks",
    "justification": "Studies using these tasks often examine these rates (e.g., healthy participants show faster learning rates for losses in substance use disorders compared to controls). They are crucial for examining how learning rates influence SWB."

    "topic_or_construct": "expected free energy precision",
    "measured_by": "limited offer (risk-taking) tasks and approach-avoidance conflict tasks",
    "justification": "These tasks have been utilized to examine uncertainty and decision-related precision, which may have implications for SWB. However, a direct link to SWB remains to be explored."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "information-seeking and preference precision",
    "measured_by": "explore-exploit and multi-arm bandit tasks",
    "justification": "The paper suggests these tasks have only very recently been used to examine preference precision and information-seeking drives. Theoretical connections to SWB exist but have not been empirically assessed."

    "topic_or_construct": "planning horizon and decision tree pruning",
    "measured_by": "multi-step planning tasks",
    "justification": "Stated as potential tools for examining mechanisms relevant to SWB, but no direct studies connecting these tasks' outcomes to SWB measures are mentioned."

    "topic_or_construct": "granular state spaces (emotion concept specificity)",
    "measured_by": "conditioned perception tasks and interoceptive inference tasks",
    "justification": "These are suggested as means to measure granularity but are noted not to have been developed for studying SWB. The text anticipates their future development drawing on existing methods."
