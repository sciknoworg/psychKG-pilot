    "measured_by": "Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) parameters",
    "justification": "The study utilized the Hierarchical Drift-Diffusion Modelling (HDDM) package to estimate parameters like drift rate, decision threshold, and non-decision time from choice and RT data in a stop-signal task, indicating how decision-making processes are measured."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Drift rate",
    "measured_by": "HDDM estimated from stop-signal task",
    "justification": "Drift rate, representing the rate of evidence accumulation, was estimated using the HDDM model from the subjects' accuracy and reaction times in the stop-signal task, allowing for the assessment of decision-making efficiency."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision threshold",
    "measured_by": "HDDM estimated from stop-signal task",
    "justification": "The decision threshold, reflecting response caution, was estimated from the stop-signal task data using the HDDM model, providing insights into cautiousness in decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Non-decision time",
    "measured_by": "HDDM estimated from stop-signal task",
    "justification": "Non-decision time, including perceptual and motor processes, was also estimated through the HDDM model applied to the stop-signal task, offering a measure of task unrelated time."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attention problems",
    "measured_by": "Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) attention problems subscale",
    "justification": "Parent-reported attention problems were measured using the attention problems subscale of the CBCL, which consists of 10 items rated on a three-point Likert scale, indicating the degree of attention issues."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Sex differences",
    "measured_by": "Analysis of HDDM parameters across sexes",
    "justification": "The study conducted multigroup analyses to explore sex differences in DDM parameters, finding that females had higher baseline scores and males showed higher variances in some parameters."
