    "justification": "The Quadratic Q-Weighted model, discovered using SINDy, captures participants' estimation of reward probability in a learning task. It demonstrates systematic distortion in estimating probability, with underestimation of high probabilities and overestimation of low probabilities, reflecting human behavior in probabilistic learning."

    "justification": "The Quadratic Q-Weighted model, replacing the Rescorla-Wagner model in decision datasets, provided significantly better fit in eight out of nine datasets. This suggests improved accuracy in predicting reward weighting behavior in complex decision-making tasks."

    "measured_by": "Simulation using Quadratic Q-Weighted model",
    "justification": "The Quadratic Q-Weighted model predicts an asymptotic bias in the estimation of true probability, particularly noting that participants tend to underestimate probabilities when they are high and overestimate when they are low, which is validated through simulations and empirical data."

    "justification": "_linear mixed effects models were used to analyze how changes in participants' expectations were influenced by rewards and their distance from the stable point (\u221a(a/b)). These models further validate the predictions made by the Quadratic Q-Weighted model regarding behavioral dynamics in probabilistic learning."
