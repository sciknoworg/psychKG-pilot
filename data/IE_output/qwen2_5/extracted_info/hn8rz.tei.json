    "measured_by": "estimation tasks with large quantities",
    "justification": "The underestimation bias, defined as the tendency to underestimate large quantities, was measured through estimation tasks involving various large quantities such as numerosity, population sizes, pricing, etc. Participants provided initial estimates and then re-evaluated them after receiving social information from others, demonstrating this bias across multiple estimation contexts."

    "topic_or_construct": "sensitivity to social influence",
    "measured_by": "sensitivity parameter S in model",
    "justification": "The sensitivity to social influence was quantified by the parameter S, representing the weight subjects assign to social information in revising their estimates. The formula X_s = (1 - S)X_p + SM was used, where X_s is the second estimate, X_p is the personal estimate, and M is the mean log estimate of social information. This S parameter captures how much subjects rely on social cues."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "distance effect",
    "measured_by": "distance D = M - X_p",
    "justification": "The distance effect was measured by the linear dependence of sensitivity to social influence (S) on the distance D between the personal estimate X_p and the average social information M. The greater the distance, the more heavily the social information was weighted in decision-making, supported by empirical data fitting this relationship."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "asymmetry effect",
    "measured_by": "difference in weights for D > 0 and D < 0",
    "justification": "The asymmetry effect was quantified by comparing the weights given to social information when the average social information M was higher (D > 0) or lower (D < 0) than the personal estimate X_p. Results showed that higher social information was weighted more heavily, demonstrating the asymmetric use of social cues."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "similarity effect",
    "measured_by": "average dispersion of estimates received",
    "justification": "The similarity effect was measured by observing how participants' sensitivity to social influence decreased as the dispersion of the social information increased. This was demonstrated through a linear relationship between the sensitivity parameter S and the dispersion h\u03c3i of the estimates received."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "herding effect",
    "measured_by": "convergence of estimates after social information",
    "justification": "The herding effect was demonstrated by the convergence of estimates after sharing social information. As participants were influenced by others' estimates, their own evaluations shifted toward the central tendency of the group, narrowing the distribution of estimates and improving accuracy."
