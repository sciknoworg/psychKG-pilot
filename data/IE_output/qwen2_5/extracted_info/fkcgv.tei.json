    "measured_by": "Mouse-tracking",
    "justification": "Mouse-tracking is used to capture the action dynamics in intertemporal decision making, revealing participants' cognitive processing over time as they choose between soon-small and late-large options. The study evaluates the influence of different design factors of the mouse-tracking paradigm on the measured cognitive effects, indicating that cognitive effects in value-based decision making are highly sensitive to the setup of the mouse-tracking paradigm."

    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal discounting",
    "measured_by": "Choice behavior (proportion of LL choices)",
    "justification": "The temporal discounting effect is measured by observing the proportion of late-large (LL) choices as a function of the interval between soon-small (SS) and late-large (LL) options. The study finds a significant temporal discounting effect, where participants prefer sooner rewards over larger later rewards, demonstrating how choice behavior reveals temporal discounting."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive effects (discrete movement measures)",
    "measured_by": "Average deviation (AD) of mouse trajectories",
    "justification": "Discrete cognitive effects are assessed using the average deviation (AD) of mouse trajectories from a notional line between starting and ending points. The study finds that these discrete movement measures are sensitive to the static vs. dynamic starting procedures, affecting the consistency and directionality of mouse movements during decision tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive effects (continuous movement measures)",
    "measured_by": "Time-continuous multiple regression (TCMR) analysis",
    "justification": "Continuous movement measures are evaluated using TCMR analysis on trajectory angles. The study reveals that the continuous measures of mouse dynamics, specifically the beta weights predicting trajectory angle, are highly sensitive to variations in the starting procedure, with less robust effects seen in static compared to dynamic starting procedures."
