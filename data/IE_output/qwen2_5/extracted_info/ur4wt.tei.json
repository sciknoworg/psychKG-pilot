    "justification": "Participants were asked to attribute quiz score variance to individual differences versus quiz difficulty. The over-attribution to individual differences tested the representativeness heuristic's influence on judgments."

    "justification": "The explicit condition informed participants about the difficulty of the quizzes, testing how well they adjust their judgments from the initial anchor information provided by quiz scores."
