    "justification": "The article discusses the computation of perceptual sensitivity using the signal detection theoretic parameter d', derived from hit rate and false alarm rate, indicating its role in measuring how well participants can distinguish between different stimuli."

    "measured_by": "signal detection theory parameter c",
    "justification": "The response criterion, represented as the parameter c in signal detection theory, is used to measure the internal bias of participants' responses, helping to assess whether feedback affects their strategy."

    "measured_by": "meta-d'",
    "justification": "The metacognitive sensitivity is quantified using the measure meta-d', a signal detection theory-based parameter that describes the relationship between confidence ratings and the accuracy of perceptual decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "metacognitive bias",
    "measured_by": "correlation between d' and average confidence",
    "justification": "Metacognitive bias is assessed by analyzing the Pearson's correlation between perceptual sensitivity (d') and the average confidence ratings, revealing how well an individual's confidence is calibrated with their performance."
