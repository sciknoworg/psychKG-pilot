    "measured_by": "Brier Score",
    "justification": "The text explains that Brier scoring was used to assess the accuracy of forecasts made by intelligence analysts in the MEA division and other divisions. It quantifies forecasting accuracy by calculating the squared deviation between the assigned probabilities and actual outcomes. (Mandel and Barnes, 2018)"

    "measured_by": "Correct Classification Rate",
    "justification": "The correct classification rate measures the percentage of forecasts correctly predicting the direction of the event (occurring or not occurring). The study reported that 94% of forecasts were correctly classified, indicating a high level of calibration. (Mandel and Barnes, 2014)"

    "measured_by": "Normalized Discrimination Index",
    "justification": "The normalized discrimination index assesses how well forecasts discriminate between different outcomes. The study showed that 76% of the variance in outcomes was explained by the forecasts, indicating good discrimination skill. (Mandel and Barnes, 2014)"

    "topic_or_construct": "Consumer's Perspective on Forecast Accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Median Probability Equivalents",
    "justification": "To assess the accuracy from an intelligence consumer\u2019s perspective, median probability equivalents assigned by consumers to verbal probability terms used in reports were used. This re-examined forecast accuracy, yielding similar Brier scores to those from analyst\u2019s perspective. (Mandel, 2015a)"

    "measured_by": "Averaged Brier Score",
    "justification": "Individual consumers\u2019 numeric translations of verbal probabilities significantly reduced forecast accuracy compared to when these were averaged across groups. This method illustrates the variability in individual interpretations. (Mandel, Dhami et al., 2021)"
