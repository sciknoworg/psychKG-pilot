    "topic_or_construct": "confidence",
    "measured_by": "Likert scales and continuous measures",
    "justification": "The article mentions that confidence is often measured using Likert scales for discrete responses and continuous measures like magnitude estimates, reflecting participants' level of certainty in their judgments."

    "topic_or_construct": "absolute judgment tasks",
    "measured_by": "non-auditory unidimensional stimuli mapped onto discrete or continuous scales",
    "justification": "The study details absolute judgment tasks where participants map non-auditory stimuli (like line lengths or colors) onto discrete or continuous response scales, a fundamental method for measuring sensorimotor and cognitive processes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "response threshold setting",
    "measured_by": "MAAT model analysis with threshold parameters",
    "justification": "The MAAT model incorporates threshold parameters to represent how participants adjust their response criteria across different sets of discrete or continuous options, with these adjustments measured from model fits."
