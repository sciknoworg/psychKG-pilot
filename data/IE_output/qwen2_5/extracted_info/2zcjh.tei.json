    "measured_by": "Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)",
    "justification": "The PANAS was used to measure participants' self-rated positive affect, as evidenced by the phrase 'To measure participants' degree of positive affect, we used the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)'. The correlation between positive affect and prior beliefs supports the use of PANAS as a valid measure of this construct."

    "measured_by": "State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI-T)",
    "justification": "The STAI-T was employed to assess participants' degree of non-specific negative affectivity, specifically trait anxiety. This is supported by the text stating 'To measure the participants' degree of non-specific negative affectivity we used the State-Trait Anxiety Questionnaire (STAI Y-form 2)'. No significant correlation was found between trait anxiety scores and prior parameters, indicating the STAI-T is a distinct measure."

    "measured_by": "Bayesian Learner Model Parameters (\u00b50, \u03c30\u00b2)",
    "justification": "Participants' choices in the two tasks were best described by a Bayesian learner model, with parameters \u00b50 (prior mean) and \u03c30\u00b2 (prior variance) estimated from their behavior. These parameters were shown to correlate with positive affect, supporting their use as a measure of prior beliefs about action outcomes."

    "measured_by": "Behavioral Tasks (Robber Task, Factory Task)",
    "justification": "The study employed two decision-making tasks (Robber Task and Factory Task) to assess learned helplessness, as the choices made in these tasks were analyzed using a Bayesian framework. The tasks aimed to generalize expectations about controllability, central to learned helplessness."
