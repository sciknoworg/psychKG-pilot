    "measured_by": "Disease problem",
    "justification": "The disease problem, used in Tversky and Kahneman's seminal study, measures how framing influences decision-making under risk. Participants choose between options presented as gains ('saved') or losses ('die'), with different risk preferences emerging based on the framing."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Description invariance",
    "measured_by": "Framing of choice options",
    "justification": "The principle of description invariance is tested by altering the description of choice options while keeping their substantive content the same. For example, the disease problem is framed both in terms of lives saved and lives lost to see if rational subjects' choices remain consistent."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Prospect theory",
    "measured_by": "Editing and evaluation phases",
    "justification": "Prospect theory proposes that decision-makers mentally represent (edit) options as gains or losses and then evaluate them accordingly. This theory is used to measure how people's valuation of outcomes changes based on their representation as gains or losses, thereby explaining framing effects."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Framing effects",
    "measured_by": "Lower-bounded interpretation of numerical quantifiers",
    "justification": "Mandel's experiments measure framing effects through participants' interpretation of numerical quantifiers as lower-bounded, which affects their perception of risk and ultimately their decision-making in framing tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Explicated Valence Account (EVA)",
    "measured_by": "Choice of predicate expressions",
    "justification": "EVA measures framing effects by examining how the use of positive and negative predicates (e.g., 'saved' vs. 'die') influences decision-makers' perception of outcome valence and their subsequent preferences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fuzzy-trace theory",
    "measured_by": "Gist-like representations",
    "justification": "Fuzzy-trace theory measures framing effects by assessing how participants rely on gist-like representations of precise numerical information, leading to predictable choices that align with the framing."
