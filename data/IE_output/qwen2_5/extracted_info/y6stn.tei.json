    "topic_or_construct": "Information Need",
    "measured_by": "Binary Indication of Need for Further Information",
    "justification": "The study measured participants' need for further information by asking them whether they wanted additional details before making a final decision, using a binary yes/no format. This measurement was directly related to their perception of needing more information, as observed in Studies 1, 1b, and 1c."

    "topic_or_construct": "Information Search",
    "measured_by": "Amount of Information Requested",
    "justification": "The amount of information participants requested was used to measure information search. Participants were presented with snippets of information and asked to select those they wanted to read in full, providing a quantifiable measure of the amount of information they sought."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Certainty",
    "measured_by": "Likert Scale (1-11)",
    "justification": "Participants' decision certainty was measured using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 11. This scale was used to gauge participants' confidence in their preliminary and final decisions, reflecting the level of certainty they had throughout the decision-making process."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Difficulty",
    "measured_by": "Likert Scale (1-7)",
    "justification": "The perceived difficulty of making a decision was assessed via a Likert scale varying from 1 to 7. This allowed researchers to quantify how challenging participants found the decision, facilitating an exploration of its relationship with other variables such as coin outcomes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Need for Further Information",
    "measured_by": "Slider Scale (1-50)",
    "justification": "In Study 2, participants indicated their need for further information using a slider scale ranging from 1 ('little additional information') to 50 ('much more information'), enabling a continuous measure of their perceived information needs."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Practical Information Search",
    "measured_by": "Time Spent on Websites",
    "justification": "In Study 3, information search was assessed by the time participants spent on websites pertaining to the charities under consideration. This metric aimed to measure the practical application of information search in a real-world decision-making context."
