    "topic_or_construct": "Preference Change without External Reinforcement",
    "measured_by": "Mere Exposure Effect",
    "justification": "The mere exposure effect, as demonstrated by Zajonc, shows that increased familiarity with stimuli leads to greater preference for those stimuli, supporting this construct without involving external reinforcements."

    "topic_or_construct": "Preference Change without External Reinforcement",
    "measured_by": "Choice Leads to Choice Phenomenon",
    "justification": "The choice leads to choice phenomenon, rooted in Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory, demonstrates how making a choice between similar options can lead to a preference change as individuals adjust their evaluations to reduce dissonance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Preference Change without External Reinforcement",
    "measured_by": "Cue-Approach Training (CAT) Task",
    "justification": "The CAT task induces preference changes by pairing neutral cues with\u7269\u54c1 and speeded motor responses, leading to enhanced preferences for the associated items without external reinforcement, as shown in various studies."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Preference Modification via Internal Feedback",
    "measured_by": "Go/No-Go (GNG) Task",
    "justification": "The GNG task assesses response inhibition and can induce internal feedback through participants' recognition of errors or correct responses, which influences preference changes for Go items over No-Go items."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Preference Modification via Internal Feedback",
    "measured_by": "Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT)",
    "justification": "The AAT measures automatic behavioral tendencies by having participants approach or avoid stimuli. Internal feedback occurs when participants recognize errors in their approach/avoidance responses, influencing preference shifts."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Preference Modification via Internal Feedback",
    "measured_by": "Stop-Signal Task (SST)",
    "justification": "The SST involves participants inhibiting responses to a stop signal, potentially inducing internal feedback as participants recognize missed inhibitions, impacting their subsequent preferences."
