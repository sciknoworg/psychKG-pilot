    "justification": "The paper discusses that men tend to score higher on systemizing while women score higher on empathizing, using S-E scores as evidence of these cognitive differences (Greenberg et al., 2018; Archer, 2019). These scores help measure individual differences in cognitive styles oriented towards understanding systems or recognizing the mental states of others."

    "justification": "The paper highlights that men, on average, tend to score higher than women in risk-taking tasks, using standardized risk-taking measures to illustrate sex differences in attitudes towards risk (Goldsmith-Pinkham, 2019). These tasks help quantify an individual's willingness to take risks."

These assessments help differentiate between various leadership styles based on their focus and effectiveness."
