    "justification": "The article states that the signaling effect of blood glucose on delay discounting demonstrates that low blood glucose levels increase delay discounting, suggesting that blood glucose levels influence resource allocation strategies across time. (Wang and Dvorak, 2010)."

    "measured_by": "Delay discounting",
    "justification": "The study highlights that appetitive stimuli, like the scent or sight of food, increase delay discounting for caloric and monetary resources, showing that such cues affect the preference for immediate rewards. (Li, 2008)."

    "measured_by": "Intertemporal decision-making tasks",
    "justification": "Preferences in intertemporal choices are gauged by measuring delay discounting, where higher discounting rates indicate a larger devaluation of delayed rewards in tasks that present choices between sooner smaller and later larger rewards. (Frederick et al., 2002)."
