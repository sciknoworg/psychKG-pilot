    "measured_by": "generalized linear mixed model",
    "justification": "The paper uses a generalized linear mixed model with the decision to adjust or maintain a judgment as a dependent variable to test whether change probability decreases over the course of a sequential chain."

    "topic_or_construct": "Change magnitude",
    "measured_by": "linear mixed model",
    "justification": "The study employs a linear mixed model to analyze whether the magnitude of changes decreases over the course of a sequential chain by computing the absolute difference between the standardized errors of consecutive judgments."

    "topic_or_construct": "Judgment accuracy",
    "measured_by": "absolute standardized errors",
    "justification": "Judgment accuracy over the course of a sequential chain is measured using absolute standardized errors, relying on a linear mixed model to assess whether accuracy improves as judgments progress."

    "justification": "The paper compares the accuracy of sequential collaboration with unweighted averaging as a benchmark, using group estimates obtained through various aggregation methods for both conditions."
