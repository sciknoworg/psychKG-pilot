    "justification": "The IMPACT was specifically designed to measure automatic consumer appraisals on multiple product dimensions simultaneously by assessing relational processing of stimuli in a reaction-time based task. The study demonstrated its ability to capture appraisals under various conditions, such as fast SOAs, unintentional judgments, high cognitive load."

    "justification": "The paper mentions using the IAT as a comparison to the IMPACT, noting its limitations in assessing multiple attributes at once. The IAT measures associations between target and attribute categories, providing a baseline for the study's exploration of automatic appraisals."
