    "justification": "The study used WTD judgements, where participants indicated the amount of money they were willing to donate to help a certain number of children, as a measure of willingness to donate. Different asking techniques like Direct Asking (DA), Classical Unit Asking (CUA), and Sequential Unit Asking (SUA) were used to assess WTD."

    "justification": "The study varied the number of affected individuals (scope, e.g., 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc.) in combination with different asking techniques (DA, CUA, SUA) to measure scope sensitivity. Participants' WTD judgements were analyzed under different scope conditions to determine if scope sensitivity emerged."

    "measured_by": "Desire for Consistency Measure",
    "justification": "A measure was included to assess participants' desire for consistency in asking for donations. Participants were asked to self-report whether they were trying to allocate money consistently per child in larger groups. However, this measure showed no effect in the context of asking technique."

    "topic_or_construct": "Scope Sensitivity in Contingent Valuation",
    "measured_by": "Contingent Valuation Judgements",
    "justification": "Instead of donating personally, participants were asked to evaluate the amount of money needed to help children in a contingent valuation scenario (i.e., estimating needed funding rather than personal donations). This alternate method allowed examination of scope sensitivity under different conditions without budget ceilings."
