    "measured_by": "10-point Likert-type scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated the trustworthiness of the host using a 10-point Likert-type scale, with anchors '1 -Very Untrustworthy' to '10 -Very Trustworthy', indicating the use of a scale to measure this psychological construct. This approach allows for quantification of users' perceptions of trust in the context of SE platforms."

    "measured_by": "Cognitive Trust and Affective Trust measures",
    "justification": "The study mentions that while Cognitive Trust ('no doubt about this host's competence') and Affective Trust ('shared concerns would be constructively responded') were measured, the results overlapped significantly with the overall Trustworthiness measure, justifying their use in capturing distinct dimensions of trust."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reputation",
    "measured_by": "Reputation scores",
    "justification": "Reputation is implicitly measured by the inclusion of reputation scores in profile elements such as 'social media presence' and 'online market reputation.' The study investigates how these elements impact user decision-making, thus using reputation scores as a means to assess this psychological construct."

    "topic_or_construct": "Digital Identity (DI)",
    "measured_by": "UGC and platform-generated information (e.g., ratings, reviews, social profiles)",
    "justification": "The study employs user-generated content (UGC) and platform-generated information as part of the digital identity displayed on profiles. It assesses how participants utilize this information to make decisions, thereby measuring DI through the content presented on the sharing economy platform."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Binary decisions (Rent/Not Rent), ratings on decision confidence, and associated profile elements analysis",
    "justification": "Decision-making is measured through participants' binary choice to rent or not rent a room, their confidence ratings in these decisions on a 10-point scale, and analysis of the information elements they select or view when making decisions."
