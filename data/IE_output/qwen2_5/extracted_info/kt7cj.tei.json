    "justification": "The study directly assessed children's intuitive understanding of diminishing marginal utility by presenting them with scenarios involving resource decisions and measuring their predictions of others' behaviors and emotions regarding resource changes. By comparing choices between individuals with different resource quantities, the study inferred children's grasp of the concept based on their decision-making patterns."

    "topic_or_construct": "Diminishing Marginal Utility",
    "measured_by": "Children's Explanations",
    "justification": "The research also evaluated children's verbal explanations for their predictions. Coding categories like Quantity, Change, and Surplus/Deficit were used to analyze the reasoning behind their decisions, indicating their intuitive understanding or lack thereof of diminishing marginal utility principles."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Variety Preferences",
    "measured_by": "Individuals' Choices of Diverse Resources",
    "justification": "Indirect evidence for understanding diminishing marginal utility came from findings that children, like adults, prefer variety over homogeneity in resources. This preference was interpreted as possibly motivated by the notion that the value of resources diminishes as they accumulate, which aligns with diminishing marginal utility."
