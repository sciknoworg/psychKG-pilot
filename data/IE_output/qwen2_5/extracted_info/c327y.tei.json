    "topic_or_construct": "Stochastic Dominance",
    "measured_by": "Choice between Gambles",
    "justification": "The article describes a series of experiments where participants are presented with choices between gambles to measure their adherence to stochastic dominance. The preference for gambles with objectively worse outcomes despite the principle of dominance provides empirical evidence of stochastic dominance violations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Outcome Monotonicity",
    "measured_by": "Participant Responses in Choice Problems",
    "justification": "Outcome monotonicity is assessed by observing participant preferences when gambles are presented in split form, where increasing outcomes should lead to a more favorable gamble. The data suggest people satisfy this principle, as reflected in low violation rates in split forms."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Coalescing Equivalence",
    "measured_by": "Training on Splitting and Coalescing Gambles",
    "justification": "Participants' ability to recognize that gambles in split and coalesced forms are equivalent was measured through training that toggled between views of gambles. The experiment aimed to assess the impact of recognizing equivalence on stochastic dominance violations."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Procedural Invariance",
    "measured_by": "Training Animation and Toggling Frequency",
    "justification": "Procedural invariance was tested by training participants to toggle between presentations of gambles in split and coalesced forms. Toggling frequency during training was linked to a reduction in dominance violations, with more toggles associated with lower violations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Between Risky Prospects",
    "measured_by": "Binary Choice Presentations",
    "justification": "Participant preferences between risky gambles were measured through simple choice tasks. The Binary Choice Presentations were used to assess adherence to decision-making theories like Expected Utility Theory (EUT) and Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT)."
