    "topic_or_construct": "Treatment-resistant depression (TRD)",
    "measured_by": "Switching between antidepressants",
    "justification": "The paper mentions that switching between antidepressants has been widely applied as a proxy for non-response in RWD research, particularly for defining TRD. This measure is based on \u22652 switches between different antidepressant classes prescribed for an adequate duration."

    "topic_or_construct": "Treatment-resistant schizophrenia",
    "measured_by": "Clozapine use",
    "justification": "Clozapine is the only evidence-based medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and it has been widely used in research as a proxy measure for non-response or treatment resistance both using clinical data and RWD. The initiation of clozapine could indicate a lack of response to at least two other antipsychotic trials."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Lithium response in bipolar disorder",
    "measured_by": "Alda Scale",
    "justification": "Previous studies have primarily relied on the Alda Scale ('Retrospective Criteria of Long-Term Treatment Response in Research Subjects with Bipolar Disorder') to assess lithium response in bipolar disorder. This specific scale is used to determine the clinical response to lithium over time."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Treatment response for major depressive disorder (MDD)",
    "measured_by": " continua proxies like duration and dose of antidepressant treatment",
    "justification": "In some studies combining duration and dose of antidepressant treatment has been considered to define treatment-resistant depression or general antidepressant efficacy. However, these parameters can vary significantly depending on the study."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Relapse in antipsychotic treatment",
    "measured_by": "Hospitalization or emergency department visits",
    "justification": "Hospitalization or an emergency department attendance has been widely used as a proxy for relapse when using electronic health records (eHRs). This approach aims to capture severe episodes that interrupt regular antipsychotic treatment."
