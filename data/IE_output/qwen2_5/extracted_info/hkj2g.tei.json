    "justification": "The article discusses the use of the LBA model to quantify decision making strategies in the Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) task by estimating parameters like threshold, drift rate, and non-decision time. The model helps reveal underlying processes responsible for differences in performance between highly trained RAAF personnel and control students."

    "measured_by": "Sequential sampling models",
    "justification": "Sequential sampling models were employed to infer latent processes behind observed behavioral data. These models, by estimating parameters that represent different cognitive processes, help explain speed-accuracy tradeoffs and the influence of factors such as task difficulty, attention, and individual differences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Speed-accuracy trade-off",
    "measured_by": "Response time and accuracy data",
    "justification": "Response times and accuracy were directly measured from the participants\u2019 performance in the MOT task, and these data were further analyzed using sequential sampling models (like the LBA) to disentangle strategic differences in speed and accuracy trade-offs between groups."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Multiple Object Tracking ability",
    "measured_by": "MOT task accuracy and response times",
    "justification": "The MOT task directly measures participants' ability to track multiple moving objects, with accuracy (correct identification of targets) and response times serving as key performance indicators. Sequential sampling models were then applied to interpret underlying decision processes in different difficulty conditions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive workload and attentional resources",
    "measured_by": "Detection Response Task (DRT) during MOT",
    "justification": "While the DRT data were not analyzed in this study, the concurrent DRT during the MOT phase was designed to assess the participants' cognitive workload and attentional resources under task demands. This type of task is indicative of the participants\u2019 ability to manage divided attention."
