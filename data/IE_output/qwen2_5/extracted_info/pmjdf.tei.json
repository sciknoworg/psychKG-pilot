    "justification": "The paper utilized the racing diffusion model to investigate the effects of prior probability on decision processes, particularly on response thresholds, accumulation rates, and nondecision time parameters. This model allows the researchers to dissect and analyze how prior probability influences these different aspects of decision-making in an experimental task."

    "topic_or_construct": "response thresholds",
    "measured_by": "racing diffusion model parameter B",
    "justification": "The research employs the racing diffusion model, particularly focusing on the threshold parameter B, to measure the effects of prior probability on response thresholds. The parameter B is key in reflecting how response thresholds are adjusted according to the prior probability of the outcomes, as evidenced by the model's better account when B was allowed to vary with bias."

    "topic_or_construct": "response execution time",
    "measured_by": "nondecision time parameter t0 from racing diffusion model",
    "justification": "The study reveals that the nondecision time parameter t0 within the racing diffusion model effectively captures the effect of prior probability on response execution time. Consistent misfit occurred when nondecision time was not included in the model, indicating its crucial role in this aspect of the decision-making process."

    "topic_or_construct": "evidence accumulation rates",
    "measured_by": "accumulation rate parameter v in racing diffusion model",
    "justification": "The accumulation rate parameter v in the racing diffusion model was analyzed to assess the influence of prior probability on the quality of sensory evidence. However, the study suggests that prior probability did not have a convincing and consistent effect on this parameter, as shown by the Bvt0 model's overfitting and inconsistency in rate effects."
