    "justification": "The paper developed and utilized the Social Drift-Diffusion Model to understand the cognitive mechanisms behind individual decision-making during social information processing. This model was fitted to empirical data to explain how participants integrate personal and social information, capturing key dynamics such as group self-organization and decision accuracy."

    "measured_by": "Social Drift-Diffusion Model (Social DDM)",
    "justification": "The social DDM was used to estimate how individuals combined personal and social information during decision-making. The model parameters, such as personal drift rate and social drift rate, helped explain the collection and aggregation of personal and social evidence over time in dynamic social environments."

    "justification": "The Two-Stage Dynamic Signal Detection model was employed in the personal phase of the experiment. This model revealed the cognitive processes governing choice accuracy and confidence ratings, showing that participants drifted in the direction of their choices, reinforcing their initial beliefs, which was further linked to observed confidence levels."

    "topic_or_construct": "Collective Intelligence and Group Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Social Drift-Diffusion Model (Social DDM)",
    "justification": "The social DDM was used to analyze collective behavior, particularly how groups self-organize based on information quality. The model showed that confident and accurate participants tend to decide earlier, providing high-quality information for others and improving the overall accuracy of group decisions."
