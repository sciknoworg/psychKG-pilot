    "justification": "The paper utilizes a custom-designed probability-estimates beads task involving an 'urn-and-beads' design where participants estimate the probability of a hidden box based on beads drawn over a sequence. This task was developed to systematically test and validate predictions of the weighted Bayesian model of sequential base-rate neglect."

    "measured_by": "Peters Delusions Inventory (PDI)",
    "justification": "The Peters Delusions Inventory (PDI) is a 21-item questionnaire used to measure delusion-like ideas and unusual beliefs in the general population. The paper validates the relationship between interindividual variability in sequential base-rate neglect and self-reported odd beliefs via the PDI score, thereby highlighting the real-world relevance of laboratory-measured cognitive constructs."

    "measured_by": "Weighted Bayesian Belief-Updating Model",
    "justification": "The weighted Bayesian model with a prior-weight parameter (\u03c9\u2081) and likelihood-weight parameters is employed to characterize the degree of sequential base-rate neglect, showing that lower \u03c9\u2081 values are associated with stronger evidence for recency biases and prior-dependent belief updating, as predicted by the model."

    "topic_or_construct": "Prior Noise",
    "measured_by": "Noisy-Sampling Model Parameters",
    "justification": "The study uses parameters from the noisy-sampling model, such as the prior noise parameter (\u03c3\u00b2), to explain sequential base-rate neglect and its variability across individuals. Increased prior noise is linked to greater prior underweighting and variability in beliefs."

    "measured_by": "Model-Agnostic Measure of Response Variance",
    "justification": "The paper defines and measures unstructured response variance in logit space as the variance of the log-odds of probability estimates for identical sequence fragments. This measure is used to explore behavioral variability related to computational models, supporting the noisy-sampling explanation for sequential base-rate neglect."
