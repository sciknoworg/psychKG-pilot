    "topic_or_construct": "Social Thermoregulation",
    "measured_by": "Temperature Manipulation (Warm vs Cold Cup)",
    "justification": "The research describes using a warm or cold cup manipulation to study the effects of temperature on social thought processes and recollection of close others, thus measuring social thermoregulation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attachment Experiences",
    "measured_by": "Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR)",
    "justification": "The Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire (ECR) was used to measure participants' self-reported experiences with past relationships as a potential moderator of the temperature effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "Culture-Based Social Thermoregulation",
    "measured_by": "STRAQ-1 (Social Thermoregulation and Risk Avoidance Questionnaire)",
    "justification": "The STRAQ-1 was introduced to assess the desire to outsource temperature regulation and avoid social risks, providing a new tool for measuring social thermoregulation-based attachment desires."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Interpersonal Closeness Thoughts",
    "measured_by": "Inclusion of Other in Self (IOS) Scale",
    "justification": "The IOS scale was used to measure how close participants felt to the people they wrote down after the temperature manipulation, reflecting the cognitive accessibility of loved ones."

    "topic_or_construct": "Relationship Closeness Regulation",
    "measured_by": "RCR Subscale (developed from ECR)",
    "justification": "A new subscale named Relationship Closeness Regulation was derived from the ECR through data-driven exploration to better moderate the temperature-social thought relationship."
