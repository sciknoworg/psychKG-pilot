    "measured_by": "affect-based AAC task",
    "justification": "The paper describes an AAC task with visual/auditory affect-based stimuli designed to study individual differences in decision-making under conflict. The task involves participants choosing positions on a runway that represent potential positive or negative affective outcomes, the probabilities of which are explicitly communicated. This task is used to measure the underlying factors driving approach-avoidance behavior in both healthy and clinical populations."

    "topic_or_construct": "decision uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Markov decision process (MDP) model parameters",
    "justification": "The study employs an active inference MDP model to analyze the AAC task data. One estimated parameter, \u03b2, reflects the prior policy precision, which indicates the expected decision uncertainty of the participant. Higher values of \u03b2 suggest greater decision uncertainty and inconsistency in choices. This model allows for a detailed quantification of the influence of uncertainty on approach-avoidance behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "emotional conflict (expected aversiveness of negative stimuli relative to reward)",
    "measured_by": "MDP model parameters",
    "justification": "Another key parameter estimated by the MDP model is the 'emotional conflict' (EC), which quantifies the relative expected aversiveness of negative affective stimuli versus the expected reward value. This parameter helps separate the contributions of emotional response to stimuli versus uncertainty in the decision-making process. The EC parameter was found to be associated with self-reported anxiety and avoidance motivations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "tolerance to uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "AAC task and post-task questionnaire responses",
    "justification": "The AAC task was used in conjunction with a post-task self-report questionnaire to validate the computational model parameters, specifically \u03b2 (decision uncertainty). The questionnaire asked participants about their subjective experiences during the task, including difficulty in decision-making and strategies for managing negative affect. The correlations between \u03b2 and questionnaire responses regarding difficulty with decisions supported the model's validity."
