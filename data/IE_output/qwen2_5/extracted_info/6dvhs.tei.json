    "justification": "The study measured subjective value (SV) of cannabis using fMRI tasks with parametric modulation of decision strength. SV signals were found in brain regions like the vmPFC, dPCC, and VS, indicating the participants' valuation of cannabis. The justification for this connection is provided by the observed SV signals, such as positive SV signals in the vmPFC for cannabis choices."

    "measured_by": "fMRI Task (Parametric Modulation of Decision Strength)",
    "justification": "The study aimed to measure the subjective value (SV) of snacks using the same fMRI task and found, contrary to expectations, a lack of positive SV signals for snacks. This is supported by analyses indicating a negative SV signal in the vmPFC and the absence of significant results in the whole-brain analysis."

    "topic_or_construct": "Craving for Cannabis/Snacks",
    "measured_by": "Visual Analogue Scales (VAS)",
    "justification": "Craving for cannabis and snacks was measured using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) before and after exposure to cues. The justification for this connection comes from the observed changes in craving ratings following exposure to cannabis and snack cues, as reported in the statistical analyses of the paper."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cue Effects on Subjective Value Signals",
    "measured_by": "Multisensory Cues",
    "justification": "The impact of cues on subjective value (SV) signals of cannabis and snacks was assessed using multisensory cues (visual, olfactory, tactile, auditory). The fMRI results showed that active cues had differential effects on cannabis and snack SV signals in the dPCC, supporting the utilization of multisensory cues as a measure."

    "topic_or_construct": "Behavioral Indifference Points",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral Choice Task",
    "justification": "The behavioral choice task was used to estimate the monetary value at which participants were equally likely to choose cannabis puffs or snacks over money. The main effect of reward (cannabis vs. snacks) in the statistical analysis showed that the estimated monetary indifference point differed between cannabis and snacks, validating its use as a measure of behavioral valuation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Contributions to SUDs from Non-Drug Reward Valuation",
    "measured_by": "fMRI Neural Activation in Response to Snacks",
    "justification": "The study investigates the degree to which blunted valuation of non-drug rewards might contribute to the maintenance of substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite observing typical behavioral effects for snacks, brain imaging did not reveal the expected positive SV signals for snacks, leading to a hypothesis that non-drug reward valuation may be dysregulated in SUDs."
