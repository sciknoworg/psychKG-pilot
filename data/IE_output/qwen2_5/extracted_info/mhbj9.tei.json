    "justification": "The article discusses a meta-analysis using datasets from the Confidence Database, which include Confidence ratings collected on various scales (discrete and continuous), correlating average confidence and average accuracy for each participant."

    "measured_by": "confidence scales with different points",
    "justification": "The study incorporates datasets using 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 9-, 11-point, and continuous confidence scales. It finds that coarser scales (fewer points) result in higher correlations between accuracy and confidence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "confidence in memory tasks",
    "measured_by": "memory tasks",
    "justification": "The analysis reveals that memory tasks produce a higher correlation (R = .35) between confidence and accuracy compared to other domains, suggesting the domain of study as a strong moderator for these constructs."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "confidence in perception tasks",
    "measured_by": "perception tasks",
    "justification": "The paper shows that perception tasks yield a lower R-value (R = .13) compared to memory tasks, demonstrating how the domain of study impacts the relationship between confidence and accuracy."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "confidence judgments in different domains",
    "measured_by": "confidence judgments in 'other' domains",
    "justification": "Across 214 datasets, the study identifies 'other' domains (like cognitive or motor tasks) and finds these domains have an intermediate correlation (R = .24) between confidence and accuracy compared to perception and memory tasks."
