    "justification": "Participants rated the similarity between pairs of traits on a scale from 1 to 7 in both Pilot Study and Experiments 2 and 3, indicating the degree to which they perceived the traits as conceptually similar. This method was used to assess the perceived similarity that guided trait-based generalization in various contexts."

    "topic_or_construct": "Sociability",
    "measured_by": "Learning Game and Partner Choice",
    "justification": "In Experiment 1, participants engaged in a Learning Game that revealed the sociability trait of targets. Subsequently, they chose partners in new games based on perceived similarity to sociability, demonstrating how this construct was assessed through social decision-making in various contexts."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social knowledge generalization",
    "measured_by": "False Recognition Task",
    "justification": "Experiment 3 utilized a false recognition task where participants were more likely to falsely remember traits that were conceptually similar to the originally presented traits. This task measured spontaneous generalization of traits at encoding."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Conceptual maps of trait space",
    "measured_by": "Task-specific and participant-specific trait similarity ratings",
    "justification": "Participants' choices in various experiments were predicted by both consensus and idiosyncratic ratings of similarity between traits, suggesting that individual differences in conceptual maps influence generalization. This was measured through subjective ratings and analyzed in relation to decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Trait-based partner choice",
    "measured_by": "Game-playing scenarios and partner selection",
    "justification": "Across multiple experiments, participants chose partners in various game contexts based on perceived trait similarities. Their choices were influenced by the similarity between traits associated with the partners and traits relevant to the given games, demonstrating how trait-based generalization was measured."
