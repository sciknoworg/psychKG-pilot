    "justification": "The paper states that job performance peaked when people were forced to wait for 1.0 second before answering a question, suggesting that forced decision time was used as a measurement instrument to assess job performance."

    "measured_by": "NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)",
    "justification": "The correct answer rate, considered as a component of cognitive utility, was measured in tandem with cognitive load as assessed by the NASA-TLX among participants who completed tasks post experimental conditions."

    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive utility",
    "measured_by": "state-space model",
    "justification": "Cognitive utility, represented by the correct answer rate, was embedded within the state-space model for statistical analysis of the relationship between decision time and performance metrics."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive frugality",
    "measured_by": "dropout rate",
    "justification": "The paper links cognitive frugality to the decreased rate of participant dropouts, thereby using dropout rate as an implicit measure of cognitive efficiency under different forced decision time conditions."
