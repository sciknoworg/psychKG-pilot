    "measured_by": "16-item short form of the Need for Cognition Scale",
    "justification": "NFC was assessed using the 16-item short form of the Need for Cognition Scale, which measures an individual's tendency to actively seek out and enjoy effortful cognitive activities. This scale was used to examine its relationship with subjective values and perceptions in the study's paradigm."

    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective Task Load",
    "measured_by": "NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)",
    "justification": "The NASA Task Load Index was used to assess perceived task load, where participants evaluated their subjective perception of mental load, physical load, effort, frustration, performance, and time pressure during the n-back task on a 20-point scale."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Effort Discounting",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive and Affective Discounting (CAD) Paradigm",
    "justification": "The CAD paradigm was used to estimate subjective values (SVs) of different task levels, adapting the original COG-ED paradigm by Westbrook et al. to measure participants' preferences for task levels independent of objective task load."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Performance",
    "measured_by": "Signal detection parameter d' and Reaction Time (RT)",
    "justification": "Performance was measured using the signal detection parameter d' (difference in z-transformed hit rate and false alarm rate) and reaction time data. These measures were used to assess performance changes across n-back levels and their influence on subjective values."
