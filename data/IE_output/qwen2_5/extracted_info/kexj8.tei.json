    "justification": "The distribution of switches between options is used to measure oscillatory switching, where the probability of switching back and forth between choices is analyzed based on the initial choice and attractiveness of the options."

    "measured_by": "Markov Analysis with varying inter-trial intervals",
    "justification": "Markov Analysis, adjusted with varying inter-trial intervals, is employed to assess how the delay between consecutive decisions affects the strength of perseveration, a key prediction of the attractor model explored in the reanalysis."

    "measured_by": "RT measurements for specific trial types",
    "justification": "Response times are measured to evaluate differences in RT for choosing preferred versus unpreferred options and for maintaining or switching between options, consistent with the model's predictions."
