    "justification": "In Experiment 1, participants provided independent location judgments for 17 cities, serving as a measure of expertise. The average Euclidean distance between participants' judgments and the correct positions was used as an operationalization of expertise, with higher expertise indicated by smaller distances (greater negative values)."

    "justification": "In Experiment 2, expertise was manipulated and measured through the use of a raster-scanning strategy. Participants in the expert condition were introduced to this strategy for accurately estimating the number of objects, which enabled them to demonstrate higher accuracy compared to participants in the control condition who did not receive the strategy training."
