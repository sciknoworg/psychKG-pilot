    "justification": "The temporal self was measured using a shape-label association paradigm where participants associated geometric shapes with the label \"(me) now.\" This method revealed how the temporal self shares representational overlaps with the social self, as indicated by the redundancy gain effects observed in the study."

    "measured_by": "Shape-label association paradigm (modified redundancy gain paradigms)",
    "justification": "The spatial self was measured through a shape-label association paradigm where participants associated shapes with the label \"(me) here.\" The study demonstrated representational overlaps between the spatial self and other self-concepts, particularly showing that the social self incorporates the spatial self's properties."
