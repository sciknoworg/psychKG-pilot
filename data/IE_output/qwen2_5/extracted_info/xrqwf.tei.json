    "topic_or_construct": "Hedonic valence (pleasant/unpleasant continuum)",
    "measured_by": "Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) for Italian",
    "justification": "The study used stimuli selected from the Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) for Italian, which provides mean valence ratings spanning from very unpleasant to very pleasant, thus enabling the assessment of stimuli along the hedonic valence dimension."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Physiological activation/arousal",
    "measured_by": "Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) for Italian",
    "justification": "The same ANEW database was used to assess arousal, which measures the physiological activation associated with words, ranging from calm to highly aroused."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Interoceptive awareness",
    "measured_by": "Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ) and MAIA-2",
    "justification": "The researchers employed both the BPQ and MAIA-2 to capture participants' self-reported awareness of bodily sensations and interoceptive abilities."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Positive affectivity",
    "measured_by": "Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)",
    "justification": "The PANAS scale was used to measure individual differences in positive emotional traits, enabling distinctions between groups with high and low positive affectivity."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Negative affectivity",
    "measured_by": "Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)",
    "justification": "Similarly, the PANAS was used to measure negative emotional tendencies, helping to define subgroups with high negative affectivity."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Depressive mood",
    "measured_by": "Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II)",
    "justification": "The BDI-II was administered to participants to gauge levels of depressive mood, another important affective dimension considered in the study."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
    "measured_by": "Bodyguard 2 (Firstbeat) HR monitor and Kubios HRV software",
    "justification": "Resting-state HRV was recorded using the Bodyguard 2 and analyzed with Kubios HRV software to assess the impact of physiological factors on emotional processing and concept organization."
