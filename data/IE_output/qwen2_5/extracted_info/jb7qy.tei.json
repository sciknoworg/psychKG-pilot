    "measured_by": "looking time",
    "justification": "The article discusses that looking time serves as a proxy for measuring habituation and dishabituation in adults, mirroring the infant habituation-dishabituation paradigm. Users' decision to look at stimuli based on learning progress, surprisal, or KL divergence helps in understanding these phenomena."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "learning progress",
    "measured_by": "Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence",
    "justification": "The article refers to research by Poli et al. (2020) which formalized learning progress using KL divergence, where higher KL predicted longer looking time. This connection supports the use of KL as a measure of learning progress in the looking time data."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "information gain",
    "measured_by": "expected information gain (EIG)",
    "justification": "The paper notes that EIG is used as the main linking hypothesis in the RANCH model, quantifying the expected information gain from the next sample to inform the decision of whether to keep looking at a stimulus. This setup mimics learning behavior in infant looking paradigms."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "surprise",
    "measured_by": "surprisal",
    "justification": "Surprisal is described as a viable linking hypothesis where looking times are longer for surprising stimuli. It's mentioned that surprisal can approximate EIG in the context of the experiment to explain looking behaviors."
