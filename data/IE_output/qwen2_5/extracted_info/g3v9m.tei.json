    "topic_or_construct": "Choice repetition bias",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral response choices and response times",
    "justification": "The choice repetition bias was measured by observing participants' choice patterns and response times in target trials after bias trials. This was indicated by a higher proportion of large/late choices following large/late bias trials and faster response times for choice repetitions compared to switches, showing a consistent preference bias from previous choices."

    "topic_or_construct": "Attentional processes in intertemporal choice",
    "measured_by": "Eye-tracking",
    "justification": "Eye-tracking was used to measure attentional biases by tracking participants' visual fixations, specifically the number of fixations on monetary vs. temporal dimensions and on different choice options, providing insights into how attention influences decision-making processes in intertemporal choice tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fixation frequencies and attentional preferences",
    "measured_by": "Selection Bias Score",
    "justification": "The selection bias score was calculated based on the ratio of fixations on the small/soon versus the large/late option, serving as an index of attentional preferences during the decision-making process and its influence on choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal discounting",
    "measured_by": "Intertemporal choice task",
    "justification": "Temporal discounting was measured using intertemporal choice tasks, where participants chose between smaller-sooner rewards and larger-later rewards, assessing how the value of rewards changes as a function of time delay."
