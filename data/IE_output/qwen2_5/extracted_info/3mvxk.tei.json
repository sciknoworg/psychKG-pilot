    "topic_or_construct": "Autism traits",
    "measured_by": "Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI)",
    "justification": "The AQ and CATI questionnaires are described as methods used to assess autism traits in the study. They provide a quantitative measure of these traits among participants, contributing to the analysis of how autism traits relate to decision-making and exploration behaviors. These tools are specified to help identify undiagnosed individuals with elevated autism traits."

    "topic_or_construct": "Depression traits",
    "measured_by": "Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS)",
    "justification": "The SDS is utilized to evaluate depressive traits among participants, which is important for the study as depression is known to co-occur with autism and could influence decision-making and exploration behaviors. Controlling for depressive traits ensures that observed effects are not confounded by comorbid conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "ADHD traits",
    "measured_by": "Adult ADHD-Self Report Scale Symptom Checklist (A-SRS)",
    "justification": "The A-SRS is used to assess ADHD traits because ADHD also commonly co-occurs with autism. Measuring ADHD provides necessary control variables to isolate the effects of autism on exploration behavior in the study."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Alexithymia traits",
    "measured_by": "Perth Alexithymia Questionnaire (PAQ)",
    "justification": "The PAQ measures alexithymia traits, another factor that co-occurs with autism and may influence the decision-making process. Controlling for alexithymia helps disentangle its effects from those of autism itself."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive abilities",
    "measured_by": "International Cognitive Ability Resource (ICAR)",
    "justification": "The ICAR is used to assess general cognitive abilities such as verbal reasoning and matrix reasoning. Although not included as a primary variable in the final models, it was initially considered and provides valuable insight into participants' broader cognitive functioning."
