    "measured_by": "Explicit trust ratings and implicit influence measure",
    "justification": "The article explicitly mentions that 'Two measures of trust were recorded to allow for dissociations between implicit and explicit behaviors. First, participants were explicitly asked to rate the reliability of advisors every second block of the experiment. Second, the degree to which participants updated their judgments and associated confidence from pre-to post-advice provided another measure of judged reliability, with larger updates indicating greater advice influence.' This indicates that trust in advisors was measured both through direct ratings and through the implicit influence of advice on participants' decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Advisor accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Measured by objective performance in the perceptual task",
    "justification": "The study manipulated advisor accuracy, setting some advisors as more accurate (80% correct) and others less accurate (60% correct). The accuracy of advisors was a key variable in understanding how participants trust and update their confidence in light of the advisor's feedback."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Advisor calibration",
    "measured_by": "Type 2 A ROC",
    "justification": "The article states that 'calibrated advisors were always accurate whenever confident, and the uncalibrated advisors' confidence was entirely unpredictive of accuracy.' This suggests that advisor calibration, a metacognitive measure of how well confidence predictions align with actual accuracy, was also directly manipulated and measured using the area under the ROC curve methodology."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence in judgment",
    "measured_by": "Subjective pre-advice confidence scale",
    "justification": "The article describes that participants first gave their response and 'associated confidence' using 'a semi-continuous confidence scale ranging from \"100% sure left\" to \"100% sure right\".' This scale was used to measure the participants' initial confidence in their judgment before receiving advice."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive confidence",
    "measured_by": "Participants' pre-advice confidence ratings and internal decision confidence",
    "justification": "Internal metacognitive signals, particularly confidence ratings, were used throughout the experiments to assess how advice reliability was estimated. The confidence updates were measured based on the initial confidence of participants and their subsequent adjustments after receiving advice."
