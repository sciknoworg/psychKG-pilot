    "measured_by": "Standardized, domain-general, computerized paradigms",
    "justification": "The article states that these paradigms, combined with computational modeling, enable the quantification of exploration-exploitation tendencies and the mathematical specification of reward-maximizing behavior in different decision-making contexts and task configurations. These include tasks like optimal stopping problems, foraging tasks, and n-armed bandit tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "Individual Differences in Exploration-Exploitation",
    "measured_by": "Self-report questionnaires, cognitive flexibility tasks, lab-based four-armed bandit task, and war simulation task",
    "justification": "The study by Richner et al. used a combination of self-report measures, cognitive task assessments, and computerized decision tasks to investigate how personality traits, cognitive flexibility, and contextual factors influence exploration-exploitation behavior. The results indicated that cognitive flexibility plays a crucial role in facilitating effective exploration-exploitation performance."

    "measured_by": "Self-report questionnaires and cognitive flexibility tasks",
    "justification": "The article describes how Richner et al. employed self-report questionnaires to assess emotional stability and cognitive flexibility tasks to examine how emotional stability impacts exploration-exploitation performance, particularly highlighting its role in mediating the positive effect of cognitive flexibility."
