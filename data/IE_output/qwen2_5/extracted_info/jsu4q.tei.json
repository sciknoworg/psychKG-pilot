    "measured_by": "S-UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior scale",
    "justification": "The study uses the Short Version of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior scale (S-UPPS-P) to measure impulsivity, assessing Dimensions like Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, and Positive Urgency. This self-report questionnaire was chosen for its established reliability and relevance to the facets of impulsivity investigated in the research."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Negative Urgency",
    "measured_by": "UPPS-P scale",
    "justification": "Negative Urgency, a subscale of the UPPS-P, is highlighted as key in the paper. It captures rash acting tendencies in negative emotional states, shown as statistically separable from other self-rated forms of impulsivity, and significantly correlated with psychopathology."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Positive Urgency",
    "measured_by": "UPPS-P scale",
    "justification": "Positive Urgency, another UPPS-P subscale, reflecting rash acting under positive moods, was identified in subsequent research. It shows robust links to psychopathology, corroborated by the paper\u2019s presentation of the UPPS-P's effectiveness in detailing distinct forms of impulsivity."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Barratt Impulsivity scores (BIS-11)",
    "measured_by": "BIS-11 scale",
    "justification": "The Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) is referenced in the paper for its relation to working memory capacity but predominantly to highlight mixed findings about its association with working memory tasks. This established scale measures trait impulsivity and was used for comparison in the study."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Working Memory Capacity",
    "measured_by": "Various Working Memory Tasks (e.g., Digit Span, N-back, CANTAB)",
    "justification": "The paper describes the relationship between Barratt Impulsivity scores and working memory through tasks like the digit span task, N-back task, and CANTAB test of spatial working memory. These tasks were selected to assess the cognitive function of working memory in relation to impulsivity."
