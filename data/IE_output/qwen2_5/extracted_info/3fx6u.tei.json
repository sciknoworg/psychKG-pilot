    "measured_by": "Drift Rate (Diffusion Model)",
    "justification": "The article states that the drift rate parameter of the diffusion model represents processing speed, which is independent of decision caution and non-decision time. This measure is considered a process-pure estimate of processing speed."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Caution",
    "measured_by": "Boundary Separation (Diffusion Model)",
    "justification": "According to the article, decision caution is represented by the boundary separation parameter in the diffusion model. This parameter indicates the amount of information sampled before making a decision."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Non-decision Time",
    "measured_by": "Non-decision Time Constants (Diffusion Model)",
    "justification": "The article explains that non-decision time, encompassing encoding and motor response times, is captured by the non-decision time constant parameters (\u03c4c and \u03c4n) in the diffusion model. Separate constants are estimated for correct and incorrect responses."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Mean Response Times",
    "measured_by": "Raw Response Time Data",
    "justification": "The article frequently refers to mean response times (RTs) as a traditional and basic measure of processing speed used in cognitive tasks, acknowledging its limitations compared to diffusion model parameters."
