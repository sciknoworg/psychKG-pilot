    "topic_or_construct": "Voluntary action initiation",
    "measured_by": "Libet clock paradigm",
    "justification": "The study used an adapted version of the Libet clock paradigm to investigate the impact of spatial distance on voluntary action initiation. The paradigm involves participants deciding when to press a key and reporting the position of a rotating clock hand, which indicates the timing of their decision."

    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective awareness of decision to act",
    "measured_by": "Libet clock paradigm",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to verbally report their awareness of the timing of their decision to act using the Libet clock paradigm, providing insights into how subjective awareness is influenced by spatial distance."

    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal binding",
    "measured_by": "Libet clock paradigm with auditory tone",
    "justification": "The Libet clock paradigm was extended to include an auditory tone played after participants' actions. This setup allowed for the observation of temporal binding effects, where the perceived timing of decisions and actions shifted closer to the sound outcome."

    "topic_or_construct": "Action execution timing estimation",
    "measured_by": "Libet clock paradigm",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to estimate the timing of their action execution using the Libet clock paradigm. This approach helped assess how spatial distance influences the subjective perception of action timings."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal awareness of action decision and execution",
    "measured_by": "Libet clock paradigm",
    "justification": "The Libet clock paradigm was adapted to evaluate how the spatial proximity of visual stimuli affects temporal awareness. Participants perceived their actions as occurring earlier when the stimuli were within peripersonal space."
