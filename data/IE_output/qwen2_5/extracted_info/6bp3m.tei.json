    "measured_by": "Congruent-Incongruent-Mixed Display Design",
    "justification": "The study manipulated processing noise by varying the screen-location of feedback to be either congruent, incongruent, or mixed relative to the slot-machine choices. This design increases the cognitive demand on participants to associate outcomes with their respective machines, thereby measuring the effects of processing noise on decision-making."

    "measured_by": "Two-armed Bandit Task",
    "justification": "The two-armed bandit task, where participants chose between 'Safer' and 'Riskier' slot-machines, served as the primary measurement for risk perception. The variance and mean differences between the machines allowed for the assessment of how participants integrate potentially high-reward and high-risk options."

    "topic_or_construct": "Attention Allocation",
    "measured_by": "Exponential Weighting Function",
    "justification": "The computational model used a convex exponential weighting function to describe how participants allocate attention to high-extreme outcomes versus mid-range or low-extreme outcomes. This function was estimated from participants' choices to infer attentional biases under increasing processing noise."
