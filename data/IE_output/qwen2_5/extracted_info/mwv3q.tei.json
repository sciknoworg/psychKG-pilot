    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Fatigue",
    "measured_by": "Number of forecasts issued before the target forecast",
    "justification": "The study operationally defines decision fatigue using the number of forecasts an analyst has issued earlier in the same day, suggesting increased fatigue with more forecasts, as they consume mental resources."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Forecast Accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Relative Accuracy",
    "justification": "Relative accuracy is calculated as the difference between an analyst's forecast error and the median forecast error of all analysts covering the same firm, standardized by the standard deviation of forecast errors. This captures forecast accuracy relative to peers."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Herding Behavior",
    "measured_by": "HERDING dummy variable",
    "justification": "The HERDING variable is defined as 1 if an analyst's forecast is between their own previous forecast and the consensus forecast, indicating herding. This measures the tendency to align with the consensus forecast as a heuristic under decision fatigue."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Self-Herding Behavior",
    "measured_by": "REISSUE dummy variable",
    "justification": "The REISSUE variable is defined as 1 if an analyst reissues an outstanding previous forecast, which indicates a heuristic of relying on earlier forecasts rather than conducting new analysis."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Rounded Forecasting",
    "measured_by": "ROUNDING dummy variable",
    "justification": "The ROUNDING variable is defined as 1 if an analyst issues a forecast ending with a zero or five, capturing heuristic behavior as rounded forecasts are less effortful but potentially less accurate."
