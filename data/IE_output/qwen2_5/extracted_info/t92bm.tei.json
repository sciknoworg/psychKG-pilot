    "measured_by": "binomial z-score based on trial history",
    "justification": "The study examines carryover effects by measuring how prior trial conditions influence current performance using a binomial z-score which quantifies the statistical evidence for the current trial condition. This mathematical representation is used across multiple experiments and datasets to show that performance is optimized based on prior experience."

    "topic_or_construct": "motor priming",
    "measured_by": "touch-and-swipe response method in object-sorting task",
    "justification": "In Experiment 1, motor priming is assessed through the touch-and-swipe method used in the object-sorting task. The experiment analyzes response times, particularly focusing on the time to swipe to the appropriate end of the screen, as a means of evaluating motor priming impacts due to prior exposure."

    "topic_or_construct": "response priming",
    "measured_by": "target presence/absence-coded response in visual search task",
    "justification": "Experiment 2 assesses response priming via a visual search task where the participants' responses are coded by target presence or absence. The relationship between prior exposure to target conditions and current response performance is evaluated, demonstrating the trial-by-trial effect on response priming."

    "topic_or_construct": "trial-by-trial reinforcement",
    "measured_by": "binomial z-score across different task-irrelevant features",
    "justification": "Experiment 3 isolates trial-by-trial reinforcement by examining task-irrelevant features like salient distractors and bag types in the absence of response features. The study uses the binomial z-score to demonstrate that these features influence performance, showing reinforcement of cognitive aspects beyond motor or response priming."
