    "measured_by": "Affordance-Based Value Estimation and Action-Sensitive Value-Based Behavior Estimation Model",
    "justification": "The model incorporating affordance-based value estimation combined with action-sensitive value-based behavior estimation was able to exhibit priority assertion behavior, where drivers increased their deceleration to encourage pedestrian crossing. This was supported by simulations with exaggerated decelerations and changes in internal value estimations as shown in Figure 3B."

    "measured_by": "Model with Sensory Noise and Evidence Accumulation",
    "justification": "Only models that included sensory noise in decision-making, particularly angular sensory noise, along with evidence accumulation mechanisms, successfully exhibited gap acceptance hesitation. This was demonstrated through parameter evaluations and simulations where pedestrians slowed down strategically before crossing in the presence of an approaching car, as shown in Figure 3E."

    "topic_or_construct": "Value Transformations in Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Bayesian Perceptual Filtering and Evidence Accumulation Model",
    "justification": "The integration of Bayesian perceptual filtering and evidence accumulation into the model led to transformations of perceived values into decision-making metrics. This allowed the model to better replicate human pedestrian hesitation and yield acceptance behavior when coupled with other psychological assumptions, particularly in scenarios with uncertainty, as shown in Figure 4A and predictions of crossing initiation times."

    "measured_by": "Value Estimation with Long-Term Pacification Horizon",
    "justification": "Driver short-stopping behavior, where drivers exaggerated their deceleration to encourage pedestrians to cross, was effectively captured with a value estimation model that accounted for future rewards beyond immediate interactions. As discussed in the model framework, this long-term value estimation better simulated real-world driver behavior as described in Figure 1B and Figure 3C."

    "topic_or_construct": "Theory of Mind in Road User Interaction",
    "measured_by": "Observation-Based Behavior Estimation Model (oBEo) and Value-Based Behavior Estimation Model (oBEv)",
    "justification": "Existing models were extended with theories of mind components, allowing both observation-based behavior estimation and value-based behavior estimation. This enabled the model to estimate intentions of others, leading to more nuanced interactive behavior. However, the combination of oBEo and oBEv provided significant improvements, especially when combined with other model components. Justified in method models and comparisons."
