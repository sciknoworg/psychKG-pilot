    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reflection Task (CRT)",
    "justification": "The Cognitive Reflection Task (CRT) is used to measure tendencies towards Type 1 and Type 2 processing in dual process theories. It reveals whether individuals are more likely to give quick, intuitive answers or more thoughtful, normative responses that align with logical reasoning, thus supporting the understanding of how dual processes operate."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Type 1 Processes",
    "measured_by": "Matching Bias in Selection Task",
    "justification": "The matching bias observed in the selection task corresponds to Type 1 processes characterized by unconscious, implicit, and rapid responding. Specifically, participants choose cards matching the content of the conditional statement, indicating an intuitive and pragmatic approach consistent with Type 1 processes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Type 2 Processes",
    "measured_by": "Normative Responses in Standard Reasoning Tasks",
    "justification": "Normative responses to reasoning tasks like the Wason selection task or the Linda problem suggest Type 2 processing. These responses indicate the use of conscious, explicit, and controlled thought processes that aim for correct, normative answers, aligned with rational, logical reasoning capabilities."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Heuristics and Biases",
    "measured_by": "Selection Task and Linda Problem",
    "justification": "The selection task and Linda problem expose participants' reliance on heuristics like representativeness and their susceptibility to biases. Individuals often violate normative principles in favor of intuitive, yet potentially flawed, judgments, highlighting the heuristic explanation within dual process theories."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Evolutionarily rational reasoning",
    "measured_by": "Social Contract Tasks",
    "justification": "Tasks involving social contracts align with evolutionary psychology interpretations. Participants show normative responding when content matches evolutionary adaptations for recognizing cheaters, indicating an evolved module specialized in detecting social contract violations."
