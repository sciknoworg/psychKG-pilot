    "measured_by": "Admiralty Code",
    "justification": "The Admiralty Code is described as a widely implemented information evaluation system used in intelligence analysis for evaluating the quality of raw intelligence based on meta-informational attributes, such as source reliability and information credibility. This system is linked to analysts' judgments of information quality."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "source reliability",
    "measured_by": "Admiralty Code Source Reliability Scale",
    "justification": "Source reliability is an important psychological construct within the Admiralty Code and is evaluated using a scale ranging from 'Completely Reliable' ('A') to 'Unreliable' ('E'). The scale helps analysts assess the trustworthiness of an information source based on past performance."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "information credibility",
    "measured_by": "Admiralty Code Information Credibility Scale",
    "justification": "Information credibility is measured through the Admiralty Code's information credibility scale, which assesses the probability of the truth of the information, ranging from 'Completely Credible' ('1') to 'Improbable' ('5'). This scale allows analysts to judge the reliability of the information content."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "trustworthiness of information",
    "measured_by": "Likelihood judgments",
    "justification": "The perceived trustworthiness of information is measured through participants' likelihood judgments using a 100-point scale. In the experiments, participants were asked to rate items on trustworthiness, providing an indicator of how trustworthy they found the information."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "information accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Accuracy ratings",
    "justification": "The accuracy of information was measured by participants adjusting sliders on a 0-100 scale, estimating how likely a piece of information was to be accurate. This method allowed for the quantification of perceived information accuracy as a key factor in its quality."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "information informativeness",
    "measured_by": "Informativeness ratings",
    "justification": "Informativeness was operationalized by participants rating how informative they perceived the provided information to be using the same scale as accuracy ratings. This measure assesses how useful or detailed the information is perceived."
