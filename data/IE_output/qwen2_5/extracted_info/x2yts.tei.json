    "measured_by": "motivational Go/NoGo task",
    "justification": "The motivational Go/NoGo task was used to capture Pavlovian choice bias by examining the impact of valence (gain win vs. avoid punishment contexts) on behavioral activation or inhibition. This task operationalizes bias-congruent responding, where Go responses for win cues and NoGo for avoid cues are facilitated compared to bias-incongruent responses."

    "topic_or_construct": "Instrumental learning bias",
    "measured_by": "motivational Go/NoGo task",
    "justification": "The motivational Go/NoGo task also measured instrumental learning bias by assessing the selective facilitation of specific response types based on reinforcement history. The task includes two different Go responses (Go Left and Right) to discern between general Pavlovian biases and specific instrumental learning biases which develop over trials."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision noise",
    "measured_by": "feedback sensitivity parameters in computational RL models",
    "justification": "Decision noise is measured using feedback sensitivity parameters (\u03c1 +FB and \u03c1 -FB) derived from reinforcement learning (RL) models applied to the motivational Go/NoGo task. Higher feedback sensitivity corresponds to lower decision noise, reflecting more deterministic choices."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive flexibility",
    "measured_by": "probabilistic reversal learning task",
    "justification": "The probabilistic reversal learning task, which involves changing outcome probabilities, was used to measure cognitive flexibility. Participants had to continuously update their expectations as reward contingencies reversed, allowing for the assessment of learning and adaptation in response to changing contexts."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Model-based control",
    "measured_by": "modified 2-step decision-making task",
    "justification": "The 2-step decision-making task was employed to assess model-based control, a higher-level cognitive process reflecting the mental simulation of outcomes and values associated with actions. This task requires participants to make choices based on dynamically changing probabilities, capturing the ability to plan prospectively."
