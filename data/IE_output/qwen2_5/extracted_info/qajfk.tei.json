    "topic_or_construct": "Consciousness",
    "measured_by": "Electron Observer Theory (EOT) and Dominant Neuron (DN)",
    "justification": "The Electron Observer Theory (EOT) posits that consciousness is tied to the Dominant Neuron (DN), which is involved in decision-making based on pleasant and unpleasant subjective feelings. This theoretical framework suggests that the membrane potential changes in DN are the basis for conscious actions and decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective feelings",
    "measured_by": "Pleasure-unpleasant principle",
    "justification": "The paper argues that all behaviors requiring decision-making can be reduced to the pleasure-unpleasant principle, suggesting that subjective feelings (pleasant and unpleasant) influence physical actions and decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Dominant Neuron (DN) activity",
    "justification": "The DN's activity is proposed as a central mechanism for decision-making, with its membrane potential sensitive to subjective feelings like pleasure and pain, thereby guiding behavioral outcomes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Neural correlates of consciousness",
    "measured_by": "Electrophysiological and imaging techniques (implied)",
    "justification": "The paper discusses the psychological theory and compatibilities with neuroscience, implying that electrophysiological and imaging techniques may be used to study the postulated Dominant Neuron (DN)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Quantum effects on consciousness",
    "measured_by": "Einselection process within EOT",
    "justification": "The role of quantum mechanics in consciousness is discussed, suggesting that the einselection process within EOT links subjective experience to quantum state, thereby addressing the quantum measurement problem."
