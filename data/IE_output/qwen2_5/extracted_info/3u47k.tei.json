    "topic_or_construct": "Approach-Avoidance Conflict (AAC)",
    "measured_by": "Human AAC task",
    "justification": "The study employed a human AAC task with a simple and abstract visual design that could be presented online, which is a well-validated model for studying cautiousness and its relationship to psychiatric symptom dimensions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Compulsive Behaviour and Intrusive Thought (CIT)",
    "measured_by": "Clinical questionnaire battery",
    "justification": "The factor 'Compulsive Behaviour and Intrusive Thought (CIT)' was derived from a comprehensive clinical questionnaire battery, including items from questionnaires assessing alcoholism, OCD, eating disorders, impulsivity, and schizotypy, demonstrating a significant correlation with AAC behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Anxious-Depression (AD)",
    "measured_by": "Clinical questionnaire battery",
    "justification": "The 'Anxious-Depression (AD)' factor was defined within the clinical questionnaire battery from items related to generalised anxiety, depression, and apathy questionnaires. However, the study found no connection between AD and approach-avoidance behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social Withdrawal (SW)",
    "measured_by": "Clinical questionnaire battery",
    "justification": "The 'Social Withdrawal (SW)' factor was identified from the questionnaire battery, particularly loading on social anxiety items. However, similar to AD, it did not predict behavior in the AAC task."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Trait Anxiety",
    "measured_by": "State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA)",
    "justification": "The trait anxiety was measured using the STICSA scale, though the study found that trait anxiety had weaker associations with AAC behavior when compared to the CIT factor."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "IQ",
    "measured_by": "International Cognitive Ability Resource (ICAR)",
    "justification": "IQ was measured using the ICAR scale, and the study demonstrated that higher IQ scores were linked to greater integration of threat features into behavior and an increased belief in threat-reward correlations."
