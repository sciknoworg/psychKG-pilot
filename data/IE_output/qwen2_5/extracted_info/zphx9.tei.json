    "measured_by": "Multiple Price List (MPL) task",
    "justification": "The paper describes using the Multiple Price List (MPL) task to measure time preferences across various treatments, showcasing its adaptability for teenagers in different formats. Various MPL treatments such as MPL, MPL-Choice, and MPL-Gift were specifically employed to measure individual time preferences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "time preferences",
    "measured_by": "MPL-Gift treatment",
    "justification": "The MPL-Gift treatment was used in the third wave of the study, where monetary amounts were represented by gifts with monetary values to measure time preferences. Using a gift format influenced the consistency and preferences by making subjects less patient."

    "topic_or_construct": "risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "Holt-Laury (HL) task",
    "justification": "Risk preferences were assessed using a modified version of the Holt-Laury (HL) task. In the HL task, participants chose between a safe and risky option iteratively with varying probabilities of high and low outcomes to reveal their risk aversion levels."

    "topic_or_construct": "risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "Gumball machine visual aid",
    "justification": "The gumball machine was introduced as a visualization aid in the third wave of the experiment for the risk preferences task. It increased consistency and the number of risky choices in the task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing task comprehension."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive abilities",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)",
    "justification": "The CRT adapted for teenagers was used to measure cognitive abilities, including reflective thinking. Participants answered questions such as the bat-and-ball problem to assess their ability to override intuitive but incorrect responses."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "financial abilities",
    "measured_by": "Financial abilities test",
    "justification": "A three-question financial abilities test was administered to gauge participants' understanding of basic financial concepts, such as interest calculations. This task aimed to measure financial numeracy among teenagers."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "understanding probabilities",
    "measured_by": "Delavande test (DL)",
    "justification": "The Delavande test, inspired by the work of Delavande and Kohler (2009), was administered in the third wave of the study to evaluate teenagers' ability to understand probabilities. This test was included alongside other tasks in the experimental design."
