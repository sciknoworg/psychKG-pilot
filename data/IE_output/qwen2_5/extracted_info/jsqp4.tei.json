    "justification": "The article describes using a remember-and-decide task to measure the memory bias, where participants first learn to associate options with locations and then make decisions between these options from memory, allowing the quantification of the preference for remembered over forgotten options."

    "justification": "Participants\u2019 risk attitudes were measured using a task where they made binary decisions between a sure gain or loss and a risky lottery, allowing estimation of their risk parameters through a hierarchical Bayesian model."

    "justification": "To measure ambiguity attitudes, participants engaged in a task involving binary decisions between a sure gain or loss and an ambiguous lottery, with model parameters estimating their individual ambiguity attitudes."

    "measured_by": "discrete rating scale (-10 to 10)",
    "justification": "The subjective value of images was determined using an incentivized rating task where participants rated images on a scale from -10 to 10, allowing for the division of images into positive and negative categories based on ratings."
