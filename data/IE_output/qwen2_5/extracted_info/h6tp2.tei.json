    "measured_by": "Weight of Advice (WoA)",
    "justification": "The paper mentions that algorithm aversion or appreciation is measured indirectly through the Weight of Advice (WoA), which assesses how much judges update their initial judgments based on advice. Differences in the WoA between AI and human advice sources reveal individual differences in algorithm aversion or appreciation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Advice Utilization",
    "measured_by": "Weight of Advice (WoA)",
    "justification": "The WoA, a widely used metric for advice utilization, was employed in this study to evaluate the effect of advice. A positive WoA signifies that a judge updated their judgment according to the advice, while a negative WoA implies that the judge moved away from the advice, thus quantifying advice utilization."

    "topic_or_construct": "Accuracy of Final Judgment",
    "measured_by": "Distance Between Final Judgment and Target (. !)",
    "justification": "The accuracy of the final judgment was evaluated using the distance between the final judgment and the target value (. !). A smaller value of . ! indicates a higher accuracy of the final judgment with advice, thus serving as a measure of final judgment accuracy."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Initial Judgment Update",
    "measured_by": "Probability of Updating Initial Judgment (#&$0%",
    "justification": "The probability that a human judge updates their initial judgment (#&$0%) was measured to understand the activation step of the cognitive process model. This metric was derived using hierarchical state space models, reflecting the likelihood of using advice based on the relationship between the initial judgment and the advice interval."

    "topic_or_construct": "Numeracy",
    "measured_by": "Numeracy Score",
    "justification": "The numeracy of the judges was measured using a numeracy score, reflecting their level of subjective numeracy. This score was used to explore the individual differences in algorithm priority among judges."
