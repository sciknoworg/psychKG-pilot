    "justification": "The mADMC is explicitly mentioned to measure task-based decision-making competence, comprising components like resistance to framing, social norm recognition, and overconfidence. It has been adapted for cultural relevance and used in the study's experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of AI assistance on decision outcomes."

    "measured_by": "Davos Assessment of Cognitive Biases Scale (DACOBS)",
    "justification": "Cognitive biases were assessed using the DACOBS, a 42-item scale on a 7-point Likert scale. The scoring suggests that a score above 140 indicates high levels of cognitive biases, reflecting participants' tendencies during decision tasks."
