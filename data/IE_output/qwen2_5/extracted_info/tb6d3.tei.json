    "justification": "The psychological construct of psychosis proneness is quantified using two established scales: the PDI, which focuses on delusional ideation, and the CAPS, which measures anomalous perceptual experiences. Both scales were administered to participants in this study to assess their psychotic-like tendencies, as stated: 'After the experimental tasks of both Experiment 1 and 2, participants completed two validated questionnaires measuring psychosis proneness, the Peters et al. Delusions Inventory, PDI, and the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale, CAPS.'"

    "topic_or_construct": "Choice history biases",
    "measured_by": "Decision tasks with auditory and visual stimuli",
    "justification": "Choice history biases are evaluated through participants' responses in specific decision-making tasks involving both auditory clicks and visual random dot kinematograms, where the influence of recent perceptual experiences on subsequent choices is analyzed. This is reflected in the study's design where participants completed experiments requiring perceptual judgments with previous choices serving as a proxy for low-level prior information: 'Choice history biases therefore offer an opportunity to quantify the influence of perceptual priors and to thereby investigate individual differences in perceptual inference in relation to psychosis.'"
