    "justification": "Participants provided subjective ratings of risk-attitude by manipulating the slider on a visual analog scale (VAS) before and after each session. This was done to detect whether participants accurately recognized what they were instructed to do and to quantitatively examine changes in their ratings. The values ranged from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating 'very risk-averse' and 100 indicating 'very risk-seeking.'"

    "measured_by": "discrepancy from Bayesian optimal aiming points",
    "justification": "The objective risk-attitude was assessed by estimating the actual aiming timing/direction from the optimal as calculated by Bayesian decision theory, which considered the variability of response time (RT) and reach direction. This discrepancy provided a measure of whether participants exhibited risk-seeking or risk-averse behavior compared to the theoretical optimum."

    "topic_or_construct": "risk-seeking bias",
    "measured_by": "comparison of subjective and objective risk-attitudes",
    "justification": "The risk-seeking bias was measured by comparing the subjective risk-attitudes (assessed via visual analog scales) with the objective risk-attitudes (determined from the discrepancy between actual and optimal aiming points). The degree of mismatch between these two measures indicated the presence and extent of a risk-seeking bias."
