    "measured_by": "Brightness Discrimination Task",
    "justification": "Participants in the study were asked to determine whether an array of pixels was of high or low brightness, with the task manipulated under speed or accuracy emphasis conditions, serving as the measurement tool for decision-making time."

    "topic_or_construct": "Speed-Accuracy Emphasis Manipulation",
    "measured_by": "Change in Accuracy and Response Time Feedback",
    "justification": "The paper describes an experimental setup where participants received different types of feedback based on speed or accuracy goals, which alters their response characteristics and thereby measures the influence of these emphases."
