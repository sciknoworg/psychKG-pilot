    "measured_by": "Frontal midline theta power",
    "justification": "FMT power is believed to originate in the ACC and reflects cognitive control processes requiring effort, as observed during decision making paradigms. This is supported by the article's mention of FMT power measuring effort-based decision making processes."

    "measured_by": "Reward positivity amplitude",
    "justification": "RewP amplitude is sensitive to the negative and positive valence of feedback stimuli and modulated more by reward than error outcomes. The article states that RewP amplitude reflects subjective reward valuation signals, making it a suitable measure for reward processing."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive effort",
    "measured_by": "Frontal midline theta power",
    "justification": "Ongoing FMT power is observed during cognitive effort exertion, as noted in the provided text, indicating its role in measuring cognitive effort."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reward evaluation and feedback valuation",
    "measured_by": "Delta power",
    "justification": "Delta power is reported to provide additional information about the effect of reward on decision making, as it is associated with reward-related ERP components, specifically in a few studies of reward processing with effort cost anticipation."
