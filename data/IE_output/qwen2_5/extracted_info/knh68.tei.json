    "measured_by": "16-item short version of the German NFC scale",
    "justification": "The article states that Need for Cognition was assessed using the 16-item short version of the German NFC scale, which participants rated on a 7-point Likert scale from -3 (completely disagree) to +3 (completely agree). This measure is used to assess an individual's tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive activity."

    "topic_or_construct": "Self-Control",
    "measured_by": "Short form of the German Self-Control Scale (SCS-K-D)",
    "justification": "Self-Control was measured using the short form of the German Self-Control Scale (SCS-K-D) and the Effortful Control scale from the German Adult Temperament Questionnaire (ATQ). Both scales are presented on a Likert scale, with the SCS-K-D comprising 13 items and the Effortful Control scale comprising 19 items assessing executive control in everyday life."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Motivation",
    "measured_by": " Trait Intellect scale and NFC",
    "justification": "Cognitive Motivation was estimated from the first-order factors derived from the Trait Intellect scale and the NFC, forming part of a hierarchical factor model of Cognitive Effort Investment."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Effortful Self-Control",
    "measured_by": "Self-Control and Effortful Control scales",
    "justification": "Effortful Self-Control was derived from the Self-Control scale and the Effortful Control scale within the hierarchical factor model, representing the shared variance in these personality traits."

    "topic_or_construct": "Demand Avoidance",
    "measured_by": "Demand Selection Task (DST)",
    "justification": "The Demand Selection Task, introduced by Kool et al. (2010), was used to measure Demand Avoidance. Participants chose between two visual patterns associated with different levels of cognitive demand, with their choices indicating their tendency to avoid demanding tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Effort Investment",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Motivation and Effortful Self-Control factor scores",
    "justification": "Cognitive Effort Investment was represented as a second-order factor explaining the shared variance of Cognitive Motivation and Effortful Self-Control, assessed through factor scores obtained from questionnaire data."
