    "justification": "Participants rated their familiarity for each image on a continuous scale from 1 to 5, with labels 'sure new,' 'unsure,' and 'sure old' at positions 1, 3, and 5 respectively, indicating the subjective familiarity of items. This measurement was used to assess the influence of familiarity on betting behavior."

    "justification": "Participants were asked to select the quadrant where each image had appeared during the encoding phase and then rate their confidence on a continuous scale (1-5). These ratings, along with the subjective probability of reward associated with the source location, indirectly measured the participants' ability to recollect relevant source information for making betting decisions."

    "measured_by": "Subjective Probability of Reward and Betting Behavior",
    "justification": "The probability of a bet being rewarded varied based on the quadrant where the scene had appeared in the encoding phase. Participants allocated bets according to the subjective value inferred from source memory and familiarity, allowing an assessment of memory signals' contribution to decision-making."
