    "measured_by": "computational modeling framework",
    "justification": "The study used a computational modeling framework to derive risk tolerance estimates, as part of the participant's decision-making process under uncertainty. The model applied a power utility function that included risk and ambiguity factors to estimate separate parameters for risk tolerance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "ambiguity aversion",
    "measured_by": "computational modeling framework",
    "justification": "Similarly to risk tolerance, ambiguity aversion was assessed using the same computational modeling framework. The model included a parameter for ambiguity aversion, allowing the researchers to estimate how participants responded to decision options with unknown probabilities."

    "topic_or_construct": "social influence on risk tolerance",
    "measured_by": "social risky and social safe conditions",
    "justification": "The study manipulated the presence of social information by presenting participants with the previous choices of others in the social risky and social safe conditions. Results demonstrated changes in risk tolerance when participants saw information about others' choices in both risky and safe directions."
