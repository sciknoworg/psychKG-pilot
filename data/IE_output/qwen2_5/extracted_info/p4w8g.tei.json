    "measured_by": "Capacity for Autonomous Decision-Making",
    "justification": "The studies used vignettes where participants judged the validity of consent given by an agent described with varying levels of autonomous decision-making capacity. The findings showed that participants were less likely to view consent as valid when the agent lacked these capacities."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Validity of Consent",
    "measured_by": "Consent Judgments Measures",
    "justification": "The research utilized a composite measure based on three questions related to whether the agent's 'yes' counted as consent, an assessment of the agent's freedom, and morality judgments. Higher ratings on these measures were associated with judgments of valid consent."

    "topic_or_construct": "Autonomous Capacities",
    "measured_by": "Manipulation Checks on Rational and Authentic Capacities",
    "justification": "Participants rated the agent's ability to make rational decisions and be true to themselves when making decisions across different conditions. Their judgments revealed a direct relationship between perceived autonomy-capacity and validity of consent."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Moral Reasoning in Consent",
    "measured_by": "Moral Judgments and Ownership Transfer Measures",
    "justification": "Study 3 included measures of moral judgments regarding the action based on consent, as well as judgments of ownership transfer. Results showed that moral judgments were influenced by whether the person exercised autonomy in the decision, but ownership transfer was linked more to the possession of autonomous capacities."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Judgment of Right Choice and Morality",
    "measured_by": "Judgments of Moral Wrongness",
    "justification": "Measures included direct questioning about the moral wrongness of acting on consent and participants' judgments about whether an agent made the right choice. These provided insight into how exercise of autonomy affects moral assessments differently than consent validity."
