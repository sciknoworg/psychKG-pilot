  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Escape behavior",
    "measured_by": "Fully-immersive virtual reality (VR) environment",
    "justification": "The study employed a VR environment to investigate human escape behavior, allowing participants to freely move within a physical space and respond to various threats in a controlled manner. The VR setup was designed to simulate realistic threat scenarios and measure escape responses."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fearfulness",
    "measured_by": "Fear Survey Schedule-III (FSS)",
    "justification": "The FSS was used to assess the participants' level of fear, which contributed to 27%/40% of the between-person variance in escape initiation time and distance from the threat during the escape. This questionnaire evaluated diverse fears including those toward specific threats like snakes and spiders."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fear of spiders",
    "measured_by": "Spider Phobia Questionnaire-12 (SPQ-12)",
    "justification": "The SPQ-12 was used to measure fear of spiders, which was correlated with behavior during escape scenarios. Participants with higher scores on the SPQ-12 tended to initiate escape earlier and maintain a greater distance from threats."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fear of snakes",
    "measured_by": "Snake Phobia Questionnaire-12 (SNAQ-12)",
    "justification": "The SNAQ-12 was used to assess the fear of snakes, as this particular phobia impacts decision-making and behavior during escape scenarios in the study, similar to other animal phobias."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Trait anxiety",
    "measured_by": "State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA-T)",
    "justification": "The STICSA-T was used to measure trait anxiety, which was one of the variables related to individual differences in escape behavior. The measure helped in understanding how anxiety influences escape decisions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Sensation seeking",
    "measured_by": "Brief Sensation Seeking Scale (BSSS)",
    "justification": "The BSSS was used to assess sensation seeking propensity, contributing to behavioral patterns during escape tasks. High scorers on this scale showed different responses in terms of body orientation when threats appeared."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)",
    "measured_by": "PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)",
    "justification": "The PCL-5 was used to screen potential participants for any history of PTSD, which was an exclusion criterion to ensure participants had no prior history impacting their responses to virtual threats."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Trait anxiety",
    "measured_by": "State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA-T)",
    "justification": "The STICSA-T was used to assess different dimensions of anxiety, contributing to a comprehensive analysis of participants' individual differences in threat response."
