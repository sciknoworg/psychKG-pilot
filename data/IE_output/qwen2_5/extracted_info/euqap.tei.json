    "justification": "The article explicitly mentions that participants make credibility judgments using a questionnaire after observing the complainant's emotional demeanor. It states that studies have reported that distressed complainants are perceived as more credible than emotionally flat counterparts (e.g., Kaufmann et al., 2003)."

    "justification": "The paper discusses a typical study design where participants' credibility judgments are assessed using experimental setups where the complainant's level of distress vs. controlled affect is manipulated via video or written descriptions. The credibility judgments are then measured through questionnaires (e.g., Ask & Landstr\u00f6m, 2010; Hackett et al., 2008)."

    "measured_by": "Credibility measures including believability, credibility, and truthfulness items",
    "justification": "The content analysis tracked various types of items used in credibility measures. For example, all studies included face-valid items such as believability, credibility, and truthfulness (Table 6). This indicates these measures assess the credibility constructed based on the complainant's emotional display."
