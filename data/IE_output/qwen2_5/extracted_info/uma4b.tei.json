    "justification": "The paper uses the Prospect Valence Learning Delta (PVL-Delta) model within the IGT to simulate how agents autonomously decide to join or abstain from collaborative decision-making groups. This model is tailored to capture the utility, learning, and choice processes related to autonomy."

    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence Sharing in Groups",
    "measured_by": "Expectancy Aggregation Simulation",
    "justification": "The study models confidence sharing in collaborative decision-making as an aggregation of expectancies across group members, with group choice defined as the alternative with the highest pooled expectancy. This reflects the interaction and communication dynamics involved in confidence sharing."

    "topic_or_construct": "Knowledge of Counterfactual Outcomes",
    "measured_by": "lnteractive Voting and Confidence Sharing Simulations",
    "justification": "The simulations compare scenarios where agents are given counterfactual knowledge versus those where they are not. Changes in collaboration rates and decision-making preferences are observed, indicating the influence of counterfactual knowledge on group dynamics."
