    "justification": "The paper describes experiments where the TTB heuristic was used to utilize a ranking of features in decision-making tasks. Participants were more likely to apply the single cue heuristic when the correct ranking of attributes was known (Experiment 1). The ergonomic use of known feature rankings led to the emergence of the single cue decision-making strategy as a resource-rational solution."

    "measured_by": "Equal Weighting Heuristic",
    "justification": "The study found that participants were likely to adopt equal weighting strategies in environments where the directions of features were known (Experiment 2). Participants were provided with positive feature directions, and their behavior aligned with the equal weighting heuristic, indicating it was ecologically rational in this environment."

    "measured_by": "Bounded Meta-Learned Inference (BMI)",
    "justification": "BMI is used as an algorithmic framework to predict human decision-making strategies in various environments. The paper's simulations and experiments demonstrate that BMI can discover different heuristics based on the environmental properties and can predict when participants use such strategies (e.g., in Experiments 1-3)."

    "measured_by": "Ideal Observer Model",
    "justification": "The Ideal Observer model was used across multiple experimental conditions to compare human performance against a normative benchmark. In environments lacking additional side information like ranking or direction, participants integrated information from multiple features in a manner similar to the Ideal Observer (Experiment 3)."
