    "measured_by": "Moral dilemmas using realistic, historical scenarios",
    "justification": "The study used 13 realistic moral dilemmas based on historical events to assess participants' reliance on cost-benefit reasoning in decision-making. For example, participants were presented with a scenario on a tilting ferry where they must decide whether to push a man blocking the escape ladder off to save others."

    "topic_or_construct": "Rule-based decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Moral dilemmas using realistic, historical scenarios",
    "justification": "Participants' rule-based decision-making was measured through the same realistic historical scenarios, assessing their inclination to follow pre-existing moral rules rather than calculating the costs and benefits of their actions. This was demonstrated by their choices in various dilemmas like deciding not to push the man off the ladder in the ferry scenario."

    "measured_by": "RLMC-MD model predictions and experimental outcomes",
    "justification": "The model of RL-based meta-control over moral decision-making (RLMC-MD) was used to predict participants' reliance on rules versus cost-benefit reasoning based on experiential feedback. The experimental outcomes demonstrated participants' flexible learning, aligning qualitatively with the model predictions by adapting their reliance on CBR or rules depending on past outcomes."

    "measured_by": "Proportion of CBR-based choices over trials in the experiment",
    "justification": "Participants' learning trajectory was measured by tracking the proportion of cost-benefit reasoning choices over the course of 13 trials. This proportion adapted over time depending on whether CBR or rule-based options led to better outcomes in the experimental scenarios."
