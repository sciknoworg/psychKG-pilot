    "measured_by": "Discrete choice between rankings",
    "justification": "The second measure involves participants selecting between two predetermined rankings, a mechanism used to explore whether choosing between rankings influences conjunction fallacy rates. This is evident in the study's design where participants were 'asked to choose which ranking they agreed with.'"
