    "measured_by": "Analogy learning",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how analogy learning, such as pretending the bat is travelling up the side of a mountain in table tennis, is used to reduce mental computational load by off-loading computations onto the body, improving athletic performance in high-pressure situations."

    "topic_or_construct": "Tactical Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Strategic positioning",
    "justification": "The paper explains that in beach volleyball, strategic positioning is measured through the use of less energy-intensive tactics when fatigued, demonstrating how the body's physical state constrains generated options and reduces mental computation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Pacing Strategies",
    "measured_by": "Cardiac interoception",
    "justification": "Athletes' reliance on cardiac changes as feedback during cycling tasks, such as hearing a faster heart rate leading to higher perceived effort, illustrates how heart rate as an interoceptive measure is used to make pacing decisions and reduce mental computation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Anticipation",
    "measured_by": "Sensorimotor simulation",
    "justification": "The paper mentions that athletes use sensorimotor simulation to anticipate others' movements, an example being professional basketball players who can predict free throw outcomes earlier and more accurately through this embodied mechanism."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Making under Fatigue",
    "measured_by": "ActionPossibilities Constraining",
    "justification": "Physical fatigue is noted to affect athletes' decision making by increasing the likelihood of making energy-conserving decisions, where the body\u2019s diminished capabilities directly constrain the mental action possibilities, reducing mental computation load."
