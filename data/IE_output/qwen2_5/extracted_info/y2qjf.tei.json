    "justification": "The Q-learning model estimates the value belief (Q-value) of each choice option based on participants' choices and received outcomes. The \u03b2 parameter, an inverse temperature parameter, indicates how deterministic the choices are, reflecting value sensitivity to reward probabilities. This model captures individuals' exploitation-exploration tendencies during reward-based learning."

    "justification": "The Q-learning model uses a positive learning rate \u03b1gain to determine the extent to which the Q-value of the chosen option is updated by unexpected positive reward prediction errors (RPE). This parameter helps in understanding how individuals adjust their value beliefs based on positive feedback."

    "justification": "The Q-learning model employs a negative learning rate \u03b1loss to determine the extent to which the Q-value of the chosen option is updated by unexpected negative reward prediction errors (RPE). This parameter allows researchers to assess how individuals learn from negative feedback."

    "justification": "Pupil dilations during the choice and feedback phases of the probabilistic decision-making task were measured and associated with value beliefs and RPEs. These pupillometry data provided insights into uncertainty-related effects on value computation and updating during the task."

    "justification": "The LC-MRI contrast ratio was derived from participants' FLASH brainstem scans to assess the LC integrity, which is considered a potential indicator of NE functioning. The LC-MRI contrast was used to examine age-related differences in LC structure, and its association with cognitive performance during reward-based learning was explored."
