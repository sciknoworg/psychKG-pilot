    "topic_or_construct": "Self-confidence",
    "measured_by": "Proportion of opt-out responses",
    "justification": "The study inferred self-confidence by tracking how often subjects chose an opt-out option in visual discrimination tasks, as this reflected their willingness to avoid making a decision when uncertain (mentioned in the section about opt-out selection reflecting confidence)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Self-confidence",
    "measured_by": "Median reaction time in correct non-optout trials",
    "justification": "The median reaction time in trials without the opt-out option was used as another indicator of confidence, as slower reaction times in correct trials were associated with greater uncertainty, signaling lower self-confidence (explained in the sections on reaction times as confidence proxies)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Mood",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported mood questionnaire",
    "justification": "Participants reported their mood using a continuous scale in a self-report questionnaire administered twice daily, directly assessing their feelings of happiness or sadness as a key measure of mood (as detailed in the Methods section on self-report questionnaires)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Mood",
    "measured_by": "Overconfidence index",
    "justification": "An overconfidence index was derived to assess confidence indirectly through a normative approach, using signal detection theory. This index, based on decision boundaries, was used to explore its relationship with mood, even though no strong correlations were found at the population level (as discussed in the Results section)."
