    "justification": "The paper discusses the application of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as a tool to formalize risk preferences, particularly for sequential decision-making processes. It notes that CVaR can capture the psychological importance of \u2018outcomes that hurt the most\u2019 and demonstrates how lower values of the risk-sensitivity parameter \u03b1 in CVaR reflect more risk-averse preferences, supporting the evaluation of extreme negative outcomes."

    "measured_by": "Avoidance Behavior Patterns",
    "justification": "The paper highlights how anxiety disorders, characterized by avoidance behaviors, can be modeled using CVaR with low \u03b1 levels. The optimal policies under CVaR resemble the avoidance behaviors observed in anxiety disorders, such as maintaining distance from perceived threats and exhibiting extreme risk aversion."

    "justification": "Worry, a hallmark of anxiety, is described as a chain of negative thoughts and mental problem-solving. The paper suggests that CVaR-driven greedy optimal planning, particularly under risk-averse conditions, mirrors the content and process of worry. Lower \u03b1 levels in CVaR planning lead to increased focus on negative outcomes, resembling pathological worry."

    "justification": "The use of risk-sensitive optimal policies, derived through CVaR models, helps in understanding how individuals with varying degrees of risk aversion (represented by different \u03b1 levels) choose their actions. The paper explores how the optimal policies calculated using CVaR approach become more circuitous and safer for highly risk-averse agents (lower \u03b1)."
