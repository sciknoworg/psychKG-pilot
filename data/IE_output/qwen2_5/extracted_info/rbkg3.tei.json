    "measured_by": "continuous-outcome task",
    "justification": "The paper mentions that the continuous-outcome task has been applied by Harlow and Donaldson (2013) to contrast continuous and threshold accounts of the observed response distributions, directly supporting its use in measuring aspects of source memory."

    "measured_by": "Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves",
    "justification": "The article discusses traditional evidence for threshold models in source memory based on the shape of source ROC curves. Continuous and threshold models make different predictions about these curves, indicating that ROCs are used to assess source memory."

    "topic_or_construct": "recognition memory and source memory",
    "measured_by": "Six-point Old/New confidence scale",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to rate each item on a six-point Old/New confidence scale, allowing researchers to condition source memory judgments based on recognition performance, thereby directly linking this scale to the measurement of both recognition and source memory."

    "topic_or_construct": "memory strength and decision processes",
    "measured_by": "circular diffusion model",
    "justification": "The circular diffusion model was used to investigate memory strength and decision processes in continuous-outcome source memory tasks. It predicted both distributions of decision times and decision outcomes, showing its pertinence to measuring these constructs."

    "justification": "The study refers to this model used by Zhang and Luck (2008) to fit the marginal distribution of response error, which provides a measure of the visual working memory capacity and guessing rate, connecting the model's use to assessing visual working memory."
