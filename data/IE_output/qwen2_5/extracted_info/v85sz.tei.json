    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Blindness",
    "measured_by": "Manipulated Choice Feedback",
    "justification": "The paper details an experimental design where choice blindness is measured by manipulating participants' feedback in their choices between faces, observing if participants accept or correct the manipulation, thus measuring the effect of choice blindness on their responses."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Response Times",
    "measured_by": "Chronometric Measurement",
    "justification": "Response times are measured to indicate the participants' deliberation on manipulated trials. Participants took longer to respond during corrected trials, particularly the first correction, suggesting prolonged processing when false feedback is noticed."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Pupil Dilation",
    "measured_by": "Pupilometry",
    "justification": "Pupil dilation is utilized as an indicator of cognitive processing effort. High levels of pupil dilation are observed in first corrections and accepted trials compared to control trials, reflecting increased cognitive effort when handling false feedback."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Gaze Patterns",
    "measured_by": "Eye Tracking",
    "justification": "Eye tracking is employed to analyze participants' visual attention during choice and feedback phases. Differences in gaze patterns, such as focusing more on the face during corrected trials, provide insight into the cognitive processes underlying response generation."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Correction Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Response to 'Other Preference' Button",
    "justification": "The response to the 'other preference' button is used to correct choice blindness manipulations. A higher proportion of gaze toward this button in later corrected trials indicates participants' awareness of the manipulation."
