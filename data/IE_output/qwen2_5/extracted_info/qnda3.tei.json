    "measured_by": "Probability ratings of absurd theories",
    "justification": "Participants' probability ratings for patently absurd theories were used to measure whether strong advocacy goals could break reality constraints, demonstrating increased endorsement for these theories when the goal was strong."

    "measured_by": "Manipulation of evidence type (ambiguous vs. unambiguous)",
    "justification": "The studies varied the type of evidence (ambiguous vs. unambiguous) to operationalize reality constraints and determine their impact on goal-induced biases. Unambiguous evidence failed to curb biases when participants had strong advocacy goals."

    "justification": "In Study 7, the worst acceptable offer in plea negotiations was used to assess the impact of advocacy goals on practical decision-making, revealing systematic differences in reservation points depending on the strength of the advocacy goal."
