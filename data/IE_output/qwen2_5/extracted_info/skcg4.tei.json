    "justification": "The study used finger tracking to analyze the factors affecting finger movement as participants pointed to a position corresponding to a number on a number line. This tracking provided insights into how the prior (based on the distribution of previous target numbers) influenced the finger's direction before and during target processing."

    "measured_by": "number-to-position mapping task",
    "justification": "The number-to-position task was used in conjunction with finger tracking to examine the role of priors in decision making. Participants converted numerical information into a spatial response, allowing researchers to infer Bayesian models involving the influence of prior distributions."

    "measured_by": "regression analysis with recent trial targets",
    "justification": "The study included regression analyses that considered targets from recent trials (N-1 to N-4) to understand the influence of recent history on the prior representation in decision making. The results showed a significant effect that decreased exponentially for trials farther back."
