    "justification": "The Stroop task assesses cognitive control by instructing participants to name the hue of a color word while inhibiting the automatic tendency to read the word. It is used here to study the plasticity of cognitive control adjustment in response to rewarding stimuli [Krebs et al., 2010]."

    "measured_by": "Eriksen Flanker Task",
    "justification": "The Eriksen Flanker task measures cognitive control by requiring participants to report the identity of a target stimulus surrounded by distractors while resisting the automatic tendency to respond to the distractors. It is utilized in this paper to demonstrate the adaptive allocation of control based on reward and congruence [Braem et al., 2012]."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Control",
    "measured_by": "Visual Search Task",
    "justification": "This task evaluates cognitive control through the allocation of visual attention. Participants search for a target within an array of distracting stimuli, learning to allocate attention more effectively over time based on predictive cues [Lin et al., 2016]."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reward-Driven Learning in Interference Control",
    "measured_by": "Stroop and Flanker Paradigms",
    "justification": "These paradigms are used to examine how people adapt their control allocation based on potential rewards or features predicting incongruence. The LVOC model simulates these tasks to show reward's impact on the adjustment of cognitive control [Krebs et al., 2010; Braem et al., 2012]."

    "topic_or_construct": "Attentional Control",
    "measured_by": "Visual Search Task",
    "justification": "The visual search task is employed to investigate how participants learn to allocate attention to specific locations based on predictive features, demonstrating the plasticity of attentional control [Lin et al., 2016]."
