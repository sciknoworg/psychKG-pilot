    "justification": "The models presented in the paper use interconnected perceptual decision accumulators to operationalize situational awareness in complex decision-making scenarios involving AV-human interactions, exemplifying this concept through pedestrian crossing decisions and safety-critical take-over situations."

    "measured_by": "drift-diffusion models",
    "justification": "The pedestrian crossing decision model utilizes a drift-diffusion model, where accumulators represent accumulation of evidence for different perceptual decisions (e.g., about vehicle movement and intentions), providing a neurobiologically plausible mechanism for decision-making."

    "justification": "The model for safety-critical take-over scenarios employs neurobiologically plausible models that interconnect perceptual decision units to simulate avoidance maneuvers, reflecting how different decisions influence subsequent actions in dynamic traffic scenarios."
