    "measured_by": "VBDM tasks",
    "justification": "The paper states that VBDM provides a framework and set of experimental tools to explain the internal processes that underlie discrete choices. By fitting decision models to behavioral data, VBDM quantifies subjective values of stimuli and predicts outcome choices, as shown in their description of fitting models to participants' reaction times and error data in a VBDM task."

    "topic_or_construct": "Recovery from addiction",
    "measured_by": "VBDM parameters and response thresholds",
    "justification": "The authors suggest that recovery from addiction is attributed to changes in VBDM parameters (such as evidence accumulation rates for substance use and substance-free activities, as well as response thresholds). They propose that these parameters can predict long-term behavioral allocations during recovery, and illustrate these changes in Figures 1 and 2."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reinforcement pathologies in addiction",
    "measured_by": "Hyperbolic discounting measures",
    "justification": "The paper references hyperbolic discounting as a central aspect of substance use disorders, citing studies that confirm addiction is associated with elevated hyperbolic discounting (MacKillop et al., 2011). It notes that this measure is used to assess the increased value of immediate substance use over delayed substance-free alternatives."

    "topic_or_construct": "Substance use reinforcement",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral Economic (BE) accounts and hypothetical purchase tasks",
    "justification": "The text discusses the use of BE indices and hypothetical purchase tasks as ways to measure the value or reinforcement gained from substance use compared to alternative activities. For example, the availability of substance-free rewarding activities is discussed as a common factor in the recovery process, and BE measures are used to assess individual differences in reinforcement patterns."

    "topic_or_construct": "Attentional biases in addiction",
    "measured_by": "Attention Bias Modification",
    "justification": "The paper mentions that selective attention to choice options influences value signals, and attenuation of attentional biases for substance-related cues via Attention Bias Modification techniques could suppress evidence accumulation for substance use, as assessed using tasks that involve the presentation of substance-related cues."
