    "justification": "The study measured participants' interpretations of probability phrases by asking them to provide a point-estimate, minimum, and maximum probability (between 0 and 100) for each phrase. This approach enabled the researchers to evaluate the variability and range of interpretations, supporting the study's hypotheses."

    "measured_by": "Positive and Negative Clinical Framing Conditions",
    "justification": "Participants were presented with probability phrases in the context of hypothetical clinical scenarios (positive and negative framing) and asked to quantify them. This methodology was used to assess how framing conditions influence the interpretation of probabilistic language, revealing a decrease in probability estimates when phrases were presented in a clinical context."

    "topic_or_construct": "Variability in phrase interpretation",
    "measured_by": "Categorization of phrases as 'broad' or 'narrow'",
    "justification": "The researchers categorized probability phrases into 'broad' and 'narrow' categories based on the range of interpretations.  The study design included analyzing the variances and ranges assigned by participants to test these pre-defined categories and support the hypothesis that people are aware of which phrases are more broadly interpreted."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "High vs. Low probability categorization",
    "measured_by": "Classification of phrases into 'High' and 'Low' probability categories",
    "justification": "Based on previous literature, the study categorized phrases into 'high' and 'low' probability categories. This classification was used as a basis to test the hypothesis that phrases expected to convey higher probabilities were indeed interpreted as such by participants compared to those expected to convey lower probabilities."
