    "topic_or_construct": "autism spectrum phenotypes",
    "measured_by": "Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ)",
    "justification": "The BAPQ is used to measure autism-related phenotypes across three domains: social aloofness, behavioral rigidity, and pragmatic language. The study adopts the BAPQ to quantify autism traits in a large online sample."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive flexibility",
    "measured_by": "restless three-armed bandit task",
    "justification": "The study employs a variant of a classic bandit task to examine how individuals learn and explore in an uncertain environment, particularly assessing components of cognitive flexibility such as shifting between exploiting and exploring."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "executive function",
    "measured_by": "Hidden Markov Model (HMM)",
    "justification": "The HMM is used to model exploration and exploitation behaviors as latent goal states underlying choices, inferring the frequency and bouts of exploratory behaviors during the decision-making task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reward-guided decision making",
    "measured_by": "restless three-armed bandit task",
    "justification": "The bandit task involves participants learning reward probabilities through experience, which is used to examine their latent cognitive strategies related to reward-guided decision making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "social behavior-related phenotypes",
    "measured_by": "BAPQ aloof subscale",
    "justification": "The BAPQ aloof subscale is emphasized as the strongest predictor of changes in decision-making strategies, indicating its relationship with social communication-related phenotypes."
