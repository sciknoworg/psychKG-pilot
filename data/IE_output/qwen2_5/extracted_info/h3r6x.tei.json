    "justification": "The paper measures risk preferences by analyzing how people's choice probabilities deviate from classical economic theory based on expected value and by estimating an \u03b1 parameter that captures risk aversion or seeking, thus discerning risk-averse, risk-neutral, and risk-seeking behaviors."

    "measured_by": "Drift-Diffusion Models with Salience Parameters (e.g., evDDM+sal, maDDM+sal)",
    "justification": "Salience is measured through drift-diffusion models that include parameters accounting for the influence of salient attributes. This is indicated by models that incorporate the effect of attribute salience on decision-making via differential evidence accumulation rates."

    "justification": "Different decision integration strategies, including integrate-then-compare, compare-then-integrate, and combined-comparison models, are measured via drift-diffusion models. These models analyze how expected values and individual attributes are processed and combined during decision-making."
