    "measured_by": "Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11)",
    "justification": "The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale was used to assess participants' degree of trait impulsivity. This self-report questionnaire consists of 30 statements rated on a 4-point Likert scale, with total scores associated with reduced dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability and enhanced dopamine release in the striatum. The scores served as a proxy measure of baseline dopamine function in the exploratory analyses."

    "measured_by": "Cognitive Effort Discounting Task (COGED)",
    "justification": "The COGED task was employed to explicitly quantify the subjective value of cognitive control by assessing participants' choices between more demanding N-back tasks for more money versus the easiest N-back task for less money. Participants' choices in this task were used to derive their subjective values, reflecting the motivational aspect of cognitive control rather than just the ability to perform the task."

    "measured_by": "Digit Span Test",
    "justification": "The digit span test was used to assess participants\u2019 baseline working memory capacity. This neuropsychological test involves participants repeating sequences of numbers forward and backwards, providing a score used as a proxy measure of baseline dopamine function. Working memory scores were included in exploratory analyses to determine if they moderatet demographic and condition-based effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "Need for Cognition",
    "measured_by": "Need for Cognition Scale",
    "justification": "The Need for Cognition Scale was included to investigate participants' tendency (trait) to engage in effortful tasks. It is a self-report questionnaire where participants rate 18 statements on a 5-point Likert scale, with scores reflecting their overall preference for cognitive challenges. Scores did not predict significant changes in subjective value but were measured as an exploratory factor."
