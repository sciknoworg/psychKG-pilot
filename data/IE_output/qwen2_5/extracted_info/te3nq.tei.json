    "measured_by": "Two-Arm Bandit Learning Task",
    "justification": "Participants learned that actions led to positive nonverbal feedback (smiling faces) from different individuals and then showed changes in action preferences related to the devalued individuals after reading negative vignettes. This task was used to measure how the devaluation of social outcomes influences subsequent behavior."

    "measured_by": "Ratings of Faces",
    "justification": "Participants rated the faces of the individuals on various social variables such as friendliness, trustworthiness, and likability before and after exposure to vignettes. The changes in these ratings were used to measure the impact of learning new information on explicit evaluations."

    "measured_by": "Action Preference Task",
    "justification": "Participants chose between actions associated with the smiling faces of different individuals in an extinction phase, indicating their preference without receiving feedback. This task was used to measure changes in action preferences based on the value of social outcomes."

    "measured_by": "Two-Arm Bandit Learning Accuracy and Reaction Time",
    "justification": "Accuracy and reaction time on the two-arm bandit task measured how participants learned the associations between actions and social feedback outcomes. The data supported changes in learning behavior based on the devaluation of outcomes before learning."
