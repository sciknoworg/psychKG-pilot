    "justification": "The paper uses the Reinforcement Learning-Working Memory-Linear Ballistic Accumulator (RLWM-LBA) model in combination with Electroencephalography (EEG) to analyze how RL and WM interact in decision-making processes during learning tasks."

    "measured_by": "Centro-parietal Positivity (CPP)",
    "justification": "The paper identifies a centro-parietal positivity (CPP) signal in the EEG data which is shown to vary systematically with drift rate estimates from the RLWM-LBA model, suggesting it represents evidence accumulation processes during reinforcement learning decisions."

    "measured_by": "Model-derived Drift Rates",
    "justification": "The study analyzes EEG signals in conjunction with model-derived drift rates from the RLWM-LBA model, demonstrating that EEG-derived CPP buildup rates improve the model's fit to choice and response time, supporting the role of drift rates in decision dynamics."

    "measured_by": "RLWM-LBA Model Q-RL Values",
    "justification": "The RLWM-LBA model's Q-RL (reinforcement learning) value estimates were found to incrementally increase with learning, independent of the set size, providing neural evidence linked to reinforcement learning processes."

    "measured_by": "RLWM-LBA Model Q-WM Values",
    "justification": "The RLWM-LBA model's Q-WM (working memory) value estimates, along with combined drift rate estimates, showed strong dependency on set size, and these values decayed over trials, indicating the working memory component's influence in learning tasks."
