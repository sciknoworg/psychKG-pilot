    "measured_by": "Number line estimation tasks",
    "justification": "Performance on fraction number-line estimation tasks has been shown to be correlated with and predictive of future overall math achievement, as it measures the ability to accurately map fractions onto a number line, a skill crucial for interpreting health statistics."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Natural number bias",
    "measured_by": "Objective numeracy scales",
    "justification": "Decision-making researchers often rely on measures like the Rasch-based numeracy scale and the Berlin numeracy scale, which require people to calculate to solve math problems and thus capture their ability to reason with rational numbers."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Natural number bias",
    "measured_by": "Educational interventions",
    "justification": "Research by Thompson et al. (2021) demonstrated an educational intervention that included analogies, worked examples, and number-line visual displays improved participants' ability to compare case-fatality rates, suggesting these components can help people bypass their natural number bias."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective numeracy",
    "measured_by": "Subjective numeracy scale",
    "justification": "The subjective numeracy scale measures self-reported math ability without the need for calculations, providing a distinct but correlated measure of numeracy compared to objective measures and avoiding issues with calculation-based tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Math anxiety",
    "measured_by": "Single-item math anxiety scale",
    "justification": "Math anxiety affects how people reason with numerical health information; it can be assessed with a single-item scale measuring apprehension about math, which relates to performance on objective and subjective numeracy measures."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Ratio bias and denominator neglect",
    "measured_by": "Ratio judgment tasks (e.g., jellybean bowl scenarios)",
    "justification": "Studies have used jellybean bowl scenarios to assess ratio bias, where participants tend to focus on absolute numbers rather than proportions, indicating a failure to attend to the relation between numbers."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Health numeracy",
    "measured_by": "Visual risk communication tools (icon arrays, risk ladders, number lines)",
    "justification": "Decision-making researchers have developed visual tools like icon arrays and risk ladders to help individuals interpret health statistics more accurately by presenting information in a format that bypasses cognitive biases."
