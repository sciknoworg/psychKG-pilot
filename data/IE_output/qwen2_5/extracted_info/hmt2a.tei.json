    "justification": "The two-stage Markov task is used to evaluate individual's inclination for MF vs. MB learning. By analyzing participants' likelihood of repeating their first-stage choice based on reward outcomes and transition types, researchers aim to measure individual's inclination for MF and MB learning (Daw et al., 2011)."

    "justification": "The proposed task adapts local change adaptation (LoCA) within the structure of the two-stage Markov task to more effectively distinguish between MF and MB learning. Performance is assessed by the fraction of instances it reaches state T2 instead of T1 during Phase III, evaluating an individual's inclination for MB learning based on local knowledge integration."
