    "justification": "The paper describes how UTE is measured using a decision-making experimental paradigm where the quality of participants' decisions is compared across different modes of thought, specifically unconscious thought (UT), conscious thought (CT), and immediate decision (IM) conditions. This format allows for direct assessment of UTE."

    "justification": "UTT\u2019s core hypotheses predicting the superiority of unconscious thought over conscious thought in complex decision-making are tested using a problem-solving paradigm that compares decision quality across modes of thought. This setup is central to evaluating UTT."

    "justification": "The core claim that unconscious thought outperforms conscious thought and immediate decision-making is measured by experimental designs that directly contrast these modes of thought (MOT), providing a controlled method to assess differences in decision-making effectiveness."
