    "justification": "The paper describes that eye-tracking is increasingly being used to measure attention more directly, based on the eye-mind hypothesis that people generally look at the information they are thinking about. The study utilizes WebGazer, a JavaScript toolbox, to monitor participants\u2019 eye movements online while making food choices, thus measuring attention."

    "justification": "The study aims to replicate the robust links between gaze and choice documented in previous literature by utilizing WebGazer for online eye-tracking. Participants were tracked during a hypothetical food choice task, allowing the researchers to measure dwell times and fixation locations as indicators of value-based attention during decision-making."
