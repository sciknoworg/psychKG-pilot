    "topic_or_construct": "Perceptual Threshold for Spider Detection",
    "measured_by": "Adaptive Staircasing Method",
    "justification": "The study uses adaptive staircasing to determine the absolute threshold at which spider and crab stimuli are identified with 75% accuracy, illustrating the sensitivity for phylogenetically salient stimuli like spiders."

    "topic_or_construct": "Top-Down and Bottom-Up Influences on Perceptual Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Hierarchical Drift Diffusion Modeling (HDDM)",
    "justification": "HDDM is employed to examine how spider and crab cues influence decision-making components, particularly the starting point (z) and the rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate, v) in the context of perceptual decision-making tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Speed and Accuracy of Perceptual Decisions",
    "measured_by": "2x2 Repeated-Measures ANOVA",
    "justification": "The analysis investigates effects of cue and stimulus type on accuracy and reaction time, showing that spider cues enhance detection speed and accuracy for spider stimuli specifically."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Perceptual Sensitivity and Criterion Shift",
    "measured_by": "Signal Detection Theory (d', c)",
    "justification": "Signal detection measures like perceptual sensitivity (d') indicate that spider cues result in better discrimination between spider and crab stimuli compared to crab cues, providing insight into perceptual decision quality."
