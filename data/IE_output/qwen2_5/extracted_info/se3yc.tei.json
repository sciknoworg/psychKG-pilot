    "measured_by": "EVT-Ratings",
    "justification": "The study employed EVT-Ratings, which utilized a fictional scenario for participants to evaluate specific tasks identified from the Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) in terms of success expectancy, value, and cost, revealing which tasks seafarers perceive as more effective for energy-efficient operations."

    "measured_by": "Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale (BPNSWS)",
    "justification": "Seafarers' basic psychological needs at work were measured using the BPNSWS, which includes eight items each for the satisfaction and frustration of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This scale helped identify that autonomy was significantly lower than other needs, highlighting areas for potential improvement in workplace practices."

    "measured_by": "Preferences for Automation Types Scale (PATS)",
    "justification": "The PATS was used to measure seafarers' preferences for different levels of automation in tasks related to EERP, revealing strong preferences for automation in information acquisition and analysis, but a preference for human control in decision selection. This reflects how seafarers want automation and human interaction to be balanced."

    "measured_by": "Critical Decision Method (CDM) adapted interviews",
    "justification": "The decision-making processes during energy-efficient route planning were explored through task-analysing interviews adapted from CDM. Participants created route plans with a decision support system in a simulator, followed by analysis using thematic coding to understand the factors influencing their decisions."
