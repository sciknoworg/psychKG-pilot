    "topic_or_construct": "Animacy perception",
    "measured_by": "Likelihood of choosing longer-shown faces as more animate",
    "justification": "The study used a procedure where participants were shown two facial images with artificial features and made to choose which was perceived as more animate. Results indicated participants chose longer-shown faces as more animate, suggesting this method effectively measured animacy perception."

    "topic_or_construct": "Preference judgment",
    "measured_by": "Choice of preferred facial images",
    "justification": "In Study 1b, participants were asked to choose their preferred facial images following the exposure manipulation. The analysis showed that preference judgments were influenced by the longer exposure time, similar to animacy perception, indicating this method measures preference."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Roundness judgment (low-level perception control)",
    "measured_by": "Choice of rounder facial images",
    "justification": "Study 1c involved participants choosing which face appeared rounder, independent of exposure duration effects. The lack of significant results for roundness judgments compared to animacy indicates this task served as a control for low-level visual perception."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Mere exposure effect on animacy",
    "measured_by": "Mixed logistic models analyzing presentation duration and participant choices",
    "justification": "The statistical models predicted choices of animate faces based on presentation duration in arbitrary and fixed eye movement conditions. The results showed that longer exposure duration facilitated animacy perception in both conditions."
