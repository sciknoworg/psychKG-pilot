    "justification": "Participants were exposed to a series of hypothetical lotteries, and their acceptance or rejection of these lotteries was recorded. The experiment measures loss aversion by observing how participants' choices were influenced by the distribution of gains and losses in decoy lotteries, as indicated by the statement, 'The acceptance rate of balance gambles by A was only 27%, while that by B was 57%, suggesting that loss sensitivity varies with the skewness of decoy gambles.'"
