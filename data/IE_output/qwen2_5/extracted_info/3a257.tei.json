    "measured_by": "Baptist's groupthink scales",
    "justification": "The study uses Baptist's (2015) scales to measure groupthink variables, including Highly Cohesive, Promotional Leadership, Conformity, Concurrence Seeking, Anxiety, Collective Efficacy, Hidden Profiles, and Trust. The surveys were arranged on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, enabling the assessment of these aspects quantitatively."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Highly Cohesive",
    "measured_by": "Items from the groupthink scale",
    "justification": "In this study, items from the groupthink scale were used to measure the level of cohesion within groups. High mean scores (>3.50) indicate a perception that the groups were highly cohesive, reflecting the potential for groupthink in these conditions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Conformity",
    "measured_by": "Items from the groupthink scale",
    "justification": "The study applies items from the groupthink scale to measure self-censorship, indicating participants' reluctance to express disagreement. For instance, items like 'I often failed to express disagreement' scored a mean of 3.82, reflecting significant conformity within the groups."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Concurrence Seeking",
    "measured_by": "Items from the groupthink scale",
    "justification": "Items from the groupthink scale measuring mindguarding and pressure not to 'rock the boat' were used. High scores (4.27) on these items indicated strong pressure within groups to avoid disagreement and maintain superficial harmony."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Anxiety",
    "measured_by": "Items from the groupthink scale",
    "justification": "Anxiety as a variable was measured with items from the scale. However, findings revealed that most anxiety-related items scored low (<2.30), suggesting that anxiety did not significantly affect the participants' thinking and expression."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Collective Efficacy",
    "measured_by": "Items from the groupthink scale",
    "justification": "The collective efficacy of groups in reaching a consensus was measured using survey items. Mean scores below 2.27 for items such as 'Our group often discussed unique information' suggest that collective efficacy was low among the participants."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Trust",
    "measured_by": "Items from the groupthink scale",
    "justification": "Survey items about trust showed that while the environment was perceived as supportive, items relating to freedom of expression within the group scored lower. This indicates a possible contradiction where trust may hinder diverse viewpoints due to a fear of breaking group cohesion."
