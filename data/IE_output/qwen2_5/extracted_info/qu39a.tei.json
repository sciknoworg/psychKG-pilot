    "justification": "Participants were instructed to choose between two options by pressing either 'f' or 'j' keys, with the intent of observing randomness and predictability in their choices in the absence of meaningful decision cues."

    "measured_by": "Various statistical models including Logistic regression and KNN",
    "justification": "The study employed several predictive models like logistic regression, KNN, and decision trees to forecast the participants' choices, aiming to gauge the predictability of human behavior in trivial decision-making tasks."

    "justification": "The research observed a bias towards the left-hand option, suggesting potential influence of hand dominance on decisions, as per literature on motor fluency and abstract concepts."
