    "measured_by": "Bystander Intervention Model (BIM)",
    "justification": "The BIM includes five sequential decision-making steps affecting bystander behavior: notice a need, interpret the situation as requiring intervention, assume personal responsibility, choose an intervention strategy, and take action. It has been applied across multiple contexts, demonstrating its role as a measurement tool for bystander intervention."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Preventive Focus",
    "measured_by": "Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT)",
    "justification": "RFT explains the dual motivational systems of prevention and promotion, with a preventive focus generally concerned with protecting against losses and maintaining security. This theory is used to measure how a bystander\u2019s chronic or situational focus influences their decision-making and behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Promotive Focus",
    "measured_by": "Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT)",
    "justification": "A person with a promotive focus is generally concerned with gains and actualizing their ideals and aspirations. Regulatory focus theory measures how this motivational system influences bystander behavior, aiming to identify potential benefits to others."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Positive Reinforcement",
    "measured_by": "Reinforcement Theory from Behavioral Science",
    "justification": "Behavioral science theories emphasize reinforcement strategies. Positive reinforcement, such as rewarding desired behaviors, can be used to measure and encourage prosocial bystander behavior. Prior research on reinforcement has been extended to include positive reinforcement in bystander paradigms."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Upstanding for Promotion-Prevention",
    "measured_by": "UPP Model",
    "justification": "The Upstanding for Promotion-Prevention (UPP) model adapts the BIM by adding promotion-oriented concepts such as promotion scope of intervention, promotive focus, and positive reinforcement. This model serves as a measurement tool for assessing both promotion and prevention in bystander behavior."
