    "measured_by": "probabilistic subjective survival expectations",
    "justification": "The article details that the forecasting errors were measured using responses to a probabilistic question on survival in the ELSA dataset. Participants were asked about their chances of living to a certain age, and this response was compared to a statistically derived true expected value based on population life tables."

    "topic_or_construct": "phenotypic IQ",
    "measured_by": "composite score of cognitive function tasks",
    "justification": "The paper employs a variety of cognitive tasks from the ELSA data, including memory tasks, executive function tasks, fluid intelligence tasks, etc., to create a 'phenotypic IQ' composite score, which is then used to assess its relationship with forecasting errors."

    "topic_or_construct": "polygenic scores (PGSs) for IQ and educational attainment",
    "measured_by": "genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics",
    "justification": "The study uses polygenic scores derived from GWAS for both IQ and educational attainment as measures of genetic predisposition, taken from large GWAS summary statistics for these traits."
