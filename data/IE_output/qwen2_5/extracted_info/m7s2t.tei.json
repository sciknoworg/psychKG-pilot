    "justification": "The paper explicitly states that EFs are assessed using the WCST. The text mentions, 'Executive functions (EFs) could benefit from exergames under depressive conditions. EFs are related to the ability to organize information, planning, reasoning, decision making and problem solving. These functions are essential in our daily life activities.' It also details how the WCST measures executive function outputs like categorization and shifting rules, making it a valid tool for assessing EFs."

    "measured_by": "Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II)",
    "justification": "The BDI-II is used to measure the severity of depression as mentioned in the text: 'To measure the severity of depression, we will use the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II). It assesses the severity of depressive symptoms through a 21-item questionnaire with each item scored on a Likert-type scale from 0 to 3.' This indicates the BDI-II as a tool for quantifying depression levels."
