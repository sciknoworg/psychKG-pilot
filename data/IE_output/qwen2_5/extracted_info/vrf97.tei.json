    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)",
    "justification": "The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) is used to measure an individual's ability to reflect upon a question before answering and inhibit the immediate response, particularly in security-related contexts. The CRT presents questions with intuitive yet incorrect answers, and answering correctly requires deliberate thinking. It functions as a measure of engaging system 2 processing and suppressing system 1 thinking."

    "measured_by": "Optimism Vulnerability Task (OVT)",
    "justification": "The OVT is a measure of unrealistic optimism for software security, which builds upon the finding that individuals tend to underestimate the likelihood of negative events affecting them compared to others. Participants estimate the likelihood of specific vulnerabilities existing in web applications developed by 'average developers' and in their own code, thereby quantifying optimism bias specific to the software development domain."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Aversion",
    "measured_by": "Gambling Task",
    "justification": "Risk aversion was measured using a gambling task adapted from Frederick (2005). Participants were presented with questions contrasting gain and loss scenarios, enabling the assessment of their preference for sure gains or losses versus risky options. This task operationalizes risk aversion by quantifying participants' willingness to accept certain versus probabilistic outcomes."
