    "justification": "The NDBI-Fi was used to characterize the fidelity with which SLPs implemented NDBI strategies during recorded sessions. It is an observational rating scale consisting of nine items, with six items measuring developmental strategies and three items related to behavioral strategies."

    "topic_or_construct": "Developmental Strategies Usage",
    "measured_by": "Developmental Strategies Items on NDBI-Fi",
    "justification": "The NDBI-Fi measures developmental strategy fidelity, and the scale shows significantly higher fidelity in use of developmental strategies compared to behavioral strategies among SLPs. This includes 'modeling appropriate language,' 'following the child's lead,' and 'positive affect and animation'."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Behavioral Strategies Usage",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral Strategies Items on NDBI-Fi",
    "justification": "The NDBI-Fi measured the fidelity of behavioral strategy implementation, such as 'communication temptations' and 'prompting hierarchies'. Results showed lower mean scores for behavioral strategies compared to developmental ones, suggesting less frequent use."

    "topic_or_construct": "Strategies/Activities Recommended to Caregivers",
    "measured_by": "Qualitative Coding of EI Sessions",
    "justification": "Qualitative content analyses identified 28 unique strategies and activities SLPs advised caregivers to use, covering categories like communication supports, developmental and behavioral strategies, emotional/sensory regulation, and sibling interactions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Child Skills, Behaviors, and Developmental Domains Discussed",
    "measured_by": "Qualitative Coding of Caregiver-SLP Conversations",
    "justification": "Qualitative coding of session transcripts identified 30 specific behaviors, skills, and developmental domains discussed by caregiver-SLP conversations, including focus areas such as spoken language, play, and emotional regulation."

    "topic_or_construct": "NDBI Strategy Fidelity",
    "measured_by": "Fidelity Scores Derived from NDBI-Fi",
    "justification": "The study computed mean scores from the NDBI-Fi to assess how well SLPs implemented strategies during sessions. Scores varied widely, with developmental strategies significantly higher than behavioral strategies."
