    "justification": "The paper discusses how subjective reward functions including the 'Expect' component model hedonic adaptation, where agents 'habituate' to rewards. The 'Expect' component is based on the difference between the objective reward and a prior expectation, representing how agents adapt over time."

    "measured_by": "Subjective reward function with 'Compare' component",
    "justification": "The study employs the 'Compare' component in the subjective reward function, which compares the actual reward to an aspiration level, effectively modeling how people evaluate outcomes relative to their aspirations."

    "justification": "The paper uses multi-armed bandit experiments to demonstrate how agents' happiness and performance change with different dynamic aspiration levels, connecting it to psychological research on income aspirations."

    "measured_by": "Multi-armed bandit environment simulations",
    "justification": "The bandit tasks simulate decision-making under uncertainty by allowing agents to choose between various options (arms) which provide stochastic rewards, providing a model for human decision-making processes."
