    "measured_by": "compositionally-structured bandit task",
    "justification": "The paper uses the compositionally-structured bandit task, where participants choose dishes to offer alien customers, to measure how humans apply compositional generalization in reinforcement learning settings. The results demonstrate higher rewards in compositional contexts compared to simple ones, indicating that participants effectively combine knowledge from past contexts."

    "measured_by": "reward obtained on the first trial of compositional contexts",
    "justification": "The study employs the first trial rewards for compositional contexts as a measure of transfer learning. Participants scored significantly higher on these trials even before direct experience with the context, showing they applied knowledge from earlier simple contexts to novel compositionally structured ones."

    "topic_or_construct": "exploration vs. exploitation in decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Shannon entropy of the distribution over participants' choices",
    "justification": "Shannon entropy of choice distributions is used to quantify exploration behavior. Participants exhibited less exploration in compositional contexts, as indicated by lower entropy values, suggesting they exploited gained knowledge through compositional structures effectively."
