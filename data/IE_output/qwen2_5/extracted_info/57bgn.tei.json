    "topic_or_construct": "Intention Offloading",
    "measured_by": "Intention Offloading Task",
    "justification": "The Intention Offloading Task was used to investigate the process of setting reminders for delayed intentions at various memory loads. It allowed participants to drag circles to the correct locations, either by memory or using external cues created through reminders, thus directly assessing intention offloading behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Interplay of Physical Effort and Memory Load on Offloading",
    "measured_by": "Effort Manipulation within the Task",
    "justification": "The study incorporated a manipulation of physical effort required to set reminders in conjunction with varying memory loads, implemented through clicking tasks. This allowed measurement of how effort changes offloading strategies at different task difficulties."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive Evaluation",
    "measured_by": "Metacognitive Judgements",
    "justification": "Participants provided self-predicted metacognitive judgements about their task accuracy. This measurement uncovered participants' confidence levels in their internal memory abilities, showing their underconfidence which influenced offloading decisions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Strategic Use of Reminders",
    "measured_by": "Externalizing Proportion",
    "justification": "The proportion of delayed intentions for which participants set external reminders was calculated as the externalizing proportion. This metric directly measured the strategic behavior of participants in using reminders when faced with varying levels of task difficulty and physical effort."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Task Performance",
    "measured_by": "Target Accuracy",
    "justification": "Target accuracy was measured as the proportion of special circles correctly moved to their target sides. This reflected the effectiveness of intention offloading strategies used by participants across different conditions."
