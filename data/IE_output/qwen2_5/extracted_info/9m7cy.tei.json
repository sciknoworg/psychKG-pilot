    "measured_by": "Domain-specific importance assignment",
    "justification": "Participants assigned percentage weights to cognitive ability, conscientiousness, and interview scores, reflecting their beliefs about predictor importance. The accuracy of these beliefs was calculated by comparing them with the algorithm\u2019s relative weights, providing a measure of participants' accurate knowledge about predictor validities."

    "measured_by": "International Cognitive Ability Resource",
    "justification": "Cognitive ability is assessed using the International Cognitive Ability Resource (ICAR) matrix reasoning and letter and number series tests. The composite score of these standardized tests reflects cognitive performance, aligning with the construct of cognitive ability essential for information processing."
