    "justification": "The text describes the use of the drift-diffusion model to account for observed choice accuracy and reaction times in perceptual decision-making tasks, clearly linking the psychological construct with this specific measurement instrument."

    "measured_by": "drift-diffusion model (DDM) variants",
    "justification": "The paper discusses various DDM variants and their impact on choice accuracy and reaction times, indicating that these constructs are measured through modifications to the standard DDM, such as introducing time-variant gain on either the drift rate or noise term."

    "topic_or_construct": "urgency signal influence on decision-making",
    "measured_by": "DDM with time-variant gain modulation",
    "justification": "The manipulation of time-variant gain on the drift rate or noise term in the DDM is used to simulate the effects of urgency signals, showing different behavioral outcomes in terms of correct and error reaction times."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "trial-to-trial variability",
    "measured_by": "DDM with trial-to-trial variability parameters",
    "justification": "Although trial-to-trial variability in the drift rate and starting point is not directly the focus of the study, the paper mentions that such variability can lead to longer error RTs, indicating this as a related measurement approach within the domain of perceptual decision-making."
