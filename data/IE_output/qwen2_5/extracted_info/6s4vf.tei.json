    "topic_or_construct": "Background uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Wheel of Fortune task",
    "justification": "In Study 1 and Study 3, a wheel of fortune was used to manipulate background uncertainty, where participants observed the wheel spinning during decision-making tasks, creating a context of uncertainty. This method varied between ambiguity (unknown probabilities) and risk (known probabilities) conditions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "Lottery decision task",
    "justification": "The lottery decision task, as used in Study 1, involved participants deciding between gambles and fixed payouts with varying probabilities. This task directly measured risk-taking behavior by assessing choices under different uncertainty conditions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)",
    "justification": "The BART was used in Studies 2 and 3 to measure risk preferences. Participants virtually inflated balloons for rewards, with the risk of the balloon bursting and losing all accumulated rewards, providing a behavioral measure of risk-taking."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "Multiple Price List (MPL)",
    "justification": "Study 4 employed the MPL to measure risk preferences. Participants chose between pairs of lotteries with differing probabilities and payoffs, enabling the evaluation of individual risk aversion under specific manipulations of background uncertainty."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "Single Choice Lottery (SCL)",
    "justification": "The SCL was used in Study 4 as a measure of risk preference where participants chose a single lottery from a menu with different risk levels. This method provided insight into how background uncertainty affects choices in a direct choice format."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "Bomb Risk Elicitation Task (BRET)",
    "justification": "The BRET was also utilized in Study 4. Participants collected boxes in a task where a randomly placed bomb could erase all rewards, measuring their willingness to take risks and how background uncertainty alters this behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Background ambiguity",
    "measured_by": "Virtual reality elevation",
    "justification": "In Study 2, the effect of background ambiguity was measured using an immersive virtual reality task where participants were elevated or on the ground while performing the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, creating a context of ambiguous risk."
