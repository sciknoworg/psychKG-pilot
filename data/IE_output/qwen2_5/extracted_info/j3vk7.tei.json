    "topic_or_construct": "Child welfare decision-making noise",
    "measured_by": "Vignette studies with global and domain-specific assessments",
    "justification": "The study uses vignette studies to present standardized case descriptions to child welfare workers and compares their assessments. This method measures noise in decision-making by examining variability in judgments, as it isolates individual differences rather than case-specific factors."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Inter-rater variability in child welfare assessments",
    "measured_by": "Gwet AC2 inter-rater reliability measure",
    "justification": "Gwet's AC2 was utilized to measure inter-rater reliability, evaluating the degree of agreement among child welfare workers in their assessments of the vignettes, especially since it's robust to missing data and flexible in handling various data structures."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Level noise in child welfare assessments",
    "measured_by": "Calculation of mean rating variance across vignettes",
    "justification": "The mean rating for each rater across all vignettes was computed, followed by the variance of these mean ratings to measure level noise, which represents the systematic differences in mean ratings by individual raters regardless of specific vignettes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Pattern noise in child welfare assessments",
    "measured_by": "Analysis of idiosyncratic variability across vignettes",
    "justification": "Pattern noise was examined by investigating the idiosyncratic noise arising across raters and varying vignettes, aiming to understand variability not attributable to the overall leniency or strictness of a particular rater."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Forecasting accuracy in child welfare decisions",
    "measured_by": "Comparison between social workers' predictions and actual outcomes",
    "justification": "The forecasting accuracy was assessed by comparing social workers' predictions about future events or actions with the actual outcomes, evaluating the reliability and validity of these forecasts in practice."
