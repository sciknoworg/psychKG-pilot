    "topic_or_construct": "Risk-taking behavior",
    "measured_by": "Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)",
    "justification": "The BART is a classical dynamic sequential risky-taking task under uncertainty, used to measure participants' risk-taking behavior. Higher pumping in BART is associated with a higher propensity for risk-taking behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Neurocognitive response during decision-making",
    "measured_by": "N2 ERP component",
    "justification": "The N2 component, observed in electrophysiological recordings, reflects cognitive conflict during stimuli processing. A more negative N2 in the peer competition condition suggests that participants experience higher conflict during decision-making, indicating enhanced cognitive control."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Feedback evaluation neural response",
    "measured_by": "Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) ERP",
    "justification": "The FRN is a negative-going ERPs component, indicating the monitoring of unfavorable events. The difference wave of FRN was greater under peer competition compared to the single condition, showing stronger sensitivity to loss aversion in competitive contexts."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Neurocognitive response to feedback value",
    "measured_by": "P300 ERP component",
    "justification": "The P300 reflects attentional resource allocation and the subjective importance of the desired outcome. A more positive P300 amplitude in the single condition suggests greater investment of psychological resources in outcome evaluation for conditions where participants keep all rewards."
