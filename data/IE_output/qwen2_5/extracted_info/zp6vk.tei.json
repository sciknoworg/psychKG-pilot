    "measured_by": "Cannon Blast task (two-step gamified task)",
    "justification": "The Cannon Blast task, a gamified and validated adaptation of the classic two-step decision-making task, was used to assess model-based decision-making by capturing participants' ability to learn task structure and make goal-directed decisions based on that structure."

    "topic_or_construct": "reducible uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "computational modeling variance",
    "justification": "Computational modeling was employed to quantify reducible uncertainty as the variance of the probability distribution over task structure learning, providing an individual-level estimate of subjective uncertainty that participants faced during the task."

    "topic_or_construct": "compulsivity and intrusive thought",
    "measured_by": "self-reported transdiagnostic symptom measure",
    "justification": "Compulsivity and intrusive thought were measured using a self-reported transdiagnostic symptom measure, designed to approximate broader symptom dimensions linked to goal-directed decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "anxious depression",
    "measured_by": "self-reported transdiagnostic symptom measure",
    "justification": "Anxious depression was assessed using a self-reported transdiagnostic symptom measure, capturing anxiety and depression dimensions associated with model-based decision-making in the context of this study."

    "topic_or_construct": "social withdrawal",
    "measured_by": "self-reported transdiagnostic symptom measure",
    "justification": "Social withdrawal was measured using a self-reported transdiagnostic symptom measure, addressing the transdiagnostic dimension linked with underlying cognitive and decision-making processes explored in the study."

    "measured_by": "Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8)",
    "justification": "Depressive symptoms were quantified using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), a well-established tool for assessing state depression severity in participants."

    "measured_by": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment (GAD-7)",
    "justification": "Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment (GAD-7), a validated instrument designed to measure state anxiety across participants."
