    "justification": "The adapted weight-lifting task was used to measure how children and adults estimate the weight of objects when they anticipate lifting with or without help, effectively assessing their intuitive cost-benefit analysis in joint actions."

    "measured_by": "Weight estimation using a standard object",
    "justification": "Estimating weight using a standard object was used to measure participants' perception of their own and others' action capabilities, including how this perception changes with the presence of a helping partner."

    "measured_by": "Weight-lifting task with varying social relationships",
    "justification": "The weight-lifting task was adapted to study how social relationships with co-actors (e.g., strangers, parents, siblings) influence the perception of weight and the anticipated effort involved in joint actions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Joint action efficiency estimation",
    "measured_by": "Differential ratios of weight estimations before and after lifting",
    "justification": "Differential ratios of weight estimations provided before and after lifting were used to measure how accurately children and adults estimated the efficiency and effort required in various joint actions with different partners."
