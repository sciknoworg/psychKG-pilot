    "justification": "The article discusses how reinforcement learning models, particularly through a probabilistic reversal learning task, are used to assess reward sensitivity and learning rates in individuals with depression. It specifies that anhedonia, a hallmark symptom of MDD, has been operationalized using a scaling parameter indicating how strongly individuals value rewards, derived from such tasks (Huys et al., 2015)."

    "measured_by": "Model-based and model-free reinforcement learning tasks",
    "justification": "The text explains that reinforcement learning models can dissociate anhedonia-related deficits in reward sensitivity from impairments in reward learning in depression, using computational models that distinguish between model-based and model-free learning components during tasks involving reward processing (Huys et al., 2015)."

    "justification": "The article describes how the working memory-reinforcement learning model uses a probabilistic reward learning task to investigate the interplay between working memory and model-free learning driven by reward prediction errors, showing how weighting parameters dynamically adjust based on task demands (Ahn et al., 2020)."

    "justification": "The paper states that incorporating interoceptive dimensions into computational models, such as Bayesian models applied to cardiac and respiratory data in anxiety-related contexts, demonstrates how reinforcement learning can account for bodily signals integrated with external stimuli for more comprehensive insights into psychiatric dysfunctions (Smith et al., 2021)."

    "measured_by": "Probabilistic reward learning task",
    "justification": "The text explains that a perseverative behavior pattern observed in addiction during the probabilistic reward learning task indicates diminished goal-directed control, whereas in OCD, it indicates intact positive and negative outcome-driven learning, but a greater switching between model-free and model-based strategies, as measured by these tasks (Kanen et al., 2021)."
