    "measured_by": "order of symptom presentation in case descriptions",
    "justification": "The study evaluated anchoring bias by manipulating the order of symptom presentation in case descriptions to see if participants favored diagnoses matching the first symptoms presented. However, the results showed a preference for diagnoses matching the last-presented symptoms, suggesting a recency effect instead of anchoring."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "confirmation bias",
    "measured_by": "information seeking behavior",
    "justification": "Confirmation bias was assessed by observing participants' requests for follow-up information that could confirm their preferred diagnosis rather than information supporting an alternative diagnosis. The study found marginal support for confirmation bias when the data from three experiments were pooled."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "overconfidence",
    "measured_by": "confidence ratings on a 10-point scale",
    "justification": "Overconfidence was measured through participants' confidence ratings for diagnostic decisions on a 10-point scale. Participants who consistently favored one diagnosis and sought confirming information showed increased confidence, which may indicate overconfidence."
