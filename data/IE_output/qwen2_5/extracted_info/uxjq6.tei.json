    "topic_or_construct": "Effort-related decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Demand Avoidance Paradigm, Effort Discounting Paradigm",
    "justification": "The study utilized these paradigms to assess how children make decisions related to effort. The Demand Avoidance Paradigm involved children choosing between a low-effort and high-effort option implicitly, while the Effort Discounting Paradigm made the effort explicit and involved choosing between different levels of effort and reward."

    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognition",
    "measured_by": "Metacognition Paradigm",
    "justification": "The Metacognition Paradigm provided a measure of children's insight into their task performance. Participants rated their performance on a scale after completing an attentional switch task with varying levels of effort, without the differences in switch numbers being made explicit."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Effort perception",
    "measured_by": "Child adapted NASA Task Load Index",
    "justification": "The Effort Experience Paradigm employed the NASA Task Load Index to evaluate children's perceptions of cognitive effort and mental demand during the attentional switch task, indicating their subjective experience of difficulty."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Task performance",
    "measured_by": "Attentional switch task, d' measure based on hits and false alarms",
    "justification": "Task performance was quantified by the d' metric, which involved calculating correct detections (hits) minus incorrect detections (false alarms) from the attentional switch task, allowing for a measure of children's ability to perform under different effort conditions."
