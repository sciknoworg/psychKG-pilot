    "topic_or_construct": "Attributions of confidence in others",
    "measured_by": "Confidence estimates from participant reports",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to rate how confident they thought the other agent was in their choices on a slider from 0 ('not confident at all') to 100 ('very confident'), directly measuring their attributions of confidence towards the agents, whether human or artificial."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognition in decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Difficulty and response times as cues to confidence",
    "justification": "The study operated under the assumption that task difficulty and observed response times acted as cues participants used to infer others' confidence. These factors were integrated into the model which generated observed behaviors of agents."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Self-directe metacognition",
    "measured_by": "RHmeta-d model",
    "justification": "The RHmeta-d model, an extension of the HMeta-d model, was used to quantify metacognitive efficiency as a measure of self-directed metacognition. This model helped operationalize and evaluate participants' insights into their own performance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Other-directed metacognition",
    "measured_by": "Difference between slopes on accurate vs. inaccurate trials",
    "justification": "Other-directed metacognition was operationalized by assessing the difference between slopes on accurate versus inaccurate trials based on participants' confidence attributions for each agent, illuminating how participants inferred others' metacognitive states."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Advice-taking behavior",
    "measured_by": "Participants' choice revisions after receiving advice",
    "justification": "Advice-taking was measured by participants' willingness to change their initial choices after receiving advice from other agents, quantifying their trust and confidence in the advice based on the agent type (AI vs. human)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social impressions of trustworthiness and competence",
    "measured_by": "Participants' ratings of agents' trustworthiness and competence",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to rate the trustworthiness and competence of the agents using specific scales, demonstrating how confidence attributions influenced broader social impressions of the agents."
