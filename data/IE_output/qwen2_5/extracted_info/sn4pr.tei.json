    "topic_or_construct": "Relational Obligation",
    "measured_by": "Relation closeness, moral obligation, and concern over letting down scales",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to indicate how close they felt to each person, the moral obligation felt toward each person, and how bad it would feel to let that person down. These dimensions were combined into a composite variable termed relational obligation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social Desirability",
    "measured_by": "Social Desirability Scale",
    "justification": "The Social Desirability Scale was included to assess sensitivity to experimental demand. It was found to be positively associated with self-control decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Socially Motivated Self-Control",
    "measured_by": "Study-specific manipulation and choice behavior",
    "justification": "Socially motivated self-control was measured through the impact of manipulating social construal on participants' decision-making in time allocation tasks, where they chose between self-control tasks and immediately gratifying alternatives."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Interpersonal Reactivity",
    "measured_by": "Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)",
    "justification": "The IRI was used to measure interpersonal reactivity, which was found to predict less time allocated to self-control behaviors in the linear mixed effects model predicting time allocation choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Self-Regulation",
    "measured_by": "Various self-regulation measures including Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), Difficulty with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Considerations of Future Consequences Scale (CFC), Domain Specific Risk-Taking Scale (DOSPERT), and self-efficacy scales",
    "justification": "The paper included a battery of self-regulation measures to understand their effects on self-control behavior. These measures were included as predictors in the models to address various questions about domain-general and social/self-control processes."
