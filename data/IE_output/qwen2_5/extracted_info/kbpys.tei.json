    "measured_by": "Response Time in Puzzle Completion Task",
    "justification": "The study uses a pathfinding puzzle task where participant response time (fast vs. slow) in solving the puzzle is recorded to gauge children's ability to infer whether the agent was figuring out the answer or remembering it. This method measures children's intuitive understanding that thinking takes time."

    "topic_or_construct": "Speed-Accuracy Tradeoffs",
    "measured_by": "Judgment Accuracy of Agent's Answers Based on Speed",
    "justification": "Participants judged whether a faster or slower responding agent was more likely to have figured out the correct answer, integrating perceptions of speed with expected accuracy to assess the trade-offs between speed and accuracy in problem-solving."

    "topic_or_construct": "Timing-Based Inferences",
    "measured_by": "Participants' Ratings of Agent Competence Based on Response Time",
    "justification": "The experiment measures whether children can use an agent's response speed (fast or slow) to infer relative competence, as assessed by children\u2019s judgments of which agent is better at solving the task after observing their response times."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Task Difficulty Integration",
    "measured_by": "Inference Accuracy with Varying Map Difficulty",
    "justification": "Children's ability to integrate task difficulty into time-based inferences is measured by examining their judgments of the agent's response when presented with either easy or hard puzzles after observing their response time."
