    "measured_by": "exploration task",
    "justification": "The study used a child-friendly decision-making task designed to assess the influence of novelty and uncertainty on exploratory choice across development. This task measures the exploration-exploitation balance by presenting participants with choices between novel and familiar options with varying levels of reward uncertainty."

    "topic_or_construct": "novelty preference",
    "measured_by": "exploration task",
    "justification": "The task dissociates sensory novelty by presenting participants with both previously encountered and novel hiding spots, allowing the measurement of participants' preference for novel stimuli across different developmental stages."

    "topic_or_construct": "uncertainty aversion",
    "measured_by": "exploration task",
    "justification": "The task manipulates reward uncertainty by varying the probabilities associated with different hiding spots, enabling the assessment of participants' aversion to uncertain options as they age."

    "topic_or_construct": "expected value computation",
    "measured_by": "exploration task",
    "justification": "Participants' ability to compute the expected value of different options is measured through their choices within each block of the task, where the optimal choice is determined by the reward probabilities associated with each hiding spot."

    "topic_or_construct": "developmental changes in exploration",
    "measured_by": "exploration task",
    "justification": "The task compares the choices of children, adolescents, and adults, providing insights into how novelty preference and uncertainty aversion contribute to the developmental shift from more exploratory to more exploitative behavior."
