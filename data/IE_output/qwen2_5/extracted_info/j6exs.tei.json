    "measured_by": "Bespoke Neighbourhoods",
    "justification": "With access to higher-resolution geographical data, researchers construct 'bespoke neighbourhoods' to characterize a respondent's neighbours, such as by average social class, to measure neighbourhood effects in voting behaviour. This method provides evidence of the spatial influence of geographic contexts on voting choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Conscientiousness",
    "measured_by": "Big Five Inventory",
    "justification": "The study includes mean values for Conscientiousness derived from the Big Five Inventory as part of the psychological variables linked to mathematical models predicting voting behaviour. The effect of constituency-level Conscientiousness on voting outcomes is statistically significant and exceeds the minimum effect size of interest."

    "topic_or_construct": "Right-wing Authoritarianism (RWA)",
    "measured_by": "Authoritarianism measures (Evans, Heath, and Lalljee, 1996)",
    "justification": "The research uses an existing but 'non-standard' instrument to measure RWA, which correlates with individual voting choices and demonstrates a significant effect at the neighbourhood level on voting conservative in the presence of other individual and demographic factors."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Openness",
    "measured_by": "Big Five Inventory",
    "justification": "Using the Big Five Inventory as a measurement instrument, the paper portrays a moderate relationship between neighbourhood Openness and individual voting patterns. Specifically, constituency-level Openness does not show a clear neighbourhood effect, which contrasts with results from other psychological constructs."
