    "measured_by": "Adult Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)",
    "justification": "The study utilized the Adult Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) to assess autistic-like traits in participants, aiming to relate these traits to decision-making parameters in a diffusion model framework. This was based on prior literature suggesting associations between AQ scores and various cognitive processes."

    "measured_by": "Diffusion model framework",
    "justification": "The diffusion model framework was employed to analyze the impact of prior information on motion coherence discrimination. This model enables greater insights into the cognitive processes underlying task performance by modeling decision-making as noisy evidence accumulation towards decision boundaries."

    "measured_by": "Bayesian, hierarchical Wiener diffusion model",
    "justification": "A Bayesian, hierarchical Wiener diffusion model was used to investigate how autistic-like traits correlate with the use of prior probability information in decision-making. This model was specifically fitted to response time and accuracy data from a task involving probabilistic cueing for motion direction discrimination."

    "topic_or_construct": "Starting point bias in decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Diffusion model parameter",
    "justification": "The diffusion model was used to examine whether starting point bias in decision-making processes varies with levels of autistic-like traits. Specifically, the model estimated the starting point parameter \u03b2, which reflects the influence of valid and invalid cues on the accumulation of sensory evidence."

    "topic_or_construct": "Response caution",
    "measured_by": "Diffusion model parameter",
    "justification": "The diffusion model parameter boundary separation \u03b1 was used to assess whether individuals with higher levels of autistic-like traits exhibit greater response caution compared to those with lower levels."
