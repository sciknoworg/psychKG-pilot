    "measured_by": " Bayesian inference (prior distributions)",
    "justification": "The paper focused on constructing informative prior distributions for parameters of the Diffusion Decision Model (DDM), which included drift rate, boundary separation, starting point, and non-decision time. These priors were derived by reviewing existing literature and fitting theoretical distributions to empirical parameter estimates, supporting their role in Bayesian cognitive modeling."

    "measured_by": "Diffusion Decision Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The DDM is discussed as a tool for decomposing speed-accuracy trade-offs in decision-making by modeling evidence accumulation over time. The model's parameters\u2014drift rate, boundary separation, and others\u2014quantify different cognitive processes underlying this trade-off."

    "topic_or_construct": "Response Caution",
    "measured_by": "Boundary separation (a) of the DDM",
    "justification": "Boundary separation in the DDM directly measures response caution, with smaller values indicating a willingness to respond quickly at the cost of accuracy, while larger values indicate greater caution and accuracy."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Response Bias",
    "measured_by": "Mean starting point (z) and relative starting point (z_r) of the DDM",
    "justification": "The starting point parameter in the DDM reflects response bias, indicating an initial predisposition towards one response over another. The relative starting point (z_r = z/a) provides a normalized measure of this bias."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Evidence Accumulation Rate",
    "measured_by": "Drift rate (v) of the DDM",
    "justification": "Drift rate in the DDM represents the rate at which evidence accumulates towards a decision boundary. Higher drift rates indicate faster and more accurate responses, reflecting a subject\u2019s ability and stimulus discrimination."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Non-decision Time",
    "measured_by": "Mean non-decision time (T_er) in the DDM",
    "justification": "Non-decision time in the DDM represents the duration of processes not directly related to evidence accumulation, such as sensory encoding and motor response execution."
