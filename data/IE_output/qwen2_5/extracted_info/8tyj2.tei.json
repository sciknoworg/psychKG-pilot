    "measured_by": "vignette-based experimental studies",
    "justification": "The principle of discrimination was assessed using vignette experiments, where participants judged the morality of attacking civilians versus soldiers. Watkins and Laham (2018) found that U.S. participants judged the killing of civilians more harshly than the killing of soldiers, supporting this principle."

    "topic_or_construct": "independence thesis",
    "measured_by": "vignette-based experimental studies",
    "justification": "The independence thesis, which states that moral judgments of soldiers' conduct should be independent of the cause of the war, was investigated via vignettes where participants judged the same actions by soldiers on just vs. unjust sides. Watkins and Goodwin (2019) found that participants judged actions on the just side more leniently, indicating an asymmetry."

    "topic_or_construct": "moral judgments in war vs. peace",
    "measured_by": "trolley problem scenarios",
    "justification": "To compare moral judgments in war and peace, researchers used trolley problem vignettes set in both contexts. Watkins & Laham (2019) observed that participants were more likely to accept sacrificing one for many in a war context than in peace, highlighting contextual differences."

    "topic_or_construct": "group alignment and moral judgments",
    "measured_by": "survey and experimental studies",
    "justification": "The influence of group alignment on moral judgments was examined using methods like surveys with varying descriptions of combatants' affiliations. Studies showed that individuals aligned morally with the just war side when presented as third-party observers, affecting their judgments."
