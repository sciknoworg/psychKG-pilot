    "measured_by": "Harvey and Fischer's (1997) ROD-WOA formula",
    "justification": "This formula measures the relative adjustment of initial judgments towards advice, indicating the degree of advice taken, by calculating the ratio of differences between judgments and advice."

    "justification": "The model is used to capture differential anchoring and adjustment processes in a regression framework, addressing limitations of simple arithmetic approaches."

    "measured_by": "Mixed-effects regression model revisiting Logg et al. (2019) data",
    "justification": "The reanalysis using this model provided evidence that laypersons and experts treated algorithmic versus human advice differently, though the original findings were partially extended."

    "topic_or_construct": "Sequential collaboration in advice taking",
    "measured_by": "Regression-based model of advice taking without initial judgments",
    "justification": "The model captures the informational influence along sequential chains, showing that initial judgments were not a prerequisite for estimating advice weighting, unlike traditional methods."

    "topic_or_construct": "Advice weighting with multiple advisors",
    "measured_by": "Multiple regression model with separate weights for individual pieces of advice",
    "justification": "This model allows for estimating distinct weights given to advice from multiple advisors, offering a more nuanced view compared to simplistic total weighting methods."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Duality of advice utilization",
    "measured_by": "Multivariate multilevel regression incorporating judgment shift and confidence change",
    "justification": "The proposed method simultaneously captures advice utilization on judgment shift and confidence dimensions, enriching traditional measures that only focus on judgmental shifts."
