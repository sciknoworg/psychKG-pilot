    "justification": "The paper mentions using the die-rolling task and lie-detection tests to study how people justify lying, reducing ethical dissonance between unethical actions and maintaining a moral self-image (Hochman et al., 2021, Zickfeld et al., 2024)."

    "measured_by": "Sender-receiver game",
    "justification": "Research on relational dishonesty utilizes the sender-receiver game, where one person (sender) communicates information to a receiver, who makes decisions based on it. This setup helps explore how dishonesty operates in relational contexts where lying can directly affect others (Capraro and Vanzo, 2019)."

    "measured_by": "Eye-movement research, Functional MRI",
    "justification": "Eye-movement studies reveal patterns of attention and information processing linked to dishonesty, while fMRI research examines brain regions involved in cognitive control during honesty decisions (Hochman et al., 2016; Dogan et al., 2016)."

    "measured_by": "Resting-state fMRI",
    "justification": "Resting-state fMRI is used to measure default brain connectivity patterns associated with honesty or dishonesty tendencies, providing insights into stable patterns linked to moral default (Yin et al., 2021; Pang et al., 2021)."

    "justification": "Experiments using norm nudging and trust games have demonstrated how social norms positively influence honesty; such interventions can boost tax compliance rates and reduce dishonest behavior in social cooperative contexts (Capraro and Vanzo, 2019; Engelmann and Herrmann, 2016)."
