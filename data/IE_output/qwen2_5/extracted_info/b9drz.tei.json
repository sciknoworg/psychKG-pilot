    "measured_by": "Frequency Estimates",
    "justification": "The conjunction effect was measured through frequency estimates, where participants rated how many of 100 people like the target person fit a particular description, including conjunction conditions ('and', 'and are') and individual conditions (likely, unlikely). This measurement directly assessed the tendency to judge the conjunction of two events as more likely than either event alone."

    "topic_or_construct": "Semantic Ambiguity of 'and'",
    "measured_by": "Comparison between 'and' and 'and are' Conditions",
    "justification": "The semantic ambiguity of the conjunction term 'and' was assessed by comparing frequency estimates in conditions using 'and' versus 'and are'. This comparison aimed to test whether participants' understanding of the conjunction term differed, supporting the idea that the conjunction effect arises from semantic interpretations."

    "topic_or_construct": "Representativeness Heuristic",
    "measured_by": "Likelihood Estimates for Descriptive Scenarios",
    "justification": "The representativeness heuristic was inferred through participants' judgments of how representative Linda or James were of certain categories (e.g., feminists, bank tellers). The study found that the judgment of likelihood was influenced by how well the description matched stereotypical categories."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Gender Effects on Estimations",
    "measured_by": "Gender-Specific Frequency Estimates",
    "justification": "Gender effects were measured by comparing frequency estimates for males and females separately (e.g., females who are Bank Tellers and Feminists, males who are Republicans and Artists). This specific measurement allowed researchers to examine if gender influenced participants' judgments on conjunction tasks."
