    "measured_by": "variable-drift diffusion model",
    "justification": "The study utilizes a variable-drift diffusion model to predict the timing of pedestrian road-crossing decisions based on vehicle kinematics (distance, speed, and deceleration). This model captures observed decision patterns across various scenarios, reflecting its ability to measure pedestrian decision processes."

    "measured_by": "drift diffusion model parameters",
    "justification": "The drift diffusion model parameters such as the damping factor (\u03b1), sensory input scaling (s(t)), and noise term (\u03c3) are used to quantify and measure the accumulation of decision evidence over time. These parameters help explain how pedestrians evaluate and accumulate evidence for deciding when to cross the road."

    "measured_by": "coefficient \u03b2\u03c4",
    "justification": "The study incorporates the time derivative of the generalized time to arrival (\u03c4) as evidence for pedestrian decisions by estimating the coefficient \u03b2\u03c4, which captures pedestrians\u2019 ability to recognize the yielding intent of vehicles. This highlights acceleration estimation as a crucial part of pedestrian decision-making."

    "measured_by": "deceleration magnitude",
    "justification": "The magnitude of vehicle deceleration is considered an implicit form of communication that indicates the vehicle's yielding intent. This is reflected in the yield scenarios where increased deceleration impacts pedestrian crossing behavior, corroborating the variable-drift diffusion model's predictive estimates."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "explicit communication cues",
    "measured_by": "external human-machine interfaces (eHMI)",
    "justification": "eHMI elements, specifically headlight flashes, are incorporated into the model as additional evidence for pedestrian decisions. The study shows that these explicit communication efforts significantly influence crossing decisions when integrated into the decision-making model."
