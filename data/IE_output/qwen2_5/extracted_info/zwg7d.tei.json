    "measured_by": "PCA-derived Affective Distress factor from GAD7, PHQ-9, DASS, RNTQ, and IUS-SF scales",
    "justification": "The study reduced multiple psychopathology scales into a single component labeled Affective Distress using a principal component analysis, which accounted for a significant proportion of variance among measures of anxiety and depression symptomatology."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Anxiety",
    "measured_by": "GAD7 Scale",
    "justification": "The GAD7 is a 7-item scale used to measure the core symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, with excellent internal consistency in this study. It captures anxiety symptoms over a 2-week period using a Likert scale."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Depression",
    "measured_by": "PHQ-9 Scale",
    "justification": "The PHQ-9 is a 9-item scale designed to assess the criteria for depression as per the DSM-5. It measures the severity of depressive symptoms over the past two weeks using a Likert scale, with excellent internal consistency observed."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Depression, Anxiety, and Stress",
    "measured_by": "DASS-21 Scale",
    "justification": "DASS-21 is a 21-item scale used to measure negative affect (depression), physiological arousal (anxiety), and general anxiety/tension (stress). It contains three subscales with excellent internal consistency for each."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Repetitive Negative Thought",
    "measured_by": "RNTQ Scale",
    "justification": "The RNTQ measures trans-diagnostic and disorder-specific repetitive negative thought across four subscales: Worry, Interference, Brooding, and Pessimistic Fixation, with excellent internal consistency shown in the study."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Intolerance of Uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "IUS-SF Scale",
    "justification": "The IUS-SF is a 12-item scale designed to measure aversion to the uncertainty of a negative event occurring, with excellent internal consistency for the total score and subscales in the present study."
