    "measured_by": "Data Quality hitting ratio and offset metrics from online eye-tracking",
    "justification": "The paper discusses the impact of head movements on online eye-tracking data quality, as measured by the hit ratio and offset, indicating worse data quality when subjects move their heads."

    "topic_or_construct": "Wearing Glasses",
    "measured_by": "Hit ratio and offset metrics from online eye-tracking",
    "justification": "The study finds a negative effect of wearing glasses on the hit ratio and offset, suggesting that glasses reduce the spatial resolution of online eye-tracking data."

    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Behavior Prediction",
    "measured_by": "Gaze Distribution and Last Fixation Point",
    "justification": "The paper demonstrates that while overall gaze distribution did not predict choice in an online intertemporal choice task, the last fixation and distribution of gaze points right before decision-making did predict choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Participantinstruction Compliance",
    "measured_by": "Response accuracy in the fixation task",
    "justification": "The paper uses the fixation task accuracy as a measure of compliance with instructions, revealing that most participants followed the gaze fixation instructions, indicating sufficient attention and task understanding."

    "measured_by": "Chromatic Measures of Accuracy and Precision",
    "justification": "The study uses changes in accuracy and precision measures over time as indicators of data quality, revealing the influence of trial sequence on eye-tracking performance."
