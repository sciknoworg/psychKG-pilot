    "justification": "The paper extensively uses and modifies the cumulative prospect theory (CPT) framework to explore probability weighting functions. It specifies how CPT models incorporate probability weighting functions using equations derived from Lattimore, Baker, and Witte's (1992) and Tversky and Kahneman's (1992) formulations. The models predict probability distortions using functions like w(p) = \u03b4p^\u03b3 / (\u03b4p^\u03b3 + (1 - p)^\u03b3)."

    "justification": "Participants completed two numeracy scales: Lipkus et al.'s 11-item scale and Weller et al.'s 8-item abbreviated numeracy scale. These scales assess individuals\u2019 ability to manipulate percentages, proportions, and fractions and their overall fluency with part-whole relationships. Correlations between numeracy scores and CPT model parameters suggest relationships between general numerical skills and decision-making behaviors."

    "measured_by": "Gambling Task Preferences",
    "justification": "Probability distortion was measured through a gambling task where participants chose between gambles and certain outcomes. Certainty equivalents (CEs) were calculated based on participant choices to derive probability weighting curves. These CE data were fit to various CPT models to observe distortions in how probabilities are weighed."

    "justification": "The study manipulated the probability range within a gambling task across full-range (0-100%), upper-range (50-100%), and lower-range (0-50%) conditions. By comparing CE data and model fits, it investigated how different probability ranges influence participants' probability weightings."
