    "justification": "The information adequacy scale (\u03b1 = .74 in Study 1 and \u03b1 = .79 in Study 2) consisted of five self-report items assessing participants' perception of whether the information they received was sufficient, credible, and comprehensive for making a decision. This scale captures the participants' belief that they have adequate information even when exposed to incomplete data, supporting the construct of the illusion of information adequacy."

    "justification": "The decision-making competence scale (\u03b1 = .37 in Study 1, revised to \u03b1 = .76 in Study 2) included five self-report items measuring participants' perceived ability to make competent decisions based on the provided information. The scale demonstrates how participants overestimate their decision-making capabilities regardless of the amount of information they receive."

    "justification": "The consensus item used a 0-to-100 slider assessing participants' belief that others would make the same decision as they did. This item captures the false consensus effect, a tendency to believe that others share one's own beliefs and decisions."
