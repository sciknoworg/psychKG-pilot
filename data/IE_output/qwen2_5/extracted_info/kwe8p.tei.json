    "measured_by": "Minnesota Trust Game (MTG) with Estimated Spite-Guilt Parameter",
    "justification": "The MTG was designed to isolate spite sensitivity, and the estimated spite-guilt parameter was most strongly correlated with choices in the Suspiciousness condition, which targets irrational fear of a partner's likelihood to be spiteful. This parameter proved key to understanding spite-sensitive beliefs about a partner's intentions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Suspiciousness",
    "measured_by": "MTG Suspiciousness Condition",
    "justification": "Behavior in the Suspiciousness condition of the MTG was significantly associated with self-reported suspiciousness measures, such as the Alienation subscale of the MPQ. This condition specifically measures irrational fear of a spiteful partner despite potential risks for the partner."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Aversion",
    "measured_by": "MTG Risk Aversion Conditions (against the coin)",
    "justification": "The Risk Aversion conditions in the MTG, which use a random coin as the decision agent, were designed to disentangle risk-averse behavior from social interactions. Results showed a high correlation among these thresholds, indicating equal risk concern irrespective of temptation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Persecutory Beliefs",
    "measured_by": "MTG Estimated Spite-Guilt Parameter",
    "justification": "The estimated spite-guilt parameter, captured using the computational model, was found to be significantly related to the Suspiciousness condition, suggesting it can quantify persecutory ideations. The model is proposed as a first step towards measuring these beliefs in clinical populations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Alienation (Persecutory Ideations)",
    "measured_by": "Multiphasic Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) - Alienation Subscale",
    "justification": "The MPQ-Alienation scale quantifies suspiciousness in day-to-day life. Higher scores on this subscale were associated with less trust in the Suspiciousness condition of the MTG, replicating previous findings on persecutory ideations."
