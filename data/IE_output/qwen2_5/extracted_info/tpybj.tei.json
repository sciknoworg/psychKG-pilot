    "topic_or_construct": "exploratory shifts of attention",
    "measured_by": "giving-up times (GUTs)",
    "justification": "Participants' GUTs served as an index of behavioral exploitation, with longer GUTs indicating a higher tendency to exploit the current display. The GUTs correlated negatively with task performance, suggesting that shorter GUTs are associated with a greater readiness to explore new options."

    "topic_or_construct": "exploratory shifts of attention",
    "measured_by": "frontopolar cortex (FPC) activity during patch-leaving decisions",
    "justification": "Activity in the FPC, particularly the right lateral FPC, was observed during patch-leaving decisions, correlating negatively with GUTs. Participants with shorter GUTs exhibited stronger FPC activation, indicating a higher inclination towards exploration."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "exploratory shifts of attention",
    "measured_by": "dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activity",
    "justification": "The dACC was active during patch-leaving decisions, possibly encoding the average value of the foraging environment and the costs of foraging. Its activity during patch-leaving may relate to the evaluation of unrewarded target fixations preceding the decision."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "exploratory shifts of attention",
    "measured_by": "temporoparietal junction (TPJ) activity",
    "justification": "The left TPJ showed positive signal changes during patch-leaving, potentially serving as a 'circuit breaker' supporting the disengagement of attention from the current focus. This suggests its role in reallocating attentional resources."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "exploratory shifts of attention",
    "measured_by": "precuneus (Pcu) activity",
    "justification": "Bilateral Pcu activity was observed during patch-leaving decisions, potentially related to attention shifting. This supports its involvement in the cognitive processes underlying exploratory foraging choices."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "exploratory shifts of attention",
    "measured_by": "intraparietal sulcus (IPS) activity",
    "justification": "The IPS showed significant cluster activation during patch-leaving, particularly in participants with shorter GUTs. This indicates its role in modulating attentional control during the decision to leave the current display."
