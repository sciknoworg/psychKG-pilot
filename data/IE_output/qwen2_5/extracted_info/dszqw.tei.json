    "justification": "The study uses k-alternative forced-choice (k-AFC) probabilities from lineup sizes 2 to 7, alongside identification and ranking probabilities from an 8-item simultaneous lineup, to test hypotheses about random-scale and monotonic-likelihood representation, as well as to verify the unequal-variance signal detection theory (UV-SDT) model which represents key psychological constructs of eyewitness memory and decision making."

    "measured_by": "UV-SDT model parameters",
    "justification": "The UV-SDT model's parameters are tested against empirical data to verify their independence and linkage with constructs like discriminability and decision bias. The model accurately predicted eyewitness identification outcomes, linking parameters to psychological constructs such as memory strength and expectation."

    "justification": "The competing high-threshold (HT) and signal detection theory (SDT) models are distinguished using hazard rate predictions derived from ranking data. The HT model predicts monotonically increasing hazard rates, while the SDT model\u2019s predictions are better aligned with non-monotonic hazard rates observed in the empirical data."
