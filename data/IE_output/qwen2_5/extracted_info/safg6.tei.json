    "topic_or_construct": "Narrative Expectations",
    "measured_by": "Predicted stock price changes",
    "justification": "Participants in Experiment 1 predicted future stock price changes based on narrative thinking, particularly showing more optimism for positive news and stronger reactions to future-oriented information. This measurement reflects how narrative expectations influence financial forecasts."

    "topic_or_construct": "Rational Expectations",
    "measured_by": "Baseline predictions and price forecasts",
    "justification": "The study measured participants' baseline predictions and price forecasts to assess the extent to which they aligned with the rational expectations hypothesis. Participants' divergence from these predictions demonstrates how their expectations deviate from rational models."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Behaviorally-Informed Expectations",
    "measured_by": "Short-term momentum and long-term reversion predictions",
    "justification": "Participants' predictions of short-term price momentum followed by long-term reversion in response to news were measured. The findings were compared against behaviorally-informed expectations, showing that participants exhibited stronger and more persistent momentum behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Valence Effect",
    "measured_by": "Portfolio allocation choices",
    "justification": "Experiment 2 used portfolio allocation choices as a measure to study the valence effect, examining how positive versus negative performance surprises influenced participants' decisions to include a security in their portfolio."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Time-Reference Effect",
    "measured_by": "Differences in responses between future and past news",
    "justification": "The study measured the differences in predictions and choices made by participants when given news about the future compared to the past, reflecting the time-reference effect on narrative thinking and financial decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotional Mediation",
    "measured_by": "Net emotion scores (positive minus negative emotions)",
    "justification": "Experiment 3 assessed the role of emotions in mediating financial choice, using net emotion scores as a measure. This captures how affective responses, such as approach and avoidance emotions, influence participants' decision-making."
