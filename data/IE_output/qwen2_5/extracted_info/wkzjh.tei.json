    "topic_or_construct": "habitual action sequences",
    "measured_by": "Two-stage decision-making task",
    "justification": "The paper uses a two-stage decision-making task to investigate whether rats perform habitual action sequences during serial decision-making. Common and rare transitions were utilized in probe tests to discern between habitual chunked action sequences and discrete goal-directed choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "goal-directed planning",
    "measured_by": "Two-stage decision-making task",
    "justification": "The study employs the two-stage decision-making task to assess goal-directed planning. The task's design involves rats making choices based on the outcome of recent trials (rewarded or nonrewarded) in stage 1, indicating a goal-directed approach to maximize reinforcement."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "effect of stress on habitual vs. goal-directed behavior",
    "measured_by": "Acute restraint stress",
    "justification": "The influence of stress on habitual vs. goal-directed behavior was investigated by subjecting rats to acute restraint stress before probe tests. The study evaluated changes in the tendency towards habitual action sequences versus goal-directed control under stressed conditions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "response latency and reaction time",
    "measured_by": "RT measurements for S0 and stage 2",
    "justification": "The study includes reaction time (RT) measurements for the first stage (S0) and the second stage (stage 2) of the task. These measurements were used to assess changes in response timing, particularly under stressed vs. non-stressed conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "discrimination accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Analysis of correct responses",
    "justification": "Discrimination accuracy was analyzed by measuring the percentage of correct responses, which helped in evaluating the performance of rats on common and rare transition trials, indicating their ability to adjust action sequences under stress."
