    "justification": "The paper mentions that mental fatigue affects task performance and physiological states, such as reduced task performance (d-prime) and changes in P3 amplitude and pupil diameter, as shown in the study by Hopstaken et al. (2015). These measurements are used as indicators of the underlying hidden fatigue state in the proposed mathematical model."

    "measured_by": "Task performance metrics, monetary rewards for task completion",
    "justification": "The paper defines cognitive effort allocation using task performance measures and associated monetary rewards. It is assumed that harder tasks lead to higher rewards but also higher psychological costs, which is reflected in the model's reward and cost functions. The agent's cognitive effort is thus estimated by their choices of task difficulty levels aligned with their subjective values and fatigue state."

    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective value",
    "measured_by": "Model parameters (\u03b83), simulated decision data",
    "justification": "Subjective values are estimated using the model's cost and reward functions parameterized by \u03b83. The estimated subjective values from participants' decision data account for the trade-offs between rewards and costs, influenced by the individual's mental fatigue state. The simulation results allow for the quantification of subjective values and their relationship to mental fatigue."
