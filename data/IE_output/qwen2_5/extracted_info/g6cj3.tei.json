    "topic_or_construct": "Parent-adolescent conflict",
    "measured_by": "To(may)to-To(mah)to Interview (TTI)",
    "justification": "The TTI reliably and validly assesses behavioral conflict about daily life topics and parent and youth perceptions of discrepancies between their beliefs (De Los Reyes et al. 2012b). It was used in this study to identify conflict topics for the discussion task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Adolescent risk-taking propensity",
    "measured_by": "Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)",
    "justification": "The youth version of the BART (Lejuez et al. 2007) was used to measure risk-taking propensity as a performance-based task, reflecting decision-making in the context of arousal from receiving immediate feedback."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Physiological regulatory ability (self-regulation)",
    "measured_by": "High-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV)",
    "justification": "HF-HRV, an estimate of parasympathetic control and an indirect measure of prefrontal cortex function, was used to assess self-regulatory ability in adolescents during the discussion and post-task periods. Lower HF-HRV indicates impaired regulation (Lane et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2016)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Adolescent hostile behavior (behavioral arousal)",
    "measured_by": "Hostile Conflict Scale of the Conflict Task Coding System",
    "justification": "The Hostile Conflict Scale was used by trained coders to rate behaviors on a 7-point scale, where higher scores indicate greater hostility. This scale measured hostile behavior, a form of behavioral arousal, during the discussion task, which could influence risk-taking behavior (Ehrlich et al. 2012)."
