    "measured_by": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)",
    "justification": "The study uses EMA to assess elements of functional analysis, capturing real-time data on variables such as situations, responses, and consequences, which are key to functional analysis. This approach provides a detailed understanding of the participants' daily experiences and behaviors."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Case Conceptualization",
    "measured_by": "Functional Analysis (FA)",
    "justification": "The paper highlights that functional analysis serves as a well-established theoretical approach to case conceptualization. It integrates aspects like situations, responses, and consequences, offering a framework to examine the development and maintenance of psychological conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Psychological Networks",
    "measured_by": "Network Analysis (NA)",
    "justification": "Network analysis is applied to model and visualize the relationships among various variables obtained from ecological momentary assessments. This method helps in understanding the interconnections between symptoms and behaviors within an individual."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Anxiety and Depression",
    "measured_by": "Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and Positive Mental Health Scale (PMH)",
    "justification": "The study includes assessments of anxiety and depression using standardized tools like the BSI and PMH both before and after the EMA period to evaluate changes in negative and positive mental health outcomes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Core Beliefs or Schemas",
    "measured_by": "Young Schema Questionnaire - Short Form 3 (YSQ-SF3)",
    "justification": "While not fully incorporated into the daily EMA, the YSQ-SF3 is used as part of the assessments to explore underlying schemas that may influence participants' experiences and behaviors, contributing to a more comprehensive case conceptualization."
