    "justification": "The paper discusses source memory tasks where participants see stimuli in a context (e.g., a speaker's voice, a location), and later report the source when cued with the item. This directly measures source memory as participants are required to recall contextual information."

    "measured_by": "Item recognition and source memory tasks",
    "justification": "Episodic memory, which involves memory for events, is studied experimentally using item recognition and source memory tasks. These tasks assess memory for both the presence of items and their contexts, key aspects of episodic memory."

    "measured_by": "Temporal similarity gradient models",
    "justification": "The paper employs models with temporal similarity gradients that assess how items occurring close in time become associated. These gradients are fitted to data to evaluate intrusion probabilities, showcasing the temporal contiguity effect in source memory."

    "topic_or_construct": "Spatial similarity in memory",
    "measured_by": "Spatial similarity gradient models",
    "justification": "Spatial similarity is measured using gradient models that assess intrusions based on the spatial proximity of the items on the circle. These models demonstrate how spatial contiguity affects intrusions in continuous-outcome tasks."

    "justification": "The circular diffusion model is used to represent evidence accumulation over time in source memory tasks. It models how decision-making processes contribute to both response errors and response times."
