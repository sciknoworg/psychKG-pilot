    "topic_or_construct": "consciousness",
    "measured_by": "bispectral index (BIS)",
    "justification": "The bispectral index (BIS) is commonly used as a measure of anaesthetic depth during procedures; however, it has limitations as demonstrated by cases where it misinterprets EEG signals during recovery. This highlights the need for alternative measures like LZC or perturbation complexity with entropy to more reliably track consciousness."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "unconsciousness during anaesthesia",
    "measured_by": "delta and alpha EEG power",
    "justification": "Increases in delta and alpha EEG power at the onset of unconsciousness during anaesthesia are correlated with the depth of anaesthetic action. The presence of high amplitude alpha and delta oscillations is typical in anesthetized states, providing an indirect index of the unconsciousness induced by anaesthetics."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "EEG markers of anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness",
    "measured_by": "delta and alpha rhythms",
    "justification": "The EEG markers, particularly delta and alpha rhythms, underlie cognitive inhibition in anaesthetized states. These rhythms provide a pharmacological basis of unconscious states due to their correlation with the suppression of conscious and subconscious behaviors respectively."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "spindle-generated activity and depth of unconsciousness",
    "measured_by": "EEG spindles",
    "justification": "Alpha spindles are a classic signature of adequate depth of anaesthesia during intravenous anaesthetics. A drop-out of alpha power is a marker of cortical arousal. Significant attention is paid to this as it is an important marker of the unconscious state during anaesthesia."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "acute memory consolidation",
    "measured_by": "sleep spindles",
    "justification": "Sleep spindles and their presence in various sleep stages have been linked to memory consolidation processes. They can enhance the consolidation of implicit traces and are associated with certain receptors and interplay during learning and memory."
