    "justification": "The article discusses how motor variability is measured by calculating the reaction time (RT) between the presentation of a red circle and the participant's key press. Variability in RT reflects the participants' motor plans and decision-making under risk."

    "justification": "The maximizing expected gain (MEG) RT is used to estimate the optimal selection of aiming points. The distortion of observed RT from the MEG RT is calculated to evaluate how close participants' actual responses are to the optimal plan."

    "measured_by": "set-level mean-variance (SL-MV) model",
    "justification": "The SL-MV model is utilized to consider both the expected gain and the variability in motor outcomes at the set level. The fitting results of the SL-MV model suggest that participants tended to adopt a risk-averse behavior based on the number of chances."
