    "justification": "The single-agent Tiger Task (TT) and the multiagent Interactive Tiger Task (ITT) were designed to assess how cooperation and competition influence choice and prediction behavior. Participants' choices and predictions in the TT and ITT under cooperative and competitive contexts were analyzed to understand their departures from computationally optimal actions."

    "measured_by": "Single-agent Tiger Task (TT) and Interactive Tiger Task (ITT)",
    "justification": "The TT and ITT contexts were used to capture human decision-making processes under uncertainty. In both tasks, participants had to gather information through 'listen' actions to make decisions about opening doors that had probabilistic outcomes, thereby assessing their decision-making strategies."

    "justification": "Participants were required to predict the actions of their partners before making their own choices in the Interactive Tiger Task (ITT). This aspect of the task served as a measure of ToM, indicating participants' ability to model the beliefs and intentions of others."
