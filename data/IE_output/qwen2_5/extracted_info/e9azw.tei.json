    "measured_by": "bandits task",
    "justification": "The paper describes a 'bandits task,' where participants choose between different options (like slot machines) with uncertain rewards, to study how individuals balance exploration of new options against exploitation of familiar choices."

    "measured_by": "Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm",
    "justification": "The UCB algorithm is presented as a method to implement directed exploration by adding an information bonus based on the uncertainty of expected rewards, suggesting its use in measuring this strategy."

    "measured_by": "Thompson sampling",
    "justification": "Thompson sampling, a strategy that adds random noise scaled by uncertainty in options, is described as a means to operationally assess the random exploration strategy in individuals."

    "measured_by": "tasks manipulating the value of exploration",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how tasks designed to manipulate the value of exploration help measure directed and random exploration by observing changes in information-seeking and behavioral variability."

    "topic_or_construct": "directed exploration",
    "measured_by": "neural activity in frontal pole, mesocorticolimbic regions, frontal theta oscillations, and prefrontal dopamine",
    "justification": "The paper associates directed exploration with activity in specific brain areas, such as frontal pole and prefrontal dopamine levels, as indicators of this type of exploration."

    "measured_by": "increased neural variability",
    "justification": "Increased neural variability and loss of choice tuning in decision-making circuits are mentioned as neural markers used to measure random exploration behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "directed exploration vs. random exploration development",
    "measured_by": "traditional bandits tasks, naturalistic tasks, horizon-dependent tasks",
    "justification": "The paper uses various tasks across different developmental stages to measure how directed and random exploration develop differently over the lifespan."
