    "justification": "In Studies 1a and 1b, the authors used a computational model to estimate sampling bias parameters under different cost conditions. The model fitting results showed participants adjusted their sampling bias in response to cost changes."

    "justification": "The article describes the use of the URG model to estimate urgency weights in the expanded judgment task. However, participants' urgency weights were found to be constant rather than varying with cost changes."

    "measured_by": "Expanded judgment task",
    "justification": "The authors used an expanded judgment task to collect behavioral data such as the number of samples used per decision, accumulated evidence, and accuracy. These measures provided insights into decision-making strategies under different cost conditions."
