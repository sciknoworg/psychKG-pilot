    "justification": "The paper describes three experiments where participants learned associations between fantasy animals (Fennimals) and toys in a training phase and then were tested on their choices for new Fennimals, which shared features with the training set Fennimals. This task was used to measure how participants rely on episodic memories to make decisions in novel contexts."

    "topic_or_construct": "directly related episodic memories",
    "measured_by": "Recalling similar Fennimals during test phase",
    "justification": "In Experiment 1, the researchers specifically measured whether participants preferred using directly similar experiences by presenting new Fennimals that shared a feature with previously encountered Fennimals. The results showed participants were more likely to select items previously associated with similar Fennimals, indicating reliance on directly related episodic memories."

    "topic_or_construct": "indirectly related episodic memories",
    "measured_by": "Recalling indirectly related Fennimals when directly similar ones are unavailable",
    "justification": "In Experiment 2, the researchers measured reliance on indirectly related memories by restricting participants' item choices such that selected items were not directly associated with the similar Fennimals. Participants selected items associated with indirectly related Fennimals significantly above chance levels, showing their reliance on indirect memories."
