    "measured_by": "random dot kinematograms (RDKs) with a motion direction estimation task",
    "justification": "The article describes a study wherein the repulsive serial bias is investigated using a continuous motion direction estimation task featuring RDKs. Participants estimated the motion direction of random-dot patterns, revealing faster response times for larger direction differences following the prior stimulus."

    "topic_or_construct": "attractive serial bias",
    "measured_by": "report errors indicating direction of bias",
    "justification": "The text indicates that studies assessing serial bias, including attractive bias, analyzed response errors related to prior stimuli to determine if the current response was biased toward the previous stimulus."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "choices response selection mechanism",
    "measured_by": "response time measures of decision-making",
    "justification": "To investigate decision-making influenced by prior stimuli, the study analyzed response time differences in relation to the similarity between current and prior stimuli. Faster decision times were reportedly linked to dissimilarity due to incorporating prior stimulus information in choice response selection."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "perceptual history effect",
    "measured_by": "response errors between current and prior trial stimuli",
    "justification": "The text mentions the systematic analysis of response errors relative to prior trials as a method to study perceptual history effects, highlighting whether reported perception is biased by recent perceptual experiences."
