    "justification": "The study utilizes a three-context measurement design where participants judge pairs of facial traits (intelligence, dominance, and trustworthiness) under different conditions. Boole's Bell inequalities are then applied to test if the judgements conform to Boole's 'conditions of possible experience,' which helps determine contextuality. Specifically, the data from Face 2 do not show significant disturbance and exhibit a violation of the Bell inequalities, indicating possible contextuality."

    "measured_by": "statistical interference between pairs of facial trait measurements",
    "justification": "Context-sensitivity was examined through significant changes in the probability of one trait depending on what other trait it was co-measured with across different contexts. For both Face 1 and Face 2, the analysis showed significant differences in probability estimates for intelligence, dominance, and trustworthiness when judged with different traits, indicating context-sensitivity."

    "topic_or_construct": "indeterminacy in facial trait judgements",
    "measured_by": " Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) framework",
    "justification": "While the initial statistical tests for Face 2 yield possibly contextual results, applying Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory provides a framework that further verifies the absence of a single underlying probability distribution across measurements. This indeterminate approach supports the presence of incompatibility and indeterminacy in the cognitive judgements of facial traits."
