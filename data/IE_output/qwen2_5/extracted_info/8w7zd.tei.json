    "justification": "The paper discusses using 'test batteries aimed at assessing multiple cognitive abilities with multiple tasks for each ability' as a way to assess individual and species-level variation in primate cognition. This approach aims to capture shared variance across tasks related to the same cognitive ability."

    "measured_by": "specific methodology for memory tasks",
    "justification": "The pilot study conducted as part of ManyPrimates focused on short-term memory, implementing a standardized memory task methodology across multiple sites to generate comparable data. The paper mentions the possibility for further data collection to include additional species for a more comprehensive analysis."
