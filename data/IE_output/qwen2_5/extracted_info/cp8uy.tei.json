    "justification": "The Horizon Task was utilized to explore the balance between exploration and exploitation in decision-making. It allowed researchers to systematically manipulate information availability (equal vs. unequal information) and horizon lengths (short vs. long) to quantify random and directed exploration."

    "topic_or_construct": "Random Exploration",
    "measured_by": "Horizon Task",
    "justification": "Random exploration in the Horizon Task was measured through the choice precision in equal information rounds, estimated by the slope of the empirical choice curve. Lower random exploration was indicated by larger choice precision, which was significantly higher for dyads compared to individuals."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Directed Exploration",
    "measured_by": "Horizon Task",
    "justification": "Directed exploration, the tendency to choose options that provide more information under conditions of unequal information, was also assessed through the Horizon Task. The rate of choosing the more informative option in unequal information rounds did not significantly differ between individuals and dyads."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Horizon Task",
    "justification": "The Horizon Task was used to measure decision accuracy by calculating the proportion of trials in which participants selected the slot machine with the higher mean payout. Accuracy was found to be significantly higher under dyadic conditions compared to individual conditions, particularly in later trials."
