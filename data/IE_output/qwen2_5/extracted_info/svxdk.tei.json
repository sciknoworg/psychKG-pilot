    "topic_or_construct": "Delay Discounting (DD)",
    "measured_by": "Intertemporal choice questionnaire",
    "justification": "The paper states that 'Intertemporal choice questionnaires are administered to measure DD.' It further explains that these questionnaires involve making binary choices between smaller, immediate rewards and larger, delayed rewards."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Delay Discounting (DD) rate",
    "measured_by": "ERN (error-related negativity) and Pe (error positivity)",
    "justification": "The study hypothesized an association between DD rate and EEG markers like ERN and Pe, indicating that these neural measures reflect post-decision processing related to DD. The analysis focused on identifying if these EEG components are modulated by DD rate and choice type."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Post-decisional theta power",
    "measured_by": "Theta-frequency oscillations",
    "justification": "The paper describes a robust association between DD rate, choice, and theta power approximately 200-400 ms post-response. Increased theta power in low DD individuals after immediate reward choices suggests involvement in conflict monitoring and possibly decision evaluation."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward choice behavior",
    "measured_by": "MCQ-27 (monetary choice questionnaire)",
    "justification": "The study used the classic MCQ-27, a questionnaire without correct or incorrect answers, to measure preferences for immediate or delayed rewards, which translates to a single DD rate."
