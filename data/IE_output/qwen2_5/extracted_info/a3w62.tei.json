    "topic_or_construct": "Affective variability",
    "measured_by": "Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)",
    "justification": "The SAM is used to measure mood, physiological activation, and control, which collectively assess affective states. Affective variability is computed from these measures, indicating how these affective states fluctuate over time, as supported by the study's methodology (SAM Cronbach's \u03b1 values demonstrate reliability)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Team workload demands",
    "measured_by": "Team Workload Questionnaire (TWLQ)",
    "justification": "The TWLQ is utilized to assess team workload demands by evaluating components like communication, coordination, team performance monitoring, time-share, team emotion, and team support within cyber defense teams during the exercise. The TWLQ's subscales showed good reliability, supporting its use in measuring team workload."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Mood",
    "measured_by": "Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)",
    "justification": "SAM measures mood on a scale from negative to positive, enabling the assessment of subjects' moods throughout the exercise, which is relevant given the significant role mood plays in interpersonal and team dynamics."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Physiological activation",
    "measured_by": "Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)",
    "justification": "SAM includes a dimension for measuring physiological activation, aimed at capturing the participants' levels of arousal over the course of the cyber defense exercise. Physiological activation is crucial for understanding how stress impacts performance in high-stress operational settings."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Control",
    "measured_by": "Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)",
    "justification": "The SAM tool assesses control, indicating the participants' feelings of self-efficacy during the exercise. This measure is vital as it reflects how much control participants perceive they have over their actions and decisions, impacting their performance."
