    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making under uncertain-risk",
    "measured_by": "Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)",
    "justification": "The BART is a commonly employed task measuring decision-making under uncertain-risk, where participants choose to inflate a virtual balloon, balancing the reward potential with the risk of the balloon exploding. The current study utilizes the BART to examine disadvantageous uncertain-risk reward pursuit in schizophrenia."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived Financial Risk",
    "measured_by": "Financial Risk subscale from the Domain Specific Risk-Taking Scale (DOSPERT)",
    "justification": "Participants indicated how risky they perceived financial situations to be on the DOSPERT Financial Risk subscale. The study hypothesizes that Perceived Financial Risk as measured by DOSPERT would contribute to differences in risk-taking tendencies on the BART in schizophrenia."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Expected Benefit of financial risk-taking",
    "measured_by": "Expected Benefit subscale from the Domain Specific Risk-Taking Scale (DOSPERT)",
    "justification": "The Expected Benefit subscale of the DOSPERT measured participants' perception of the benefits they would obtain from financial situations. The study tested the hypothesis that the expected benefit of financial risk-taking would be associated with risk-taking on the BART."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Defeatist Performance Beliefs",
    "measured_by": "Defeatist Performance Scale (DPS)",
    "justification": "The study used the DPS to measure defeatist beliefs, defined as negative appraisals about one's ability to complete goal-directed tasks. It hypothesizes that defeatist beliefs may impact decision-making but not explain risk-taking tendencies on the BART after controlling for other factors."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Hedonic Tone",
    "measured_by": "Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)",
    "justification": "The SHAPS was used to measure hedonic tone, or the ability to experience pleasure. The study tested if hedonic tone would be associated with risk-taking tendencies on the BART in schizophrenia but found no significant correlation."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Functioning (IQ)",
    "measured_by": "Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)",
    "justification": "The WASI was used to assess general intelligence (IQ) in the study, hypothesizing that IQ may be associated with computational parameters of uncertain-risk decision-making, potentially impacting risk-taking behavior in schizophrenia."
