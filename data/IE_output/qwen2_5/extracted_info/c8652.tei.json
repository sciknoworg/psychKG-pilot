    "topic_or_construct": "lexical access",

    "justification": "The study employs a lexical decision task where participants respond 'yes' or 'no' to letter strings, assessing their lexical access speed and accuracy, as described in the Methods section."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "vocabulary size",
    "measured_by": "novel, precalibrated familiarity measure",
    "justification": "The paper developed and used a novel measure of vocabulary size based on participant accuracy and familiarity ratings across a calibrated list of words, which allowed for evaluating individual differences in lexical representation."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "age-related changes in lexical skills",
    "measured_by": "lexical decision task across different age groups",
    "justification": "The effects of age on lexical access were examined using a lexical decision task with a wide age range of participants from 9 to 90 years old, allowing for analysis of age-related changes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "word familiarity",
    "measured_by": "pilot experiment ratings",
    "justification": "Word familiarity was determined using ratings from a pilot experiment involving a separate set of participants, which were used to filter and categorize words into different familiarity bins."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "lexical decision times",
    "measured_by": "generalized additive modeling (GAM)",
    "justification": "The model was used to analyze the relationship between participant vocabulary size, age, and word familiarity on response times in the lexical decision task, showing complex interactions among these factors."
