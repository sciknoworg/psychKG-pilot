    "measured_by": "Confidence forced-choice method",
    "justification": "The study used the confidence forced-choice technique to assess how sensory uncertainty influences confidence judgments. This allowed the researchers to investigate suprathreshold perceptual decisions where confidence is typically high without ceiling effects. Observers were asked to judge whether they had greater confidence in their first or second decision."

    "measured_by": "Ideal Confidence Observer model and Probability-Difference models",
    "justification": "The Ideal Confidence Observer model and Probability-Difference models were used to assess the confidence computations using probability metrics. These models compare the probability of being correct between intervals and incorporate metacognitive noise and interval bias, providing a framework to evaluate Bayesian confidence calculations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Evidence-Strength metrics",
    "measured_by": "Distance-From-Criterion (DFC) Evidence-Strength models",
    "justification": "The DFC Evidence-Strength models used point estimates from the decision process to compute confidence, with variations including scaled-distance models that account for sensory uncertainty. These models predicted that observers would scale their confidence based on signal-to-noise ratios to avoid paradoxes related to confidence judgments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Heuristic metrics",
    "measured_by": "Heuristic model",
    "justification": "The heuristic model incorporated different sensory cues like dot spread and number to compute confidence, showing that observers could use stimuli-based heuristic cues. It was found that heuristic observers gave significant weight to the number of dots, reflecting a heuristic strategy in easy perceptual decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence agreement",
    "measured_by": "Confidence agreement analysis",
    "justification": "Leveraging unintentional repetition in the experiment (N-pass design), the researchers measured observers' consistency in confidence reports. This analysis showed that the best-fitting models generally underestimated the observers' confidence agreement, indicating potential limitations of the current models."
