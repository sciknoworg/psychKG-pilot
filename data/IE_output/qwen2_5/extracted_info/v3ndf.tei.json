    "topic_or_construct": "Motivational biases",
    "measured_by": "Motivational Go/NoGo Learning Task",
    "justification": "The study employed a well-established probabilistic Motivational Go/NoGo Learning Task that reliably elicits motivational biases in choice behaviour and reaction times. Participants had to learn by trial and error to execute or withhold a response to acquire a desired outcome, with cues valenced for reward or punishment. The task quantified motivational biases as the relative performance difference between bias-congruent and incongruent cues."

    "topic_or_construct": "Anxiety and Depression (AD) symptoms",
    "measured_by": "Composite questionnaire battery",
    "justification": "The study administered a well-established questionnaire battery assessing a wide range of clinical symptoms, including anxiety and depression, to participants. These questionnaires allowed researchers to extract factor scores for the Anxiety-Depression dimension and relate these scores to performance in the motivational Go/NoGo task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Compulsions and Intrusive Thoughts (CIT) symptoms",
    "measured_by": "Composite questionnaire battery",
    "justification": "Similar to the anxiety and depression dimension, a factor analysis identified the Compulsions and Intrusive Thoughts dimension from the questionnaire battery. The results demonstrated how these symptom scores correlated with overall task performance and motivational bias effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive control over Pavlovian biases",
    "measured_by": "Computational RL models with adaptive bias suppression",
    "justification": "Computational reinforcement learning models were employed to dissect how cognitive control is recruited to adaptively suppress Pavlovian biases, especially on incongruent trials. These models included a mechanism for learning the value of control, which was supported particularly for high-scoring AD individuals, highlighting their ability to exert control adaptively."
