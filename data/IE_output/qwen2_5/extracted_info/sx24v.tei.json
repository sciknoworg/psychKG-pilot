    "topic_or_construct": "behavioral predictability",
    "measured_by": "choice entropy",
    "justification": "The study utilized choice entropy as a measure of the predictability of participants' choices. Lower entropy values indicated more predictable behavior. Participants demonstrated lower choice entropy in the cooperative task compared to the competitive task, indicating that they made their behavior more predictable to facilitate cooperation."

    "topic_or_construct": "communication effectiveness",
    "measured_by": "signal informativeness",
    "justification": "In Experiment 2, signal informativeness was used to evaluate the effectiveness of minimal reciprocal communication. It measured the average informational content conveyed by each participant within each block of the cooperative task. Participants who provided more informative signals were also making their behavior more predictable, thus improving cooperation."

    "topic_or_construct": "communication effectiveness",
    "measured_by": "speech entropy",
    "justification": "In Experiment 3, speech entropy was used to quantify the information content of participants' verbal communication in the cooperative task. The entropy was calculated based on the distribution of word usage, providing insight into the efficiency and optimization of verbal communication for successful cooperation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cooperative success",
    "measured_by": "win rate",
    "justification": "The win rate served as a direct measure of cooperative success in the decision-making tasks. Higher win rates were observed in the cooperative task compared to the competitive task across all three experiments, supporting the use of behavioral predictability and communication as strategies to facilitate collaboration."
