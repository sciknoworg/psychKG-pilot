    "justification": "The paper discusses that an individual's degree of loss aversion, measured by their gamble rejection rate, is often seen to be synonymous with the value of the \u03bb parameter in prospect theory. This connection between rejection rates and loss aversion is used for understanding decision-making processes (p.2)."

    "justification": "The pre-valuation bias is quantitatively defined within the drift diffusion model by the starting point parameter z. A positive z predisposes decision-makers towards accepting gambles, while a negative z predisposes them towards rejecting gambles (p.12)."

    "justification": "The fixed utility bias is measured by the additive intercept (a) in the drift rate equation of the drift diffusion model. This intercept can be positive or negative, indicating a general tendency favoring acceptance or rejection, independent of specific gamble values (p.12)."
