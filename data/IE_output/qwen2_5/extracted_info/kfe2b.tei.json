    "topic_or_construct": "intentions to quit studies completely",
    "measured_by": "newly developed five-item multifaceted scale",
    "justification": "The authors developed a new multifaceted scale with five phases (non-fit perception, thoughts of quitting/changing, deliberation, information search, and decision made) to specifically measure intentions to quit studies completely. This scale was used in the absence of existing measures that distinguish between different phases of student dropout and between quitting studies completely and changing a major."

    "topic_or_construct": "intentions to change a major",
    "measured_by": "newly developed five-item multifaceted scale",
    "justification": "Similar to the intent to quit studies completely, a new multifaceted scale was also developed for measuring intentions to change a major with five distinct phases. This instrument provides a specialized tool for assessing the particular process leading to changes in academic majors."

    "measured_by": "German Single-Item Scale L1",
    "justification": "Subjective well-being was assessed using the German Single-Item Scale L1, which evaluates general life satisfaction. This single-item scale offers a brief, direct method to gauge individuals' overall life satisfaction, a key indicator of psychological well-being."

    "justification": "The authors adapted a five-item subscale from the German SESSKO scale to assess academic self-concept. It measures participants' views of themselves in an academic context, adapted specifically for university students. The subscale maintains the psychometric properties of the original measure."

    "measured_by": "adapted Achievement Emotions Questionnaire (AEQ)",
    "justification": "Four items from the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire (AEQ) were adapted to measure anxiety specific to the academic context. These items target the emotional experience related to studying, providing insight into the anxiety students may face in an academic setting."

    "measured_by": "six-item scale",
    "justification": "A six-item scale, previously used by the authors in other studies, was employed to measure subjective task value. It evaluates the perceived personal benefit and importance students attach to their studies, offering insights into their motivation and engagement."

    "measured_by": "short version of Tuckman Procrastination Scale (TPS)",

    "topic_or_construct": "learned helplessness",
    "measured_by": "adapted helplessness scale",
    "justification": "The authors adapted and extended Breitkopf's helplessness scale to create a six-item measure. This tool evaluates the belief that effort does not lead to success in an academic context, assessing the concept of learned helplessness."
