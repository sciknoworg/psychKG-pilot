    "justification": "The study used the 4CONFiDE moral set, which includes four options: 'I certainly do it', 'I do it', 'I do not do it', and 'I certainly do not do it'. The first two options were considered utilitarian, while the latter two were considered deontological, thereby assessing participants' moral decisions (Cecchetto et al., 2019)."

    "justification": "fMRI data was used to investigate the neural underpinnings of moral decision-making, particularly the activation of brain regions during exposure to masked social odors versus masker odor while participants processed moral dilemmas, providing insights into how emotional and cognitive brain areas are engaged in moral reasoning."

    "justification": "Social odors were collected from donor t-shirts worn for 12 hours, which were then used in the study. The perception of these odors, masked by a neutral fragrance, was intended to manipulate participants' sense of social presence, thereby influencing their moral decisions and associated neural activity (\u5c71\u8def\u3089, 2014)."
