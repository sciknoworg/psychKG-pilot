    "justification": "The paper uses CPT models with various parameters to simulate and analyze differences between description-based decisions (DBDs) and experience-based decisions (EBDs), showcasing how asymmetric learning can explain observed gaps in probability weighting and risk preferences across tasks."

    "justification": "The RL-CPT model incorporates separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors to better capture behavioral differences across DBDs and EBDs, outperforming standard CPT models in empirical model comparisons."

    "justification": "Probability weighting parameter \u03b3 showed biases in EBDs relative to DBDs based on asymmetric learning rates and sample size, with RL-CPT providing a more accurate representation of true values compared to traditional CPT."
