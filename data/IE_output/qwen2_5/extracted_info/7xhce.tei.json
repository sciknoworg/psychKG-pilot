    "measured_by": "Self-reported levels of occupational stress",
    "justification": "The paper references studies like Goldstein & Alesbury (2021), which discuss self-reported levels of occupational stress, indicating that subjective measurement methods are used to assess stress levels in forensic examiners."

    "topic_or_construct": "Challenge-Hindrance Stressor Framework (CHSF)",
    "measured_by": "Perceived work-related demands",
    "justification": "The CHSF framework is used to measure how different types of stressors (challenge vs. hindrance) affect forensic experts, based on individuals\u2019 appraisals and perceptions of work-related demands (Cavanaugh et al., 2000; LePine, 2022; Podsakoff et al., 2023)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Physiological Stress Reactions",
    "measured_by": "Physiological measurement methods",
    "justification": "The paper mentions the use of physiological measurement of stress in crime scene investigators, suggesting the use of physiological processes as an indicator of stress levels (Adderley et al., referencing physiological measures)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Making Under Stress",
    "measured_by": "Decision thresholds",
    "justification": "The paper refers to Thompson (2023), which discusses decision thresholds as a measure that can indicate stress levels affecting forensic decision-making. Changes in decision thresholds are explored as a method to identify stress impact on performance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Ambiguity Aversion",
    "measured_by": "Trait measuring ambiguity aversion",
    "justification": "The concept of ambiguity aversion is discussed, noting that some examiners are naturally more or less comfortable with ambiguity. This implies the use of traits such as ambiguity aversion levels to measure the psychological tendency towards uncertainty (Levy et al., 2010; Raptis et al., 2017; Saposnik et al., 2017)."
