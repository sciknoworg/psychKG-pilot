    "justification": "The study demonstrates that semantic relatedness between words can be assessed using mouse-tracking, where the maximum deviation from the direct path (MD) and sample entropy measure the decision conflict during a two-alternative forced choice task. The results showed that MD and sample entropy were significantly influenced by the semantic relatedness (SRel) between word pairs, indicating the involvement of semantic processing in the decision-making process."

    "justification": "The study used mouse-tracking to quantify decision conflict through MD and sample entropy. The MD is defined as the furthest point on the actual trajectory from the idealized straight trajectory, while sample entropy measures the degree of irregularity and unpredictability in movement. These measures were shown to be significantly affected by semantic relatedness, reflecting the conflict and evolution of the decision-making process."

    "justification": "In Experiment 2, the study used mouse-tracking to capture the temporal dynamics of decision-making. The temporal measures\u2014initiation RTs, MDtime, and overall RTs\u2014were used to analyze different stages of the decision process. The results indicated that semantic relatedness significantly influenced MDtime and overall RTs, suggesting that the decision-making process unfolds over time and is affected by semantic factors."

    "justification": "Participants were asked to indicate the more abstract or concrete word from two options. In Experiment 1, this was done using keyboard responses, while in Experiment 2, it was done using mouse responses. The study results showed that the semantic relatedness of word pairs influenced response times and decision conflict metrics, even though semantic relatedness was not a primary dimension for performing the task."

    "justification": "The study utilized a distributional semantic model (DSM) generated through the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) method to estimate the degree of semantic relatedness (SRel) between word pairs. This DSM was trained on a large Italian text corpus, and the word vectors obtained were used to compute SRel scores that were significantly associated with decision conflict and reaction times."
