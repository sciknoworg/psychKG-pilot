    "measured_by": "Magnitude Estimation Task",
    "justification": "The study uses magnitude estimation tasks to directly measure the perceived Psychological Value of human lives, allowing for empirical estimation independent of choice. This method is chosen for its ability to generalize across multiple classes of stimuli without altering for specific items, aligning with the theoretical construct of value."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived Psychological Value",
    "measured_by": "Robust Random Walk (RRW) Procedure",
    "justification": "Psychological Value Theory utilizes the RRW to model decision processes, taking direct measurements of Psychological Value collected through magnitude estimation as input. The RRW accurately predicts participants' reaction times and response choices in complex social decisions, supporting the theory's predictive power."

    "topic_or_construct": "Value Similarity (f(Yv1\u2229Yv2))",
    "measured_by": "Non-parametric bootstrap procedure",
    "justification": "The overlap of perceived Psychological Value distributions for different items is estimated using a non-parametric bootstrap procedure. This measure of value similarity serves as the driving force in decision-making processes and is used to predict participants' responses in the robust random walk model."

    "topic_or_construct": "Sacrificial Moral Dilemma Responses",
    "measured_by": "Simplified Moral Dilemma Scenarios",
    "justification": "Sacrificial moral dilemmas are simplified scenarios where conditions like the smaller group having greater perceived Psychological Value than the larger group are manipulated. The study demonstrates that individual differences in perceived value strongly influence decisions in these dilemmas."
