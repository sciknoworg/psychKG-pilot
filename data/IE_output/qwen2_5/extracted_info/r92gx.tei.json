    "topic_or_construct": "Retrospective bias in goal selection",
    "measured_by": "Participants' choice patterns and switching behavior in the Suits task",
    "justification": "The paper shows that participants preferred to pursue goals with greater accumulated progress rather than goals with higher prospective benefits. This retrospective bias was measured through the participants' choices between the dominant suit and the maximum progress suit in the Suits task, revealing their tendency to prioritize retrospective progress."

    "topic_or_construct": "Momentum in goal pursuit",
    "measured_by": "TD-momentum algorithm fits to participant choice data",
    "justification": "The paper introduced the TD-momentum model, a computational algorithm designed to capture participants' momentum-based decision-making process in goal selection. The model's superior fit to participants' choice data compared to other models supported its utility in measuring goal momentum."

    "topic_or_construct": "Goal persistence",
    "measured_by": "Switching patterns and persistent revisiting of goals in the Suits task",
    "justification": "Goal persistence was gauged through participants' switching behavior and their tendency to revisit previously pursued goals even after switching away. The switching patterns and revisiting frequency offered insights into how participants persisted with their goal selections."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Overpersistence in goal pursuit",
    "measured_by": "Performance comparison between participants and task-optimized models",
    "justification": "Overpersistence was measured through the difference in performance between human participants and task-optimized agents like the prospective agent. Participants' performance shortfall relative to these optimal models indicated their tendency to overpersevere with goals despite suboptimal outcomes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Influence of explicit instructions on goal selection",
    "measured_by": "Comparison of goal selection patterns in task versions with and without explicit instructions",
    "justification": "The impact of providing participants with explicit instructions about potential goal contingencies was assessed by comparing their goal selection patterns across different experimental conditions. The results showed that while instructions influenced behavior, they did not eliminate retrospective biases."
