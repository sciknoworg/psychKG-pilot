    "justification": "The study used a well-studied progress sunk-cost paradigm where participants were required to solve demanding arithmetic problems in order to advance projects, which varied in the level of cognitive effort required. This task allowed researchers to measure whether previous investments of cognitive effort increased individuals' propensity to invest additional cognitive effort into a course of action."
