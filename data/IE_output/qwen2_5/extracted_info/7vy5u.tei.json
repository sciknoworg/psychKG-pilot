    "measured_by": "Moral dilemmas with a process dissociation approach",
    "justification": "The study employed Conway & Gawronski's process dissociation approach to calculate independent estimates of utilitarianism and deontology. This method provides a more detailed understanding of the underlying tendencies in moral judgments beyond the traditional score (proportion of utilitarian decisions), as it contrasts responses in incongruent and congruent dilemmas."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Deontology",
    "measured_by": "Moral dilemmas with a process dissociation approach",
    "justification": "The process dissociation approach used in the study also calculates independent estimates of deontology, providing insight into rule-based moral tendencies. By comparing responses in dilemmas where utilitarian and deontological principles conflict or align, the study measures the strength of deontological inclinations."

    "topic_or_construct": "Sex differences in moral judgment",
    "measured_by": "Traditional scoring of outcome-based decisions in moral dilemmas",
    "justification": "Sex differences in moral judgment were assessed using the traditional scoring method, which calculates the proportion of outcome-based decisions in incongruent dilemmas. Higher scores indicate stronger utilitarian inclinations, with men in the study scoring higher than women."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Endocrine status effects on moral judgment",
    "measured_by": "Comparison between free cycling women, COC users, and men",
    "justification": "The study specifically examined the impact of endocrine status on moral judgment by comparing outcomes between free cycling women, COC users, and men. Significant differences were found, particularly in utilitarianism scores, with the highest levels observed in men and lowest in free cycling women."

    "topic_or_construct": "Testosterone levels and moral judgment",
    "measured_by": "Salivary testosterone measured via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)",
    "justification": "Associations between testosterone levels and moral judgment were assessed through salivary testosterone measurements using LC-MS/MS. Results indicated that higher testosterone was associated with increased utilitarianism in free cycling women and decreased deontology in men."
