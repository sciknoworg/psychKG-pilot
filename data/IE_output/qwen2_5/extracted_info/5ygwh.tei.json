    "measured_by": "Switching among Stroop, dot motion judgment, and flanker tasks",
    "justification": "Cognitive effort was measured using a task-switching paradigm that involved the Stroop task, dot motion judgment, and flanker tasks. Participants had to rapidly switch between these tasks during the handling time in the foraging trials. This setup was designed to impose subjective costs and assess how cognitive effort influenced decision-making during the foraging task."

    "topic_or_construct": "Physical effort",
    "measured_by": "Gripping a handheld dynamometer",
    "justification": "Physical effort was measured by requiring participants to grip a handheld dynamometer with a calibrated threshold set to 20% of their maximum voluntary contraction. Participants had to maintain this grip force during the handling time in the foraging trials, introducing a physical demand that was compared against cognitive and passive delay conditions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Preference for effortful courses of action",
    "measured_by": "Acceptance rates in a foraging task",
    "justification": "The preference for effortful courses of action was assessed by examining participants' acceptance rates in a foraging task where they could choose between trials involving cognitive effort, physical effort, or passive delay. The acceptance rates provided insights into how different types of demand influenced decision-making and motivational preferences."
