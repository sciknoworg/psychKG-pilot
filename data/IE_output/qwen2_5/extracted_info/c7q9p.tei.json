    "topic_or_construct": "Tension Reduction Hypothesis",
    "measured_by": "Choice patterns between alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages",
    "justification": "The study designed a novel experimental paradigm requiring participants to make explicit choices between alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages before and after experimental manipulations to evaluate whether stress leads participants to override their baseline preferences for non-alcoholic options."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Alcohol Purchase Task (APT)",
    "measured_by": "Willingness to consume alcohol at varying price points",
    "justification": "The APT was used to assess participants' behavioral economic demand for alcohol, providing insight into their willingness to consume alcohol at different prices following the experimental manipulations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) Parameters",
    "measured_by": "Decision boundary, drift rate, and alcohol bias",
    "justification": "DDM was applied to choice and RT data to disaggregate the mechanisms of decision-making, identifying that stress affects the alcohol bias parameter, showing a computational bias towards alcohol."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective Level of Stress",
    "measured_by": "Self-reports of stress levels (1='not at all stressed', 10='extremely stressed')",
    "justification": "Participants reported their subjective level of stress before and after stress induction procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of the stress manipulations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) Score",
    "measured_by": "Self-report questionnaire",
    "justification": "The AUDIT was administered as a self-report questionnaire to assess alcohol use patterns and potential alcohol use disorders among the participants."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective Intoxication Level",
    "measured_by": "Self-reports of intoxication (1='not at all intoxicated', 10='extremely intoxicated')",
    "justification": "Participants reported their subjective level of intoxication following the consumption of alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages to evaluate the manipulation of intoxication status."
