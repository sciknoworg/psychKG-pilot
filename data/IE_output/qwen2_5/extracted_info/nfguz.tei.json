    "measured_by": "Drift Diffusion Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The study utilized the drift diffusion model to separately assess decision-making and non-decision-making processes in HD mutation carriers, helping to determine whether language impairments result from decision-making defects or core linguistic deficits (model parameters like decision boundary, drift rate, bias, and non-decision time were extracted and analyzed)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "language performance",
    "measured_by": "AX auditory discrimination task",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to compare two sequences and decide whether they were the same or different, which enabled assessment of language performance through measures like discriminability and response time, reflecting abilities in phonological processing."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "phonological processing",
    "measured_by": "AX auditory discrimination task with linguistic stimuli",
    "justification": "The linguistic version of the AX auditory discrimination task used phonological stimuli, allowing researchers to evaluate HD patients' phonological processing abilities, revealing slower non-decision times in the linguistic task compared to non-linguistic tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "striatal atrophy",
    "measured_by": "Voxel-based morphometry analysis",
    "justification": "MRI scans were used with voxel-based morphometry analysis to identify gray matter volume loss in the striatum of HD carriers. This measurement helped in correlating striatal atrophy with cognitive performance metrics derived from DDM analysis."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "motor performance",
    "measured_by": "UHDRS motor score",
    "justification": "The UHDRS motor score was used to assess motor function in HD participants, which in the model analysis explained non-decision time in the linguistic task better than a linguistic score, suggesting motor components contribute to non-decision time."
