    "measured_by": "Interactive Mentalizing Questionnaire (IMQ)",
    "justification": "The authors used the IMQ to measure participants' mentalizing ability, which is crucial for understanding the interaction between human drivers and AVs. The IMQ evaluates self-self mentalization, self-other mentalization, and other-self mentalization, providing a comprehensive assessment of mentalizing skills."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "self-other mentalization (SO) ability",
    "measured_by": "Interactive Mentalizing Questionnaire (IMQ) - SO component",
    "justification": "The SO component of the IMQ specifically quantifies the ability of participants to assess the mental state of others from their own perspective. This is relevant to predicting how players anticipate the policies of opponent AVs in different mentalizing levels."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "other-self mentalization (OS) ability",
    "measured_by": "Interactive Mentalizing Questionnaire (IMQ) - OS component",
    "justification": "The OS component of the IMQ evaluates participants' ability to infer how others might think about their intentions. This is particularly important for understanding complex interactions in the human-AV game scenario."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "self-self mentalization (SS) ability",
    "measured_by": "Interactive Mentalizing Questionnaire (IMQ) - SS component",
    "justification": "The SS component of the IMQ measures the ability to self-reflect and assess one's own mental states. The SS component is analyzed alongside SO and OS to investigate how these mentalizing abilities influence driving strategies."
