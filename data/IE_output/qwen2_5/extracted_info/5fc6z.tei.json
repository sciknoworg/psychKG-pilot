    "measured_by": "Polish version of the Pure Procrastination Scale",
    "justification": "The study used the Polish version of the Pure Procrastination Scale to measure procrastination, replicating the original relationship between dependent decision style and procrastination. Both scales showed excellent reliability in the replication."

    "topic_or_construct": "dependent decision-making style",
    "measured_by": "translation of the dependent style subscale from the GDMS",
    "justification": "The dependent decision style was measured using the translated dependent style subscale from the GDMS. This measurement helped in establishing the relationship between dependent decision style and procrastination, demonstrating a significant but smaller effect than the original study."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "sunk cost effect",
    "measured_by": "between-subjects conditions with different sunk costs",
    "justification": "Sunk cost effect was measured by varying the amount of money already invested (1, 5, 9 million dollars) and asking participants about their willingness to invest additional funds. This experimental design replicated the significant effect of sunk cost on the subjective likelihood of investing additional money."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "risk attitudes",
    "measured_by": "word search puzzles priming risk attitudes",
    "justification": "Risk attitudes were measured using word search puzzles that primed participants towards either encouraging or discouraging risk-taking. The willingness to take instrumental risk was influenced by these priming conditions in the replication."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "sex differences in risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "questions about past risky behaviors",
    "justification": "The study measured sex differences in risk preferences through questions about actual past risky activities. The replication found that while males engaged more in gambling, there were no significant differences in other risk-taking behaviors."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "subjective numeracy and risky choices",
    "measured_by": "subjective numeracy test and decisions in choice problems",
    "justification": "Subjective numeracy was measured using a subjective numeracy test, while risky choices were measured through decisions in high-payoff and low-payoff choice problems. The replication partially supported the role of subjective numeracy in maximizing expected value in high-payoff problems."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "self-control and financial behavior",
    "measured_by": "Brief Self-Control Scale and Financial Management Behavior Scale",
    "justification": "Self-control was measured using items from the Brief Self-Control Scale and the Short-Term Future Orientation Scale, while financial behavior was measured using the Financial Management Behavior Scale. Participants with higher self-control showed better financial behaviors in the replication."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "openness to experience and susceptibility to anchoring",
    "measured_by": "Polish version of the TIPI scale and anchoring task",
    "justification": "The study used the Polish version of the TIPI scale to measure openness to experience and an anchoring task involving estimates of the Odra river's length. The replication found that higher openness-to-experience moderated the anchoring effect."
