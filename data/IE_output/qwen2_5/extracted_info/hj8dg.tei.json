    "measured_by": "Relative Choice Share of the Target (RST)",
    "justification": "The paper uses the RST measure to evaluate the presence of context effects such as attraction, compromise, and similarity effects. The RST compares the share of times a target option is chosen relative to its competitor, quantifying the impact of a decoy. This measure supports the theoretical model's predictions on how attention modulates context effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "Similarity-Based Attention",
    "measured_by": "Eye-tracking measures",
    "justification": "Eye-tracking studies are cited as supporting evidence for similarity-based attention. For example, Noguchi and Stewart (2014) show that participants tend to fixate more on similar options during decision making, suggesting that attention is drawn to similar alternatives, which supports the model's assumption about similarity-based attention's role in context effects."

    "measured_by": "Choice-Reaction Time Data",
    "justification": "The modeling framework uses choice-reaction time data to validate the proposed attentional processes influencing context effects. Fitting the model to such data demonstrates how variations in attention during decision-making lead to different patterns of context effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "Spatial Attention Effects",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral Data from Spatial Ordering Experiments",
    "justification": "The reanalysis of Trueblood et al. (2015) explores how spatial ordering of options impacts context effects. Behavioral data show that variations in spatial arrangement lead to different effects, supporting the importance of spatial attention in the model."
