    "topic_or_construct": "Sense of freedom of choice (FoC)",
    "measured_by": "Subjective freedom ratings",
    "justification": "Participants were required to rate their subjective experience of how much their response choice was influenced by the dot motion, using a scale to indicate feelings of being more or less detached from the stimulus on each trial. This directly measured their sense of freedom in relation to the experimental manipulations."

    "topic_or_construct": "Objective freedom of choice (FoC)",
    "measured_by": "Proportion of motion congruent responses",
    "justification": "The objective measure of freedom was calculated as the percentage of motion congruent responses on detach trials. This provided a quantifiable measure of participants' ability to act independently of the stimulus direction, independent of their subjective experience."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Stimulus-response association learning",
    "measured_by": "Frequency of instructed trials",
    "justification": "The study manipulated the frequency with which participants received instructions to adhere or oppose, with the frequency affecting participants' tendency to act congruently or incongruently with the stimuli. This measured the learned stimulus-response associations through the distribution of instructed trials."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective sense of autonomy",
    "measured_by": "Subjective freedom rating scale",
    "justification": "Participants reported their subjective experience of autonomy using a scale that ranged from 'completely influenced' to 'completely free.' This reflected their perceived level of autonomy in their responses, especially in relation to the condition (Adhere, Oppose, Detach)."
