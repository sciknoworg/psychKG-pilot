    "justification": "The study utilized valence ratings from 1 (negative) to 4 (positive) during the value encoding phase to assess how participants assigned value to consumer reviews. This scale directly measured value encoding as participants rated product valence while the product information was visible on the screen."

    "measured_by": "Average Consumer Rating on a 1-5 Scale",
    "justification": "During the value retrieval phase, participants were asked to estimate the average consumer rating for each product on a 1-5 scale (1 being negative and 5 being positive) based on previously encountered reviews. This scale assessed how well participants could retrieve and integrate encoded value information."

    "topic_or_construct": "Episodic Memory for Product Attributes",
    "measured_by": "Corrected Recognition Scores",
    "justification": "Episodic memory for product attributes was measured using a self-paced behavioral memory test that employed a 1 (definitely yes) to 4 (definitely not) scale. Corrected recognition scores were calculated based on hit rates minus false alarm rates, providing a measure of episodic memory strength for product details."
