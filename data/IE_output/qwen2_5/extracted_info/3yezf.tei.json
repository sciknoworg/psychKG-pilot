    "topic_or_construct": "willingness to wait for delayed rewards",
    "measured_by": "Kaplan-Meier survival curve",
    "justification": "The authors constructed a Kaplan-Meier survival curve for each participant to operationalize willingness to wait, plotting the probability of waiting at least until each time point if the reward had not been delivered earlier. The area under this curve was used as the primary dependent measure."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "learning rate of willingness to wait",
    "measured_by": "WTW trend",
    "justification": "The change in willingness to wait over time was quantified using the WTW trend. This trend was estimated by regressing the number of elapsed seconds against the willingness to wait at each second, serving as a proxy for the learning rate, with a more negative trend indicating faster learning in limited-persistence environments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "optimal quitting time",
    "measured_by": "explicit report of ideal maximum waiting time",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to explicitly report their perceived ideal maximum waiting time on a progress bar, converting their mark into seconds. This self-report served as a measure of their understanding of the optimal quitting time."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "response time expectations",
    "measured_by": "reaction times in passive learning blocks",
    "justification": "Response times were recorded in passive learning blocks, where participants were exposed to different reward timing distributions without making decisions. The RTs suggested participants' expectations about reward timing, with faster RTs indicating more expected reward times."
