    "measured_by": "Employee Satisfaction and Loyalty measure",
    "justification": "The article mentions using a specific measure for employee satisfaction and loyalty, which was critical in predicting suboptimal cybersecurity behavior. It is one of the most important predictors of riskier behavior, as revealed by the ordinal logistic regression analysis."

    "topic_or_construct": "Phishing email detection accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Phishing discrimination task",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to discriminate between phishing and legitimate emails, and their accuracy on this task was analyzed. This task provided a measure of their ability to detect phishing emails, which modestly predicted riskier cybersecurity behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence in phishing email discrimination",
    "measured_by": "Confidence ratings on a scale from 0 to 100",
    "justification": "The study measured the confidence participants had in their phishing email discrimination judgments, with participants rating their confidence on a scale from 0 to 100. The overall tendency was slight overconfidence, suggesting a relationship between confidence and behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "Years of employment",
    "measured_by": "Number of years worked at the organization",
    "justification": "Years of employment at the organization was found to be a significant predictor of phishing susceptibility. Newer employees with fewer years of employment were more vulnerable to phishing attempts, according to the research findings."

    "topic_or_construct": "Propensity to morally disengage",
    "measured_by": "Propensity to Morally Disengage Scale",
    "justification": "This scale measures the strategies people use to morally disengage and was included as a predictor in the ordinal logistic regression model. It captures aspects such as moral justification, advantageous comparison, and diffusion of responsibility, although its relative importance was smaller compared to other factors."
