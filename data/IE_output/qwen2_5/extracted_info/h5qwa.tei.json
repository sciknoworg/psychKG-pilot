    "measured_by": "Centro-Parietal Potential (CPP)",
    "justification": "The paper suggests that signal suppression, influenced by the vehicle's time-to-arrival (TTA), impacts the decision variable, which is reflected in the CPP component of ERPs. This connection is supported by the study's analysis of CPP patterns, especially in response to imminent collision risk, which corroborates the signal suppression hypothesis (Twomey et al., 2015)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Time-varying Drift Rate",
    "measured_by": "Extended Diffusion Model",
    "justification": "The time-varying drift rate, influenced by utility maximization and collision concerns, is captured through the utility function within the extended diffusion model. This model incorporates a time-varying maximization process that links pedestrian and vehicle kinematics with the TTA, demonstrating its role in road-crossing decisions (Lin et al., 2022)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Inhibition Control",
    "measured_by": "Road-Crossing Task",
    "justification": "Inhibition control is studied through participants' responses in a road-crossing task, which requires them to halt planned actions in the face of an approaching vehicle. This real-world task assesses inhibition control as a fundamental aspect of cognitive decision-making (Kwon et al., 2022; Schiff & Oldak, 1990)."

    "measured_by": "Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling (HBM)",
    "justification": "Time pressure in road-crossing decisions is evaluated using hierarchical Bayesian modeling. This approach analyzes data at both individual and group levels, offering insights into how the time-to-arrival (TTA) factor influences participants' decision-making processes, especially under varying time constraints."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Utility Maximization",
    "measured_by": "Extended Diffusion Model",
    "justification": "Utility maximization is measured through the extended diffusion model, which includes a utility function affected by visual looming, safety pressure, and their interaction. The model helps understand how these factors quantitatively affect road-crossing decisions (Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993; Roe et al., 2001)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Dynamics in High-Stakes Scenarios",
    "measured_by": "Road-Crossing Task and ERP Data",
    "justification": "The decision dynamics in time-critical, high-stakes scenarios are studied using a road-crossing task and ERP data. This dual approach illuminates how pedestrians integrate situational awareness and cognitive resources when faced with potential collision risks, enhancing our understanding of the decision-making process (Afacan-Seref et al., 2018)."
