    "measured_by": "structural MRI",
    "justification": "Research using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has examined the relationship between political ideology and brain structure, finding that political liberals had increased volume in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) relative to conservatives, while conservatives showed increased volume in the right amygdala relative to liberals."

    "topic_or_construct": "political ideology",
    "measured_by": "electroencephalography (EEG)",
    "justification": "Work using electroencephalography (EEG) or event-related potential (ERP) to study conflict detection has shown a link between political ideology and ACC activity during a Go/No-Go Task. In general, political liberalism appears to be associated with increased sensitivity to conflicting information relative to conservatism, suggesting that the difference in ERP activity could be localized to ACC."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "political ideology",
    "measured_by": "functional MRI (fMRI)",
    "justification": "Haas and colleagues (2017) used fMRI to investigate ideological differences in neural processing of incongruent information in the context of political candidate and policy evaluation. The study found evidence for ideological differences in ACC and insula activation, suggesting that political liberalism is associated with greater activation in these regions to incongruent information."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "political candidate evaluation",
    "measured_by": "functional MRI (fMRI)",
    "justification": "Spezio and colleagues (2008) found in an fMRI study that activation in insula and ACC was associated with candidates being more likely to lose an election. When participants evaluated both positive and negative traits of candidates, similar activation in insula and ACC to losing candidates was explained by negative trait judgments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "motivated reasoning",
    "measured_by": "functional MRI (fMRI)",
    "justification": "Westen and colleagues (2006) used fMRI to examine the neural basis of motivated reasoning during the 2004 U.S. presidential election. They found increased activation in regions involved with cognitive control and processing negative information when participants engaged in motivated reasoning."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "political participation",
    "measured_by": "functional MRI (fMRI)",
    "justification": "Rule and colleagues (2010) conducted a cross-cultural fMRI study where viewing images of preferred candidates was associated with increased activation in the amygdala in both American and Japanese participants, providing evidence for neural correlates of voting behavior."
