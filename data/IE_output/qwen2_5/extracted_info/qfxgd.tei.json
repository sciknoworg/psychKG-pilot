    "topic_or_construct": "Information-seeking motives",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral tasks and neural responses",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how different motives for information-seeking, such as instrumentality, curiosity, valence, and uncertainty reduction, are measured through behavioral tasks and neural responses. For example, instrumentality is measured by the decision-making process where participants choose between uncertain and certain information options."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Valence-dependent information-seeking",
    "measured_by": "fMRI and pharmacological interventions",
    "justification": "The study employs fMRI to detect valence-dependent information prediction errors (VD-IPEs) in the midbrain and nucleus accumbens, and uses pharmacological interventions like L-DOPA to examine the role of dopamine in valence bias during information-seeking."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty reduction",
    "measured_by": "Functional MRI (fMRI) and behavioral tasks",
    "justification": "Uncertainty reduction in information-seeking is measured through fMRI studies that identify specific brain regions like dACC and rlPFC, which encode the non-instrumental value of information independently of reward value. Behavioral tasks show participants' preferences for information that reduces subjective uncertainty."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Curiosity",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral studies and neural recording",
    "justification": "Curiosity is measured through participants\u2019 preference for seeking new information, as demonstrated in behavioral studies. Neural recording in monkeys reveals differential responses in specific brain areas, such as the ACC, to uncertain vs. certain information."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Instrumentality",
    "measured_by": "Sequential choice tasks and fMRI",
    "justification": "Instrumentality is measured through sequential choice tasks where participants' decisions to seek informative options are linked to their potential future utility. fMRI studies reveal the involvement of specific brain regions like vmPFC and OFC in encoding the value of instrumental information."
