    "measured_by": "Proximity-to-Center Bias",
    "justification": "Selective attention is measured through consumers\u2019 tendency to focus on centrally located items within product displays, which leads to biased quantity estimations, supporting the use of the proximity-to-center bias as an instrument."

    "measured_by": "Proximity-to-Center Bias",
    "justification": "The research identifies the proximity-to-center bias as a perceptual bias affecting quantity estimations, where items closer to the center appear more numerous, thus serving as a tool to measure perceptual biases."
