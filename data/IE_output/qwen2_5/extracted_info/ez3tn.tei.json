    "topic_or_construct": "Insight phenomenology",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported Aha! moments",
    "justification": "The paper discusses the subjective experience of insight, often recognized as the 'Aha!' moment, which participants report experiencing when they have sudden solutions. Studies rely on these self-reports to identify solutions associated with insight vs. those achieved analytically."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Insight accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Performance on tasks with known solutions",
    "justification": "Various studies use tasks like compound remote associates (CRA), rebus puzzles, and anagrams, which have known correct answers. Participants' responses are compared against the correct answers to assess the accuracy of insight solutions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Insight memory effects",
    "measured_by": "Recognition memory tasks",
    "justification": "Studies measure whether insight solutions are better remembered by participants by using recognition tests to evaluate memory differences between insights and analytically-derived solutions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Insight effects on attention",
    "measured_by": "Eye movement and blink rate measurements",
    "justification": "Neural and behavioral studies use eye movement tracking and blink rate analyses to measure attentional engagement during insight moments. Changes in these metrics help infer the attentional capture by insights."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "False insights",
    "measured_by": "Behavioural paradigms with semantic priming",
    "justification": "Experiments use semantic priming to elicit false Aha! moments. The presence or absence of such false moments is determined from participants' self-reports and their problem-solving performance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Insight emotions",
    "measured_by": "Physiological measures (e.g., pupil dilation, skin conductance)",
    "justification": "To understand the emotional intensity of insights, physiological measures are used. For example, increases in pupil dilation are correlated with higher emotional reactions during insight moments."
