    "measured_by": "Outcome Devaluation Task Tricomi",
    "justification": "The Tricomi outcome devaluation task is used to assess habit formation by evaluating participants' behavior after a specific snack is devalued. If participants continue to choose the devalued snack, it suggests habit-based control rather than goal-directed behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Habit Formation",
    "measured_by": "Contingency Degradation Task",
    "justification": "This task measures whether participants maintain their responses despite degraded or negative contingencies, indicating habitual behavior if they persist in their response patterns even when rewards decrease in predictability."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Habit Formation",
    "measured_by": "Sequential Markov Decision Task (2-Step)",
    "justification": "The 2-Step task uses model-free reinforcement learning to operationalize habitual behavior, assessing whether participants rely on habitual rather than goal-directed decision-making when faced with sequential decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Frequency-based Habitization",
    "measured_by": "Reward Pairs Task",
    "justification": "This task examines if repeated choice frequency during training influences subsequent choices and response times in the absence of rewards, aiming to isolate frequency-based habit formation processes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Frequency-based Habitization",
    "measured_by": "Unrewarded Habit Task",
    "justification": "This task investigates whether frequent unrewarded choices during training lead to habit formation, as indicated by faster response times and increased preference for the frequently chosen stimuli in the test phase."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Real-life Habitual Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI)",
    "justification": "The SRHI assesses the habit strength of real-life behaviors, allowing researchers to validate experimental measures of habits against self-reported habitual behavior in everyday life."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Real-life Habitual Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Creature of Habit Scale (COHS)",
    "justification": "The COHS measures routine and automatic behavior tendencies in daily life, providing a separate self-report measure to compare with experimental habit metrics for generalizability."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Real-life Habitual Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Habitual Tendencies Questionnaire (HTQ)",
    "justification": "The HTQ evaluates habitual tendencies including compulsivity, regularity, and aversion to novelty in real-life contexts, offering another instrument to investigate the relationship between experimental and real-world habits."
