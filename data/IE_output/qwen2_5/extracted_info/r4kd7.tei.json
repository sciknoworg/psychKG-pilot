    "justification": "The paper discusses how individuals adjust their start point bias in the social drift-diffusion model to optimize their payoff under conditions of asymmetric error costs. This is justified by the statement, 'With increasing cost asymmetry, individuals acting alone and in small cooperative groups evolved a bias towards the signal decision boundary avoiding the costly error.'"

    "topic_or_construct": "social information use",
    "measured_by": "social drift rate in the model",
    "justification": "The study uses the social drift rate in the social DDM model to measure social information use. The justification is found in the explanation that the social drift rate describes the incorporation of social information and that it evolved to the maximum level across all conditions, indicating the effectiveness of using social information."

    "topic_or_construct": "decision threshold",
    "measured_by": "boundary separation in the DDM framework",
    "justification": "Boundary separation in the social DDM framework is used to measure the amount of evidence required before an individual makes a decision. The paper justifies this by explaining that larger groups evolve a higher boundary separation, reflecting the higher potential of social information usage in larger groups."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "collective decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Social DDM framework",
    "justification": "The Social Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) is used to model the collective decision-making process, integrating personal and social information dynamically over time. This reflects the cognitive underpinnings of decision-making processes involving both individual and group dynamics."
