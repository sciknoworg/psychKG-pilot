    "justification": "The paper uses participants' judgments and the Joint Effort Model's predictions to assess how belief-desire-competence reasoning influences collaborative behavior. Experiments showed that participants' judgments align with the theoretical framework's predictions, demonstrating its relevance in measuring these constructs."

    "justification": "Behavioral tasks were used to analyze participants' ability to estimate strength, predict lift probabilities, and allocate incentives. These tasks serve as instruments to measure how individuals reason about collaborative efforts and evaluate the framework's predictions."

    "measured_by": "Participant choices in Experiment 3",
    "justification": "Experiment 3 measured participants' selections of team members and incentives assigned based on given contestant attributes. This assessed how participants balance strength and effort cost considerations when structuring teams for collaborative tasks."
