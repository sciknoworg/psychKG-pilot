    "topic_or_construct": "reciprocal choices",
    "measured_by": "iterated ultimatum game (iUG)",
    "justification": "The study measured reciprocal choices using the iterated ultimatum game, which allowed players to make repeated economic exchanges involving offers and decisions to accept or reject these offers. The behavior in this game reflects reciprocal reactions to an opponent's prior behavior. (See section on Introduction and Procedure)"

    "topic_or_construct": "reciprocal choices",
    "measured_by": "expected utility (EU) model",
    "justification": "The study adapted a reciprocity model to fit each player's round-by-round behavior according to estimates of expected utility, which accounted for their reciprocity reactions to their opponent's prior behavior. The estimates of EU were used to model effective connectivity in the brain. (See section on Reciprocity model)"

    "topic_or_construct": "brain responses during reciprocal choices",
    "measured_by": "functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)",
    "justification": "Players underwent functional MRI scanning while engaging in the iterated ultimatum game. The fMRI data showed brain responses that mapped onto their reciprocal choices, notably in the right anterior insula (AI) and anterior/anterior-mid cingulate cortex (aMCC). (See sections on Imaging protocol and Results)"

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "patterns of effective connectivity",
    "measured_by": "dynamic causal modelling (DCM)",
    "justification": "Behavioural DCM was used to identify player-specific patterns of effective connectivity between brain regions, especially the right AI and aMCC. The bDCM procedure estimated choices with over 70% accuracy by modelling effective connectivity under the influence of estimates of EU from the reciprocity model. (See sections on Methods and Results)"
