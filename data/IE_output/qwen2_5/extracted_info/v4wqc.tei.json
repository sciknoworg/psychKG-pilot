    "justification": "The effectiveness of IMPIs, where participants are instructed to specify when and where they will perform an intended task, is measured by examining goal completion rates across experimental groups with and without IMPIs, as demonstrated in the Christmas report study by Gollwitzer and Brandst\u00e4tter (1997)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Goal Intentions (GOIs)",
    "measured_by": "Self-Report Method",
    "justification": "The construct of goal intentions involves forming a general plan to perform a behavior, which is measured through self-report where participants express an intention to undertake a task without specifying the time or place, as implied in comparison studies assessing GOIs against IMPIs."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Moderators of Intention Effects (e.g., Task Difficulty, Personality Traits)",
    "measured_by": "Experimental Manipulation and Personality Scales",
    "justification": "The moderating effects of factors like task difficulty or personality traits on the efficacy of IMPIs versus GOIs are measured through experimental manipulations of task variables and measurement of personality traits, such as conscientiousness scales, to assess how these conditions affect goal pursuit."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective Value of the Goal",
    "measured_by": "Within-Participant Manipulation and Outcome Assessment",
    "justification": "The subjective value of a goal, a parameter in the proposed computational framework, can be measured by manipulating the level of perceived importance participants assign to a goal. This is achieved by within-participant experimental designs that assess how different values impact goal pursuit outcomes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "State-Specificity of Intentions",
    "measured_by": "Experimental Instructions Varying Cued Contexts",
    "justification": "The state-specificity parameter, which relates to the degree of context-specificity in intentions, is measured by instructing participants to form intentions associated with specific cues and then observing their goal pursuit behavior in both cued and non-cued states."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive Judgments & Biases",
    "measured_by": "Self-Report and Cognitive Tasks",
    "justification": "Metacognitive aspects related to intention formation, such as confidence in goal pursuit and potential biases, can be measured using self-report questionnaires and tasks that assess metacognitive judgment accuracy and confidence levels."
