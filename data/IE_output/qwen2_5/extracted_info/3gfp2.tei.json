    "measured_by": "Questionnaires",
    "justification": "Self-efficacy is typically assessed via questionnaires that measure a person's belief in their ability to perform a specific task according to Bandura's theory. This method aligns with the discussion in the paper regarding self-efficacy influencing confidence judgements."

    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence Judgements",
    "measured_by": "Continuous scale (50% to 100%) confidence ratings",
    "justification": "The paper mentions that participants reported their decision confidence on a continuous scale ranging from 50% to 100%, indicating the certainty of their perceptual decisions. This scale was used to measure subjective confidence in experiments 1\u20133."

    "topic_or_construct": "Task Difficulty",
    "measured_by": "Subjective Difficulty Manipulation (contrast ratios in stimuli)",
    "justification": "Task difficulty was manipulated via stimulus contrasts that generated differential confidence levels but equal performance, ensuring that subjective difficulty was isolated as a variable."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Task Difficulty",
    "measured_by": "Objective Difficulty Manipulation (variations in sensory noise)",
    "justification": "Objective difficulty was manipulated by altering sensory noise levels (such as dot motion variability in Experiment 2) while maintaining equal features except for the variance, thus creating true differences in performance."
