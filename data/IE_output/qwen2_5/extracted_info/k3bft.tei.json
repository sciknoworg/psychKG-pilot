    "measured_by": "Goal Conflict Scale",
    "justification": "The study developed and used the Goal Conflict Scale, comprising three items (e.g., 'Palliative care and curative care are in conflict with one another'), to assess the perceived conflict between curative and palliative care goals. This scale was validated through factor analysis, demonstrating its appropriateness for measuring goal conflict in the context of healthcare providers' decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Goal Complementarity",
    "measured_by": "Goal Complementarity Scale",
    "justification": "The Goal Complementarity Scale used five items, including questions about the helpfulness of achieving palliative goals on curative goals and vice versa, and selecting an image depicting the overlap between curative and palliative care. The scale was validated in the study and found to be modestly correlated with the Goal Conflict Scale, indicating it measures a distinct concept."

    "topic_or_construct": "Importance of Palliative Goals",
    "measured_by": "Single Item Assessment",
    "justification": "The importance of palliative care goals was measured through a single item asking providers to rate the extent to which 'Palliative care is a strong priority.' This approach was used to gauge the perceived priority of palliative care goals in decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Importance of Curative Goals",
    "measured_by": "Single Item Assessment",
    "justification": "Providers' prioritization of curative goals was assessed with a single item stating 'Curative care is a strong priority.' This direct measure helped determine the relative importance healthcare providers placed on curative care in comparison to palliative care."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Willingness to Provide Palliative Care",
    "measured_by": "Single Item Measure of Behavioral Willingness",
    "justification": "Willingness to provide palliative care was assessed using an item asking if providers would fulfill a patient's request for palliative treatment. This measure was designed to capture specific behavioral willingness, which is more predictive of actual actions than general intentions."
