    "justification": "The article assesses the Privacy Paradox through participants ranking feature preferences. Participants were asked to rank combinations of features according to their desirability, which was used to infer the probability of adopting a service given each feature level. The resulting preference values were then utilized by cognitive models to predict installation choices, treating privacy-relevant features as integral to studying disclosure behavior."

    "measured_by": "Cognitive Modeling",
    "justification": "The Privacy Paradox is also measured using cognitive models like the Rational Process Model (RPM) and others (detBayes, detTTB, probTTB). These models predict user behavior based on feature preferences and decision-making processes, comparing predicted choices against actual user decisions. The support of these models is evaluated through Bayes Factor analysis, demonstrating how well they capture the decision-making underpinning the Privacy Paradox."
