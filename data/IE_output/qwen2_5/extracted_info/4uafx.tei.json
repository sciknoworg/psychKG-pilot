    "topic_or_construct": "Social exclusion",
    "measured_by": "Cyberball paradigm (Williams & Jarvis, 2006)",
    "justification": "The Cyberball paradigm is used to experimentally manipulate social exclusion in the study, where participants are either included or excluded from a virtual ball-tossing game, effectively creating feelings of social exclusion for experimental purposes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risky decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Columbia Card Task (CCT, Figner et al., 2009)",
    "justification": "The Columbia Card Task was used to assess risky decision-making by having participants choose cards that represent either small but recurring gains or large and infrequent losses, allowing researchers to study how social exclusion and social rank feedback impact information use during risk-taking."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotional responses",
    "measured_by": "Self-Assessment Manikin Task (SAM, Bradley & Lang, 1994)",
    "justification": "The SAM was employed to measure emotional dimensions such as arousal, valence, and control/dominance at various points, including baseline and after social inclusion/exclusion, to evaluate the emotional impact of the manipulations."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social exclusion and inclusion effects",
    "measured_by": "Need Threat Questionnaire (NTQ, Williams et al., 2000)",
    "justification": "The NTQ, specifically the German adaptation, was used to gauge changes in feelings of belonging, self-worth, and mood after the Cyberball sessions, providing insight into the emotional and cognitive effects of social exclusion and inclusion."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Information use during decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Gain amounts, Loss amounts, and Loss probabilities (CCT parameters)",
    "justification": "The specific parameters of the Columbia Card Task\u2014gain amounts, loss amounts, and loss probabilities\u2014were used to assess how adolescents incorporate information about risks and rewards during decision-making, particularly under conditions of social exclusion and social rank feedback."
