    "measured_by": "Agency Bonus Parameter in Reinforcement-Learning Model",
    "justification": "The agency bonus parameter was added to the model to capture participants' intrinsic bias toward choosing agency. Positive values of the agency bonus reflect individuals' valuation of making choices irrespective of rewards, and it did not significantly vary with age, indicating a consistent intrinsic value across development."

    "topic_or_construct": "Instrumental Value of Choice",
    "measured_by": "Value of Choice (VoC) and VoC x Age Interaction Analysis",
    "justification": "The VoC calculated as the difference between the expected values of choosing and forgoing agency was used to assess the influence of instrumental value on choices. The interaction between VoC and age revealed that older participants were more sensitive to the instrumental value of choice, reflecting developmentally increasing integration of instrumental value."

    "topic_or_construct": "Confirmation Bias in Learning",
    "measured_by": "Learning Rate Parameters in Reinforcement-Learning Model",
    "justification": "The learning rate parameters indicated that participants updated their beliefs more strongly with wins compared to losses after their own choices, suggesting a confirmation bias. However, no significant learning rate asymmetry was observed for computer-made selections."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Sensitivity to Expected Reward Value",
    "measured_by": "Machine Selection Task",
    "justification": "Participants' ability to learn and select more rewarding machines was assessed through performance in the machine selection task. Across conditions, participants made optimal choices at above-chance levels, demonstrating a sensitivity to expected reward value."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value Computation for Agency Decisions",
    "measured_by": "Decision Times Analysis",
    "justification": "Agency decision times were slower when the expected values of choosing versus forgoing agency were more similar, indicating effortful deliberation in value computation. Age also modulated decision times, particularly under more difficult decision conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Integration Across Dual Stages",
    "measured_by": "Inverse Temperature Parameters in Model",
    "justification": "The inverse temperature parameters (\u03b2) in the computational model captured the extent to which participants' agency decisions were guided by value estimates. Older participants exhibited greater use of value estimates, suggesting improved ability to integrate values across decision stages."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Declarative Knowledge of Machine Values",
    "measured_by": "Post-task Explicit Value Estimation Task",
    "justification": "Participants estimated the reward probabilities of slot machines on a 9-point scale, assessing their explicit knowledge. Their error showed that participants were more accurate in assessing higher-reward machines, indicating better memory integration of rewards."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-Making Biases",
    "measured_by": "Agentic Choice Bias Analysis",
    "justification": "The analysis showed participants consistently preferred making choices even when instrumental value favored forgoing agency, indicating a general bias toward agentic choice that was not significantly modulated by age."
