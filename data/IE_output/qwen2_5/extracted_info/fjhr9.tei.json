    "measured_by": "The Memory For Exemplars Modeling Framework (MEM-EX)",
    "justification": "The research paper employs MEM-EX to model the cognitive mechanisms underlying decisions based on experience. The framework allows for the simulation and testing of value-assignment errors, memory sampling errors, memory priming, and memory confusion in participants' decision processes through computational models."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value-Assignment Errors",
    "measured_by": "MEM-EX's Value-Assignment Error Mechanism",
    "justification": "This mechanism within MEM-EX examines how participants misremember outcome values more frequently in value-ignorance conditions, providing a mechanistic interpretation for 'overweighting' rare events. The model demonstrates these errors influence risk choices between different conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Outcome Order Effects",
    "measured_by": "MEM-EX's Memory Confusion Mechanism",
    "justification": "MEM-EX's memory confusion mechanism captures the impact of outcome order on choice by positing that memory confusions produce retroactive interference, leading participants to prefer options with rewards at the end of sequences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Effect of Outcome Salience",
    "measured_by": "MEM-Ex's Memory Priming Mechanism",
    "justification": "Perceptually highlighting outcomes during sampling increases their weight in decision-making, as modelled by the memory priming mechanism. This mechanism explains how salient outcomes become more prominent in memory sampling, leading to riskier choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Experience-Based Choices",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral Experiments with Sampling and Choice Phases",
    "justification": "Through the described robot-sampling task involving two phases (sampling phase where participants sample outcomes, and a subsequent choice phase), the paper investigates how memory operates during experience-based decisions to understand underlying cognitive processes."
