    "justification": "The study analyzed the proportion of bets that customers placed on a hand identical to previous consecutive outcomes. This measurement indicates whether gamblers follow the trend (positive recency). Specifically, Analysis 1 showed that the majority of customers' bets followed trends after a longer streak of consecutive outcomes."

    "measured_by": "Proportion of bets after an interrupted streak of outcomes",
    "justification": "To disentangle positive recency from the hot outcome fallacy, the study measured the betting proportion after a streak of consecutive outcomes was interrupted. The analysis showed that the majority of customers were more likely to place bets on outcomes other than the recent streak after its interruption, which aligns with positive recency rather than the hot outcome fallacy."

    "topic_or_construct": "Gambler's Fallacy",
    "measured_by": "Analysis of bet amounts when following vs. betting against the trend",
    "justification": "Analyses 3 through 5 involved examining bet amounts when gamblers followed the trend versus betting against it. The finding here involved the average bet amount slightly increasing with streak length when following the trend, which supports the presence of positive recency and contrasts with the gambler's fallacy where gamblers would expect an inverse outcome."
