    "topic_or_construct": "Illusory Truth Effect",
    "measured_by": "Truth rating scales",
    "justification": "The paper describes how participants rate the truthfulness of previously exposed statements on a scale from 'Definitely False' to 'Definitely True', indicating the measurement of the illusory truth effect through these truth ratings."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Illusory Implication Effect",
    "measured_by": "Truth rating scales",
    "justification": "The study assesses whether prior exposure to premise statements affects participants' ratings of logically implied statements, showing increased or decreased truth ratings depending on the implication. The measurement of this effect is done using truth rating scales."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Processing Fluency",
    "measured_by": "Truth rating scales",
    "justification": "The connection between processing fluency and the illusory truth effect is examined by observing how exposure makes subsequent processing more fluent, which is evaluated through participants' truth ratings post-exposure."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Familiarity Effects",
    "measured_by": "Truth rating scales",
    "justification": "The effect of familiarity on participants' truth ratings is examined in the study where the researchers look at whether familiar statements are rated as more true. This is assessed through the same truth rating scales used to evaluate the illusory truth effect."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Belief Formulation",
    "measured_by": "Truth rating and confidence ratings",
    "justification": "Participants' belief formation was measured through their truth ratings and confidence ratings about the statements in the experiments, which captures how mere exposure may lead to belief formation."
