    "measured_by": "Response bias (d' and response criterion)",
    "justification": "The study used signal detection theory to assess sensory and decisional biases by computing d' (sensitivity) and response criterion (bias) over blocks. These measures helped differentiate the changes in sensory and decisional components of perceptual decision making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Sensory bias",
    "measured_by": "Face distortion ratings",
    "justification": "In Experiment 3, participants rated the subjective strength of face distortion they perceived after each trial without the presence of artificially distorted faces. This allowed the researchers to assess the sensory bias independent of their decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decisional bias",
    "measured_by": "Response bias shift over time",
    "justification": "The decrease in response bias over time in the illusion condition was interpreted as a decisional adjustment, as the sensory signal remained constant. This suggests that participants adjusted their decisional bias rather than the sensory processing."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Response bias",
    "measured_by": "Reaction time (RT) and confidence ratings",
    "justification": "Corresponding shifts in RT and confidence over time were used to corroborate the interpretation of a decisional bias counteracting a perceptual bias. Longer RTs and lower confidence in the illusion condition in later blocks supported this interpretation."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Face distortion illusion effect",
    "measured_by": "Post-experiment survey",
    "justification": "A post-experiment survey asked participants if the illusion changed over the course of the experiment, with responses indicating that the illusion strength either stayed the same or became slightly stronger over time. This supported the conclusion that the sensory bias did not weaken."
