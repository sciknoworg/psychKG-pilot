    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)",
    "justification": "The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) is explicitly described as a measure of individual differences in rational thought, particularly in detecting and overriding intuitive but incorrect responses. This is supported by the article's detailed description of CRT's purpose and usage."

    "topic_or_construct": "Verbal Cognitive Reflection",
    "measured_by": "Verbal Cognitive Reflection Test (Verbal CRT)",
    "justification": "The Verbal Cognitive Reflection Test is developed and validated in the article to measure cognitive reflection without the confounding effects of mathematical ability. The test includes verbal problems that assess the ability to detect and override intuitive but incorrect responses similar to the traditional CRT."

    "measured_by": "Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT)",
    "justification": "The Berlin Numeracy Test is used in the article to measure statistical numeracy, which includes the ability to understand and use statistical and probability information. The Validity of BNT within the context of the research is also discussed."

    "measured_by": "International Cognitive Ability Resource (ICAR) Items",
    "justification": "Four matrix reasoning items from the International Cognitive Ability Resource (ICAR) are used to measure fluid intelligence, which is defined as the ability to reason and solve novel problems. The psychometric properties and factor analysis results support this."

    "measured_by": "Belief Bias Measure",
    "justification": "A six-syllogism task that assesses the conflict between the logical validity of a syllogism and the believability of its conclusion is used to measure Belief Bias. Participants indicate whether conclusions logically follow from premises, capturing reasoning biases."

    "measured_by": "Risk Preference Measure",
    "justification": "The Risk Preference measure involves presenting participants with options to choose between a sure reward and a risky option with a higher expected value. The responses reveal individual differences in risk-taking behavior."
