    "justification": "The LMS model was used to infer participants' subjective cue weights by fitting the model to the estimation task data while taking into account experiences from the choice task. The model helped identify that almost all participants exhibited knowledge that went beyond mere cue order\u2014specifically, they learned cue weight values, as evidenced by their performance in the estimation task and their fluctuating knowledge across trials."

    "justification": "The WADD and DE models were used to analyze participants\u2019 choice patterns, determining that the WADD strategy best described the largest group of participants, while the DE heuristic also captured a sizable group. The models relied on cue weight information obtained from the LMS model, showing an interaction between learned cue weights and choice strategy performance."

    "measured_by": "Insight Questions",
    "justification": "Periodic self-reports through insight questions during the choice task asked participants to rate the strength of each cue's effect on option value, providing insight into participants' evolving knowledge of cue order and weight. These ratings showed gradual learning over time, although the exact nature of cue knowledge (weights vs. orders) was better discerned with other methods like LMS."
