    "justification": "The study introduces models M1s and M1m, which include a perseveration term to capture the effect of previous choices on future decisions. The explanation and inclusion of this term help assess how action perseveration influences learning rates and decision-making processes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Learning rates (for positive and negative outcomes)",
    "measured_by": "Reinforcement learning models (M0, M0b, M1s, M1m)",
    "justification": "The paper discusses the estimation of learning rates using various RL models. It particularly examines how learning rates are adjusted based on positive (win) and negative (loss) outcomes, and how these are affected by including or excluding the perseveration term."

    "measured_by": "Reinforcement learning models (M0, M0b, M1s, M1m)",
    "justification": "The inverse temperature parameter, which controls the sharpness of the value difference between options in the choice probability, is estimated using the RL models discussed. Its reliability and estimation biases are thoroughly examined in the study."

    "measured_by": "Reinforcement learning models incorporating volatile outcomes",
    "justification": "The paper describes volatility-dependent learning using a task with win-volatile (WV) and loss-volatile (LV) blocks. It examines how the RL models adjust learning rates under different levels of volatility in the feedback."

    "justification": "The study evaluates the reliability of different RL model parameters over time through test-retest analyses and parameter recovery simulations, highlighting variations in stability across parameters."

    "measured_by": "Information bias learning task",
    "justification": "The behavioral traits such as choice accuracy before and after reversals, and stay probabilities after different types of feedback are measured through the information bias learning task developed by Pulcu and Browning."
