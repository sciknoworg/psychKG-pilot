    "justification": "The SDT framework is used to quantify biases in the decision-making process towards or away from differently rewarded stimuli, taking into account individual variation in the perception of the stimuli. Specifically, the paper describes how SDT enables researchers to quantify biases, such as in tasks where participants discriminate between high and low reward tones, and how biases in perceptual decision-making can be linked to underlying psychological constructs like affective bias."
