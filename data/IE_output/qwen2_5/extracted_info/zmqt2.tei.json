    "topic_or_construct": "Individual cognitive processing",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported measures of cognitive capabilities",
    "justification": "The paper mentions that Woolley and colleagues (2007) used self-reported measures of cognitive capabilities to study the effects of spatial and object processing on dyadic task performance, indicating the use of self-reported measures for assessing individual cognitive processing."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "EEG-Engagement (EEG-E)",
    "measured_by": "Voltage power from EEG",
    "justification": "The paper explains that EEG-E is computed by modeling the participant\u2019s neural activity's voltage power, and higher levels of EEG-E are proposed to correspond with higher levels of attention, task demand, and cognitive demand."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "EEG-Workload (EEG-WL)",
    "measured_by": "Voltage power from EEG",
    "justification": "The paper states that EEG-WL is computed by modeling the voltage power of the participant\u2019s neural activity and increases with higher executive function, task demand, and working memory load during complex tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Neurophysiologic Synchronies (NS)",
    "measured_by": "Combination of EEG-Engagement and EEG-Workload",
    "justification": "The paper indicates that NS is a group-level measure calculated by aggregating EEG-Engagement and/or EEG-Workload across members, reflecting how synchronized a team's neural activity is, with higher synchronization correlating with better teamwork and communication."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive readiness",
    "measured_by": "Alpha oscillations (7 -13 Hz) in EEG",
    "justification": "The paper explains that cognitive readiness is reflected in EEG markers like alpha oscillations, with differences in pre-stimulus neural activity and changes in alpha phase predicting efficient sensory information processing."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive flexibility",
    "measured_by": "Theta oscillations (4 -7 Hz) in EEG",
    "justification": "The paper discusses that theta oscillations in EEG activity are linked to cognitive flexibility, particularly in the frontal cortex of the brain, demonstrating deficits in cognitive flexibility when theta power is lower."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Shared mental models",
    "measured_by": "Neurophysiological synchronies of EEG activity",
    "justification": "The paper mentions that neurophysiological synchronies come from aggregating EEG activity of team members, demonstrating how aligned their neural activity is in processing common information, indicative of shared mental models."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Individual Alpha Frequency (IAF)",
    "measured_by": "Spectral peak analysis of EEG",
    "justification": "The paper indicates that IAF is derived from the prominent peak in alpha frequency (7 -13 Hz), measured using spectral analysis of EEG data, where variations reflect differences in information processing speed and attention."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Aperiodic Exponent of EEG",
    "measured_by": "Power spectral density analysis of EEG",
    "justification": "The paper explains that the 1/\u0192 exponent of EEG is isolated through power spectral density analysis of resting-state EEG, where the slope indicates neural noise and links to cognitive readiness and efficiency."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attentional control",
    "measured_by": "Think-aloud verbal data analysis",
    "justification": "The paper states that attentional control is studied in MOC research using think-aloud verbal data, analyzing tone, speed, pausing, and word choice to understand how attention is directed towards selective stimuli."
