    "justification": "The authors describe using a Dirac-delta function to model perseveration, noting that its probability is 0 everywhere except at 0, where it is 1. This function was used to define perseveration behavior in the learning task."

    "topic_or_construct": "Anchoring bias",
    "measured_by": "Difference between initial prediction location and updated location",
    "justification": "The anchoring bias was measured by analyzing the discrepancy between the initial prediction location and the updated belief location in the modified task condition, where an external anchor was introduced. This manipulation revealed age-related differences in the anchoring effect."

    "justification": "The study used a regression model to calculate average learning rates. Specifically, it used the formula a_t = \u03b2_0 + \u03b2_1\u03b4_t in the first experiment and a_t = \u03b2_0 + \u03b2_1\u03b4_t + \u03b2_2y_t in the follow-up experiment to determine participants' learning rates."

    "topic_or_construct": "Unknown helicopter location prediction",
    "measured_by": "Reduced Bayesian Model",
    "justification": "Participants' predictions of the unknown helicopter location were modeled using a reduced Bayesian framework that incorporated parameters like relative uncertainty, change-point probability, and hazard rate. This allowed the researchers to simulate beliefs about the helicopter's location."
