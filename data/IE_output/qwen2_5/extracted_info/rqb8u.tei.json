    "justification": "The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) was used as a behavioral measure of memory precision in this study. Specifically, the Lure Discrimination Index (LDI) from the MST was used to index mnemonic discrimination ability, correlating higher scores with better memory precision, and this measure was linked to the influence of memory sampling on decision-making."

    "justification": "The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) served as a tool to assess pattern separation, a key aspect of memory that declines with aging. Participants' ability to distinguish between objects during the MST provided insights into their pattern separation capacity, which was then related to their decision-making behavior in the choice task."

    "justification": "A computational model that included both memory sampling and reinforcement learning processes was used to analyze participants' choices in the decision-making task. The model allowed extraction of the degree to which individuals relied on memory sampling, which was then correlated with memory precision measures, such as the LDI."

    "justification": "The computational model applied to participants' choices also incorporated reinforcement learning processes. The model's parameters related to reinforcement learning allowed quantifying individual reliance on this decision-making strategy, contrasting it with memory sampling contributions."
