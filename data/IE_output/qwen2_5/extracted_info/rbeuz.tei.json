    "measured_by": "Pavlovian Performance Index (PPI)",
    "justification": "The article describes the use of the Pavlovian Performance Index (PPI) as a measure to assess Pavlovian bias, which is calculated as the mean of two measures: 'Reward-based invigoration' and 'Punishment-based suppression'. This index quantifies the propensity to initiate actions towards rewards and inhibit responses to potential losses."

    "topic_or_construct": "Pavlovian bias (PB)",
    "measured_by": "Computational model parameter \u03c0",
    "justification": "The computational model in the study extracted the Pavlovian bias parameter (\u03c0), which scales learned stimulus value to favor action/inaction for win/avoid cards, respectively. This parameter is a more sensitive measure to changes in Pavlovian bias under low controllability compared to the PPI."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Control (CC)",
    "measured_by": "Response accuracy in Pavlovian-conflict trials",
    "justification": "The study evaluated cognitive control by measuring response accuracy, especially in Pavlovian-conflict trials, where participants need to suppress Pavlovian response tendencies. Improved accuracy in such trials indicates enhanced cognitive control."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Outcome controllability",
    "measured_by": "Manipulated task design with varying controllability",
    "justification": "Outcome controllability was directly manipulated in the study design; participants in the manipulated group faced low controllability situations, while control participants faced high controllability conditions. This allowed for the assessment of how controllability affects performance and decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Control",
    "measured_by": "Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC) activity",
    "justification": "The study links cognitive control to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which is hypothesized to suppress maladaptive Pavlovian bias. Improved cognitive control via HD-tDCS over this region was inferred from changes in response accuracy and the computational model parameters."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Learned Helplessness (LH)",
    "measured_by": "Behaviors in low outcome controllability conditions",
    "justification": "The study indirectly measures learned helplessness by observing behaviors (e.g., motor passivity, impaired decision-making) in conditions of low outcome controllability, which are known to be associated with LH."
