    "justification": "Fazio et al. (2004) experiments confirmed the existence of learning traps in a series of experiments involving approach-avoid decisions with bean stimuli varying along two continuous dimensions. Participants often incorrectly avoided positive prospects, demonstrating learning traps when they entered a state where their behavior prevented further experience and learning."

    "measured_by": "ALCOVE-RL model simulations and Experiments 1 and 2",
    "justification": "The selective attention mechanism in the ALCOVE-RL model was used in computer simulations and human experiments (Experiments 1 and 2) to demonstrate the attentional learning trap where learners selectively attend to fewer dimensions, leading them to ignore a dimension that later proves useful. This creates learning traps in both simulated and real environments."

    "topic_or_construct": "Hot stove effect",
    "measured_by": "Denrell & March (2001)",
    "justification": "The hot stove effect was introduced by Denrell & March (2001) to explain how early stochastic experiences can lead agents to avoid positive prospects that appear negative based on initial encounters, which illustrates the hot stove effect learning trap where agents generalize from early stochastic experiences, leading to suboptimal avoidance behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "Category learning and generalization",
    "measured_by": "Experiments involving category learning tasks with artificial stimuli",
    "justification": "Experiments involving category learning tasks used artificial stimuli to show how selective attention and generalization from past experience can create learning traps. Participants tended to adopt incorrect one-dimensional rules due to the structure of the learning tasks and choice-dependent feedback."
