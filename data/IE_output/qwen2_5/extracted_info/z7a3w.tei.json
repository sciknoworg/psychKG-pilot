    "measured_by": "Dictator Game",
    "justification": "The article describes experiments where the prosocial behavior of participants was measured through a Dictator Game, in which participants decided between a prosocial and self-serving option. The study specifically mentioned manipulating certainty and uncertainty conditions within this game to observe effects on decision-making (e.g., 'Study 1', 'Study 2')."

    "topic_or_construct": "impact uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "receiver's income uncertainty",
    "justification": "Impact uncertainty, defined as uncertainty about the negative impact on others' well-being, was measured by manipulating information about the receiver's income level. Participants were given information about possible income levels (rich, middle, or poor) of the receiver, and their decisions were analyzed under conditions of impact uncertainty."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "outcome uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Hidden Information Game",
    "justification": "Outcome uncertainty, defined as uncertainty about whether a decision will lead to a particular outcome, was specifically measured in the Hidden Information Game, where participants had a chance that their self-serving decision would lead to a worse or better outcome for the receiver depending on a virtual coin flip."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "social norms",
    "measured_by": "incentivized coordination game",
    "justification": "The study examined social norms through an incentivized coordination game, where participants predicted how others would evaluate the social appropriateness of different choices. This game measured the participant's perception of social norms and their impact on behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive and affective empathy",
    "measured_by": "Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE)",
    "justification": "Cognitive and affective empathy were measured using the QCAE questionnaire as part of the method to examine if these traits could moderate the effect of impact uncertainty on prosocial behavior. The QCAE was used as a well-established psychometric tool in the relevant study."
