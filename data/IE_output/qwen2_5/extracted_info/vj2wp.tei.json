    "measured_by": "RL model with asymmetric learning rates",
    "justification": "GD patients exhibited altered learning rates for positive and negative reward prediction errors, as measured by the RL model with asymmetric learning rates (Suzuki et al., 2023). This was associated with enhanced neural responses in the anterior insula."

    "measured_by": "RL models with choice perseverance and asymmetric learning rates",
    "justification": "Behavioral inflexibility was captured by RL models incorporating choice perseverance and asymmetric learning rates, with the perseverance parameter being significantly different between OCD patients and healthy controls (Hauser et al., 2017)."
