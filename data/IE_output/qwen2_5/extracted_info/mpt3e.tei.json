    "justification": "The paper explicitly states that participants reported their confidence in their choice on a 4-point scale following the decision in the two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) tasks, indicating that subjective confidence was directly quantified using a 4-point confidence rating scale."

    "topic_or_construct": "chosen-unchosen rule of confidence",
    "measured_by": "hierarchical linear regression",
    "justification": "The chosen-unchosen rule, which considers the chosen and unchosen stimulus values, was assessed through hierarchical linear regression models. The models demonstrated superior fit over the diff-sum rule by comparing AIC and BIC scores, suggesting that confidence was better explained by this rule."

    "topic_or_construct": "confidence framing effect",
    "measured_by": "summed stimulus value effect",
    "justification": "The confidence framing effect was measured by the influence of the summed stimulus value on confidence ratings. The paper reports that confidence ratings were modulated by the summed value differently under the 'more' and 'less' decision frames, indicating the occurrence of the framing effect."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "goal-directed modulation of metacognition",
    "measured_by": "dot-number discrimination task under framing conditions",
    "justification": "The goal-directed control in constituting decisional evidence, leading to the confidence framing effect, was experimentally investigated using a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) dot-number discrimination task under 'choose more' and 'choose less' frames. Different patterns of confidence ratings under these frames were observed, supporting the construct."
