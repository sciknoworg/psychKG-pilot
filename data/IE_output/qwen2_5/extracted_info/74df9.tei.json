    "measured_by": "Evidence Accumulation Models (EAMs)",
    "justification": "EAMs have provided a detailed account of how humans make decisions, predicting both the response choice and time of each decision, offering a process-level explanation for rapid decision-making experiments. They provide both a theoretical basis and a measurement tool for estimating latent variables from empirical data related to decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "response selection process within decision-making",
    "measured_by": "diffusion model (a type of EAM)",
    "justification": "The diffusion model allows researchers to decompose choice response time distributions into latent variables such as drift rate, decision threshold, and non-decision time, relating directly to task ability, response caution, and perceptual/motor processes respectively. It's particularly useful for understanding how these variables differ across groups or experimental conditions."

    "topic_or_construct": "speed-accuracy tradeoff",
    "measured_by": "Evidence Accumulation Models (EAMs)",
    "justification": "EAMs can explain the speed-accuracy tradeoff through the concept of response caution\u2014people who are faster often sacrifice accuracy, while slower responses tend to be more accurate. This tradeoff is captured through adjustments in the decision threshold within these models."

    "measured_by": "modified EAMs with additional data sources",
    "justification": "Extensions of EAMs with additional sources of data such as choice confidence or post-decision responses (e.g., double responding) can provide further constraints on specific dynamics within the decision process, beyond just the choice response time distributions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive control and conflict",
    "measured_by": "EAMs in conflict tasks like the Stroop task",
    "justification": "EAMs can be specifically developed to account for conflict in tasks such as the Stroop or flanker tasks, providing a mechanistic understanding of how cognitive control operates. They allow the estimation of latent variables related to inhibition and processing speeds."
