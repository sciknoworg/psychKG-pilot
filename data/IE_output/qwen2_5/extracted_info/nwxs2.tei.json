    "justification": "The query theory experimental paradigm is used to measure memory-based decision making by asking participants to list thoughts that come to their minds as they deliberate on a decision prompt. This paradigm provides a structure for exploring how memory and decision-making processes interact."

    "justification": "The CMR model is applied to quantify thought retrieval dynamics, particularly in terms of how thought clusters are related semantically and decision-wise over time. This model helps in predicting transitions between thought clusters."
