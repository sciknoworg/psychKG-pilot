    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognition",
    "measured_by": "Confidence ratings on a six-point scale",
    "justification": "The paper describes a task where participants rated their confidence on a six-point scale ranging from 'certainly wrong' to 'certainly correct' after each decision. This rating was used to measure participants' metacognitive judgments about the correctness of their decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Stimulus Congruent Evidence (SCE)",
    "measured_by": "Assignment of stimulus color elements as congruent or incongruent",
    "justification": "The study analyzed which elements of a color stimulus (red or blue) influenced participants' decision-making and confidence ratings. Elements that matched the average color of the stimulus were deemed congruent."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Stimulus Incongruent Evidence (SIE)",
    "measured_by": "Assignment of stimulus color elements as incongruent",
    "justification": "The same analysis measuring which color elements affected confidence also looked at how incongruent elements (those that did not match the average color) influenced responses and confidence."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Response Congruent Evidence (RCE)",
    "measured_by": "Response congruency-based analytical contrast",
    "justification": "The investigation into RCE used statistical contrasts focusing on elements that matched the participant's response. The paper discusses how much their confidence was influenced by evidence congruent with their decision."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Response Incongruent Evidence (RIE)",
    "measured_by": "Response incongruency-based analytical contrast",
    "justification": "Similarly to the RCE analysis, the RIE effect was measured using contrasts to detect the influence of evidence that contradicted the participant's response on their confidence judgments."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Robust Averaging Effect",
    "measured_by": "Electrophysiological measures and computation model comparison",
    "justification": "The original LPR by de Gardelle et al. (2011) and further analysis in the paper use electrophysiological measures and computation models to study how decomposed color stimuli evidence was weighed differently depending on its proximity to a category boundary during confidence calculation."
