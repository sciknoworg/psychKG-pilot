    "justification": "The paper explicitly discusses using a Conditional Associative Learning paradigm to investigate the impact of stimulus discriminability on learning processes, especially focusing on reinforcement learning (RL) and working memory (WM). This method permitted the manipulation and observation of learning under various discriminability conditions."

    "measured_by": "Computational Models",
    "justification": "The study employed computational modeling to simulate and analyze RL processes, comparing models with condition-specific RL learning rates, RL decision confusion, etc. These models were used to assess how RL was impacted by different stimulus conditions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Working Memory (WM)",
    "measured_by": "Computational Models and Surprise Memory Test",
    "justification": "WM was measured through computational models evaluating WM decay, decision confusion, and its interaction with RL. Additionally, a surprise memory test in Experiment 2 further probed WM's role in stimulus-response associations without WM's immediate influence."

    "justification": "The study introduced the RLWM framework to assess the relative contributions of RL and WM processes in learning. It was used to analyze how these processes interacted in different stimulus conditions and their effects on behavior."
