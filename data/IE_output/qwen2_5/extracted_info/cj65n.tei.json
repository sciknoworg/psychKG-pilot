    "topic_or_construct": "Affective reactivity",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral task with self-report probes",
    "justification": "The study used a variant of a behavioral task to quantify affective reactivity by embedding self-report probes of participants' momentary affective valence. Computational modeling was employed to analyze these self-reports from the task."

    "justification": "Participants completed the GAD-7 questionnaire to assess the severity of their anxiety symptoms."

    "topic_or_construct": "Depression",
    "measured_by": "7-down subscale of the 7-up/7-down scale",
    "justification": "The 7-down subscale was used to measure participants' self-reported severity of depression symptoms."

    "topic_or_construct": "Hypomania",

    "justification": "The 7-up subscale was used to assess participants' self-reported severity of hypomania symptoms."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Anhedonia",
    "measured_by": "Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)",
    "justification": "The SHAPS was utilized to measure participants' self-reported severity of anhedonia symptoms, with scores being reverse-coded to maintain consistency."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotion Dysregulation",
    "measured_by": "Variation within ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and task-based measures",
    "justification": "The study implies that greater variation in emotion self-reports is associated with increased symptoms of emotion dysregulation, as seen in participants with higher anxiety and hypomania symptoms who showed more unsystematic variation in affect."
