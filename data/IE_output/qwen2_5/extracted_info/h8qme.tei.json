    "measured_by": "Moral Inference Task",
    "justification": "The Moral Inference Task was used to measure several facets of social cognition related to antagonism, including prior beliefs about moral character, learning of agents' harm preferences, subjective impressions, and trust decisions. Participants' performance on this task revealed a link between higher antagonism scores and lower accuracy in predicting others' moral decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Antagonism",
    "measured_by": "Self-Report Clinical and Transdiagnostic Symptom Questionnaire Battery",
    "justification": "A battery of transdiagnostic symptom questionnaires was used to capture antagonism as a latent symptom dimension. Factor analysis identified antagonism as one of the factors based on questionnaire items' loadings, indicating that antagonism was measured through self-report questionnaires."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social representations",
    "measured_by": "Moral Inference Task",
    "justification": "Social representations accuracy related to antagonism was assessed using the Moral Inference Task, where participants' ability to form accurate impressions of generous and selfish agents was evaluated. The task provided an objective measure of social representation accuracy, showing reduced differentiation and certainty in higher antagonism."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Prior beliefs about moral character",
    "measured_by": "Moral Inference Task (prior belief report)",
    "justification": "The Moral Inference Task included a phase where participants reported their prior expectations about agents' moral character before observing any behavior. Higher antagonism predicted stronger pessimistic prior beliefs about the agents, indicating this aspect of social representation was also measured through this task."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Trust decisions",
    "measured_by": "Moral Inference Task (trust game phase)",
    "justification": "The Moral Inference Task incorporated a trust game phase where participants made trust decisions based on learned information about agents' harm preferences. Antagonism was associated with less adaptive trust decisions, indicating that the task also measured trust behaviors."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Predictive accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Moral Inference Task (prediction phase)",
    "justification": "Participants' ability to accurately predict agents' moral decisions was assessed in the Moral Inference Task's prediction phase. Antagonism was linked with lower prediction accuracy, showing that the task effectively measured the accuracy of social inferences related to the construct."
