    "topic_or_construct": "Oxytocin-related parochial preferences (\u03b1I > \u03b1O)",
    "measured_by": "Salivary oxytocin levels",
    "justification": "Studies with human participants revealed that in-group biased preferences in social behavior can be inferred from observable social interactions and are supported by elevated levels of oxytocin measured in saliva. Higher donations to in-group rather than out-group members during economic games reflect stronger concern for in-group interests over out-group interests, which is a parochial preference mediated by oxytocin."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived out-group threat (\u03b2)",
    "measured_by": "Brain oxytocin levels and aggressive behavior responses",
    "justification": "Across vertebrates, oxytocin-mediated aggressive responses toward threatening outsiders are observed, indicating the role of oxytocin in increasing the perception and reactions to out-group threats. For instance, in nursing rats, oxytocin knockout results in a lack of defensive aggression toward threats, illustrating the necessity of oxytocin for such responses."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reputation and compliance with group norms (\u03b3)",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral measures in social games",
    "justification": "Oxytocin facilitates interpersonal synchronization and alignment, as evidenced by humans changing their opinions more under the influence of oxytocin when given the opportunity to conform to group members' views. Furthermore, in third-party punishment games, oxytocin increases punitive actions toward unfair behaviors, supporting the role of oxytocin in upholding social norms and reputation management within groups."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Affiliation and social bonding",
    "measured_by": "Oxytocin levels from blood plasma, urine, and saliva",
    "justification": "Studies measuring oxytocin levels from blood, urine, and saliva link elevated oxytocin with prosocial behaviors such as affiliation and cooperation. For example, oxytocin levels increase following affiliative touch and cooperative exchanges in mammals, demonstrating the biological underpinnings of social bonding facilitated by oxytocin."
