    "topic_or_construct": "State anxiety",
    "measured_by": "The Anxiety Thermometer",
    "justification": "The paper uses the Anxiety Thermometer, a time-efficient measurement tool that requires participants to report their anxiety on a scale from 0 (not at all anxious) to 10 (extremely anxious), indicating elevated anxiety during high-pressure conditions (see manipulation checks)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Predictive eye movements",
    "measured_by": "Active Inference Modelling",
    "justification": "The study employs a computational model based on Active Inference principles to estimate the rate of belief updating in participants' predictive eye movements, revealing slower updating under anxiety."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Physiological arousal",
    "measured_by": "Polar H10 Heart Rate Sensor",
    "justification": "The heart rate sensor measures sympathetic nervous system activation changes related to anxious states, with participants wearing the device throughout the experiment to capture differences between high and low pressure conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Gaze variability and entropy",
    "measured_by": "Sample entropy calculation",
    "justification": "Sample entropy is used to measure the complexity of pre-release gaze patterns, with higher entropy values suggesting a more random distribution of gaze points under anxiety conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "In-flight tracking efficiency",
    "measured_by": "Pursuit gain calculation",
    "justification": "Pursuit gain measures how closely eye position follows the ball's trajectory, showing participants in high-pressure conditions maintain or improve their in-flight tracking compared to low-pressure conditions."
