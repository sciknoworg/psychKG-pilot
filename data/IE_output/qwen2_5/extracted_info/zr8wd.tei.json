    "measured_by": "Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) model",
    "justification": "The authors applied the LBA to fingerprint discrimination tasks, selecting parameters such as threshold (response caution), mean rate of evidence accumulation, and rate variability to predict patterns of response times and accuracy. This approach reveals how different finger stimuli and experimental manipulations influence decision-making processes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff in Fingerprint Discrimination",
    "measured_by": "LBA under different emphasis conditions",
    "justification": "The study shows that the LBA could effectively model the effects of emphasizing speed versus accuracy across fingerprint discrimination tasks. Under speed emphasis, participants showed increased mean rates of evidence accumulation and reduced response thresholds compared to accuracy emphasis, illustrating the tradeoff."

    "measured_by": "LBA with participant group variations (feedback vs. no-feedback)",
    "justification": "In Experiment 3, the study utilized the LBA to analyze differences in response thresholds, mean rates, and rate variability after training with feedback. It showed specific changes in these parameters for the feedback group, indicating a shift in cognitive strategies related to decision-making."

    "justification": "Participants\u2019 thresholds were analyzed to reveal response caution in decision-making. Experiment 1 demonstrated that participants were biased toward deciding prints came from different fingers by lowering thresholds for the 'different' response, reflecting decision criteria."

    "measured_by": "LBA rate parameter comparisons under noise conditions",
    "justification": "Experiment 2 revealed that the LBA captured changes in the rate of evidence accumulation and mean rate differences due to visual noise applied to fingerprint stimuli, showing that noise selectively influenced same-finger print discriminability."
