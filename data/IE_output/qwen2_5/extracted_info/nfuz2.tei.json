    "justification": "The Empathy Selection Task is a behavioral paradigm wherein people choose between an empathy task (e.g., sharing in the internal experience of a stranger) or a comparable non-empathic task. This task has been used to demonstrate that people consistently prefer to avoid empathy in the absence of acquired rewards."

    "measured_by": "Empathy Selection Task",
    "justification": "Ferguson and colleagues found that individuals were more willing to empathize with a self-nominated loved-other than a stranger, likely due to perceived social rewards. This was observed through participants describing such empathizing as less effortful compared to empathizing with strangers."
