    "measured_by": "Probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) paradigms",
    "justification": "The paper describes how PRL paradigms are used to assess flexible choice behavior that requires learning structure in uncertain environments and adapting responses to changes, aligning with the cognitive processes implicated in flexible behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "Restricted, repetitive behavior (RRB)",
    "measured_by": "Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)",
    "justification": "The ADI-R and RBS-R are used to assess RRB symptomatology in ASD, with the ADI-R providing a structured interview score for RRB and the RBS-R a questionnaire score, specifically focusing on Ritualistic-Sameness and Stereotyped Behavior subscales related to behavioral rigidity."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive flexibility",
    "measured_by": "Probabilistic reversal learning (PRL)",
    "justification": "The PRL task is utilized to evaluate cognitive flexibility by requiring participants to adapt their responses when task rules change, reflecting flexible behavior and reinforcement learning."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reinforcement learning and reward processing",
    "measured_by": "Counterfactual update model, Reward-punishment model, Experience-weighted attraction model",
    "justification": "These reinforcement learning models are employed to investigate underlying learning mechanisms in probabilistic reversal learning. They quantify learning rates and other parameters to understand differences between ASD and TD groups."

    "topic_or_construct": "Anxiety",
    "measured_by": "Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Youth Inventories (BYI-II)",
    "justification": "The BAI and BYI-II are used to assess comorbid anxiety symptoms in ASD participants. Adolescents and adults self-reported on the BAI or anxiety subscale of BYI-II, while children had their caregivers report on the anxiety subscale of BYI-II."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)",
    "measured_by": "ADHD Rating Scale-5",
    "justification": "The ADHD Rating Scale-5 is used to measure associated ADHD symptoms in ASD participants, with parent and self-reports gathered for a comprehensive assessment of ADHD comorbidity."
