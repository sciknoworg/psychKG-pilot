    "topic_or_construct": "Risk-taking for status outcomes",
    "measured_by": "Status risk task",
    "justification": "The status risk task was designed to assess risk-taking for social status outcomes by presenting participants with gambles that could affect their social ranking, without monetary consequences. The task evaluated whether testosterone influenced these status-driven risk-taking decisions, particularly when participants were in high social status positions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk-taking for monetary outcomes",
    "measured_by": "Monetary risk task",
    "justification": "The monetary risk task was used to evaluate risk-taking behaviors involving monetary gains and losses. This task was used to isolate the effects of testosterone on purely monetary decisions, distinct from status-related risks, to determine whether testosterone influenced these types of economic decisions."

    "measured_by": "Competition paradigm",
    "justification": "Participants\u2019 social status was manipulated via a competition paradigm, which randomly assigned them to high or low social rankings based on their scores in a reaction time task. This method was used to create experimental conditions where individuals believed they had either high or low status prior to completing the risk tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "Trait dominance",
    "measured_by": "16-PF-R (Schneewind & Graf, 1998)",
    "justification": "The 16-PF-R scale was used to measure trait dominance, which is a personality trait hypothesized to moderate the effects of testosterone on status-seeking behaviors, especially in individuals with high trait dominance."

    "topic_or_construct": "Testosterone levels",
    "measured_by": "Saliva hormone concentrations measured via LCMS/MS",
    "justification": "Saliva samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) to measure testosterone levels before and after administration, confirming the success of the exogenous testosterone manipulation."
