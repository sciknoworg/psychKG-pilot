    "justification": "The article discusses how RDM and DDM models are used to represent decision-making where support for options accumulates in separate accumulators. These models were tested against empirical data from the experiments, where participants were shown different stimulus conditions and their response times and accuracy were recorded. The models incorporated a carryover parameter \u03c9 to handle changes in options, aiming to capture priming and change-detection effects in evidence."

    "measured_by": "Geometric Similarity Representation (GSR) model",
    "justification": "The GSR model was used to test alternative-general representations of evidence, where decision-making is based on accumulated stimulus information rather than specific options. The model was fit to the data from the experiments, where participants interacted with dynamic stimuli and shifting options. The GSR model outperformed alternative-specific models in predicting response patterns and accuracy, suggesting it better captures how participants adapt their choices to changes in options."

    "justification": "The study used experimental paradigms where participants completed orientation tasks with options that could change during trials. Their response times and accuracy were measured across various switch and non-switch conditions. These tasks were designed to test how participants accumulate and remap evidence when choice options shift, providing data to evaluate alternative-specific and alternative-general models."

    "measured_by": "Stimulus features and spatial locations in the GSR model",
    "justification": "The GSR model accumulated evidence based on the underlying features of stimuli (e.g., orientation or brightness) rather than specific choice options. Participants performed tasks where stimulus locations were primed or manipulated, and their accuracy was recorded. The model's ability to explain these patterns supports the idea that participants use a feature-based representation of evidence during decision-making."
