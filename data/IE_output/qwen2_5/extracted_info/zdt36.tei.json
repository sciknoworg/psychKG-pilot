    "measured_by": "Fear Potentiated Startle and Skin Conductance Response (SCR)",
    "justification": "Five studies examined Pavlovian conditioning in MDD using fear potentiated startle and SCR measurements. These studies focused on the acquisition of aversive Pavlovian associations with inconsistent findings, suggesting the role of aversive Pavlovian conditioning in MDD is unclear."

    "topic_or_construct": "Instrumental Conditioning in MDD",
    "measured_by": "Probabilistic Reinforcement Learning Tasks",
    "justification": "Ten studies used probabilistic reinforcement learning tasks to evaluate instrumental conditioning in MDD. Key findings indicate that individuals with MDD do not use reinforcement as effectively as non-depressed individuals, showing diminished response bias toward more frequently reinforced stimuli and altered reaction times following task feedback."

    "topic_or_construct": "Pavlovian Instrumental Transfer (PIT) in MDD",
    "measured_by": "Experimental Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer Tasks",
    "justification": "Three studies examined PIT in MDD using experimental tasks that combined Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning. Results suggest diminished action-specificity of Pavlovian influences and enhanced influence of aversive Pavlovian cues on instrumental behavior in MDD compared to controls."

    "topic_or_construct": "Anhedonia in MDD",
    "measured_by": "Effort-Based Decision-Making Paradigms",
    "justification": "Anhedonia, a core symptom of MDD, is measured using effort-based decision-making tasks. Individuals with MDD exhibit lower willingness to exert effort for reward, which aligns with their reduced sensitivity to positive feedback."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Negative Attentional Bias in MDD",
    "measured_by": "Attention and Memory Assessments",
    "justification": "Negative attentional and memory biases play a role in MDD, where patients tend to detect and recall negative aspects more readily. These biases are assessed through attentional biases and memory tests for negative vs. positive stimuli."
