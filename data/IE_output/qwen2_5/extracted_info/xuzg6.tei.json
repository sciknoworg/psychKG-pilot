    "justification": "The study leveraged the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) to analyze the relationship between neural activation and the rate of evidence accumulation in category decisions. This computational model approximates the Exemplar-Based Random Walk (EBRW) framework's decision-making mechanism."

    "measured_by": "Generalized Context Model (GCM)",
    "justification": "The GCM was used to predict category evidence based on participant behavior. Specifically, the model was fit to participant-specific data to generate predictions of discriminatory evidence for category decisions, which were then related to neural activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Category learning",
    "measured_by": "Exemplar-Based Random Walk (EBRW) model",
    "justification": "The EBRW model formalizes category decisions as an evidence accumulation process based on similarity-based retrieval of category exemplars. It provides a comprehensive formal account of the behavior underlying categorization decision-making and was used to inform the hierarchical Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) analysis."
