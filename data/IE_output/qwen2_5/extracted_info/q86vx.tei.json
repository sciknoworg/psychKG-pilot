    "measured_by": "Process Dissociation approach",
    "justification": "The Process Dissociation (PD) method was used to independently measure utilitarian and deontological inclinations. This method allows researchers to dissociate the contributions of deontological and utilitarian processes in moral dilemmas, providing a more accurate measure of utilitarianism that is not confounded with harm avoidance concerns."

    "measured_by": "Analytic thinking measures",
    "justification": "Analytic thinking measures, including the Need for Cognition (NFC), Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), and Actively Open-minded Thinking (AOT) scales, were used to assess reasoning ability and style. These measures evaluate the capacity and propensity for reflection and deliberation, which are proposed to increase utilitarian moral judgment."

    "topic_or_construct": "individual differences in reasoning",
    "measured_by": "Self-report questionnaires and behavioral task measures",
    "justification": "Self-report questionnaires like the NFC, AOT, and REI, along with behavioral tasks such as the two-step reinforcement learning tasks, were employed to measure various aspects of reasoning. The positive correlation between these measures and utilitarian judgment suggests that reasoning supports cost-benefit thinking and overcomes emotional responses in moral decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "cortical thickness at dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)",
    "measured_by": "Neuroimaging data (CAT12 toolbox for SPM)",
    "justification": "Neuroanatomical measures, specifically cortical thickness at the dlPFC, were analyzed using CAT12 software. Increased cortical thickness at the dlPFC was associated with more utilitarian moral judgments, suggesting a neural basis for the association between reasoning and utilitarianism."
