    "measured_by": "Behavioral Representational Similarity Task (behRSA)",
    "justification": "The article states that participants' relatedness ratings of objects were used to measure the structure of their cognitive maps. This is supported by the results showing that participants judged item similarity in a manner consistent with various models of representational change."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Maps",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral Representational Similarity Analysis (behRSA)",
    "justification": "The study used behRSA to assess how participants represented the task structure. The results showed participants constructed internal representations that reflected aspects of the task structure useful for planning and decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Model-based Control",
    "measured_by": "Dual-system Reinforcement Learning Model",
    "justification": "The dual-system reinforcement-learning model was used to dissociate model-free and model-based decision-making strategies. The study found that participants' behavior reflected a mixture of both strategies, indicating their cognitive maps were useful for model-based control."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Higher-order Task Structure Encoding",
    "measured_by": "Direct and Indirect Item Association Models",
    "justification": "The study developed models capturing the encoding of direct and indirect associations between items, which reflect higher-order relationships in the task. Participants who encoded these higher-order structures showed better task performance and more model-based control."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Motivational Influence on Cognitive Map Construction",
    "measured_by": "Stakes Manipulation within Decision-making Task",
    "justification": "The study implemented a stakes manipulation, indicating whether a trial reward would be multiplied by a factor of 5 or 1. This showed that psychological motivation affects how individuals encode goal-directed information in their cognitive maps."
