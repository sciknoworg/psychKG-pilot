    "topic_or_construct": "Episodic Memory",
    "measured_by": "Temporal Context Model (TCM)",
    "justification": "The paper uses the Temporal Context Model (TCM) to simulate and explain the characteristics of episodic memory, such as recency and contiguity effects, and ties how these memory properties are utilized in decision making processes. The TCM is described as formalizing episodic memory retrieval that affects decision variables and choices."

    "topic_or_construct": "Procedural Memory",
    "measured_by": "Dopamine, Prediction Errors, and Stimulus-Response Habits",
    "justification": "Although not directly measured in this paper, reference is made to a putative neurocomputational mechanism involving dopamine, prediction errors, and stimulus-response habits as a shared, orthodox model for procedural memory. The text builds on this relationship between procedural memory and decision-making systems."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Declarative Memory",
    "measured_by": "Construction of Cognitive Maps or Models",
    "justification": "The paper discusses the potential correspondence between declarative memory and the cognitive maps or models thought to guide goal-directed systems for deliberative evaluation of candidate actions, which are similar to the putative relations in procedural memory decision systems."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value-directed Remembering",
    "measured_by": "Reward Magnitude",
    "justification": "Episodic retrieval is strongly affected by signs that some stimuli carry higher reward, where memory for high-reward stimuli is typically better than memory for low-reward stimuli. This is explicably examined within a computational simulation using emotional modulation of memory."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal Context",
    "measured_by": "Drifting Temporal Context in TCM",
    "justification": "The TCM uses a drifting temporal context that integrates the agent's recent experience during memory encoding and guides retrieval. It's central to explaining phenomena such as the recency and contiguity effects in free recall experiments."
