    "measured_by": "Curvature indices (e.g., MAD, MD above)",
    "justification": "Curvature indices are used to measure how strongly a trajectory is bent towards the nonchosen option, reflecting response competition. This is based on the idea that stronger curvature indicates higher cognitive conflict or hesitation during decision-making."

    "measured_by": "Change of mind trajectories",
    "justification": "Changes of mind trajectories (dCoM, dCoM2) reveal shifts in preference during the decision process. These trajectory types are identified through clustering or prototype mapping and provide insights into the temporal dynamics of decision commitment."

    "measured_by": "Complexity indices (e.g., flips, reversals, sample entropy)",
    "justification": "Complexity indices measure the spatiotemporal disorder of trajectories, providing a way to quantify the degree of response competition. Higher complexity is linked to greater competition and less smooth movement."

    "topic_or_construct": "Information processing dynamics",
    "measured_by": "Temporal dynamics analysis",
    "justification": "Analyzing the temporal evolution of trajectory features like position or angle can reveal how information is processed over time. This approach helps understand the unfolding of cognitive processes during decision-making."

    "measured_by": "Visualization of trajectory distribution",
    "justification": "Visualizing the distribution of trajectories allows researchers to assess homogeneity and identify distinct trajectory types. This is important for choosing appropriate analytical methods based on the data's properties."

    "measured_by": "Movement tracking methodologies",
    "justification": "Movement tracking captures motor actions during decision-making tasks and is used to infer the continuous development of preferences, assuming that movement features directly reflect underlying cognitive processes."
