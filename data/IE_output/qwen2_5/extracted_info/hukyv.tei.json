    "measured_by": "Math Anxiety Scale",
    "justification": "Math anxiety was measured using Ashcraft's (2002) scale to assess participants' overall math anxiety and anxiety about specific types of numbers. Higher math anxiety scores were found to be associated with increased WNB errors, justifying the use of math anxiety as an indicator of WNB."

    "topic_or_construct": "Whole Number Bias (WNB)",
    "measured_by": "Strategic Reports Analysis",
    "justification": "A coding scheme was used to analyze strategy reports provided by participants after solving health decision-making problems. Reports indicating mention of either the numerator or the denominator in isolation when making decisions were identified as WNB errors, demonstrating the direct measurement of WNB through reported strategies."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Perceptions",
    "measured_by": "Likert Scale items",
    "justification": "Risk perceptions were measured using a Likert scale where participants rated their perceived likelihood of being infected with COVID-19 and their worry levels. The scale reliably captured changes in risk perceptions as influenced by the educational intervention."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fraction Estimation Skills",
    "measured_by": "Number Line Estimation Tasks",
    "justification": "Fraction estimation skills were assessed via number line estimation tasks for fractions, whole number frequencies, and percentages. Participants' performance as percent absolute error (PAE) was used to measure their magnitude knowledge, establishing a direct link between the tasks and fraction estimation skills."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Health Decision-Making Accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Forced-choice Health Decision-Making Problems",
    "justification": "Participants' health decision-making accuracy was measured through forced-choice problems assessing their ability to compare fatalities of diseases. Their performance indicated understanding of WNB and effective use of the educational intervention."
