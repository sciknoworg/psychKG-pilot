    "justification": "The article describes that a Bayesian model, particularly model B6, was used to capture participants' level of cooperativeness. The model included parameters such as SocialBias (representing inherent social preferences) and TitXTat (scaling the reciprocation of the co-player's level of cooperation), which allowed for quantifying the degree of cooperativeness based on the players' behavior in the Space Dilemma game."

    "measured_by": "Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD)",
    "justification": "The article explains that social prediction errors were quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the prior and posterior probability distributions over the co-player's position. This measure was used to derive the absolute and directional prediction errors in participants' brains, particularly in the TPJ subregions."

    "measured_by": "Functional MRI (fMRI)",
    "justification": "The neural activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate gyrus (ACCg), and paracingulate sulci were measured using fMRI. These regions were found to be sensitive to different social contexts (cooperative vs. competitive), showing how the social context modulated the coding of changes in cooperativeness."

    "measured_by": "Behavioural Modelling with TitXTat Parameter",
    "justification": "The cooperation-competition continuum in the Space Dilemma was influenced by players' tendency to reciprocate their co-player's level of cooperation. This was modelled using a TitXTat parameter within the Bayesian models, allowing for the measurement of how much a player scaled their level of cooperation based on their co-player\u2019s actions."
