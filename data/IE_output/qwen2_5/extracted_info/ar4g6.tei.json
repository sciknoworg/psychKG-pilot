    "justification": "Participants were asked to place a physical marker on a 1m length line corresponding to the position of a symbolic number they were shown. This task is used to assess the mental number line representation and its accuracy."

    "justification": "Simulations used probabilistic tuning curves based on neural population activity relating to numerical perception. This model attempts to predict performance variations in numerical tasks like number comparison and number line estimation."

    "measured_by": "Power function models in number line estimation",
    "justification": "Evidence suggests that models using power functions fit account for more variance in children's estimates than models using logarithmic functions. This hints at the role of proportional reasoning skills in performing the number line task."

    "topic_or_construct": "Mental number line representation",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral patterns in number line estimation",
    "justification": "Young children tend to produce overestimations on smaller numbers and underestimations for larger numbers, creating a logarithmic pattern that shifts to a more linear pattern with age. This change is attributed to changes in mental number line representations."
