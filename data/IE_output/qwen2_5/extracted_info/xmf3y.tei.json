    "justification": "The Mouselab-MDP paradigm is used to measure individual differences in the depth of planning, a construct related to people's propensity to plan into the future. Participants are observed as they choose which nodes to click on and at what depth, revealing their planning strategies and costs."

    "justification": "The Effort and Planning Depth model, validated through Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning, was found to be the most effective in estimating the planning depth cost. This methodology takes into account individual differences in planning behaviors and provides parameter estimates indicating how much cost participants associate with planning further into the future."

    "measured_by": "Effort and Planning Depth model combined with Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning",
    "justification": "The mental effort cost, another element of the planning process, is also measured using the Effort and Planning Depth model with Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning. The model assesses the mental burden participants experience when choosing where and when to click, contributing to understanding their planning depth."
