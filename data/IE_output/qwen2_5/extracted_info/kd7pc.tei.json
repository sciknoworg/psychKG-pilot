    "justification": "The article describes using an orientation delayed estimation task with an intervening Stroop task during the delay period to investigate how working memory maintenance affects the direction of serial bias. The task involves participants remembering an orientation and reporting it after a delay, with the Stroop task during this delay potentially interrupting WM maintenance."

    "measured_by": "Response Time and Response Trajectory Analysis",
    "justification": "Response time and trajectory analyses were performed to understand how WM maintenance affects serial bias. Specifically, longer response times and non-straight response trajectories indicated a decision-making process during the report phase, which was influenced by the prior stimulus and the degree of WM maintenance interruption."
