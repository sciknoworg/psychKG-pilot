    "measured_by": "Confidence Weighted Majority Voting (CWMV) model",
    "justification": "The study uses a modified CWMV model to analyze decision weights and estimate information exchange during group conversations in noise and quiet conditions, providing a quantitative measure of communication ability."

    "measured_by": "Group decision-making task and weight distance summary statistics",
    "justification": "The experiment employs a group decision-making task with noise conditions, and uses four summary statistics (overall weight change, self-weighting, weight equality, and weight similarity) derived from estimated decision weights to quantify the impact of noise on communication."

    "topic_or_construct": "Successful communication in noisy environments",
    "measured_by": "Overall weight change statistic",
    "justification": "The overall weight change statistic is used to quantify how noise impacts the relative weighting scheme applied by participants, indicating deviations from an assumed 'ideal' communication scenario without inhibitive effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "Information exchange dynamics in groups",
    "measured_by": "Angular distances between weight vectors",
    "justification": "Angular distances between the weight vectors derived from the decision model provide insights into individual differences in weight assignment and information exchange dynamics in the presence of noise."
