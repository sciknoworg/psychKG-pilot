    "justification": "The study used a box-of-switches task where children were instructed to determine which switches controlled the lights. This setup was used to assess children's CVS proficiency, particularly their ability to adapt strategies based on causal sparsity."

    "justification": "Children's ability to adapt their causal hypothesis testing strategies (testing one switch at a time or multiple at once) in response to varying causal sparsity was measured through their behavior in the switch-box task."

    "justification": "The efficiency of children's chosen strategies was assessed using EIG, which quantifies the reduction in uncertainty about causal hypotheses after each intervention in the switch-box task."
