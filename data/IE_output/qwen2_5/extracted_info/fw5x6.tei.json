    "measured_by": "drift-diffusion model",
    "justification": "The drift rate bias was used as an indicator of perceptual effects as per the initial proposal, but the study found that in purely cognitive tasks, drift rate bias also occurred, challenging the one-to-one mapping between DDM parameters and effect types."
