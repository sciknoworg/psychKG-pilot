    "justification": "The study found that the FRN amplitude was larger in trials where participants intended to hit the target compared to when they did not intend to, indicating that FRN can be used to measure intention."

    "topic_or_construct": "Foresight",
    "measured_by": "P3 component of EEG",
    "justification": "The P3 amplitude was found to be significantly larger in trials with unexpected outcomes compared to expected outcomes. Since foresight is linked to the experience of surprise, this suggests the P3 can serve as a proxy for measuring foresight."

    "topic_or_construct": "Intention",
    "measured_by": "EMS-filtered EEG",
    "justification": "Exploratory EMS filtering identified spatiotemporal EEG patterns that dissociated intention-related activity in parietal and occipital cortex from foresight-related activity in centro-frontocentral and frontopolar regions, supporting the use of such EEG patterns to measure intention."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Foresight",
    "measured_by": "EMS-filtered EEG",
    "justification": "The EMS analysis revealed greater foresight-related EEG deflections in centro-frontocentral, lateral and frontopolar prefrontal areas, approximately 320-380 ms after outcome presentation, suggesting that these specific spatiotemporal patterns can be utilized for measuring foresight."
