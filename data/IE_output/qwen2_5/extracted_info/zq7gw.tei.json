    "justification": "Participants reported their confidence level on a scale from 0% (not confident at all) to 100% (completely confident) after choosing the largest shape in the size discrimination task and after categorizing the target dot in the target categorization task. This indicates the use of a confidence report scale as the measurement instrument for perceptual decision confidence."

    "measured_by": "comparison of confidence levels in 2-alternative vs 3-alternative tasks",
    "justification": "The study compared confidence levels in conditions where participants faced decisions with two alternatives versus three alternatives, with the third alternative being easliy discardable. The effect of the presence of an irrelevant third option on confidence is a measure of the dud-alternative effect."

    "topic_or_construct": "computational models of confidence",
    "measured_by": "Average-residual model, Contrast model, Max model, and Difference model",
    "justification": "The paper implemented and compared four computational models - Average-residual, Contrast, Max, and Difference - to explain how confidence is computed in the presence of irrelevant alternatives. Model fitting and simulations were used to evaluate their explanatory power for confidence increment observed in the experiments."
