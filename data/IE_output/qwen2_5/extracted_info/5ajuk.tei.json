    "justification": "The novel experiential task utilized real-time delays and artistic photographs as consumable rewards, validating the tradeoff between delay and reward magnitude and eliciting temporal discounting effects."

    "measured_by": "Hypothetical Intertemporal Choice Task",
    "justification": "The study employed a classic hypothetical task involving monetary rewards, where choices between immediate and delayed monetary options were evaluated using indifference points data."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reward Sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Pleasantness Rating Task",
    "justification": "Participants rated the pleasantness of partially occluded photographs, indirectly measuring reward sensitivity and its impact on state anxiety during experiential temporal discounting."

    "justification": "The study used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory state subscale to measure participants' anxiety symptoms experienced in the moment, relating them to increased discounting in the experiential task."

    "measured_by": "State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait Subscale",
    "justification": "The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory trait subscale was utilized to assess participants' general frequency of experiencing anxiety, which was linked to greater willingness to wait in the experiential task."
