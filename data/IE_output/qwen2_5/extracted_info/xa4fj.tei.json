    "measured_by": "Controlled Reproduction Task",
    "justification": "The text mentions the controlled reproduction task was used to establish whether a given manipulation affects subjective experience independently from effects of response bias. It was validated to measure subjective experience changes, distinguishing between perceptual and non-perceptual effects on stimulus appearance."

    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence Ratings",
    "measured_by": "High/Low Confidence Reports",
    "justification": "The experiment included participants providing 'high' or 'low' confidence ratings for their decisions. These confidence ratings were used to assess whether changes in subjective experience, as measured by other tasks, were reflected in self-reported confidence."

    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive Efficiency",
    "measured_by": "M-ratio (Meta-d'/d')",
    "justification": "Metacognitive efficiency was measured using the M-ratio, calculated as the ratio of metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d') to perceptual sensitivity (d'). This measure was used to evaluate how well confidence ratings track the accuracy of perceptual performance."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Making Bias",
    "measured_by": "Point of Subjective Equality (PSE)",
    "justification": "Signal detection metrics like the point of subjective equality (PSE) were computed from participants' decisions to evaluate how different manipulations biased their decision-making process."
