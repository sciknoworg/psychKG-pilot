    "justification": "The paper discusses how 'Theory of Machine' conceptualizes people's lay theories about algorithmic judgment, and suggests that this can be studied through observing people's interactions with and inferences about decision-support systems and AI agents (Logg, 2022)."

    "justification": "The paper mentions that algorithm aversion is measured through surveys on preferences, choice behavior in favor of humans over algorithms, comparisons of judgmental shifts, and emotional reactions to erroneous algorithms (Dietvorst et al., 2015; Logg et al., 2019; Renier et al., 2021)."

    "measured_by": "established human tests and interventions for enhancing Theory of Mind",
    "justification": "The paper references that there are established tests for Theory of Mind, such as the replication of these tests on social robots (Banks, 2019), and suggests the use of training programs aimed at enhancing Theory of Mind, like social cognitive training (Cavallini et al., 2015)."
