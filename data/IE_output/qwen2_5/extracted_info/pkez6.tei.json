    "measured_by": "Transitional RTs (Reaction Times)",
    "justification": "The study measured transitional RTs to capture whether participants' performance reflected the hierarchical structure of learned visuomotor mappings. After controlling for intrinsic finger switch costs, corrected RTs scaled with the path distance through the structure of the mapping, providing evidence that participants mentally represented and used the latent structure during action selection."

    "measured_by": "Hierarchical clustering analysis",
    "justification": "The model-free hierarchical clustering of transitional RT matrices was used to reconstruct the latent structure of the mappings learned by participants. This analysis faithfully reproduced the hierarchical structure of mappings in Experiments 1 and 2, demonstrating that individuals learned and utilized the structure built into the task."

    "measured_by": "Forced Response Paradigm",
    "justification": "The forced response paradigm was utilized to track the dynamics of action selection within trials. It involved interrupting the retrieval of visuomotor associations at various preparation time points. Errors made on these trials systematically varied in a manner consistent with a structured model of action selection, suggesting participants sequentially resolved levels of an internal representation of the learned mapping."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Hierarchical action preparation process",
    "measured_by": "Computational modeling",
    "justification": "Computational models were employed to clarify the processing dynamics between structured and unstructured mappings. The Hierarchical model with three \u03c3 parameters best captured participant behavior for structured mappings, fitting a sequential pruning process during visuomotor decision-making. This supports dynamic, structured action preparation in real time."
