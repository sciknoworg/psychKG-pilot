    "topic_or_construct": "Listening effort",
    "measured_by": "Pupillometry",
    "justification": "The paper extensively discusses how pupillometry, which measures changes in pupil dilation, serves as an objective time-series measure of cognitive load and listening effort. It tracks effort changes in real-time, before, during, and after the listening process, offering insight into how individuals allocate and modulate their effort."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive load",
    "measured_by": "Pupillometry",
    "justification": "Pupillometry is presented as a valuable tool for measuring cognitive load, especially in speech perception studies. The changes in pupil dilation are tightly linked with cognitive arousal, engagement, and decision-making processes, reflecting how demanding certain cognitive tasks can be."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Speech perception effort",
    "measured_by": "Pupillometry",
    "justification": "The paper details how pupillometry can be used to assess effort in speech perception, especially under conditions like hearing difficulties or complex linguistic contexts. This includes the effort related to speaker accent, syntactic structure and semantic content, and the context in which the speech is presented."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fatigue",
    "measured_by": "Pupillometry",
    "justification": "Some sections of the paper indicate that chronic or task-induced fatigue can be observed through pupillometry. Long-term changes in pupil size and patterns of dilation can reflect the degree of fatigue, which may be particularly relevant for individuals with hearing impairments and continuous exposure to difficult listening scenarios."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making effort",
    "measured_by": "Pupillometry",
    "justification": "Pupillometry is suggested as a tool for gauging decision-making processes in auditory tasks. It measures the cognitive effort associated with processing observed stimuli, forming judgments, and making decisions based on the information gathered through listening."
