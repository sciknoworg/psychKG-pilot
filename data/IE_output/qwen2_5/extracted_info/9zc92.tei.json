    "measured_by": "Free Response Estimation task",
    "justification": "The study assesses participants' precision in numerical representations indirectly through the Free Response Estimation task, where the precision score is calculated as the average coefficient of variation across target values. This task involves showing participants a set of objects and asking them to estimate the number."

    "topic_or_construct": "Numerical comparison performance",
    "measured_by": "Numerical Comparison task",
    "justification": "Numerical comparison performance is directly measured by the Numerical Comparison task, wherein participants are presented with pairs of shape arrays and instructed to indicate which side contains more shapes. The task is used to evaluate individual variation in numerical comparison behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making threshold",
    "measured_by": "Dynamic neural field model",
    "justification": "The decision-making threshold contribution to numerical comparison performance is evaluated through a dynamic neural field model implementing a Decision hypothesis. The model simulates the process of evidence accumulation in decision-making tasks, and it fits participants' data more accurately than a model without this parameter."
