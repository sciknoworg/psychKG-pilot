    "justification": "The paper states that metacognition, which refers to the ability to evaluate the accuracy of one's own decisions, can be measured via confidence ratings. This measurement method is used across various perceptual decision-making tasks in the 10 datasets analyzed."

    "topic_or_construct": "Task performance",
    "measured_by": "d'",
    "justification": "The study uses task performance measures like d' (sensitivity) based on signal detection theory to evaluate the perceptual decision-making abilities of subjects. d' is computed using hit and false alarm rates."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive efficiency or metacognitive ability",
    "measured_by": "M-Ratio",
    "justification": "M-Ratio is used as a measure of metacognitive efficiency, which controls for first-order task performance. It is calculated by dividing the meta-d' value, which reflects sensitivity in confidence judgments, by the d' value, which measures task performance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence judgments",
    "measured_by": "Confidence ratings",
    "justification": "Confidence was assessed using separate button press responses on various scales (11-point, 6-point, 4-point, etc.) in different experiments, without any incentive schemes in place. These ratings were analyzed to assess differences between genders in confidence levels."
