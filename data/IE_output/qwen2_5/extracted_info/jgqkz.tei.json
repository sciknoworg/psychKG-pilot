    "measured_by": "Confidence ratings (meta-d')",
    "justification": "The study uses meta-d' calculated from confidence ratings as a measure of metacognitive sensitivity, reflecting how well confidence ratings track perceptual accuracy. Participants were asked to provide confidence ratings on a scale from 'not confident at all' to 'completely sure'."

    "topic_or_construct": "Second-order confidence choices",
    "measured_by": "Second-step metacognitive sensitivity measure",
    "justification": "The authors defined second-step metacognitive sensitivity using hits/false alarms for correct/incorrect type-1 responses followed by confidence increases in the second interval, indicating an enhanced metacognitive ability through re-evaluation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Type-1 perceptual sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Staircase algorithm adjustment",
    "justification": "The two-up-one-down adaptive staircase method was used to adjust the ratio of Xs and Os, ensuring that participants' type-1 accuracy remained around 70%, thereby titrating the task difficulty."
