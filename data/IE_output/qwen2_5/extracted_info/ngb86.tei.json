    "topic_or_construct": "Risky decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Iowa Gambling Task (IGT)",
    "justification": "The IGT is described as a behavioral measure of risky decision-making, specifically used to assess participants' tendencies to make choices that may have immediate benefits but can incur long-term costs.

    "measured_by": "Criticism Gambling Task (CGT)",
    "justification": "The CGT introduced audio criticism to simulate socioemotional contexts relevant to NSSI. It was used to assess risky decision-making under conditions of perceived criticism from close others, hypothesized to disrupt adaptive avoidance of negative outcomes."

    "measured_by": "Self-Rating Scale (SRS)",
    "justification": "The SRS was used to assess self-critical beliefs, operationalized as the emotional and cognitive aspects of self-criticism. It was included to evaluate its potential role in decision-making and its interaction with NSSI and risky decision-making."
