    "justification": "The composite face task is discussed as a method to test holistic processing by manipulating alignment conditions and observing feature interactivity, captured through parameters like pcross in the MSPN model."

    "topic_or_construct": "analytic vs. holistic encoding",
    "measured_by": "Modular Serial-Parallel Network (MSPN)",
    "justification": "MSPN uses parameters such as pmod for processing type (serial or parallel) and pcross for feature interaction to assess the degree of analytic versus holistic encoding in face perception tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "other-race effect",
    "measured_by": "facial categorization task",
    "justification": "The study uses the MSPN framework to analyze the other-race effect by comparing the performance of participants from different racial backgrounds on face categorization tasks and examining the estimated parameters such as pmod and pcross."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "configural processing",
    "measured_by": "part-to-whole paradigm",
    "justification": "The part-to-whole task is used to assess configural processing by comparing recognition accuracy of face parts in isolation vs. within the whole face context, with MSPN being used to model these results."

    "topic_or_construct": "holistic face processing models",
    "measured_by": "overlearned attention hypothesis tests",
    "justification": "Testing the overlearned attention hypothesis via MSPN involves measuring changes in parameters like pmod and pcross to infer if holistic effects are due to learned attentional strategies rather than innate mechanisms."
