    "topic_or_construct": "covert attention",
    "measured_by": "eye-tracking data",
    "justification": "The study uses eye-tracking data to analyze participants' fixation patterns and determine whether they use covert attention in decision-making, as evidenced by their choices when not directly fixating on the target attribute (Study 1 and Study 2)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "overt attention",
    "measured_by": "eye-tracking data",
    "justification": "Overt attention was measured by the same eye-tracking data, specifically analyzing the times when participants directly fixated on the target attributes or options in the decision-making tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "visual discriminability",
    "measured_by": "stimuli size and salience manipulation",
    "justification": "In Study 1, the visual discriminability was manipulated by altering the size and salience of target attributes; the effect of these manipulations on covert vs. overt attention is central to understanding how visual factors influence the decision-making process."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "learning effects on attention",
    "measured_by": "mixed-model analysis across trials",
    "justification": "The study employed mixed-model analyses to examine how learning over time influenced the use of covert and overt attention, showing a mild increase in covert attention as participants engaged more with the decision tasks."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "response time",
    "measured_by": "timing of fixations",
    "justification": "Participants' response times were used as a measure to analyze the efficiency of decision-making when relying on covert versus overt attention, with faster responses often associated with covert attention."
