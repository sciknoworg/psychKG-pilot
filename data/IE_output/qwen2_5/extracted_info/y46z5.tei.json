    "topic_or_construct": "Perceptual Inference of Body Size",
    "measured_by": "Rubber Hand Illusion Task",
    "justification": "The paper mentions that AN patients show a higher sensitivity to the rubber hand illusion, indicating altered body size perceptions. This supports the notion that the rubber hand illusion can measure perceptual inference deficits associated with unusual body size experiences in anorexia nervosa."

    "topic_or_construct": "Spontaneous Mental Imagery of Body Size",
    "measured_by": "Patient Self-Reports",
    "justification": "Instances of patients describing their spontaneous imagery experiences, such as seeing themselves as obese, are cited in the paper. These self-reports provide evidence for the role of spontaneous mental imagery in creating false body size beliefs among AN patients."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "False Beliefs about Body Size in Anorexia Nervosa",
    "measured_by": "Semi-Structured Interviews",
    "justification": "Semi-structured interviews are used to illustrate significant between-patient differences in belief characteristics such as conviction and incorrigibility regarding body size beliefs. This indicates that such interviews are a method for capturing various aspects of false body size beliefs in AN patients."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Dysfunctional Self-Other Body Comparison",
    "measured_by": "Body Comparison Tasks",
    "justification": "The paper discusses patients' tendency to engage in faulty self-other body comparisons as a potential source of false beliefs about body size. Conducting body comparison tasks can reveal how AN patients misjudge their body size in relation to others, supporting its use as a measurement tool."

    "topic_or_construct": "Sensitivity to Prediction Error",
    "measured_by": "Bayesian Model Eliciting Tasks",
    "justification": "While not explicitly stated as a measurement tool, the paper's reference to Bayesian models of cognition and the PP framework suggests Bayesian model eliciting tasks (such as those involving prediction error) can be used to assess sensitivity to prediction error in AN patients."
