    "measured_by": "free choice paradigm",
    "justification": "The article discusses how the free choice paradigm is utilized to assess choice-induced preference change, where participants make choices between pairs of options, followed by rating the options before and after choice. The shift in ratings indicates changes in preference."

    "topic_or_construct": "choice-induced preference change",
    "measured_by": "choice blindness paradigm",
    "justification": "The choice blindness paradigm was employed to study choice-induced preference change by manipulating participants' choices covertly. The acceptance of the manipulation and subsequent changes in preference ratings were taken as evidence for choice-induced preference change."

    "topic_or_construct": "choice-induced preference change",
    "measured_by": "second round choice response times",
    "justification": "In both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, inconsistent choice response times (i.e., choices that were contrary to the original preference) were analyzed. When the manipulation was accepted, the choice response times for inconsistent choices were similar to consistent choices, suggesting a preference change after accepting the false feedback."

    "measured_by": "choice blindness paradigm in group decision-making",
    "justification": "In Experiment 2, the authors extended the choice blindness paradigm to dyads, showing that when false feedback was accepted in a mutual decision-making context, preference change was also observed in subsequent choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "collaborative confabulation",
    "measured_by": "false feedback about past choices in dyads",
    "justification": "The article describes how false feedback about past choices led dyads to collectively rationalize their actions, indicating that shared preferences are dynamically constructed and adhered to in response to the manipulation."
