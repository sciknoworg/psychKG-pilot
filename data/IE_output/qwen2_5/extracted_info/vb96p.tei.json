    "justification": "Study 1 examined the correlation between perceived within-group similarities and bias size, using a perceived within-group similarity question on a 5-point Likert scale. The positive correlation supports W-LOGE's prediction that greater perceived similarity increases NSSB."

    "measured_by": " homogeneity/heterogeneity manipulation",
    "justification": "Study 2 manipulated perceived homogeneity/heterogeneity in groups by asking participants to create a homogeneous or heterogeneous group. W-LOGE predicts higher biases in homogenous groups, which was supported by the greater NSSB in the homogenous condition."

    "measured_by": " similarities/dissimilarities manipulation",
    "justification": "Study 3 used a within-subjects design where participants focused on within-group similarities or dissimilarities. The results showed greater NSSB under the similarities condition, supporting the W-LOGE framework."

    "measured_by": " sequential comparative judgment method",
    "justification": "Studies 4 to 6 employed the sequential comparative judgment technique where participants judged multiple items one by one. These findings demonstrated the persistence of NSSB, which aligns with W-LOGE's external comparison explanations."

    "measured_by": " within-group similarities/dissimilarities",
    "justification": "Studies 7 to 9 manipulated within-group similarities and dissimilarities in both positive and negative groups. These manipulations increased NSSB under similarity focus conditions, supporting W-LOGE\u2019s predictions."
