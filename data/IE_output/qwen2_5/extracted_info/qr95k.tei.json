    "measured_by": "weather prediction task (WPT) with social stimuli",
    "justification": "The study employed a modified version of the WPT where task-irrelevant social stimuli (Black and White male faces) were introduced. Participants were asked to predict 'steal' or 'no steal' based on card combinations while ignoring the faces. This allowed the researchers to measure how pre-existing social associations about race disrupted probabilistic category learning."

    "topic_or_construct": "Nonsocial associations about weather",
    "measured_by": "weather prediction task (WPT) with nonsocial stimuli",
    "justification": "The WPT was also used with nonsocial stimuli, specifically images of clouds associated with sun or rain. Participants predicted sun or rain based on card combinations while ignoring the cloud images. This design helped isolate the impact of nonsocial associations on learning."

    "topic_or_construct": "Internal Motivation to Respond Without Prejudice (IMS)",
    "measured_by": "5-item questionnaire",
    "justification": "The study used a 5-item questionnaire to assess participants' IMS, demonstrating strong reliability (Omega = .85). This measure was used to examine how IMS influenced learning rates when social associations were present during the WPT."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "External Motivation to Respond Without Prejudice (EMS)",
    "measured_by": "5-item questionnaire",
    "justification": "A separate 5-item questionnaire was used to measure EMS, showing moderate to strong reliability (Omega = .79). This scale helped determine how external pressures affected participants' learning in presence of racial stimuli."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social Dominance Orientation",
    "measured_by": "16-item questionnaire",
    "justification": "The researchers assessed participants\u2019 preference for inequality among social groups using a 16-item questionnaire, which showed strong reliability. This measure was used to explore its potential moderating effect on learning disruptions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Positively-valenced stereotypes about Black men as athletic",
    "measured_by": "Touchdown vs. No Touchdown prediction task with faces",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to predict 'touchdown' or 'no touchdown' while seeing Black and White male faces. This design tested whether positively-valenced stereotypes similarly disrupted learning as negatively-valenced ones."
