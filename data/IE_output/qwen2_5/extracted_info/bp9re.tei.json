    "justification": "The paper discusses how social withdrawal in depression can be observed through social decision-making tasks that require inferences about social contexts, which highlights how depressive individuals may choose socially withdrawn actions and their perception of social cues."

    "justification": "The paper suggests that negative relational schemas can be assessed through outcomes of behavioral activation therapy where clinicians assess changes in social engagement and active behavior post intervention to evaluate the modification of these schemas."
