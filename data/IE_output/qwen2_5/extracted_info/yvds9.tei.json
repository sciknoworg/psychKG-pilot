    "measured_by": "Delay discounting tasks",
    "justification": "The paper discusses impulsivity as a common dimension of neuropsychiatric disorders, relating the tendency to select immediate rewards over delayed rewards. This concept was linked to various experiments, such as McGuire and Kable's studies (2012, 2013), which explored how perceptions of environmental uncertainty and stability could lead to impulsive behavior. These concepts were operationalized through delay discounting tasks assessing preferences for immediate vs. delayed rewards."

    "measured_by": "Rat gambling task (rGT)",
    "justification": "The rat gambling task (rGT) was developed by Winstanley and colleagues to model human gambling, specifically characteristics like slot machine behavior. The rGT helps quantify risk-seeking behaviors in rats, correlating baseline risk-seeking tendencies with future drug-seeking and increased risk-taking post-cocaine exposure (Ferland and Winstanley, 2017)."

    "measured_by": "Orbitofrontal-Amygdala interactions",
    "justification": "The interplay between the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the amygdala was noted in understanding goal-directed behavior. Studies examining devaluation tasks in rhesus macaques, combined with lesions to the OFC-amygdala connections, showed that these brain regions are critical for selecting optimal rewards and responding to changes in reward value. Compulsivity can be associated with deficits in various animal models and human clinical contexts, often mediated by these neural connectivity pathways."

    "measured_by": "Platform-mediated avoidance tasks",
    "justification": "The article outlines the use of platform-mediated avoidance tasks to study the neural mechanisms of avoidance behavior. These tasks require animals to learn and avoid a platform to escape an aversive stimulus. The prelimbic cortex, ventral striatum, and OFC were identified as playing roles in sustaining and extinguishing avoidance behaviors, linking neural circuits with specific avoidance patterns."

    "topic_or_construct": "Maladaptive fear learning",
    "measured_by": "Fear conditioning tasks",
    "justification": "The paper references fear conditioning tasks as methods to investigate the learning of fear associations. According to theoretical models, these tasks help in understanding the persistence of fear responses that are no longer relevant, underlining the concept of maladaptive maintenance of fear associations seen in disorders like PTSD. This mechanism is explored using latent cause theory which distinguishes the maintenance of such associations despite environmental changes."
