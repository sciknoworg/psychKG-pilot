    "measured_by": "Probabilistic reward learning task",
    "justification": "A probabilistic reward learning task with three conditions (Stationary Low Noise, Volatile, and Stationary High Noise) was used to assess participants' learning rates and decision-making performance. Individuals with higher ASD traits performed worse in the volatile condition, indicating challenges in adapting to changing environments."
