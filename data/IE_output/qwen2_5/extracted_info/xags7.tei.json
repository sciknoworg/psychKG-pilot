    "justification": "The SRET is used to measure schema strength by assessing participants' self-referential affective judgments. It involves participants decide whether trait adjectives are self-descriptive, and their recall of these adjectives reflects self-referential schema strength."

    "measured_by": "Drift rate from diffusion model analysis of SRET",
    "justification": "The drift rate derived from the diffusion model analysis of SRET reaction time data provides a measure of schema strength. A negative drift rate for negative adjectives indicates difficulty classifying them as not self-referent, indicating a strong negative self-schema."
