    "justification": "The study used d' as a measure of decision sensitivity in perceptual decision-making, specifically computing it based on hit and false-alarm rates transformed into z-scores using SDT principles."

    "topic_or_construct": "metacognitive noise",
    "measured_by": "confidence ratings",
    "justification": "Metacognitive noise was quantified by the decrease in d' when computed using confidence criteria compared to the unbiased decision criterion, reflecting the impact of confidence ratings on decision-making noise."

    "topic_or_construct": "expectation and reward cues",
    "measured_by": "decision criterion shift",
    "justification": "Expectation and reward cues induced a shift in the decision criterion, measured as the difference in values between biased cues favoring one option over another and the unbiased criterion, revealing their influence on perceptual decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "computational noise",
    "measured_by": "d' drop for biased criteria",
    "justification": "Computational noise associated with biased criteria was assessed through a significant drop in d' compared to the unbiased criterion, demonstrating the impact of noise on decision sensitivity."

    "topic_or_construct": "decision-making with confidence, expectation, and reward",
    "measured_by": "criterion shift and d' drop",
    "justification": "The study explored whether common computational noise affects decision-making in conditions involving confidence, expectation, and reward by analyzing both criterion shift (c shig) and sensitivity drop (d' drop) across these conditions."
