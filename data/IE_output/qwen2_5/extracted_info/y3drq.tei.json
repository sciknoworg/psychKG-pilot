    "justification": "The article states that through this modeling, one can quantify the metacognitive sensitivity of observers, which indicates how well their confidence distinguishes between their own correct and incorrect decisions. Metacognitive sensitivity is measured as the distance between two latent distributions, known as meta-d'. The significance of meta-d' lies in its direct comparability to d', allowing for the measurement of metacognitive sensitivity in relation to objective decision accuracy."

    "measured_by": "SDT-based Confidence Rating",
    "justification": "The text mentions that the SDT framework provides methods for describing how people rate their decision confidence. For example, the distance of a latent variable from the objective decision criterion can serve as a basis for confidence. Confidence rating involves categorizing response outcomes into classes based on the probability of being correct or incorrect with corresponding confidence levels."

    "measured_by": "Error-related Negativity and Error Positivity",
    "justification": "Studies utilizing electroencephalography have identified neural markers of error detection. These markers include the error-related negativity, a negative potential detected at frontocentral sites within 100 ms after an incorrect response, and the error positivity, a positive component localized at the parietal area. The error positivity is uniquely observed when individuals are aware of their errors."

    "measured_by": "Subjective Visibility Confidence",
    "justification": "The article explains that the visibility rating is used as a metacognitive measure in visual tasks. Unlike confidence rating, it evaluates the subjective clarity of visual stimuli. This rating mechanism is closely linked with visual awareness, though it can differ from decision confidence when discriminating subtle differences."

    "justification": "The text explains that in recognition memory research, researchers have utilized SDT and sequential sampling frameworks to explore mechanisms related to memory judgment and metamemory monitoring. Confidence ratings have also been integrated into these frameworks in memory research to better understand metamemory."
