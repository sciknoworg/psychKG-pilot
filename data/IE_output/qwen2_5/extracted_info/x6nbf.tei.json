    "topic_or_construct": "Context Effects in Risky Choice",
    "measured_by": "Relative Choice Frequency Analysis",
    "justification": "The paper discusses using relative choice frequency to analyze attraction and compromise effects, indicating how participants' choices are influenced by the presence of additional alternatives. This method quantifies changes in preference when decoys are introduced (e.g., asymmetrically dominated decoys)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Gaze-Dependent Accumulation in Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Eye Tracking and Dwell Time",
    "justification": "The study employs eye tracking to measure participants' gaze behavior during decision-making tasks. This includes relative dwell times on different alternatives, which are used to evaluate the impact of visual attention on risky choices."

    "topic_or_construct": "Attraction Effect in Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Gaze-Dependent Leaky Accumulator (GLA) Model",
    "justification": "The GLA model is specifically used to explain the attraction effect by incorporating gaze-dependent accumulation of evidence for each alternative. This tool links visual attention (fixation data) to choice behavior, showing how attention bias influences attraction effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Behavior in Complex Scenarios",
    "measured_by": "Multialternative Decision Field Theory (MDFT)",
    "justification": "MDFT is applied to model and predict participant behaviors in multi-alternative scenarios, providing insights into how participants make decisions when faced with multiple risky options. It takes into account attribute-wise comparisons and inhibition."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Individual Differences in Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Controlled Experimental Task with Various Trials",
    "justification": "The paper implements a controlled experimental design involving repeated decisions across various trials to systematically investigate individual differences in decision-making strategies and susceptibilities to context effects."
