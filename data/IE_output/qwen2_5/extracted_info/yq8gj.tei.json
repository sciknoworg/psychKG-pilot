    "justification": "The use of moral vignettes with different agent/victim identities (stranger-stranger, brother-stranger, stranger-brother, brother-brother) and scenarios (harmless, accident, attempt, harmful) allowed the study to explore the effects of family membership in moral judgment. These vignettes were adapted from previous research and specifically tailored to examine biases in moral judgment based on familial roles."

    "justification": "Participants rated the moral acceptability and perceived transgression using a 6-point Likert scale, which helped in quantifying the degree of moral judgment regarding different scenarios involving family members or strangers."

    "justification": "The study measured participants' moral decisions by asking them if they would disclose the agent's actions to the police on a binary yes/no scale (willingness) and then rated the difficulty of making such a decision on a 5-point Likert scale. This approach aimed to understand the influence of family membership on actual decision-making processes."

    "justification": "Intent and outcome were manipulated in the moral vignettes (such as accident, attempt, and harmful scenarios) to explore how the absence or presence of these factors altered moral judgments and decisions, particularly when involving family members."
