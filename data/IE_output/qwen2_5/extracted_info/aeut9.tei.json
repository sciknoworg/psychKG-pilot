    "measured_by": "Experimental tasks and narrative reports",
    "justification": "The paper discusses autobiographical memory, noting that details of personal experiences depend on how they were encoded (e.g., in self-focused or general terms). The discussion about autobiographical memory implies the assessment via experimental tasks and narrative reports designed to capture the details and characteristics of such memories."

    "measured_by": "Experimental decision-making tasks",
    "justification": "The text outlines various cognitive biases like availability and representativeness heuristics, noting that these biases can influence decision-making. The measurement of decision biases and heuristics is typically conducted using experimental tasks that simulate real-world decision-making scenarios, although specific scales are not specified here."
