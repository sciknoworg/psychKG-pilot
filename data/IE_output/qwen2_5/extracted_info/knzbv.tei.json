    "justification": "The research employed GLMs to analyze the temporal weighting profiles of visual and auditory evidence in perceptual decision-making tasks, demonstrating how evidence contributes to decisions over time."

    "measured_by": "Two-alternative forced-choice decision task",
    "justification": "Participants completed a two-alternative forced-choice task designed in the Psychtoolbox library for MATLAB, which allowed researchers to observe sensory evidence accumulation processes in response to visual, auditory, and audiovisual stimuli with fluctuating intensities."

    "topic_or_construct": "Early sensory weighting profiles",
    "measured_by": "Coefficient weights from GLMs aligned to stimulus onset",
    "justification": "The analysis of GLM coefficient weights aligned to stimulus onset revealed that early sensory information contributes most heavily to perceptual decisions, indicating the strength of early weighting profiles across modalities and difficulties."

    "topic_or_construct": "Modality dominance in audiovisual decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Analysis of coefficient weights from GLMs across trial types",
    "justification": "The study used the analysis of GLM coefficient weights to show that audiovisual decisions involved sequential modality dominance, where visual information was prioritized before auditory information took precedence in later stages, especially under difficult conditions."
