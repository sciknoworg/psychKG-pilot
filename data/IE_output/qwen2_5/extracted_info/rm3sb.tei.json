    "topic_or_construct": "Compassion fade",
    "measured_by": "Likelihood of granting refugee status ratings over time",
    "justification": "The study used repeated ratings of likelihood to grant refugee status as a measure of compassion fade. Participants were presented with scenarios of asylum seekers early and later in the survey, and their declining ratings over time were interpreted as evidence of decreasing compassion."

    "topic_or_construct": "Compassion fatigue",
    "measured_by": "Work experience and role at the Migration Agency",
    "justification": "Compassion fatigue was operationalized through longer work experience at the Migration Agency. The study hypothesized that more experienced civil servants would show greater inconsistencies in their judgments, indicating a decrease in empathy over time due to compassion fatigue."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Empathic concern",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported compassion",
    "justification": "Participants' self-reported compassion levels at the end of the questionnaire were used to measure empathic concern. The study hypothesized that higher self-reported compassion would be associated with smaller inconsistencies in judgments, supporting a relationship between empathy and judgment consistency."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Reflection",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)",
    "justification": "The Cognitive Reflection Test was included in the second wave of data collection to measure participants' cognitive reflection ability. The study found some indication that higher CRT scores were associated with greater consistency in the decline of their ratings over time, suggesting cognitive reflection may mitigate inconsistencies."
