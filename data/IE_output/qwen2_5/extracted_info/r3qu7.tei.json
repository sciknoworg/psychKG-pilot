    "topic_or_construct": "Empathic Concern",
    "measured_by": "Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)",
    "justification": "The study used the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) to assess Empathic Concern, defined as the degree to which one experiences warmth, compassion, and concern for others. This measurement was validated and employed to explore how physicians performing invasive procedures might have less concern for others in sacrificial moral dilemmas."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Personal Distress",
    "measured_by": "Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)",
    "justification": "The study used the Personal Distress subscale of the IRI which measures uneasy feelings and discomfort in response to others' feelings. Lower personal distress was hypothesized among invasive procedure specialists, suggesting they handle stressful situations better during harmful actions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Resilience",
    "measured_by": "Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)",
    "justification": "The CD-RISC was utilized to measure resilience among physicians. Surgeons were expected to score higher on this scale, indicating that they are better adapted to performing invasive procedures that can cause emotional distress."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Action Aversion",
    "measured_by": "Action and Outcome Aversion Scale",
    "justification": "Action Aversion was assessed using a self-report scale developed by Miller and colleagues (2014), measuring aversion to performing harmful actions. Physicians frequently engaging in invasive procedures were expected to demonstrate lower aversion scores."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Outcome Aversion",
    "measured_by": "Action and Outcome Aversion Scale",
    "justification": "Outcome Aversion was also assessed via the same scale, focusing on reactions to witnessing others' suffering. This measure aimed to capture the affective responses influencing moral decisions in physicians."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Deontological Moral Decisions",
    "measured_by": "Process Dissociation Dilemma Battery",
    "justification": "The Process Dissociation Dilemma Battery was used to measure the tendency to reject causing harm regardless of outcomes in sacrificial dilemmas. The battery aimed to disentangle utilitarian and deontological moral responses in physicians."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Utilitarian Moral Decisions",
    "measured_by": "Process Dissociation Dilemma Battery",
    "justification": "This same battery was further employed to evaluate the concern for maximizing outcomes in dilemmas where harmful actions are necessary. It was hypothesized that physicians in surgery would score higher on this utilitarian parameter."
