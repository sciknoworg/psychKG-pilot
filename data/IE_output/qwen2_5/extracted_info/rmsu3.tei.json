    "measured_by": "Why/How task paradigm",
    "justification": "The 'Why/How' task paradigm was used to manipulate construal level in the study, where participants were asked to consider why (high construal) or how (low construal) they would achieve financial goals, demonstrating how this measure operationalizes construal level in the context of economic decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Self-Control",
    "measured_by": "Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS)",
    "justification": "The Brief Self-Control Scale was employed to measure self-control in participants, with the scale being validated across various studies and shown to have good internal consistency and test-retest reliability, making it a suitable instrument for assessing self-control in this context."

    "topic_or_construct": "Financial Literacy",
    "measured_by": "Financial Literacy Questionnaire",
    "justification": "A questionnaire adapted from Fernandes et al. (2014) was used to measure financial literacy, which is a reliable unidimensional construct correlating with numeracy, information search confidence, and other financial behaviors."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective Numeracy",
    "measured_by": "Subjective Numeracy Scale",
    "justification": "The Subjective Numeracy Scale was used to measure participants' preference for information in numerical formats and their confidence in completing basic arithmetic, an appropriate tool to assess subjective numeracy in decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Load",
    "measured_by": "Stroop Task and Go/NoGo Task",
    "justification": "The Stroop Task and the Go/NoGo Task were utilized as cognitive load measures, with the Stroop task assessing color-word interference and the Go/NoGo task examining response inhibition, both common methodologies for inducing cognitive load in studies."
