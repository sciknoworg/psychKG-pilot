    "measured_by": "Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS)",
    "justification": "The Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) is used to assess the severity of executive, emotional, and initiative apathy. In the study, participants with initiative apathy were identified based on their DAS initiative score being above a defined cut-off."

    "topic_or_construct": "Effort anticipation",
    "measured_by": "Contingent Negative Variation (CNV)",
    "justification": "The CNV amplitude is higher when completing effortful and rewarding tasks, positively correlated with better accuracy and faster responses. In the study, CNV is used as an electrophysiological correlate of effort anticipation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Effort expenditure",
    "measured_by": "mPFC theta power",
    "justification": "Frontal-midline theta activity reflects the mobilization of cognitive effort, with higher theta power observed in tasks requiring higher mental effort. In the study, mPFC theta power is used to indicate effort expenditure."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Effort-based Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Effort-based Decision-Making (EDM) task",
    "justification": "The EDM task is a decision-making task that manipulates both cognitive effort and motivation. In the study, it is used to investigate the potential modulating effects of motivation on effort anticipation and expenditure."
