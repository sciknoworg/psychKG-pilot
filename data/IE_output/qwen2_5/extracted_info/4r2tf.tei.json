    "justification": "To assess primacy effects in free recall, the authors applied the racing diffusion model and LBA model. These evidence accumulation models allowed for detailed simulations of primacy effects characterized by enhanced recall of the early list items. The models offered a joint account of response time distributions and recall probabilities. (Howard & Kahana, 1999; Ratcliff & Smith, 2004)"

    "justification": "The article discusses various prediction models, including strength models, rehearsal models, and reinstatement models, to describe the interaction between primacy and recency. These models were tested through simulations based on evidence accumulation frameworks, providing insights into the different processes of recall initiation involving early and end-of-list items.

    "justification": "To account for nondecision time and response latency, the authors employed an ex-Gaussian distribution to smooth RT distributions. This method improved the goodness of fit of the models to data and was used to generate stable quantile estimates for analyzing response times across serial positions.
