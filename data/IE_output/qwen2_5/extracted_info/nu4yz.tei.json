    "measured_by": "Likert rating scale",
    "justification": "The article discusses the use of a Likert rating scale for assessing personality traits and identifies systematic differences in response patterns between Eastern and Western cultures, indicating the presence of cross-cultural response style bias."

    "measured_by": "Comprehensive Personality Scale (CPS)",
    "justification": "The Comprehensive Personality Scale (CPS) was selected to measure five facets underlying the Big Five dimensions (Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, Openness). The item selection process controlled for extremity parameters, optimizing the measurement of these traits across cultural samples."

    "topic_or_construct": "Extreme response style (ERS)",
    "measured_by": "Item Response Theory (IRT) tree model",
    "justification": "The IRT tree model, specifically the Tree Process Model (TPM), was applied to examine the intensity and direction response processes that reflect ERS. This model helps disentangle response styles from content-related processes and validates cross-cultural response style differences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cross-culture response style mitigation",
    "measured_by": "Two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) format",
    "justification": "The 2AFC format with Item Response Theory (IRT) scoring was evaluated as an alternative method to reduce cross-cultural response style bias observed in Likert scale assessments. It was found to diminish cultural disparities in personality trait scores across the Big Five dimensions."
