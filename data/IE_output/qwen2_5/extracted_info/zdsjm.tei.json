    "justification": "The PHQ-9 was used to measure depression severity by assessing problems experienced in the last two weeks on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 'not at all' (0) to 'several days' (3). The PHQ-9 has been validated and used in various contexts."

    "measured_by": "UPPS-P",
    "justification": "The UPPS-P was used to measure impulsivity, including the sub-facet of negative urgency by providing 20 statements with 4 items for each of the five sub-facets, scored on a Likert scale from 'disagree strongly' (1) to 'agree strongly' (4). Higher scores indicate a higher association with the impulsivity trait, and items related to negative urgency were reverse scored."
