    "justification": "The article employs the Pavlovian Performance Index (PPI), calculated as the mean of Reward-Based Invigoration and Punishment-Based Suppression measures, to assess Pavlovian bias. This is supported by the sentence: 'PPI was used as dependent variable in rmANOVA, whereas Block served as within-, and iTBS and EHP as between-subject factors.'"

    "measured_by": "orthogonalized Go/NoGo task",
    "justification": "The orthogonalized Go/NoGo task is used to measure instrumental learning in the RL paradigm, which is reflected in response accuracy. The article states: 'For details about the expected significant main effects and interactions for all analyses, we refer the reader to our preregistration (https://osf.io/s6e8r).'"

    "measured_by": "Control-Reward-Loss Manipulation (CRLM) protocol",
    "justification": "The CRLM protocol is utilized to manipulate outcome controllability during the RL task, which is considered a key factor in learned helplessness. The study mentions: 'In this block, outcomes were uncontrollable by being presented randomly, irrespective of preceding instrumental (Go or NoGo) choices.'"

    "measured_by": "Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)",
    "justification": "The intensity of pain is measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) both for mean and peak levels after each block. This is supported by: 'Participants were asked to rate the maximum pain level you felt in this block!' and 'Please rate the average pain level you felt in this block!'"

    "measured_by": "Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS)",
    "justification": "Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) is used to modulate cognitive control via stimulation of the mPFC/dACC. The article explains: 'Stimulation of the mPFC/dACC was achieved with the iTBS protocol, which was demonstrated to increase neural excitability in the targeted area.'"
