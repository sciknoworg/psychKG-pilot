    "justification": "The study utilized an adapted information board paradigm to examine where participants begin their information search and how much content and source information they search for in order to inform themselves about science-related topics. This paradigm was modified to include source information along with content information (arguments in text format)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Belief revision",
    "measured_by": "7-point Likert scale",
    "justification": "Participants' prior and posterior beliefs about the presented topic were measured using a 7-point Likert scale. The study found that the presentation of arguments during the information search changed prior beliefs, resulting in belief revisions for certain topics."

    "topic_or_construct": "Source evaluation and content evaluation",
    "measured_by": "Adapted information board paradigm",
    "justification": "The adapted information board allowed participants to search for both source expertise and interests, as well as pro and contra arguments. This enabled the researchers to examine whether participants paid equal attention to content and source information, and how such processes differ due to preexisting knowledge and prior beliefs."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Search start and search amount",
    "measured_by": "Video recordings and card-turning sequences",
    "justification": "The information search behavior, including the search start and the amount of information searched, was recorded through video recordings and by tracking the sequence of card-turning in the information board matrix. This setup allowed researchers to analyze where participants began their search and how much information they searched across different categories."
