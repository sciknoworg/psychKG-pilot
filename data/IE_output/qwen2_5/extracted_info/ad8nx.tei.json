    "justification": "The Top2Diff strategy outperformed other confidence strategies by generating the best quantitative fits, reproducing qualitative signatures of human confidence, and providing the best image-by-image predictions of confidence ratings. It computes confidence as the difference in evidence between the top-two choices, aligning closely with human confidence behavior."
