    "justification": "The social distance was measured indirectly by evaluating how participants adjusted the size of images on a screen or the distance from a virtual image when making judgments, reflecting their comfort levels in decision-making processes for different environments."

    "measured_by": "Time required for decision-making",
    "justification": "Response time was used as a dependent variable, measuring the duration participants took to make a decision regarding the attractiveness of the images. This variable was shown to be more associated with the social distance estimate than image attractiveness."

    "measured_by": "0-10 attractiveness score scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated the attractiveness of images on a 0-10 scale, which served as one of the dependent variables and helped in understanding correlations with social distance estimation and response time."
