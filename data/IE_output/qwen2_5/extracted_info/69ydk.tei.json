    "measured_by": "STL-D model",
    "justification": "The study used the Scaled Target Learning with Decay (STL-D) model to estimate learning from positive and negative feedback, showing that learning bias is present under increased levels of uncertainty. The STL-D model outperformed earlier models by accurately capturing both risk-taking propensity and learning in the modified Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk-taking propensity",
    "measured_by": "Adjusted score (mean number of pumps for unexploded balloons)",
    "justification": "The adjusted score was calculated as the mean number of pumps across unexploded balloons, which has been repeatedly associated with real-life risk-taking behaviors, such as smoking or substance use. It served as a proxy for risk-taking propensity and was used to evaluate the positive correlation with learning bias."

    "topic_or_construct": "Learning parameters",
    "measured_by": "STL and STL-D models",
    "justification": "The Scaled Target Learning (STL) and its extended version, STL-D, were utilized to model the target number of pumps, behavioral consistency, and differential learning rates following positive and negative feedback, providing improved external validity compared to the adjusted BART score and other existing models."

    "topic_or_construct": "Performance",
    "measured_by": "Total points earned",
    "justification": "Performance was quantified as the total points earned by participants during each phase of the experiment. It was used to examine the relationship between learning bias and performance under varying levels of uncertainty, revealing a negative correlation in the unlucky phase."
