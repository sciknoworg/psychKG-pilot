    "measured_by": "Pubertal Development Scale (PDS)",
    "justification": "The Pubertal Development Scale (PDS) assesses the physical changes associated with puberty on a five-point scale, capturing the stage of pubertal development in both boys and girls, which is used as a measure of pubertal status in this study."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "testosterone levels",
    "measured_by": "salivary testosterone measures",
    "justification": "Testosterone levels are quantified using salivary samples collected via passive drool, providing a non-invasive method to assess testosterone levels that are linked to various cognitive and behavioral developmental changes during adolescence."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) levels",
    "measured_by": "salivary DHEA measures",
    "justification": "Salivary DHEA levels are measured using the same collection method as for testosterone, allowing for the assessment of another key pubertal hormone that influences cognitive processes such as cognitive flexibility and decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "estradiol levels",
    "measured_by": "salivary estradiol measures",
    "justification": "Estradiol levels are evaluated from salivary samples in girls, providing insight into the role of this hormone in cognitive functions like sustained attention and working memory during female pubertal development."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "inhibitory control",
    "measured_by": "Toolbox Flanker Task",
    "justification": "The Toolbox Flanker Task is used to measure inhibitory control by assessing participants' ability to respond to target stimuli while ignoring conflicting surrounding stimuli, capturing cognitive control processes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "visuospatial processing",
    "measured_by": "Little Man Test (LMT)",
    "justification": "The Little Man Test evaluates visuospatial processing by requiring participants to identify the hand of a figure holding a briefcase from various orientations, offering a means to study spatial abilities and cognitive development."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Game of Dice Task (GDT)",
    "justification": "The Game of Dice Task assesses decision-making by presenting participants with choices between different risk levels and potential rewards, simulating real-life decision-making scenarios and evaluating cognitive reasoning."
