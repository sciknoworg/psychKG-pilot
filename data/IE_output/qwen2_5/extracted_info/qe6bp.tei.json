    "measured_by": "Iterated Cooperative Decision-Making Task",
    "justification": "The theory of mind was assessed through a task where participants made simultaneous decisions with a partner about selecting parking spots with different rewards. The task required reasoning about other players' beliefs and intentions to develop norms, reflecting the theory of mind in action."

    "topic_or_construct": "Norm Formation",
    "measured_by": "Strategy Classification Algorithm",
    "justification": "Norm formation was quantitatively analyzed using a strategy classification algorithm, which identified and categorized the types of strategies participants developed over time, allowing researchers to assess how people naturally converge on coordinated behaviors."

    "topic_or_construct": "Joint Planning and Coordination",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral Task Performance",
    "justification": "Participants' ability to jointly plan and coordinate was measured by their performance in a parking spot selection task. Their success in minimizing costs through effective decision-making strategies indicated their capacity for joint planning."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Complexity and Simplicity",
    "measured_by": "Complexity Penalty Model",
    "justification": "The cognitive complexity and simplicity were evaluated using a complexity penalty model that assessed the simplicity of joint action sequences participants followed. This model quantified the cognitive effort involved in executing different norms."
