    "justification": "The paper introduces PEST as a tool to assess email phishing susceptibility in the lab. Participants were asked to rate a series of 160 emails for their level of suspicion on a four-point scale. This measure was validated by comparing it to real-world efficacy data, indicating its potential ecological validity in assessing phishing vulnerability."

    "measured_by": "Linear regression model on PEST ratings",
    "justification": "The study employed a linear regression model to analyze PEST ratings, revealing significant assimilative and contrastive sequential effects. These findings suggest that participants' judgments of email suspicion are influenced by previous stimuli and ratings, mirroring cognitive processes known in other sequential judgment tasks."
