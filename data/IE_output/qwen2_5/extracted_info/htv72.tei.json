    "justification": "The study investigates semantic relevance as a nonlinear combination of dominance and distinctiveness and assesses its impact on controlled retrieval and semantic selection through neural modeling and mixed-effects analysis. Specifically, the interaction between task conditions and semantic relevance is analyzed using statistical models that evaluate the contribution of distractor and target relevance values."

    "topic_or_construct": "semantic control",
    "measured_by": "dual-task methodology, semantic feature selection task",
    "justification": "Semantic control was measured using a dual-task methodology where participants performed a semantic feature selection task (choosing a target feature among distractors) under both single and dual-task conditions. The methodology effectively isolates the capacity for semantic control under divided attention by introducing an auditory-verbal 1-back task as an additional cognitive demand."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "semantic selection",
    "measured_by": "linear mixed-effect modeling with semantic feature selection task",
    "justification": "The semantic selection task is designed to probe the capacity to select target features over competing distractors. Linear mixed-effect modeling was used to examine accuracy and reaction times under different conditions, revealing how semantic selection demands are influenced by the relevance of distractor features."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "controlled retrieval",
    "measured_by": "linear mixed-effect modeling with semantic feature selection task",
    "justification": "Controlled retrieval processes involved in accessing weakly activated but relevant target features are assessed through the same semantic feature selection task as used for semantic selection. However, the focus here is on how the task factor and target feature relevance impact performance, separately from the selection of distractors."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "target feature relevance",
    "measured_by": "linear mixed-effect modeling with semantic feature selection task",
    "justification": "The semantic relevance of target features, calculated using a combination of their dominance and distinctiveness, is directly measured through its effect on participants' reaction times and accuracy in selecting the correct feature. Linear mixed-effect modeling confirms the relationship between target relevance and performance."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "distractor feature relevance",
    "measured_by": "linear mixed-effect modeling with semantic feature selection task",
    "justification": "The relevance of distractor features in the task is assessed through their impact on performance under dual-task conditions using linear mixed-effect modeling. The analysis shows that more relevant distractors interfere more significantly with target selection when cognitive resources are divided."
