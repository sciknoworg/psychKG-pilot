    "justification": "Study 1 participants completed the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE) Scale (Mirels & Garrett, 1971), which is used to measure individual differences in PWE beliefs. The findings show that participants' endorsement of PWE did not moderate the relationship between perceived effort and moral character judgments, suggesting the scale is used to assess cultural beliefs related to effort moralization."

    "measured_by": "Trait evaluations (Moral, Warm, Competent)",
    "justification": "In Studies 2a-c, participants evaluated the high-efficort and low-effort targets on 15 traits including morality, competence, and warmth using 7-point scales. Ratings were averaged into composites for these traits to measure perceptions of morality specifically. High-effort targets were consistently rated as more moral, showing that effort moralization influences moral character judgments."

    "measured_by": "Trust Game (TG) Partner Choice",
    "justification": "Study 6 measured participants' preference for a high-effort versus low-effort target as a partner for a trust game. A significantly higher proportion of participants chose the high-effort target as their partner, demonstrating that effort cues influence cooperative partner selection through perceived moral character."

    "measured_by": "Charitabledonation",
    "justification": "In Study 5, participants allocated more donations to a runner who completed a longer race, perceiving this additional effort as a signal of moral character. Participants\u2019 donations were higher for runners who exerted greater effort, mediated by perceived moral character. This indicates that charitable giving can serve as a measure of perceived moral value from effort."

    "topic_or_construct": "Effort cues influencing moral traits",
    "measured_by": "Core Goodness and Value Commitment Traits",
    "justification": "Study 6 introduced separate measures for core goodness and value commitment traits. The results showed that effort cues induced evaluations of both trait types, which influenced partner choice. While effort didn't directly influence core goodness traits, it increased value commitment traits, which then influenced core goodness judgments."
