    "measured_by": "Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE)",
    "justification": "The article describes how multi-attribute preferential choices are studied using DCEs, where participants select their most preferred option among a set of options varying across multiple attributes. DCEs are detailed as a method to understand the trade-offs and weights ascribed by participants to different attributes."

    "justification": "The LBA model is used to predict and explain the relationship between choice frequency and choice times in the context of multi-attribute choices. The article specifies the model's parameters and assumptions, and uses posterior predictive checks to compare model predictions against observed data."

    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Frequency and Choice Times",
    "measured_by": "Racing Diffusion Model (RDM)",
    "justification": "Similar to the LBA model, the Racing Diffusion Model is utilized to analyze how choice frequency and choice times relate in multi-attribute preferential decision-making. It is described as an alternative sequential sampling model that also serves as a comparison to the LBA's performance."

    "measured_by": "Calculation of Attribute-Level Choice Proportions and Response Times",
    "justification": "The article calculates attribute-level choice proportions as the ratio of the times an attribute was chosen over the number of appearances, and summarizes attribute-level response times. These measures help in understanding the relationship between choices and response times at the attribute level."

    "topic_or_construct": "Options-Level Analysis in Preferential Choices",
    "measured_by": "Option-Level Choice Proportions and Mean Response Times",
    "justification": "The manuscript examines options-level summaries by calculating option-level choice proportions and mean response times to investigate the relationship between choice frequency and choice times at an option level rather than at an attribute level."
