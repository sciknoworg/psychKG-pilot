    "measured_by": "Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT)",
    "justification": "The article explains that CPT incorporates a nonlinear probability-weighting function to account for systematic deviations from expected utility theory. This function captures how decision weights can be distorted relative to objective probabilities, explaining phenomena like the certainty effect."

    "measured_by": "Attentional Drift Diffusion Model (aDDM)",
    "justification": "The aDDM formalizes how attentional biases can impact decision-making by allocating evidence at different rates for attended versus unattended options. This model predicts how biases toward certain options can influence choice behavior over time."

    "measured_by": "Sampling paradigm",
    "justification": "Empirical data from the sampling paradigm, used in the study by Wulff et al. (2018), allowed researchers to measure attention allocation and choice outcomes, demonstrating that attentional biases affect choice patterns."

    "measured_by": "Hierarchical Bayesian implementation of CPT",
    "justification": "Through Bayesian modeling, the article links attentional biases in aDDM-simulated data to specific parameters (\u03b4 and \u03b3) of CPT\u2019s probability-weighting function, revealing how these parameters reflect attentional dynamics."

    "justification": "Eye-tracking studies by Fiedler and Gl\u00f6ckner (2012) provided both attention allocation measures and response times, which were linked to probability-weighting patterns through aDDM and CPT modeling."
