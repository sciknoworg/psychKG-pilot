    "justification": "The study uses various investment scenarios to measure moral hazard behaviors. For example, participants choose between a guaranteed option with a low reward and a risky option with a high potential reward but significant risk. The difference in expected value between these options allows researchers to identify when participants prioritize their gain at the expense of others."
