    "topic_or_construct": "Conflict resolution skills",
    "measured_by": "peer-ratings",
    "justification": "The study utilized peer ratings from a sample of Chabu adults to assess individuals' conflict resolution skills. These ratings were completed by a group of seven peer-raters who rated participants on various traits including conflict resolution, which directly measures an individual's ability to mediate disputes within their community."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "IQ and neural capital",
    "measured_by": "Trait of being intelligent",
    "justification": "Intelligence is one of the peer-rated traits included in the study, and the analysis found it to be a strong predictor of conflict resolution skills. This suggests that individuals with higher levels of neural capital (intelligence) are more effective at resolving conflicts."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social influence and leadership",
    "measured_by": "Trait of respect, likable, and allies",
    "justification": "Traits such as being respected, likable, and having allies were rated by peers and analyzed in relation to conflict resolution skills. The EGA identified a dimension that included respect and likable, suggesting these traits are key components of social capital contributing to effective leadership in conflict mediation."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Dominance behavior",
    "measured_by": "Trait of being feared, fighting",
    "justification": "Traits linked to dominance, such as being feared or engaging in fights, were also peer-rated. The bootstrap analysis and EGA results showed a weak positive association between feared and conflict resolution skills, suggesting a role for dominance but not as a strong predictor compared to neural capital."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Material capital and economic productivity",
    "measured_by": "Trait of farming productivity",
    "justification": "The study included farming as a peer-rated variable which clustered with dominance traits but not with social capital traits. It indicates that farming productivity, a marker of material capital, may contribute to conflict resolution skills in contexts where economic factors are relevant."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Prosocial behavior",
    "measured_by": "Trait of prosocial orientation",
    "justification": "The peer-ratings included prosocial orientation, which was found to be part of the neural and social capital dimension linked to decision-making and expertise. This reflects the role of prosocial traits in mediating conflicts effectively."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Expertise and decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Trait of expertise, decisions",
    "justification": "Expertise and decision-making were strongly correlated with conflict resolution skills. These traits were rated by peers and included in the analysis as critical components of neural capital, essential for resolving conflicts."
