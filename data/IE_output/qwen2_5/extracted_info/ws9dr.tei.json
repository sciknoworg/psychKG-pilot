    "measured_by": "Gambling task with rewards and losses",
    "justification": "Petrovic and colleagues (2008) used opioid blockade (10 mg IV naloxone) in a gambling task to show that opioid antagonism decreased subjective pleasure ratings and ACC BOLD activity for high-reward options, supporting the use of the gambling task to measure reward-based decision-making in the context of opioid system effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reward-based decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Slot-machine and roulette tasks",
    "justification": "Porchet and colleagues (2013) used 50 mg naltrexone in slot-machine and roulette tasks and found effects on motivational ratings and psychophysiological responses, indicating these tasks can assess opioid modulation of reward motivation."

    "measured_by": "Pavlovian Instrumental Transfer task with chocolate reinforcement",
    "justification": "Weber and colleagues (2016) used a PIT task with chocolate reinforcement to show decreases in the difference between button presses for rewarded and unrewarded stimuli following 50 mg naltrexone, demonstrating the task's ability to measure opioid effects on reward learning."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reward-based decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Monetary Incentive Delay task",
    "justification": "Nestor et al. (2017) used this task and found no opioid effects on BOLD responses to monetary wins and losses following 50 mg naltrexone, showing it can be used to study opioid modulation of neural reward processing."

    "measured_by": "Trading game (financial decisions)",
    "justification": "Efremidze et al. (2017) found decreased reinforcement learning after naltrexone in a trading game, illustrating the task's utility for measuring opioid effects on financial decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Impulsivity",
    "measured_by": "Delay discounting task",
    "justification": "Mitchell, Tavares, Fields, D'Esposito, & Boettiger (2007) and Boettiger, Kelley, Mitchell, D'Esposito, & Fields (2009) reported no effects of naltrexone (50 mg PO) on impulsive choice ratio in healthy controls using delay discounting tasks, indicating their use for measuring opioid effects on impulsivity."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive control",
    "measured_by": "Coding Task (Digit Symbol Substitution Task)",
    "justification": "Evans & Witt (1966) noted context-specific effects on coding performance with a low dose of codeine, showing the task's potential for measuring opioid effects on psychomotor performance and executive functioning."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive control",
    "measured_by": "Logical reasoning task",
    "justification": "Evans & Smith (1964) found improved logical reasoning performance with low-dose morphine, indicating the task is sensitive to opioid effects on higher-level cognitive functions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive control",
    "measured_by": "Attention tasks using ERP measures",
    "justification": "Arnsten et al. (1983, 1984) used ERP measures showing that naloxone increased a late frontal component related to attention, suggesting these tasks capture opioid modulation of attentional processes."
