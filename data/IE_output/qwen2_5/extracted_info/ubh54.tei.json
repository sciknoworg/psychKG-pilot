    "measured_by": "GOAL Architecture",
    "justification": "The GOAL architecture was applied to integrate and compare theoretical perspectives on goal-directed motivation by quantifying the influence of distance, time, and rate of progress gradients. It was used in both laboratory and field settings to assess participants' decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Proximity Perspective",
    "measured_by": "Distance Gradient (negative)",
    "justification": "The results showed that the majority of participants (91% in approach goals, 93% in avoidance goals) exhibited a negative distance gradient, increasing motivation as the goal becomes closer, supporting the proximity perspective."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Discrepancy Perspective",
    "measured_by": "Distance Gradient (positive)",
    "justification": "The positive distance gradient predicting decreased motivation as goals become closer had limited support, with only a small percentage of participants exhibiting this trend, suggesting limited relevance of the discrepancy perspective."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Time Gradient",
    "measured_by": "Time Remaining (negative gradient)",
    "justification": "The time gradient showed that motivation increases as the deadline approaches. This was evident in both experimental tasks and the NBA data, particularly for approach goals."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Rate of Progress Gradient",
    "measured_by": "Non-monotonic, increasing or decreasing",
    "justification": "Individual differences in the rate of progress gradient were observed, with participants showing patterns consistent with the expectancy, difficulty, or achievability perspectives. In Study 1, substantial variation was noted, while Study 2 showed predominance of non-monotonic gradients."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Importance of Goal Achievement",
    "measured_by": "Variation in \u03ba and \u03b8 parameters",
    "justification": "The studies found that goal importance increased overall sensitivity to the motivational gradients and led to a greater allocation of resources independently of these gradients, highlighting the role of goal importance in goal-directed motivation."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Approach vs. Avoidance Goals",
    "measured_by": "Differences in Distance and Time Gradient Influences",
    "justification": "The research demonstrated that the relative influence of the distance and time gradients differed between approach and avoidance goals, with stronger distance effects in avoidance and stronger time effects in approach goals in most cases."
