    "measured_by": "Electromyographic (EMG) Activity",
    "justification": "The study measures the motor time (MT), defined as the time between the onset of the last EMG activation preceding a response and the behavioral response itself, using EMG activity recordings of the effector muscles. This measurement is used to infer motor execution time and its relationship with psychological processes like decision-making, as described in the context of decomposing RT into PMT and MT."

    "topic_or_construct": "Pre-Motor Time (PMT)",
    "measured_by": "Electromyographic (EMG) Activity",
    "justification": "PMT, defined as the time between stimulus onset and the last EMG onset preceding a response, is also measured using EMG activity. This allows researchers to separate and analyze decisional from motor components of response times, assessing their independence and effects of various experimental factors."

    "topic_or_construct": "Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff (SAT)",
    "measured_by": "Drift Diffusion Model estimates of Decision Threshold and Motor Time",
    "justification": "The SAT is analyzed through model-based approaches involving drift-diffusion models, where the effects on SAT are evaluated both through decision threshold adjustments and observed changes in motor time (as measured with EMG). The model allows for inference of how cognitive processes underlying decision thresholds interact with motor execution."

    "topic_or_construct": "Non-Decision Time (T_er)",
    "measured_by": "Drift Diffusion Model",
    "justification": "T_er, representing the non-decision time assumed to encompass stimulus encoding and motor execution, is estimated using drift-diffusion models. The study explores how this time relates to actual motor time measured through EMG, revealing its relationship to response execution latent processes."
