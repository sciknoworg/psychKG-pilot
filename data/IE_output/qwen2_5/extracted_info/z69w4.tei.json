  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Anhedonia",
    "measured_by": "Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)",
    "justification": "The paper explicitly states that anhedonia was assessed using the SHAPS, indicating its use as a measurement instrument for the construct. This is supported by the context where the SHAPS is used to measure anhedonia in relation to neuropsychiatric symptoms and effort-based decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Apathy",
    "measured_by": "Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES)",
    "justification": "The AES is mentioned as the assessment tool for apathy in the study. The AES scores are used to predict acceptance bias and other parameters related to effort-based decision-making, establishing its role as a measure of apathy."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Depression",
    "measured_by": "Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.)",
    "justification": "Participants meeting criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) were identified using the M.I.N.I. Interviews were used to diagnose clinical depression, thereby highlighting its role in measuring depressive conditions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Chronotype",
    "measured_by": "Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ)",
    "justification": "The MEQ and MCTQ were specifically used to identify participants' chronotypes (early or late). These questionnaires helped in classifying chronotypes and exploring their effects on cognitive parameters such as effort-based decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Anhedonia",
    "measured_by": "Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS)",
    "justification": "The DARS is used in assessing anhedonia dimensions, as mentioned in the methods section. This scale is used alongside SHAPS in analyses involving the prediction of model parameters."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Dimensional Measures of Mental Health",
    "measured_by": "Self-report Questionnaires (including SHAPS, DARS, AES, MEQ, MCTQ)",
    "justification": "The study employs several self-report questionnaires to measure various dimensional aspects of mental health, such as anhedonia, apathy, and chronotype. These measures are analyzed in relation to task parameters, forming a comprehensive measurement approach."
