    "measured_by": "Items from the Intuition vs. Deliberation Scale (Study 1)",
    "justification": "The paper develops scale items specifically designed to measure how much participants rely on intuition versus deliberation in moral decision-making. These items were initially created based on existing literature and refined through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, ensuring they measure reliance on intuitive responses (e.g., 'relied on emotions' or 'gut feeling') vs. deliberative processes (e.g., ' considere[d] the anticipated consequences')."

    "topic_or_construct": "Rules vs. Cost-Benefit Reasoning (CBR) in Moral Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Items from the Rules vs. Consequences Scale (Studies 2 & 3)",
    "justification": "To assess the reliance on rules versus consequences when making moral decisions, the authors developed and validated a scale through factor analyses. The scale items distinguish between decision-making driven by moral norms and rules, compared to decisions based on the expected consequences of the actions taken."

    "topic_or_construct": "Integration of Moral Decision Processes",
    "measured_by": "Items from the Integration Scale (Across Studies)",
    "justification": "A separate scale was created to evaluate how participants integrate different moral considerations. Items were designed to capture participants' reflection on trading off moral values associated with breaking rules versus anticipated consequences."

    "topic_or_construct": "Utilitarianism",
    "measured_by": "Oxford Utilitarianism Scale Sacrificial Harm Subscale (OUS)",
    "justification": "The paper mentions the OUS Sacrificial Harm Subscale as a measure of utilitarian beliefs, specifically the willingness to inflict sacrificial harm for greater benefit. It is used for validation of the developed scales and is frequently cited as a established instrument for measuring utilitarian orientations."

    "measured_by": "Deontology Subscale of the Deontological-Consequentialist Scale (DCS)",
    "justification": "The DCS Deontology Subscale was chosen to measure endorsement of deontological principles as it taps into participants\u2019 adherence to moral rules. It is used in the paper as a comparison alongside other scales to evaluate the distinctness and validity of their new scales."
