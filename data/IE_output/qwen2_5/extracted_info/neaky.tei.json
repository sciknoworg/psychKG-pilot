    "measured_by": "Detection Response Task (DRT) and Multiple Object Tracking task (MOT)",
    "justification": "The authors used the DRT and MOT in a dual-task setup to study how individuals dynamically allocate attention under varying cognitive loads. The DRT indexed residual cognitive resources, while the MOT manipulated cognitive load, providing a basis for modeling attention allocation between tasks."

    "measured_by": "Number of Dots Tracked in MOT Task",
    "justification": "The cognitive load was manipulated through the number of moving dots participants needed to track in the Multiple Object Tracking task (MOT). Increasing the number of dots to track from one to five escalated the cognitive demands, leading to observable performance decrements in both tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "Task Performance under Dual-Task Conditions",
    "measured_by": "Signal Detection Theory Model for MOT and Wald Accumulator Model for DRT",
    "justification": "Performance under dual-task conditions was quantified using the Signal Detection Theory Model (SDT) for the MOT task assessing discrimination (d\u2019) and the Wald Accumulator model for the DRT task, focusing on response times and accuracy. These models helped in understanding how workload affects the decision-making processes in separate but concurrently performed tasks."

    "measured_by": "Experimental Task-Emphasis Instructions",
    "justification": "Participants were instructed to either prioritize the MOT task over the DRT or vice versa. The authors used these emphasis instructions to assess how individuals strategically allocate cognitive resources to one task over another under experimental conditions."
