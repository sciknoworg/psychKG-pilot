    "measured_by": "Experimental Paradigm",
    "justification": "The study used an experimental paradigm involving a variant of the Dictator Game where participants made moral judgments before and after learning contextual information. This design allowed the researchers to measure how participants updated their moral judgments in real-time as they learned new information about the context."

    "topic_or_construct": "Context-Independent Norms",
    "measured_by": "FPCA analysis of Context-Absent Judgements",
    "justification": "Functional Principle Component Analysis (fPCA) was applied to context-absent judgements to identify the latent context-independent norms like generosity, equality, and selfishness. This systematic method helped in identifying patterns across individuals and organizing the inter-individual variability."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Context-Dependent Norms",
    "measured_by": "FPCA analysis of Context-Present Judgements",
    "justification": "FPCA was also applied to the context-present judgements to identify context-dependent norms like relative generosity, indirect reciprocity, and relative selfishness. This helped in understanding how the norms shift as participants integrate contextual information."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fairness Norms",
    "measured_by": "Judgments in Dictator Game",
    "justification": "Participants' judgments in the Dictator Game variant were used to assess fairness norms. The task involved making moral judgements of others' actions based on how resources were shared, which varied from context-independent to context-dependent scenarios."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Judgment Adjustments",
    "measured_by": "Difference between Context-Absent and Context-Present Judgements",
    "justification": "Judgment adjustments were measured by calculating the differences between the initial context-absent judgments and the subsequently updated, context-present judgments. This provided insights into how people re-evaluate their moral judgements based on new information."
