    "topic_or_construct": "working memory (WM) usage",
    "measured_by": "implicit measure using pick-ups and placements",
    "justification": "The study employed an implicit measure for WM usage, where participants' actions of correctly picking up and placing objects indicated the use of identity and location attributes in WM. This measure provided insight into how WM coordinates with behaviors over time."

    "topic_or_construct": "visual search",
    "measured_by": "search time and object viewing times",
    "justification": "Participants' search time and viewing times of distractors and targets during visual search in the virtual environment were used to quantify the effects of distraction on this subcomponent. The data showed that higher distraction increased search time and the number of distractors viewed."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "encoding",
    "measured_by": "model viewing time and frequency",
    "justification": "Participants' model viewing time and number of model viewings per task were utilized to measure their encoding processes. Higher visual distraction resulted in longer total encoding times and more frequent viewings of the model."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "sensorimnemonic decisions",
    "measured_by": "probabilities of memory reliance during decision points",
    "justification": "Participant's reliance on memory versus re-encoding in specific decision points (identity and location-related decisions) was evaluated via the probability participants decided to use memory. Distraction impacted identity-related but not systematically location-related decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "overall behavior",
    "measured_by": "display completion time and total head movement",
    "justification": "Overall behavioral performance was assessed via display completion times and total head movement, serving as proxies for the global effects of visual distraction. Results demonstrated that higher distraction significantly slowed display completion and increased head movement."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "errors",
    "measured_by": "identity and location errors",
    "justification": "The study tracked and analyzed identity (incorrect pick-ups) and location errors (incorrect placements) as indicators of concentration under distraction. Higher visual distraction increased identity errors but did not significantly increase location errors."
