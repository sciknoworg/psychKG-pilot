    "justification": "The paper explicitly mentions conducting experiments using consumer choice tasks (Experiments 1a and 1b) with hypothetical consumer choices (such as Italian restaurants and cans of orange juice) to measure the occurrence of repulsion effects. These tasks were designed to assess participants\u2019 preferences for options when an inferior decoy is present."

    "justification": "In Experiment 2a and Experiment 2b, the paper employs value estimation tasks, such as the gold mines scenario, to evaluate the repulsion effect by measuring participants\u2019 estimated values of options in the presence of a decoy. This method was utilized to manipulate statistical properties of the environment and infer how participants integrate RequestOptions values under uncertainty."

    "measured_by": "Bayesian Generative Models",
    "justification": "The model discussed in the paper uses Bayesian generative models to infer latent group structures from observable attributes. Participants' ability to infer group membership was examined in Experiment 2b, where they were required to guess which mines belonged to the same mountain. This provided data on how participants' estimates of target mine values were influenced by the decoy mine's signal."
