    "justification": "The authors used a series of empirical studies to investigate factors influencing what comes to mind within various categories. These studies involved tasks such as listing items in a category (Study 1), constructing feature spaces to represent these categories (Study 2), rating the relevance of features to category members (Study 3), and examining the predictiveness of category features in influencing the likelihood of specific members coming to mind. Each study included assessments and rating scales that helped in measuring the generation of category members and options, suggesting these tasks and ratings are direct measurements of the underlying psychological construct of category member/option generation."

    "measured_by": "Ease of response metric",
    "justification": "The authors define a measure of 'ease of response' to estimate how naturally participants can think about category members in terms of various features. This metric is calculated from the combination of the number of responses given during a trial and the speed of each response. Higher ease of response indicates that participants were able to quickly and readily think of category members in terms of that feature, suggesting the feature is highly relevant to their mental representations of the category. The justification is found in Study 6's design which explicitly aims to assess feature relevance in feature space."

    "measured_by": "Intrusion rate comparison in Study 5",
    "justification": "Study 5 assessed how often participants experienced 'intrusions' of category members when asked to think of members opposite to the predictive feature dimension. The intrusion rate comparison shows whether the mental representation and recall are biased toward a feature's predictive end, even when the task is to think of the opposite. This comparison acts as a measure of how strongly the features predict the likelihood of a category member coming to mind, even under contrary instructions."

    "measured_by": "Correlation analysis in Study 7",
    "justification": "In Study 7, the authors used correlation analyses to determine how well features that predict what comes to mind in non-decision-making contexts also predict the options considered in a decision-making task. The positive correlation indicates that the same underlying mechanism is used by participants to generate options for both tasks. This correlation analysis thus measures the predictiveness of specific features in guiding thoughts related to decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Category member typicality",
    "measured_by": "Ratings of typicality and goodness",
    "justification": "Throughout the study, the authors compared typicality and goodness ratings to other measures of what comes to mind, such as feature-based predictions. Participants rated how typical or 'good' a category member is, and these ratings were then compared to other predictors to clarify distinctions between typicality and feature relevance. Therefore, these ratings serve as measurements of perceived category member typicality."
