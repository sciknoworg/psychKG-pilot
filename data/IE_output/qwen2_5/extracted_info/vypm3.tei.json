    "measured_by": "Risky Decision Making Task",
    "justification": "The study utilizes the risky decision-making task, which includes conditions such as Friend Predicted, where participants predicted their friend's choices. This task specifically measures the degree of (mis)calibration of beliefs about peer risk preferences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": " risky decision-making in social contexts",
    "measured_by": "Opposite and Desired Opposite conditions",
    "justification": "The Opposite and Desired Opposite conditions of the risky decision-making task require participants to choose between their own preferred option and assigning it to their friend, as well as choosing what they would like their friend to choose. This measures how these beliefs influence risky decision-making in contexts involving peers."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": " willingness to relinquish preferred options",
    "measured_by": "Preference Revealed condition",
    "justification": "The Preference Revealed condition explicitly shows participants their friend's preferred options and then asks them to choose, thereby measuring their willingness to relinquish their initial preference to accommodate their friend's choices, especially under conflicting preferences."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": " risk preferences and social decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Baseline condition and computational models",
    "justification": "The Baseline condition measures participants' baseline risk preferences by asking what they choose for themselves. The computational models (e.g., power utility function) further quantify individual risk attitudes and how they evolve when considering peer preferences."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": " prosocial risk-taking behavior",
    "measured_by": "Final choices in the Opposite and Preference Revealed conditions",
    "justification": "These conditions require participants to make decisions that may prioritize their friend's outcomes over their own, revealing changes in prosocial risk-taking motives and strategies as they mature from adolescence into early adulthood."
