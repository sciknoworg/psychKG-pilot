    "justification": "The meta-d' measure is used to assess metacognitive sensitivity by comparing the fitted type 2 ROC curves derived from the observer's confidence reports to those predicted by SDT. This is particularly useful for evaluating metacognitive efficiency relative to the underlying task sensitivity. The paper discusses it as a match to observer\u2019s d\u2019 value in standard SDT should the observer be optimal."

    "justification": "The authors derive formulae for the optimal type 2 criteria (c_2) for various optimization contexts, such as accuracy, reward, calibration, and difference between hit rate and false alarm rates. These equations are used to mathematically define the ideal placement of confidence criteria based on factors like sensitivity (d'), prior probabilities, and type 1 criterion placement."

    "justification": "The type 1 criterion 'c_1' is measured as a threshold on the decision axis in SDT. It\u2019s placement reflects observer\u2019s response bias towards a specific decision option, such as 'S1' or 'S2'. The paper explores how the optimal setting for c_1 enhances task outcomes like accuracy or reward."

    "justification": "The study implicitly assumes confidence as a binary report ('high confidence' vs 'low confidence') and measures it through how an observer reports confidence vis-\u00e0-vis their type 1 decision. This binary format guides optimal strategy in setting type 2 criteria."

    "measured_by": "Relative Reward Quotient Q_2",

    "justification": "To account for when meta-d' deviates from d', two computational models were introduced (type 2 noise and signal loss) to simulate suboptimal metacognitive sensitivity. These models aid in understanding how deviations from SDT expectations affect optimal type 2 criterion setting."
