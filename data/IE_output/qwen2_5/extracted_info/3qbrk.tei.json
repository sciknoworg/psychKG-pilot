    "justification": "The article mentions that several studies have found that people who score higher on moral disengagement or neutralization questionnaires, such as those created by Bandura, cheat more. For instance, Shu et al.

    "justification": "Students' cheating behavior is often assessed by analyzing their actual behavior on academic tasks. For instance, the study on first-generation and traditional college students by Collier and Morgan (2008) evaluates students' cheating behavior through observation of their real-time decision-making during academic assignments."
