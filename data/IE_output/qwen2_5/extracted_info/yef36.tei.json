    "measured_by": "Bifurcated Negentropy",
    "justification": "The article describes the telotopic negentropy as a measure of the emergent coherence within an affective field aligned with a situational telos. The bifurcated formulation distinguishes between conative and inhibitory forces, capturing both directional alignment and intensity, which is formally defined by tel = NFc \u2212 NFi."

    "measured_by": "Axiological Alignment Coefficient (\u03b2)",
    "justification": "The axiological alignment coefficient quantifies the alignment between an affect and a telos, considering both directional and axiological concordance. It combines the geometric direction with the valence compatibility to fully capture the affective alignment."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Net Conative Force (\u03c4)",
    "measured_by": "Vectorial Formulation",
    "justification": "\u03c4 is calculated by projecting each affective force onto the telos axis using the cosine of its angle, reflecting the net directional projection of all affective vectors. It captures the overall orientation towards or against the telos within the interaction."

    "topic_or_construct": "Directional Coherence",
    "measured_by": "Mean Directional Coherence (A)",
    "justification": "Mean directional coherence represents the angular alignment of affective vectors relative to the telos. It is computed via the average of square cosine values of the vectors\u2019 angles, ensuring that vectors with greater alignment have a stronger influence on coherence."

    "topic_or_construct": "Axiotype Coherence",
    "measured_by": "Structural Negentropy (N)",
    "justification": "The structural negentropy measures the internal consistency within an individual's axiotype, independent of the external telos. It is computed based on the dispersion of vectors within the axiotype, indicating the stability and coherence of an individual's long-term affective configuration."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Affective Field Intensity",
    "measured_by": "Normalized Intensity (I)",
    "justification": "Intensity reflects the affective magnitude of vectors, normalized to a [0,1] scale. This measurement captures the strength of affective forces and their impact on the overall affective field configuration."
