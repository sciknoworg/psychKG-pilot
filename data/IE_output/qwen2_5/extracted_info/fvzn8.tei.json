    "measured_by": "Centroparietal positivity (CPP)",
    "justification": "The study used the CPP as a neural marker of evidence accumulation and found it to be modulated by motion coherence, which is associated with perceptual uncertainty. The first CPP peak was strongly modulated by motion coherence, indicating its role in perceptual processing."

    "topic_or_construct": "Categorical uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Centroparietal positivity (CPP)",
    "justification": "The second peak of the CPP was significantly modulated by the angular offset of motion direction from a criterion, reflecting categorical uncertainty. This suggests that the CPP can dissociate perceptual and categorical uncertainty."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Change-of-mind scores",
    "justification": "Participants' desire to change their mind was quantified using a continuous scale, which served as a measure of subjective uncertainty. Greater uncertainty, as manipulated by coherence and offset, led to higher change-of-mind scores."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Change-of-mind scores difference (error - correct)",
    "justification": "Metacognitive sensitivity was assessed by subtracting change-of-mind scores following correct responses from those following error responses. The results showed that the separation between scores was greater when uncertainty was low, indicating reduced metacognitive sensitivity with higher uncertainty."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Strength of internal stimulus representations",
    "measured_by": "Neural tuning strength",
    "justification": "The study used Mahalanobis distance to compute the similarity between neural activity on individual trials and mean activity grouped by orientation bins, yielding tuning strength. This method quantified the strength of decoded motion signals, which was numerically greater for high coherence conditions."
