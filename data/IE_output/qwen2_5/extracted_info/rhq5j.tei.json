    "measured_by": "4-in-a-row game performance and Elo ratings",
    "justification": "The paper uses the 4-in-a-row game as a tool to investigate planning, with players' Elo ratings and in-game behavior serving as measures of planning effectiveness. The computational cognitive model predicts planning behavior, which is linked to a player's skill level."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Expertise in planning",
    "measured_by": "Planning depth, feature drop rate, heuristic quality metrics",
    "justification": "The study derives three metrics from the cognitive model\u2014planning depth, feature drop rate, and heuristic quality\u2014to analyze expertise. These metrics are directly linked to players' Elo ratings and their decision-making proficiency, validated through laboratory and mobile app experiments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attentional mechanisms in planning",
    "measured_by": "Feature drop rate",
    "justification": "The feature drop rate measures the probability of attentional lapses during decision-making. Lower feature drop rates are associated with increased planning depth and expertise, indicating players' ability to maintain focus on relevant board features."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value function in decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Heuristic quality metric",
    "justification": "The heuristic quality metric reflects the precision of players' value function when evaluating board states. Improvement in this metric is linked with increased playing strength, as players develop more accurate assessments of game positions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Pattern recognition in planning tasks",
    "measured_by": "Memory and Reconstruction experiment",
    "justification": "The memory and reconstruction experiment reveals that experts exhibit improved pattern recognition skills compared to novices. Experts accurately reconstruct game-relevant features more quickly, suggesting a strong link between pattern recognition and planning depth."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Human cognitive models of planning",
    "measured_by": "Computational model parameters (feature weights, decision tree size, pruning threshold, etc.)",
    "justification": "The accuracy of the computational model in predicting human behavior is validated through experiments. The model parameters, such as feature weights and decision tree size, effectively capture different aspects of human planning during the game."
