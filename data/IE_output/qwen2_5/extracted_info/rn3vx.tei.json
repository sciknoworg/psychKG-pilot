    "measured_by": "Novelty Index",
    "justification": "Novelty in Go decisions is quantified by identifying the first historically novel move in each game and using its move number to calculate the Novelty Index, which indicates how early a novel decision is made in the game."

    "measured_by": "Analysis excluding decisions matching optimal AI decisions",
    "justification": "The study tests the memorization hypothesis by analyzing decision quality for moves that differ from optimal AI moves, demonstrating that quality improvements are not solely due to memorization, as improvements persist in these restricted analyses."
