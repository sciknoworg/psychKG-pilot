    "justification": "The study by Howard and Gottfried examined changes in component representations of odors using the fMRI BOLD signal, showing how the brain represents specific odor components and overall odor values in the orbitofrontal cortex."

    "measured_by": "participant ratings",
    "justification": "Suzuki et al. used participant ratings of nutritive content (like carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamins) to predict the subjective valuation of different foods, demonstrating that lOFC represents individual nutritive features."

    "topic_or_construct": "flexible value computation",
    "measured_by": "BOLD fMRI signals",
    "justification": "Studies using BOLD fMRI signals have shown that the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) are central in enabling flexible value computation based on current motivational states and external contexts."

    "topic_or_construct": "category-dependent goal-value",
    "measured_by": "fMRI activity in vmPFC",
    "justification": "McNamee et al. used fMRI activity in different regions of the vmPFC to distinguish category-dependent values for different goods like consumer goods, food items, and monetary lotteries."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "hierarchical feature integration",
    "measured_by": "neural activity analysis",
    "justification": "Thorough analysis of neural activity demonstrated that lower-level sensory features are integrated into higher-level value representations, supporting the hierarchical organization of value construction with specific roles for lOFC and vmPFC."

    "measured_by": "single-neuron recordings",
    "justification": "Analyses with single-neuron recordings indicated that the orbitofrontal cortex represents specific features and sensory aspects of outcomes, reflecting their role in coding subjective value."
