    "measured_by": "Bayesian meta-planner model",
    "justification": "The Bayesian meta-planner model is used to derive heuristics for meta-planning by mapping a planning problem onto one of information search. This model iteratively computes the value of sampling per action via Bayesian inference, thereby measuring the meta-planning behavior."

    "measured_by": "Response times",
    "justification": "Human response times are utilized as a proxy for the amount of planning computations made in a complex planning task such as 4-in-a-row. The Bayesian meta-planner successfully captures response time trends that previous models cannot explain, indicating the measure of planning depth and complexity."

    "justification": "The Bayesian meta-planner simulations with varying levels of prospective and retrospective uncertainty show that increased uncertainty leads to higher sampling utilities, demonstrating how uncertainty influences planning decisions."

    "measured_by": "Utility of sampling measure",
    "justification": "The utility of sampling as a function of the action gap size indicates that sampling is more beneficial when the action gap is smaller. The Bayesian meta-planner simulations highlight the relationship between top gap size and utility of sampling, supporting the construct of action gaps' influence on meta-planning."

    "topic_or_construct": "Retrospective experience impact on planning",
    "measured_by": "Response times and retrospective samples in simulations",
    "justification": "The Bayesian meta-planner simulations incorporating retrospective experience show that environments with more retrospective experience result in lower utilities for sampling another measurement. This indicates that past experience can influence the extent of prospective planning."
