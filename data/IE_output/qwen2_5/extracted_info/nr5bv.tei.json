    "topic_or_construct": "Partial Innocence",
    "measured_by": "Plea Acceptance Rates",
    "justification": "The article reports that partially innocent participants accepted plea deals more often than innocent participants but at rates similar to guilty participants. This demonstrates the construct of partial innocence can be measured through participants' decision to plead guilty."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Feelings of Guilt",
    "measured_by": "Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)",
    "justification": "The article describes the use of the PANAS scale to measure self-reported feelings of guilt among participants. Higher guilt levels correlated with\u66f4\u9ad8 likelihood of accepting the plea, providing evidence of guilt's role in shaping plea decisions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Feelings of Shame",
    "measured_by": "Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)",
    "justification": "The PANAS scale was also employed to measure self-reported feelings of shame. Unlike guilt, shame did not significantly predict plea acceptance, suggesting a different function in the plea decision-making process."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Judgments of Deservingness of Punishment",
    "measured_by": "Custom Deservingness Scale",
    "justification": "The study constructed a custom sort of questionnaire (adapted from Feather et al. 2011) to assess participants\u2019 beliefs about whether they deserved punishment. These judgments significantly correlated with feelings of guilt, and ultimately influenced the likelihood of accepting a plea."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Beliefs About Fairness of the Plea Deal",
    "measured_by": "Three-Item Composite Score",
    "justification": "The researchers developed a composite score to measure how fairly participants perceived the plea deal relative to their alleged and actual misconduct. Participants' assessment of fairness played a role in their decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Evidence Strength Judgments",
    "measured_by": "Single-Item Due Self-Evaluation",
    "justification": "The study included measures where participants rated how strong the evidence against them was. Stronger perceived evidence negatively correlated with likelihood of pleading guilty among innocent participants."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotional States Following Accusation/Manipulation",
    "measured_by": "State Shame and Guilt Scale (SSGS)",
    "justification": "Shortened versions of the SSGS were used to assess state feelings of guilt and shame after the induction of a particular condition. This was validated by the alignment of subjects\u2019 emotional state reporting against their plea decision."
