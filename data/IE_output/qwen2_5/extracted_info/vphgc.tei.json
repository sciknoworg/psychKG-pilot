    "justification": "The paper states that 'In previous experiments, we have used two key memory measures: frequency judgments and first-outcome reported. The frequency judgment presents participants with each of the risky options and outcomes and asks them to state what percentage of the time they saw each of the outcomes. Participants systematically overestimate the frequency of the extreme outcomes (highest and lowest experienced).'"

    "justification": "Participants are asked 'to type as many outcomes as they could recall for each door within two minutes. They were also shown each door again and asked to type what they thought the average value of that door was. They had 30s to type their answers.' This free recall task is used to assess their memory accuracy and specific recall patterns."

Accordingly, the high-value risky door would be overestimated (as it might lead to a high extreme), and the low-value risky door would be underestimated (as it might lead to a low extreme).'"
