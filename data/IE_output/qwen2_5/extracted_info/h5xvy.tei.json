    "measured_by": "Salivary Cortisol Collection protocol",
    "justification": "Saliva samples were collected at multiple time points over two consecutive weekdays to reliably assess the cortisol awakening response and the post-awakening diurnal fall of cortisol. The cortisol awakening response was measured using the area under the curve with respect to increase (AUCi) for the first three samples, and the diurnal cortisol slope was assessed by calculating the difference between cortisol levels at bedtime and the morning peak."
