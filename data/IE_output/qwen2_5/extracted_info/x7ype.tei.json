    "measured_by": "Finger Tracking Implicit Association Test (FT-IAT)",
    "justification": "The study introduces the Finger Tracking Implicit Association Test (FT-IAT) as a method to enhance traditional implicit bias measurement, by collecting detailed in-flight data such as curvature, complexity, and temporal trajectory. It provides a way to examine cognitive processes during decision-making beyond simple reaction times, offering richer evidence about cognitive preferences."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Processing Complexity",
    "measured_by": "Trajectory Indices (Curvature, Complexity, Temporal Metrics)",
    "justification": "The research utilizes trajectory indices including measures of curvature, complexity, and temporal development to analyze cognitive processing during decision tasks. These indices offer a more nuanced understanding of cognitive load and the decision-making process compared to traditional IAT methods which only use reaction times."

    "topic_or_construct": "Implicit Association Strength",
    "measured_by": "Area Under the Curve (AUC)",
    "justification": "The area under the curve (AUC) is used as an index to measure the cumulative response competition across a trial, providing additional evidence of the strength of associative pairs in implicit cognition beyond mere reaction time."

    "topic_or_construct": "Individual Decision Dynamics",
    "measured_by": "Spatio-temporal Analysis",
    "justification": "Spatio-temporal analysis of decision-making processes, focusing on velocity, x-position, and angle, reveals detailed insights into bias and cognitive complexity, allowing for a more fine-grained understanding of individual variations in cognitive processes."
