    "justification": "The article assesses GPT-3's decision-making by subjecting it to classic vignette-based problems like the Linda problem and cab problem, as well as decisions from descriptions tasks involving gambles. These instruments evaluate GPT-3's capacity in making choices under different conditions."

    "measured_by": "Toma problem, test selection, Wason's card task",
    "justification": "Information search abilities of GPT-3 are evaluated through tasks such as identifying the reasons behind Toma's lateness, choosing appropriate tests in a medical context, and resolving Wason's card sorting problem. These tests measure the model's capability to search for relevant information and tackle uncertainty."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Deliberation",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)",
    "justification": "GPT-3's deliberation was tested using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), which challenges the model's tendency to override fast but incorrect responses with more considered and accurate answers, indicating its reflective thinking process."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Causal reasoning",
    "measured_by": "Blicket experiments, interventions scenarios",
    "justification": "The article investigates GPT-3's causal reasoning via the Blicket tasks and intervention scenarios. These tasks evaluate the model's ability to understand cause-effect relationships and to reason about causal structures in various situations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Heuristics and biases",
    "measured_by": "Vignette-based classic bias experiments",
    "justification": "GPT-3's susceptibility to human cognitive biases is evaluated via vignette-based experiments derived from cognitive psychology literature, which includes problems like the conjunction fallacy and the base-rate fallacy."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Exploration and exploitation",
    "measured_by": "Multi-arm bandit tasks, horizon task",
    "justification": "The exploration-exploitation trade-off in GPT-3 was measured using multi-arm bandit tasks and the horizon task, which evaluated its ability to balance known options with novel, potentially more valuable but riskier choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Model-based and model-free reinforcement learning",
    "measured_by": "Two-step task",
    "justification": "The two-step task was employed to explore whether GPT-3 could distinguish between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning strategies, thereby assessing its capability to navigate sequential decision problems."
