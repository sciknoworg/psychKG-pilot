    "topic_or_construct": "Negative affective biases",
    "measured_by": "Ambiguous-Cue Decision-Making Task",
    "justification": "The paper describes using the ambiguous-cue decision-making task to measure negative affective biases, particularly how participants interpret ambiguous cues in the context of reward. It measures the tendency to avoid high-reward responses on ambiguous trials, indicating a negative bias."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Dynamic Reward Task",
    "justification": "The dynamic reward task was used to assess reward sensitivity (captured as the gain parameter G) through participants' responses to changing reward contingencies. Participants with lower reward sensitivity demonstrated a conservative shift in their criterion placement, supporting the link between reward sensitivity and negative affective biases."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective value sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Prospect Theory Task",
    "justification": "The gambling task, modeled using prospect theory, was designed to evaluate subjective value sensitivity. Participants' choices between a safe bet and gambles helped determine parameters like risk aversion (r). However, this study did not find an association between subjective value sensitivity and negative affective bias, suggesting it may not be a primary driver of the bias."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice variability (noise)",
    "measured_by": "Dynamic Reward Task",
    "justification": "The dynamic reward task produced a setting noise parameter which indicated the variability in mapping decision-making criteria to actual responses. Higher noise levels were associated with lower negative affective bias scores, indicating that choice variability plays a role in the bias."
