    "justification": "The paper mentions studies like Jacowitz & Kahneman (1995) and others that use general-knowledge questions to measure anchoring effects. These questions, such as estimating the percentage of African countries in the UN, are commonly used instruments to assess the anchoring effect."

    "justification": "Northcraft and Neale\u2019s (1987) study is cited, which uses appraisers\u2019 estimates of home prices as an instrument to measure anchoring effects in the context of real estate, where the listing price acts as an anchor."

    "justification": "Studies by Ariely, Loewenstein, and Prelec (2003), Green, Jacowitz, Kahneman, and McFadden (1998), and Simonson and Drolet (2004) are mentioned. These studies use modifications in consumer product prices as anchors to assess anchoring."

    "justification": "Research by Galinsky and Mussweiler (2001), Loschelder, Stuppi, and Trotschel (2014), and Mason, Lee, Wiley, and Ames (2013) uses first offers in negotiations as an instrument to measure how anchoring affects negotiation outcomes."

    "measured_by": "Temporal Proximity Tasks",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how temporal proximity is used in anchoring studies, like those of Wilson, Houston, Etling, and Brekke (1996), as a way to assess anchoring. Participants are anchored by numbers presented shortly before making numerical judgments."

    "justification": "Studies such as Northcraft and Neale (1987) focus on contextual diagnostic anchoring, where sentence lengths predicted by prosecutors for different crimes act as anchors in judicial estimates."
