    "measured_by": "paired associate learning (PAL) tasks",
    "justification": "Children's skill in forming letter-sound correspondence is often assessed using paired associate learning (PAL) tasks, which require learning novel associations between characters and pseudowords, reflecting the early stages of visual-to-phonological mapping processes during reading acquisition."

    "topic_or_construct": "reading skill",
    "measured_by": "paired associate learning (PAL) tasks",
    "justification": "PAL is a significant, unique predictor of reading skill in children and adults, and performance on PAL tasks reliably discriminates typically developing readers from poorer readers, such as those with developmental dyslexia."

    "topic_or_construct": "decision-making patterns",
    "measured_by": "mouse tracking procedures",
    "justification": "Mouse tracking measurements were used to provide a window into the cognitive processes underpinning paired associate learning decision-making processes on correct trials, showing that poorer readers exhibit more switched decisions, indicative of less stable associations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "recognition accuracy",
    "measured_by": "recognition task as part of PAL",
    "justification": "Recognition accuracy was measured by how frequently participants correctly identified the character that corresponded to an auditorily presented pseudoword, with mixed effects regression analyses used to show differences based on reading ability."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "visual-phonological associations",
    "measured_by": "cued-recall trials",
    "justification": "Verbal recall of the novel visual-phonological associations was measured in both interspersed cued-recall tasks and a post-test cued-recall task, revealing poorer readers were less accurate in verbal recall compared to skilled readers."
