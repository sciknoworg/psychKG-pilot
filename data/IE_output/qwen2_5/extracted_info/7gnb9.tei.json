    "justification": "The Beck Depression Inventory-II is used to measure the severity of depression, as evidenced by the statement that the MDD group had higher BDI-II scores (p < 0.001, t = 19.33, d = 3.42)."

    "justification": "The Reward Learning Task and Punishment Learning Task measured the participants' ability to learn from rewards and punishments. Depressed participants made fewer choices of the more advantageous option in punishment reversal learning (d = -0.54, t = 3.10, p = 0.003) and showed slightly smaller differences in reward reversal learning (d = -0.38, t = 2.15, p = 0.03)."

    "measured_by": "Prediction Questionnaire",
    "justification": "The Prediction Questionnaire was used to assess participants' future reward expectations. Depressed participants expressed a lower expectation of winning additional money on this task (d = -0.47, t = 2.54, p = 0.01)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Persistence",
    "measured_by": "Persistence or Willingness to Wait (WTW) Task",
    "justification": "The Persistence or Willingness to Wait (WTW) Task was used to measure participants' willingness to wait for delayed rewards. Depressed participants showed reduced willingness to wait when the optimal strategy was to persist until the reward arrives (d = -0.39, t = 2.22, p = 0.03)."

    "measured_by": "Risk Tolerance Task",
    "justification": "The Risk Tolerance Task measured the degree to which participants tolerate risk. The article describes the task as used to compare safe choices between depressed and control groups, although the differences were not statistically significant."

    "topic_or_construct": "Ambiguity tolerance",
    "measured_by": "Ambiguity Tolerance Task",
    "justification": "The Ambiguity Tolerance Task measured participants' tolerance for ambiguity. The article indicates this task was part of the battery of decision-making tasks, although the observed differences were small and not significant."

    "topic_or_construct": "Delay discounting",
    "measured_by": "Delay Discounting Task",
    "justification": "The Delay Discounting Task measured the extent to which participants discount delayed rewards. The study reported small, non-significant differences in delay discounting between the depressed and control groups."

    "justification": "The Ultimatum Game was used to assess social decision-making. Participants played as both proposers and responders, with no significant differences found between depressed and control groups."
