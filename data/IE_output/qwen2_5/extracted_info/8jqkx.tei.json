    "measured_by": "Self-Report Measures",
    "justification": "The study used self-report measures to assess participants' identification with the wearing facial disguise and their racial identity as Asian or White (Experiment 1). Participants rated their degree of personal and racial identity on 7-point Likert scales, providing subjective estimations of racial identity shift due to WMTP and AMTP."

    "topic_or_construct": "Racial Identity",
    "measured_by": "Racial Face Categorization Task",
    "justification": "The racial face categorization task (Experiment 3) was used to measure racial identity shift. Participants categorized upright and inverted White and Asian faces, revealing faster responses to White than Asian faces after WMTP, suggesting a shift in racial identity."

    "topic_or_construct": "Racial Identity Shift",
    "measured_by": "fMRI - Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) Activity",
    "justification": "fMRI data from the self-referential task (Experiment 4) revealed enhanced activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) when participants judged trait adjectives for own facial disguises after WMTP compared to AMTP, indicating a neural substrate underlying shifted racial identity."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Empathy for Pain",
    "measured_by": "EEG - P2 Amplitudes",
    "justification": "The EEG results in Experiment 5 showed that WMTP compared to AMTP increased P2 empathic neural responses to perceived pain in White targets, demonstrating that racial identity shift can modulate empathic brain responses."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Altruistic Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Monetary Donation Task",
    "justification": "An altruistic decision-making task (Experiment 7) measured participants' choices of monetary donations to faces with varying racial identity and expression. Results showed reduced racial ingroup bias in altruistic decision-making after WMTP."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Implicit Racial Attitudes",
    "measured_by": "Implicit Association Test (IAT)",
    "justification": "The study used the IAT (Experiment 7) to measure changes in participants' implicit negative attitudes toward White faces. WMTP resulted in a significant reduction of this bias compared to AMTP, further supporting the impact of racial identity shift."
