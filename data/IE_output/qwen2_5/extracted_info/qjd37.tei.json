    "measured_by": "Extinction Gambling Task (EGT)",
    "justification": "The paper introduces and utilizes the Extinction Gambling Task (EGT) for studying decision making under extinction risk, providing a structured experimental paradigm to assess participants' choices in scenarios reflecting varying definitions of extinction risks (Keep, Lose, Reset)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Opportunity Cost Neglect",
    "measured_by": "Computational Modeling Analysis",
    "justification": "Computational modeling was employed to analyze participants' choice strategies, revealing differences between conditions reflecting opportunity cost neglect, as participants were more aligned with the optimal strategy when their endowment was at stake compared to the opportunity to continue playing."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Loss Chasing",
    "measured_by": "Loss + Endowment Condition in Experiment 3a",
    "justification": "Experiment 3a introduced losses and an endowment to explore loss chasing behaviors. Participants exhibited risk-seeking behavior after experiencing losses, providing insights into how risky decision-making escalates under conditions that allow for recovery from previous losses."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Scope Insensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Varying Maximum Number of Trials in Experiment 3b",
    "justification": "Experiment 3b varied the maximum number of trials to investigate scope insensitivity. Participants\u2019 sensitivity to the total number of trials suggested limitations in their ability to appropriately adjust their choices based on the stakes involved, aligning with scope insensitivity observed in earlier literature."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Aversion and Risk Seeking",
    "measured_by": "Choice Patterns in Keep, Lose, and Reset Conditions",
    "justification": "Participant choice patterns across the Keep, Lose, and Reset conditions were indicative of risk aversion or risk-seeking behaviors, with patterns reflecting considerations like potential gains, losses, and the nature of the extinction event."
