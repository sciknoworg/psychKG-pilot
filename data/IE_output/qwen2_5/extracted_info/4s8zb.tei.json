    "topic_or_construct": "Safety",
    "measured_by": "Threat-related decision-making tasks",
    "justification": "The article discusses how threat-related decision-making paradigms have been used to assess safety processing. Although these paradigms often involve measuring perceived threat, safety decisions are also captured through participants' responses during these tasks, indicating the utility of such assessments for understanding safety."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Safety signal",
    "measured_by": "Functional MRI studies",
    "justification": "The article mentions functional MRI studies that have been conducted to identify neural activation patterns associated with safety signals in the anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). These imaging studies provide empirical evidence of safety processing."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Safety decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Neurosynth meta-analysis",
    "justification": "The article utilizes Neurosynth meta-analysis to correlate vmPFC subregions with various components of the Safety Decision Model. This analysis helps in understanding how different aspects of safety evaluations are processed neurally, particularly highlighting anterior vmPFC involvement."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Safety neural circuitry",
    "measured_by": "Neuroanatomical studies",
    "justification": "Studies on rodent and primate neuroanatomy help identify the specific neural systems associated with safety computations. The article references how rodent infralimbic cortex, analogous to the anterior vmPFC in humans, is responsible for conveying safety."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived safety",
    "measured_by": "Observation of behavioral responses",
    "justification": "The article suggests that safety perceptions can be assessed by observing an organism's behavior, such as the prioritization of non-defensive motivated behaviors like foraging during perceived safety. This observational approach aids in evaluating safety decisions."
