    "measured_by": "Moral Dilemma Task",
    "justification": "Participants read moral dilemma scenarios and made binary choices between deontological and utilitarian options. The moral similarity to group consensus was calculated as the ratio of participant decisions that match the group consensus moral decision, directly measuring moral intuition toward group consensus."

    "measured_by": "Korean Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (K-MAIA)",
    "justification": "The K-MAIA, a self-report instrument measuring multiple dimensions of interoception, was used to assess individuals' interoceptive awareness. The study found that K-MAIA scores were positively correlated with the moral similarity to group consensus and negatively correlated with moral distance from group consensus."

    "measured_by": "Heartbeat Counting Task",
    "justification": "The heartbeat counting task was employed to measure interoceptive accuracy. Participants counted their heartbeats during specified periods without touching their bodies. The accuracy of their counts was compared to actual heartbeats recorded via ECG, revealing a correlation between interoceptive accuracy and moral intuition toward group consensus."
