    "measured_by": "Generative model parameter estimation",
    "justification": "The value-update mechanism within the generative model is estimated through parameters that reflect choices conditioned on the memory of previous choices, showing updates for chosen and rejected items separately."

    "measured_by": "Forced-choice vs. voluntary choice conditions",
    "justification": "Experiment 3 introduced a forced-choice condition to demonstrate whether exogenously driven choices can induce CIB, showing that voluntary choice is necessary for the bias to occur."
