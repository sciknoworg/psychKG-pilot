    "topic_or_construct": "Online/offline moral judgment discrepancy",
    "measured_by": "Vignette-based approach",
    "justification": "The study used a vignette-based approach to measure and validate the differences in moral judgment between online and offline contexts for various moral scenarios. This method allowed participants to respond to hypothetical situations in both online and offline settings, helping to establish whether moral judgments differ based on the context."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Imageability",
    "measured_by": "7-point Likert scale",
    "justification": "Imageability was measured using a 7-point Likert scale where participants rated how easy it was to clearly imagine the details of each vignette. This was crucial for ensuring that participants could effectively visualize and respond to the moral scenarios presented in a comparable way for both online and offline contexts."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotional Response",
    "measured_by": "7-point Likert scale",
    "justification": "The emotional response to each vignette was measured on a 7-point Likert scale to evaluate the strength of emotional reactions. This was used to ensure that participants' emotional responses were comparable for online and offline scenarios, which is a critical component of moral judgments."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Size of Effect",
    "measured_by": "Open-text box estimate",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to estimate the number of people negatively affected by the moral actor's behavior in an open-text box. This measure helps quantify perceived negative social impact, which is an essential aspect of moral judgment."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social Harm",
    "measured_by": "7-point Likert scale",
    "justification": "Social harm was measured on a 7-point Likert scale to determine the perceived social harm of the hypothetical actor's behavior. This variable examines the broader social consequences considered by participants in making moral judgments."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Moral Wrongness",
    "measured_by": "7-point Likert scale",
    "justification": "The perceived moral wrongness of a behavior was assessed using a 7-point Likert scale. It directly measures participants' moral evaluation of the hypothetical actions, serving as a key metric for comparison across online and offline scenarios."
