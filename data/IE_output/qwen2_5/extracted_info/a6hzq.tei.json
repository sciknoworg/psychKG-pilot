    "measured_by": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) model-based analysis",
    "justification": "The article discusses how the RL model-based analysis estimates preference changes, which may be due to the model's pseudo-learning effect rather than actual changes in preference. This is illustrated by simulations that show the model reporting apparent preference changes even when real preferences remain stable."

    "measured_by": "Q-learning model",
    "justification": "The study uses the Q-learning model to analyze choice behavior in decision-making tasks, examining the apparent preference changes due to different reward probabilities even when no actual learning occurs."

    "justification": "The paper critiques the traditional analysis of the FCP, showing that choice-induced preference changes, as measured through cognitive dissonance theory, might be statistical artifacts caused by methodological flaws."
