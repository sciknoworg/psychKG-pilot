    "measured_by": "Intertemporal Choice Task",
    "justification": "Researchers use the intertemporal choice task to study time preferences by presenting participants with choices between rewards arriving at different times. Based on participants' responses, researchers fit delay discounting models to quantify individual differences in time preferences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Impulsivity",
    "measured_by": "Delay Discounting",
    "justification": "The most commonly used behavioral measure of impulsivity is delay discounting, as it assesses impulsive decision-making. People with substance use disorders, for example, are regarded as impulsive for their inability to suppress the urge for immediate rewards, which corresponds to steep delay discounting."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Self-Control",
    "measured_by": "Intertemporal Choice Task",
    "justification": "In many studies, a tendency to choose larger-later options in intertemporal choice tasks is denoted as a self-controlled choice pattern. This is linked to concepts like delay of gratification, where choosing larger, delayed rewards reflects self-control."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Preference Reversals",
    "measured_by": "Indifference Points",
    "justification": "Preference reversals occur when people prefer a larger-later reward when both are distant, but as the smaller-sooner reward becomes more immediate, they switch their preference. Indifference points are used to estimate these preference reversals in delay discounting tasks."
