    "justification": "The study used a 11-point confidence scale from 'Guessing' to '100% sure' to measure participants' subjective confidence in their choices, which was critical for investigating confidence-based learning signals in phases without external feedback."

    "topic_or_construct": "Value-based decision making",
    "measured_by": "Reward outcomes (scratch card with 50 fields)",
    "justification": "The experiment employed a scratch card with 50 fields, each of which could contain a 1 Euro coin or be blank, to measure the monetary values of conditioned stimuli (CS) and participants' learning of these values."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice consistency",
    "measured_by": "Choice consistency between trials",
    "justification": "The experiment analyzed choice consistency across repeated pairs of CS to determine if participants became more consistent with their choices over time, which supported the idea of self-reinforcement."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective value changes",
    "measured_by": "Continuous rating scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated the subjective value of each CS on a continuous scale before and after phases without feedback, which helped assess whether subjective values were influenced by confidence-based learning."
