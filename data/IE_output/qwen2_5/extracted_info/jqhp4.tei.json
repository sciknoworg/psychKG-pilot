    "measured_by": "Public Goods Game",
    "justification": "The Public Goods Game is commonly used to study cooperation where participants contribute money to a public pool that is multiplied and then evenly redistributed. Contributions are used as a measure of cooperation in group settings."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social Norms and Cooperation",
    "measured_by": "Experimental manipulations of descriptive and injunctive norms",
    "justification": "Studies manipulate descriptive and injunctive norms to examine their influence on cooperation in social dilemmas. For instance, providing information about others' cooperative behavior (descriptive norms) or suggested behaviors (injunctive norms) affects participants' contributions in games like the Dictator Game."

    "topic_or_construct": "Intentional Deliberation in Cooperation",
    "measured_by": "Time-pressure vs. Forced-delay Conditions",
    "justification": "Researchers compare reaction times in time-pressure vs. forced-delay tasks during social dilemmas to investigate whether deliberate thinking promotes or hinders cooperation. For example, research explores whether rushed decisions favor intuitive cooperative or selfish tendencies."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social Identity and Cooperation",
    "measured_by": "Minimal Group Paradigm",
    "justification": "The minimal group paradigm is used to create artificial social categories, examining how group membership influences cooperative behavior by altering social identities among participants."

    "topic_or_construct": "Value of Cooperation Representation",
    "measured_by": "fMRI measurements of vmPFC and dlPFC activity",
    "justification": "Neuroimaging studies utilize fMRI to track brain activity, particularly in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), to understand how subjective values are computed in cooperative decisions."
