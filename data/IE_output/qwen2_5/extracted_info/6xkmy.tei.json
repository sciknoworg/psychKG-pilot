    "measured_by": "DPOWER model",
    "justification": "The article presents the DPOWER model as a novel computational approach to capture the complex relationship between effort and value. It specifically aids in modeling individual differences in effort-value relationships by integrating the contributions of both positive and negative evaluation subsystems, demonstrating its superior explanatory power compared to other models."

    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal orientation impact on effort-value",
    "measured_by": "Logit model analysis",
    "justification": "The paper employs a logit model fitted to participants' choices to determine the effect of temporal orientation (prospective or retrospective) on effort-value relationships. Results highlight distinct patterns, such as the greater likelihood of choosing effortful options in the retrospective condition compared to the prospective condition."

    "topic_or_construct": "Hypothetical vs. real task impact on effort-value",
    "measured_by": "Choice data and model comparisons",
    "justification": "Analysis of choice data shows the interaction between effort intensity and task type (hypothetical vs. real). In the prospective condition, effort had a more pronounced negative impact in hypothetical tasks, while the opposite occurred in the retrospective condition, suggesting task type influences effort-value relations."

    "measured_by": "Parametric Estimation by Sequential Testing (PEST) procedure and DPOWER model",
    "justification": "The PEST procedure was used to elicit various individual effort-value relationships. The DPOWER model then identified four distinct preference profiles\u2014decreasing, increasing, decreasing-increasing, and increasing-decreasing\u2014providing insight into individual differences in effort evaluation."
