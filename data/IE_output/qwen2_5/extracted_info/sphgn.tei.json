    "measured_by": "CSA for Analysts Questionnaire",
    "justification": "The paper mentions using a questionnaire partly inspired by the CSA for Analysts Questionnaire to assess participants' understanding of network topology. This tool helps in evaluating CSA for analysts in a digital format by choosing among several images that depict network topology correctly."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA)",
    "measured_by": "Task Performance Measures",
    "justification": "The study includes various task performance measures such as identifying Red Team hosts and compromised Blue Team segments, which directly assess the level of CSA achieved by participants. Observing these behaviors helps in understanding participants' capabilities in establishing and utilizing CSA."

    "topic_or_construct": "Communication Workload",
    "measured_by": "Team Workload Questionnaire (TWLQ)",
    "justification": "The TWLQ was used to measure communication demands within the cyber team. This instrument helps in understanding the subjectively experienced worker load related to communication in tasks, which is critical for achieving shared CSA."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Orient, Locate, Bridge (OLB) Processes",
    "measured_by": "Structured Observation",
    "justification": "Structured observation was used to assess OLB processes, critical for achieving a shared understanding between dyads. The frequency of OLB communication behaviors was recorded to determine their impact on team performance and CSA."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Forced-choice Decision-making Task",
    "justification": "The forced-choice decision-making task was administered to evaluate the effect of VDE (virtual representation) and Arkime (2D graph representation) on decision-making ability. Participants chose from several decision options after completing the tasks, reflecting their judgments based on the CSA developed."
