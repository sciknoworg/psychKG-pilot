    "justification": "The article states that the Sally-Anne Task is used to assess Theory of Mind, particularly false belief understanding. This connection is supported by the statement that children who passed the SAT at ages 5 and 7 demonstrated 'false belief understanding' (see section on Theory of Mind and Broader Social Cognitive Abilities)."

    "justification": "The article mentions that the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) is used to measure risk adjustment (RA), a specific measure of the ability to adjust decisions under risk in light of new information. The CGT is described as assessing risk-taking behavior outside a learning context, specifically highlighting the RA component (see section explaining the study's focus on risk adjustment)."

    "measured_by": "Sally-Anne Task (SAT)",
    "justification": "The article indicates that children who passed the SAT at ages 5 and 7 demonstrated 'above-average social competence skills', which are part of their broader social-cognitive abilities. This is supported by the statement that the combination of passing the SAT and demonstrating social competence skills is referred to as 'superior social cognition.' (see the section discussing the present research and the Sally-Anne Task)."
