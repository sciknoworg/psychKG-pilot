    "topic_or_construct": "New Look in Perception bias",
    "measured_by": "explicit reports of perceived infractions",
    "justification": "The New Look in Perception examined if emotions and motivations influence basic perception. Perceived infractions during a football game were explicitly reported by participants, which purportedly demonstrated the influence of viewing teams unfavorably. However, subsequent analyses show that disagreement in perceived infractions was minimal, suggesting these studies didn't conclusively prove perceptual bias."

    "topic_or_construct": "Heuristics and Biases",
    "measured_by": "statistical models and behavioral measures",
    "justification": "Kahneman and Tversky identified heuristics and biases from deviations in rational decision-making. The constructs were supported by statistical models and observed behaviors. As research continued, many deviations once considered irrational were shown to be adaptive strategies in real-world scenarios, indicating an overemphasis on bias in early work."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Implicit Bias",
    "measured_by": "Implicit Association Test (IAT)",
    "justification": "The IAT was designed to measure implicit biases by comparing reaction times to associated stimuli. However, critique has arisen suggesting the IAT may not effectively measure unconscious biases, as participants can predict their scores, indicating awareness and possibly conscious response rather than unconscious associations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Stereotype Threat",
    "measured_by": "performance metrics under stereotype-relevant conditions",
    "justification": "Stereotype threat was primarily measured by observing performance changes under stereotype-relevant conditions. Yet critics question the strength of this paradigm, citing failed replications and challenges to the foundational claims that stereotype threat solely accounts for performance disparities among certain groups."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Microaggressions",
    "measured_by": "self-report inventories and checklists",
    "justification": "Microaggressions have been studied using self-report inventories. Although widely applied, there is criticism that such measures cannot verify the alleged unconscious nature of microaggressions, as empirical testing for their existence or impact is lacking."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Workplace Gender Discrimination",
    "measured_by": "audit studies",
    "justification": "Audit studies, particularly those involving job applications, are used to assess whether gender influences hiring decisions. Recent meta-analyses of these studies suggest that biases against women in hiring have diminished or reversed in recent times, contrary to the prevalent narrative predicting strong and persistent discrimination."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Racial Discrimination",
    "measured_by": "audit studies and ultimatum game tasks",
    "justification": "Racial discrimination has been measured through audit studies and ultimatum game tasks. While these methods highlight disparities, they also point to the complexity of discrimination, occasionally showing low levels of discriminatory behavior which still result in significant aggregate disparities."
