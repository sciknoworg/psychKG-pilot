    "topic_or_construct": "relative value of drugs versus alternative rewards",
    "measured_by": "economic demand tasks, concurrent choice tasks",
    "justification": "In economic demand tasks, participants indicate hypothetical consumption of a drug across prices, reflecting the relative value compared to money. Concurrent choice tasks involve choosing between a drug and an alternative reward, with the proportion of drug choices indicating relative value. These tasks correlate with dependence severity, supporting their relevance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "negative affect and drug choice",
    "measured_by": "negative mood induction, concurrent choice tasks",
    "justification": "Studies show that negative mood induction increases drug choice, suggesting mood induces greater sensitivity to drug value. This association is more reliably linked to self-reported drug use to cope with negative affect, indicating a potential risk factor for addiction."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "drug-related cue reactivity",
    "measured_by": "Pavlovian to Instrumental Transfer (PIT) procedure",
    "justification": "The PIT procedure isolates the mechanism by which drug stimuli prime drug choice through an expectancy of the drug\u2019s availability. Despite the drug cue increasing drug choice overall, this effect\u2019s magnitude isn\u2019t consistently associated with dependence severity, challenging cue-reactivity theories."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "goal-directed versus habitual drug choice",
    "measured_by": "outcome devaluation experiment, concurrent choice tasks",
    "justification": "Outcome devaluation tests show that drug choice decreases when the drug is devalued, indicating goal-directed control. Dependence severity is not associated with insensitivity to devaluation, contradicting habit theory, which posits autonomy from value changes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cost-sensitivity in drug choice",
    "measured_by": "cost imposition experiment, concurrent choice tasks",
    "justification": "Cost imposition on drug choice (via increased effort or alternative reward value) reduces drug selections. Most studies show that dependence severity is not linked to impaired cost-sensitivity, contradicting compulsion theory, which suggests maladaptive, cost-insensitive behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "self-reported drug use to cope with negative affect",
    "measured_by": "concurrent pictorial drug choice task, mood-induced drug choice increase",
    "justification": "This coping motive reliably predicts higher baseline drug choice and greater sensitivity to mood-induced increases in drug choice, highlighting its role as a risk factor for addiction, particularly when combined with negative reinforcement theory."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "evidence accumulation in drug and alternative rewards",
    "measured_by": "Value-based Decision Making (VBDM) tasks with drift diffusion models",
    "justification": "VBDM tasks with drift diffusion models isolate the internal processes of evidence accumulation for drug versus non-drug options, allowing researchers to identify differences in rates of accumulation and response thresholds that may underpin addiction's cognitive underpinnings."
