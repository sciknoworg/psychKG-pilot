    "measured_by": "Computational models: IBL and RL",
    "justification": "The paper employs computational models, including Instance-Based Learning (IBL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), as tools to simulate and analyze how participants adapt their choices in response to changing probabilities. The models' parameter estimations and predictions provide insights into adaptive behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "Awareness of change",
    "measured_by": "Funnel debriefing questionnaire",
    "justification": "The funnel debriefing questionnaire was used to assess participants' explicit awareness of changes in probabilities throughout the experiment. Responses from this questionnaire were analyzed to classify participants as aware or unaware, thus measuring their explicit awareness of change."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Recency effects",
    "measured_by": "Decay parameter in IBL model",
    "justification": "The Instance-Based Learning (IBL) model's decay parameter was used to capture recency effects, indicating reliance on more recent experiences. High decay values were associated with better adaptation, demonstrating how recency plays a role in behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Maximization rates",
    "measured_by": "Choice selection patterns",
    "justification": "Maximization rates were calculated based on participants' choice selection patterns over the course of the task, showing how effectively they adapted their choices to optimize rewards. These rates were examined within different experimental conditions."
