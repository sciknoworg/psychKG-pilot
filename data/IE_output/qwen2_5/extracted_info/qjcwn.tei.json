    "measured_by": "two-step task",
    "justification": "The two-step task was used to explore the correlates of model-based decision making by examining an individual's probability of repeating a first-step choice as a function of reward received on the previous trial and whether the previous transition was common or rare."

    "topic_or_construct": "model-free decision making",
    "measured_by": "two-step task",
    "justification": "The two-step task was also employed to assess model-free decision making, using logistic regression to model the action repetition probability based on the main effect of reward and interaction between reward and transition type."

    "measured_by": "Test of Episodic Future Thinking",
    "justification": "The Test of Episodic Future Thinking was used to obtain written narratives of personal future events by presenting participants with cue words and asking them to describe a future event in response, scoring the specificity of these events."

    "topic_or_construct": "temporal discounting",
    "measured_by": "Monetary Choice Task",
    "justification": "Temporal discounting was measured using a monetary choice task in which participants chose between smaller immediate rewards and larger delayed rewards, and their discount function was fit using maximum likelihood estimation."

    "measured_by": "Future Self-Continuity Questionnaire",
    "justification": "The Future Self-Continuity Questionnaire was used to measure future self-continuity, evaluating participants' vividness in imagining their future self, felt similarity to the future self, and positive feelings toward the future self via 10 Likert scale questions."
