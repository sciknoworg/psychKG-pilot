    "measured_by": "Reward task, Memory task",
    "justification": "Participants first learned associations between stimuli and reward outcomes. In the Memory task, item memory and associative memory were assessed using responses on a scale from definitely old to definitely new, along with questions probing the value and confidence in that value."

    "measured_by": "bias in associative memory for social stimuli",
    "justification": "Older adults displayed a bias toward remembering social partners as being fair, whereas young adults were biased toward remembering them as being unfair. This was measured through distinct response biases in the associative memory task."

    "measured_by": "ratings of perceived warmth, competence, trustworthiness, attractiveness, dominance, and perceived generosity",
    "justification": "The effects of perceived attributes on choice were evaluated through mixed-effects logistic regressions, where ratings were independently rated and entered into models with memory and value controlled for."

    "measured_by": "Decision task",
    "justification": "Participants' decisions to approach or avoid social and non-social stimuli were measured, comparing these to memory accuracy and perceived attributes, thus assessing the adaptiveness of their decision-making."
