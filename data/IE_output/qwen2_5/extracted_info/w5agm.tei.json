    "justification": "The article explains that Victim Impact Statements (VIS) elicit moral emotions such as sympathy/empathy toward the victim, which increases the likelihood of jurors recommending harsher sentences. This is supported by empirical evidence that identifies emotional reactions as the explanation for increased death penalty recommendations following VIS (Paternoster & Deise, 2011)."

    "measured_by": "Gruesome photographs",
    "justification": "Exposure to gruesome photographs elicits negative moral emotions like disgust and anger in jurors, which are correlated with more guilty and liability verdicts, as well as harsher punishments. Several studies have confirmed this link, demonstrating that such photographs significantly increase jurors' levels of disgust and anger, which directly influences their verdicts (Salerno, 2017; Bright & Goodman-Delahunty, 2006)."

    "measured_by": "Emotional evidence eliciting moral emotions",
    "justification": "The article outlines that emotional evidence which elicits moral emotions like anger, disgust, and moral outrage instigates blame validation processes in jurors. These processes include cognitive biases such as skewing the processing of evidence towards prosecution/plaintiff information, perceiving more intentionality, lowering the burden of proof, and perceiving actions as more morally wrong, increasing likelihood of guilty verdicts and harsher punishments."

    "measured_by": "Jury instructions to suppress emotion",
    "justification": "Research demonstrates that telling jurors to suppress their emotions is ineffective and can backfire by intensifying emotions and depleting cognitive resources. For instance, instructions to disregard emotional testimony have been ineffective or even amplified its impact, highlighting the problematic nature of such measures (Edwards & Bryan, 1997; Gross & Levenson, 1993)."

    "measured_by": "Emotional reactions self-reported by factfinders",
    "justification": "The article cites research indicating that judges and jurors report experiencing intense emotional responses and stress when exposed to emotionally disturbing evidence such as gruesome photographs. Studies have found that substantial percentages of jurors and judges meet diagnostic criteria for conditions like PTSD following exposure to such evidence (Lonergan et al., 2016; Jaffe et al., 2003)."
