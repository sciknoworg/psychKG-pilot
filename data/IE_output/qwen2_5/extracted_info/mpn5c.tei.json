    "topic_or_construct": "Positive skew bias",
    "measured_by": "Skewed Gambling Task",
    "justification": "The study used the Skewed Gambling Task to measure participants' preferences between positively skewed gambles and negatively skewed gambles. This task involves choices between a certain, safe option and an uncertain gamble with different degrees of skewness."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Loss aversion",
    "measured_by": "Gamble acceptance rate",
    "justification": "Loss aversion was assessed indirectly through participants' acceptance rates for different gambles. The analysis found that greater loss aversion correlated with lower acceptance rates for all gambles, regardless of age."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive control",
    "measured_by": "Time pressure manipulation",
    "justification": "Cognitive control was manipulated experimentally by imposing time pressure, with two-second decision windows, which was expected to reduce the engagement of cognitive resources for decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Positive skew bias",
    "measured_by": "Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)",
    "justification": "To ensure cognitive health among older participants, the MoCA was administered. This cognitive assessment indirectly informed whether an individual\u2019s cognitive state might influence their skew bias in the gambling task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Positive skew bias",
    "measured_by": "Short Blessed Test",
    "justification": "The Short Blessed Test was used as a preliminary phone screening to assess the cognitive health of older participants, ensuring their inclusion in the study for accurate measurement of positive skew bias."
