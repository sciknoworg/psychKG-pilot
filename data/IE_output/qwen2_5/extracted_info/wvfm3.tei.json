    "measured_by": "Anchoring effect",
    "justification": "The paper uses the anchoring effect as a tool to increase predictive diversity within crowds by anchoring participants to either extremely low or high values, which resulted in more diverse estimations compared to controls. This increased diversity led to greater collective accuracy despite higher individual errors."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Collective accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Difference between collective error and individual error",
    "justification": "The study measures collective accuracy through reducing collective error via equations introduced by the Diversity Prediction Theorem, while increasing predictive diversity achieved through computational and experimental methods. Collective accuracy is higher despite the rise in mean individual error."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Mean individual error",
    "measured_by": "Survey responses on estimation tasks",
    "justification": "Individual errors were calculated from participants' responses to general knowledge questions such as estimating populations or building heights, with the anchoring effect provoking higher average errors but paradoxically better collective outcomes."
