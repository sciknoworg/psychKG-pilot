    "justification": "The study uses a multi-element episodic decision-making paradigm involving event triplets (activity, clique/social group, location) to assess episodic memory retrieval. By manipulating retrieval demands and measuring performance, the paradigm evaluates the prioritization of social content in episodic memory. This approach allows the assessment of participants\u2019 recall biases and holistic pattern completion mechanisms."

    "topic_or_construct": "social cognition",
    "measured_by": "multi-element episodic decision-making paradigm",
    "justification": "The paradigm incorporates social information (cliques, people) as part of the event triplets in the design, enabling the study of how social content influences episodic memory and decision-making processes. The use of this method demonstrates the impact of social elements on memory retrieval and the cognitive processes associated with them."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "holistic pattern completion",
    "measured_by": "computational model",
    "justification": "The study employs a computational model to simulate the process of holistic pattern completion during episodic memory retrieval. The model considers the influence of social content on the recall process and evaluates whether it leads to enhanced pattern completion, further supporting the notion that social elements provoke more comprehensive recall of other event details."

    "topic_or_construct": "social memory recall bias",
    "measured_by": "2AFC associative memory test",
    "justification": "A two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) associative memory test was administered to participants after the decision-making task to gauge their ability to recall social versus non-social elements. The test's results help evaluate whether participants exhibit a bias towards recalling social information over non-social information."
