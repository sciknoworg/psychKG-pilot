    "topic_or_construct": "Valuation Conflict",
    "measured_by": "Multi-Attribute Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The paper uses the DDM to analyze participants' decisions and response times to test the prediction that the valuation of positive and negative attributes of money varies depending on whether it is considered dirty or clean. This supports the valuation conflict hypothesis (c.f., Study 1 and Study 3 methods and results)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Moral Judgments of Dirty Money",
    "measured_by": "Moral Judgment Task",
    "justification": "Participants in Study 2 judged the blameworthiness of decisions to take dirty money for personal profit versus donating it to charity. The task used a 0 to 100 scale to measure their blame judgments, providing insight into how the destination of money affects moral judgments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Prosociability as a Default",
    "measured_by": "Drift-Diffusion Model Parameter z",
    "justification": "The paper uses the starting point parameter z in the DDM to test whether there's a prosocial default, i.e., an a priori bias towards avoiding dirty money irrespective of its attributes. Model comparisons in Study 1 failed to support this theory."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value Integration",
    "measured_by": "DDM Drift Rate v",
    "justification": "The drift rate parameter v in the DDM captures the rate of value accumulation toward one of two options, representing the processing of attributes (money and harm) in choices about dirty vs. clean money. The paper demonstrates that this parameter is influenced by the source and destination of money."
