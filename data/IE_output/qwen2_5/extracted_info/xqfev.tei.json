    "justification": "The paper states that participants completed the 20-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) questionnaire, which is one of the most commonly used measures of alexithymia due to its strong psychometric properties. It assesses three facets of alexithymia: difficulty identifying feelings (DIF), difficulty describing feelings (DDF), and externally-oriented thinking (EOT)."
