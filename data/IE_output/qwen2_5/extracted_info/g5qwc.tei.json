    "topic_or_construct": "sense of agency",
    "measured_by": "various behavioral and self-report measures, not explicitly named",
    "justification": "The text discusses the psychological construct of a 'sense of agency' that is associated with higher life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and self-control, but it does not specify a particular measurement instrument. The construct is discussed as a psychological tool for reducing uncertainty, yet the actual scales and tools used for measuring it are not explicitly mentioned."

    "topic_or_construct": "volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA)",
    "measured_by": "not explicitly stated in the provided excerpt",
    "justification": "The paper assesses the human response and adaptation mechanisms related to VUCA but lacks explicit references to specific scales or instruments used to measure these constructs. The discussion revolves around human psychological responses like arousal, stress, and cognitive flexibility which are implied to be indicators of how people handle VUCA situations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "predictive processing abilities",
    "measured_by": "assumed to be measured through neuroscientific methods",
    "justification": "The discussion of predictive processing is informed by neuroscience research which might involve neuroimaging or other neuroscientific techniques, but specific instruments or scales are not mentioned within the excerpt. Predictive processing is theorized to be central to how the brain minimizes prediction errors and adapts."
