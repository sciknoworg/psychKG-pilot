    "measured_by": "6-item measure assessing importance of increasing healthy behaviors",
    "justification": "The paper states that 'Our main outcome variable, perceived importance of change, was assessed using 6 items for each of the three behaviors,' such as 'I should try to get more sleep overall,' and participants responded on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). This supports the use of a structured 6-item measure to evaluate the perceived importance of changing behaviors."

    "topic_or_construct": "Absolute Behavior Frequency",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported behavior estimates",
    "justification": "The paper mentions 'A common-rule self-estimate question measured absolute behavior frequency. For sleep, the question was 'How many [hours of sleep] do you get per [night]?' This measure allows participants to report their actual behavior frequency directly."

    "topic_or_construct": "Global Comparison",
    "measured_by": "Direct comparison questions against an average standard",
    "justification": "For global comparisons, the study used the question 'Think about an average person your age and gender. How much sleep do you typically get compared to the average person?' This demonstrates the instrument used to measure how participants compare their behavior to a global average."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Local Comparison",
    "measured_by": "Direct comparison questions against a specific peer",
    "justification": "The study presented direct local comparison questions like 'Think about your close peers (people you see or hang out with often). How much sleep do you typically get compared to your close peers?' These questions show the scale used to measure local comparisons."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Expert Comparison",
    "measured_by": "Direct comparison against expert recommendations",
    "justification": "The paper notes participants were asked, 'Think about the amount of sleep that experts recommend. How much sleep do you typically get compared to what experts recommend?' This question measures participants' comparison of their behavior against expert recommendations."
