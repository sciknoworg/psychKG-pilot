    "measured_by": "Direction of moving dots task",
    "justification": "Studies found that perceptual decision-making paradigms, such as differentiating the direction of moving dots in the absence of feedback, were used to measure perceptual decision-making abilities in autistic participants and comparison groups."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reward-based learning",
    "measured_by": "Iowa Gambling Task (IGT)",
    "justification": "Several studies utilized the Iowa Gambling Task to investigate reward-based learning in participants with autism and comparison groups, demonstrating differences and similarities in how they made decisions based on reward contingencies."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognition",
    "measured_by": "Confidence judgments",
    "justification": "Metacognition was measured by assessing participants' ability to monitor their behavior with subjective assessments like self-reported confidence. Studies compared autistic and non-autistic participants on their metacognitive ability in evaluating decisions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value-based decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Discounting tasks",
    "justification": "Value-based decision-making, specifically temporal discounting tasks, were used to evaluate how autistic and comparison participants make decisions involving monetary rewards and aversive delays, revealing differences in decision-making preferences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Ultimatum Game",
    "justification": "The ultimatum game was used to study social decision-making in autistic individuals. It revealed differences in how autistic individuals make offers and react to offers compared to neurotypical participants."
