    "justification": "The article states that cognitive control was assessed using a gamified smartphone-based working memory task, which involves remembering positions of red circles presented in a grid, indicating that this task measures working memory."

    "topic_or_construct": "inhibition",
    "measured_by": "response inhibition task (gamified smartphone-based)",
    "justification": "The inhibition task, where participants must collect fruit only when it is not rotten, is used to assess cognitive control. This indicates that particular attention is being paid to inhibition as a component of cognitive control."

    "topic_or_construct": "risk-taking",
    "measured_by": "risk-taking task (gamified smartphone-based)",
    "justification": "The risk-taking task, which involves choosing between a certain outcome and a gamble, was employed to measure risk-taking behavior, as fluctuations in risk-taking in mixed trials were hypothesized to predict subsequent drinking."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "information sampling",
    "measured_by": "information sampling task (gamified smartphone-based)",
    "justification": "The information sampling task, which requires participants to choose the row with the largest sum of card values by turning over individually presented cards, was used to gauge individuals' decision-making processes related to information seeking."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive control",
    "measured_by": "response inhibition and working memory tasks",
    "justification": "Cognitive control is studied via tasks focusing on inhibition and working memory. The response inhibition task examines participants' ability to stop preplanned actions, while the working memory task evaluates memory functions as components of cognitive control."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "working memory capacity (WMC)",
    "measured_by": "working memory task (gamified smartphone-based)",
    "justification": "Working memory capacity (WMC) was determined using the working memory task, where it was hypothesized that higher WMC could serve as a protective factor against the influence of risky decision-making on subsequent drinking behavior."
