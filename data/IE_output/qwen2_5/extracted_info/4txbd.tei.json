    "topic_or_construct": "Choice revaluation",
    "measured_by": "Subjective value ratings",
    "justification": "The paper discusses choice revaluation, which is measured through subjective value ratings of conditioned stimuli (CS). Participants rate the subjective value of the CS at the end of each block, directly assessing the effect of choices on value perception (see the 'Experimental procedures' section)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice confidence",
    "measured_by": "6-point confidence scale",
    "justification": "Choice confidence is measured using a 6-point discrete scale where participants indicate their certainty in their choice, with 0 corresponding to 'guessing' and 5 to '100% sure about the choice', as described in the 'Experimental design' section."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice-induced preference change",
    "measured_by": "Choices in the probe phase",
    "justification": "The effects of choices on preferences are measured through participants\u2019 choices in the probe phase where they select between equally rewarding CS. This choice behavior indicates if the previous choices have influenced their preferences (see the 'Confirmatory planned analysis 2' section)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive dissonance",
    "measured_by": "Computational models incorporating dissonance resolution",
    "justification": "The cognitive dissonance hypothesis is examined with computational models where confidence (as normalized value difference) negatively modulates choice revaluation, reflecting the dissonance resolution process (see 'Computational modeling' section)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence learning",
    "measured_by": "Computational models with confidence-based reinforcement",
    "justification": "The confidence learning hypothesis is tested using models where higher confidence is associated with greater choice revaluation effects, reflecting confidence as an internally-generated reinforcement signal (see 'Computational modeling' section)."
