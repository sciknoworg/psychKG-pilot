    "measured_by": "Oxford Utilitarianism Scale (OUS)",
    "justification": "The Oxford Utilitarianism Scale (OUS) consists of two sub-scales: Instrumental Harm (OUS-IH) and Impartial Beneficence (OUS-IB), which aim to measure individual differences in proto-utilitarian moral tendencies. It captures the endorsement of the impartial maximization of the greater good and the willingness to cause harm in order to bring about the greater good, aligning with key dimensions of utilitarianism."

    "topic_or_construct": "Pro-sacrificial judgments",
    "measured_by": "Sacrificial dilemmas",
    "justification": "Sacrificial dilemmas, such as the trolley problem, are used to assess individuals' willingness to endorse the sacrifice of some individuals to save a greater number. These dilemmas tap into the psychological underpinnings of instrumental harm, which is one key aspect of utilitarian moral psychology, despite limitations in generalizability to other aspects of utilitarianism."

    "topic_or_construct": "Dual Process Model (DPM)",
    "measured_by": "Process Dissociation (PD) technique",
    "justification": "Process Dissociation is a method used to measure the distinct contributions of deontological (harm-rejection) and utilitarian (outcome-maximizing) tendencies in moral judgments. It allows researchers to dissect the psychological processes underlying sacrificial dilemmas by calculating D-parameters and U-parameters, providing insights into the cognitive underpinnings of moral decisions in the context of DPM."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Impartial Beneficence (IB)",
    "measured_by": "Two-Dimensional (2D) Model",
    "justification": "The 2D Model incorporates a focus on impartial beneficence alongside instrumental harm, offering a nuanced way to measure utilitarian psychology by assessing the endorsement of the impartial promotion of everyone's welfare, which is distinct from sacrificial judgments. This separation helps in understanding the broader implications of utilitarian decision-making beyond sacrificial dilemmas."
