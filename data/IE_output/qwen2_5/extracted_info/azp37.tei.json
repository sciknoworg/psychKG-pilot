    "measured_by": "proportion of risky choices in final 3 blocks",
    "justification": "The study measures participants' risk preferences by the proportion of risky choices made in the final 3 blocks after they have had the opportunity to learn from past experience. This method directly assesses how participants weigh rare events in their decision-making process."

    "topic_or_construct": "underweighting of rare events",
    "measured_by": "computer-based decision task with visual door choices",
    "justification": "The underweighting of rare events was studied using a computer-based task where participants chose between a fixed option and a risky option involving rare outcomes. The task's design, with visual cues and feedback, allowed researchers to quantify how rare events were underweighted in participants' choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "overweighting of extreme outcomes",
    "measured_by": "simulation model (Sample + Boost)",
    "justification": "The study employed a simulation model that includes a 'boost' for the probability of including extreme outcomes in the sample, demonstrating that participants' risk preferences can be better accounted for by actively favoring these extreme events. This model captures the cognitive process of overweighting extreme outcomes in decisions."
