    "topic_or_construct": "Anti-social motives",
    "measured_by": "Dominant choice situations in the decision-from-experience task",
    "justification": "The introductory section states that participants classified as anti-social consistently chose lower EV options for others when presented with dominant choice situations in an experience-based task. This demonstrates their anti-social behavior in risk-taking decisions for others."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Pro-social motives",
    "measured_by": "Dominant choice situations in the decision-from-experience task",
    "justification": "Participants classified as prosocial individuals selected higher EV options more frequently for others in dominant choice situations. This evidenced their prosocial inclinations within the social environment of the study."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk preferences for others",
    "measured_by": "Decisions from Experience (DfE) design",
    "justification": "The study employed a DfE design where participants made risky choices for themselves and others by sampling from different options. This setup was used to observe and measure differences in risk preferences between self and others under uncertainty."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social Value Orientation (SVO)",
    "measured_by": "SVO Slider questionnaire",
    "justification": "Both experiments utilized the SVO Slider questionnaire, which provided a continuous measure of prosociality (SVO angle) and a discrete classification of participants into competitive, selfish, prosocial, or altruistic based on their responses to mini-dictator games."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Inequity Aversion",
    "measured_by": "Comparison of choices in equal vs. unequal choice situations (Experiment 1 and 2)",
    "justification": "The supplementary results sections explain how first- and second-order inequity aversion were examined by comparing choice behavior when the decision-maker and another participant had the same vs. different choice options. This setup allowed for measuring inequity aversion in an experimental context."
