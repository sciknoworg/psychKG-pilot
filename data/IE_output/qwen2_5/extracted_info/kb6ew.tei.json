    "measured_by": "Additive Heuristic Model",
    "justification": "The Additive Heuristic Model parameterizes the extent to which choices reflect a heuristic reliance on probability information by computing a Choice Probability Weight parameter. This is supported by the text stating that the model captures individual differences in reliance on probability versus reward information (Fig. 2c)."

    "measured_by": "Additive Heuristic Model",
    "justification": "The Additive Heuristic Model also parameterizes the use of reward information in decision making through the Choice Reward Weight parameter. The model shows that individuals vary in their reliance on reward information, which is reflected in their choice behavior (Fig. 2c)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Heuristic Use of Reward Information",
    "measured_by": "Perceptual Detection Task",
    "justification": "The perceptual detection task measures a tendency to represent outcome stimuli based on their absolute reward by observing faster responses when higher absolute reward outcome stimuli are the probed stimulus. This conceptual replication supports the relationship between heuristic reliance on reward information and its neural representation (Fig. 6)."

    "measured_by": "Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Decoding",
    "justification": "MEG decoding was used to determine the relationship between neural activity and the preferential representation of higher probability gamble outcomes. Participants who relied more on probability information in their choices showed greater neural reactivation of these outcomes (Fig. 4)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Behavioral Impulsivity",
    "measured_by": "Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS)",
    "justification": "The Barratt Impulsivity Scale was used to measure behavioral impulsivity, which was related to a lesser reactivation of higher probability outcomes in individuals. This suggests that impulsive behavior is linked to differential neural processing during decision-making tasks (Fig. 7)."
