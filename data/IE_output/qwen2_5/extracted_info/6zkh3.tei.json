    "topic_or_construct": "learning performance",
    "measured_by": "total points sum score",
    "justification": "The study measured overall learning performance by calculating a summation of points across different types of responses (correct hits, false alarms, and misses) during the learning task. Higher scores indicated more optimal performance, including more correct hits on reward trials and fewer false alarms on punishment trials."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive learning processes (value-updating)",
    "measured_by": "computational RL model parameters (learning rates)",
    "justification": "The researchers used a computational reinforcement learning model to estimate learning rates from the task data. The learning rates, which reflect the speed of value updating based on rewards and punishments, were modeled for both non-emotional and socioemotionally-salient task conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision-making strategies",
    "measured_by": "inverse temperature parameter",
    "justification": "The inverse temperature parameter derived from the computational RL model captured the balance between exploration and exploitation in decision-making. Higher inverse temperatures indicated a stronger tendency toward exploitative strategies, reflecting a greater reliance on higher-valued options."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "psychophysiological engagement",
    "measured_by": "cardiac complexity (alpha scores)",
    "justification": "Temporal cardiac organization and complexity were quantified using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to derive alpha scores from inter-beat interval (IBI) time-series data. This measure reflected the dynamic real-time organization of the autonomic system during the learning task."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "affectively salient learning",
    "measured_by": "learning task with socioemotionally salient stimuli",
    "justification": "The study used an adapted learning task with emotionally valenced stimuli (IAPS images) to assess how socioemotionally salient contexts influenced learning performance, cognitive processes (like learning rates), and psychophysiological engagement in contrast to a non-emotional version of the task."
