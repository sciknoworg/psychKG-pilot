    "justification": "The study used the CRT to measure analytical reasoning as participants high in analytical reasoning were better at detecting fake news. This is supported by the statement: 'According to the Naturalistic Decision Making framework [...], in fast-paced complex settings, decision makers mostly rely on past experiences to find the first workable option rather than trying to find the best possible solution, which requires analytical reasoning and is resource-intensive.'"

    "measured_by": "ratings on a scale from 1 to 10",
    "justification": "To assess news source credibility, participants were asked to rate credibility on a scale, as described: 'Participants were asked to indicate the level of credibility (How credible is this news source?) on a scale from 1 = Not at all credible to 10 = Completely credible for 10 commonly known news organizations.' This was used to identify the impact of credibility on news evaluation."

    "topic_or_construct": "perceived credibility",
    "measured_by": "rating scale (1 to 10)",
    "justification": "The perceived credibility of news was measured using a scale where participants rated how credible they found each news article, as noted: 'perceived credibility (How credible do you find this news article?; response option: 1 (Not at all credible) to 10 (Completely credible)).' This suggests higher analytical reasoning was linked with lower perceived credibility for fake news."
