    "justification": "The article describes using choice trials where participants choose between two delayed and probabilistic prospects to measure subjective value. This method allows participants to express their preferences between options based on attributes such as payoff, risk, and delay, providing insight into how subjective value is computed in decision-making contexts."

    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective value",
    "measured_by": "Pricing trials",
    "justification": "Pricing trials involve participants assigning a price to individual prospects, either as if they were buying or selling the prospect. The article notes that this method provides a precise, continuous scale variable for measuring subjective value, potentially capturing more detailed preference information compared to binary choice tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "Utility function",
    "measured_by": "Power-law utility function (u(x) = x^\u03b1)",
    "justification": "The article uses a power-law utility function to describe the diminishing marginal utility typically observed in subjective value judgments. This function relates increasing payoffs to their subjective utility, with typical values of \u03b1 < 1 yielding a concave function."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Delay discounting",
    "measured_by": "Hyperbolic discounting model (v(t) = 1 / (1 + k * t))",
    "justification": "The hyperbolic discounting model is used to quantify how the value of outcomes decreases with increasing delay. The article notes that delays tend to decrease the value of positive outcomes while often increasing the value of negative outcomes, due to delaying or avoiding losses."

    "topic_or_construct": "Probability weighting function",
    "measured_by": "Inverse s-shaped probability weighting function (w(p) = e^(\u2212(\u2212 ln(p))^b))",
    "justification": "This function is used to describe how subjective probabilities differ from actual probabilities. The article refers to the subjective weight assigned to outcomes, where low probabilities are perceived as more likely, and high probabilities as less likely when b < 1, consistent with prospect theory."
