    "justification": "The study evaluated the performance of various risky choice models using a set of 19 experimental datasets that involved binary choice between monetary gambles with detailed payoffs and probabilities. These datasets were screened for specific criteria such as individual-level choice data with at least 50 choice problems per participant and binary choice involving explicit probabilities and payoffs."

    "measured_by": "log-loss, Brier score, and prediction error",
    "justification": "The predictive performance of the models was evaluated using three different loss functions: log-loss, Brier score, and prediction error. These measures were applied to assess how well the models predicted risky choices out-of-sample, tweaking the balance between bias and variance."

    "topic_or_construct": "psychological mechanisms in risky choice models",
    "measured_by": "model parameters and performance based on assumed mechanisms",
    "justification": "The models were categorized based on the psychological mechanisms they assumed, such as payoff transformation, probability transformation, attention, etc. The contribution of these mechanisms to predictive performance was assessed by analyzing the model's parameters and their performance with and without certain mechanisms."

    "topic_or_construct": "historical evolution of risky choice modeling",
    "measured_by": "analysis of models formulated between 1950 and 2018",
    "justification": "To track the historical trend of risky choice models, the study evaluated models formulated from 1950 to 2018, using a comprehensive test-bed of datasets. The results illustrated the predictive performance and relative importance of specific models and psychological mechanisms over time."
