    "justification": "The article uses the matrices task as a measure of dishonesty. Participants are instructed to find two numbers adding up to exactly 10 in a given table and self-report finding the solution. Over-reporting the ability to find solutions is taken as a measure of dishonesty."

    "measured_by": "Composite score of Rule Orientation, Perceived Obligation to Obey the Law, General Neutralization Acceptance, and Mechanisms of Moral Disengagement scales",
    "justification": "The follow-up study employs various scales measuring adherence to rules and lawfulness to create a composite 'lawfulness' score. These scales include the Rule Orientation, Perceived Obligation to Obey the Law (POOL), General Neutralization Acceptance, and Mechanisms of Moral Disengagement."

    "measured_by": "Pledge conditions in the matrices task",
    "justification": "The matrices task is used under different pledge conditions (no pledge, pledge once, pledge repeat) to measure the effect of ex-ante pledges on ethical behavior and dishonest reporting."

    "measured_by": "Sequential task in matrices",
    "justification": "The matrices task is used in a sequential manner to test if the effect of honesty pledges decays over the duration of the task, analyzing differences in reported performance across problems."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cheating extent",
    "measured_by": "Percent of problems participants claimed to solve correctly",
    "justification": "The matrices task results are used to examine the extent of cheating, categorizing participants based on percentages of problems reported as correctly solved, to identify 'high extent cheaters.'"
