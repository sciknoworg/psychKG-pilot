    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive effort",
    "measured_by": "N-back working memory task",
    "justification": "The article mentions that the 'N-back task imposes increasing demands upon executive functions like selective attention, monitoring, and updating... and is perceived as effortful, with self-reported effort increasing systematically with increasing N.' The authors used this task to manipulate and measure different levels of cognitive effort."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "physical pain",
    "measured_by": "thermal stimuli calibrated using TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer",
    "justification": "The article explains that thermal stimuli were applied to participants' left forearms, calibrated to elicit various reported pain intensities. This was used to measure and control for subjective differences in pain perception, enabling a direct comparison with cognitive effort."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "need for cognition",
    "measured_by": "Need for Cognition Scale",
    "justification": "The article refers to the Need for Cognition Scale as a questionnaire administered to participants to measure their propensity to engage in cognitive activities. Individuals higher in Need for Cognition perceived cognitive effort as less unpleasant."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "pain catastrophizing",
    "measured_by": "Pain Catastrophizing Scale",
    "justification": "Participants completed the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, which measures the tendency to magnify pain-related experiences. Higher scores on this scale were associated with a greater willingness to exert cognitive effort to avoid pain."
