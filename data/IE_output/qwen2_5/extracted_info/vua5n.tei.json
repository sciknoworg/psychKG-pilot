    "justification": "The article discusses strengthening perceived risk to increase tax compliance, supported by data from thematic analysis of interviews and design of intervention e-mails. The interviews identified themes like 'Not paying pays off' and 'Not paying is the norm,' which suggested a low perceived risk of getting caught."

    "justification": "The study mentions weakening descriptive norms as a key intervention target, achieved by stating that 92% of employees receive salaries with taxes deducted. This message was included in the intervention e-mails suggesting that non-compliance is an outlier."

    "measured_by": "E-mails altering the perception of tax authority",
    "justification": "To change the adversarial perception of the tax authority, the e-mails were designed to emphasize the collaborative role of taxes in funding public services.
