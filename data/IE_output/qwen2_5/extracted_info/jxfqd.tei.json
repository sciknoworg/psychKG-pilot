    "measured_by": "Drift Diffusion Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The DDM was applied to analyze trial-by-trial choice and response time data from the N-back task, providing parameters that describe the rate of evidence accumulation, speed-accuracy tradeoff, and other cognitive processes involved in decision-making."

    "justification": "The NIH Toolbox is mentioned as a test battery comprising tasks that measure various cognitive functions, with its first principal component used as a proxy for general cognitive ability in the study."

    "topic_or_construct": "Latent cognitive processes",
    "measured_by": "Computational parameters from DDM",
    "justification": "The computational parameters derived from the DDM were used to estimate individual differences in cognitive processes such as evidence accumulation and speed-accuracy tradeoff."
