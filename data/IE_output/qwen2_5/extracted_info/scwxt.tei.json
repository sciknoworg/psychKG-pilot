    "justification": "The paper states that reappraisal use was assessed using two items from the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire: 'When I want to experience more positive emotions, I alter the way I'm thinking about the situation' and 'When I want to reduce negative emotions, I change my perspective on the situation.' These items directly measure the cognitive reappraisal construct."
