    "measured_by": "Willingness to work task",
    "justification": "The willingness to work task measured participants' willingness to expend cognitive effort for rewards by presenting them with choices involving different levels of cognitive difficulty and reward size. The task quantified how strongly rewards were discounted as a function of the cognitive effort required, reflecting participants' preference for certain types of rewards."

    "justification": "The go-no-go task was used to assess the impact of reward type on cognitive control by measuring performance on trials where participants had to respond correctly under different reward conditions. It showed that adults performed better on go trials when rewarded with secondary rewards compared to primary rewards, indicating the invigorating effect of secondary rewards on cognitive control."
