    "measured_by": "simple diffusion model",
    "justification": "The study applied the simple diffusion model to estimate cognitive constructs such as drift rate, decision threshold, and non-decision time, finding no significant differences in these parameters between correction allowed and no correction conditions. This supports the use of this model for assessing the impact of corrective instructions on initial decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "no correction",
    "measured_by": "simple diffusion model",
    "justification": "The simple diffusion model was used to evaluate decision-making processes in conditions where participants were not allowed to correct their responses, demonstrating consistency in cognitive constructs such as drift rate, threshold, and non-decision time across different instructions."

    "measured_by": "simple diffusion model",
    "justification": "The study included manipulations of speed-accuracy emphasis and found that while decision thresholds were influenced by these manipulations, there was strong evidence against speed-accuracy emphasis affecting drift rate, validating the diffusion model's application in assessing task difficulty under different emphases."

    "justification": "Manipulations of task coherence using dot motion tasks showed effects on drift rate as measured by the diffusion model, indicating the model's utility in capturing different task difficulties."
