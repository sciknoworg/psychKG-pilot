    "measured_by": "Negative Activation Rating Scale (NARS)",
    "justification": "The Negative Activation Rating Scale (NARS) was used to evaluate valenced agentic responses to the task, specifically negative activation as a measure of agentic anger, indicating the presence of negatively valenced agentic emotion along a dimension of intensity. The NARS ratings provided information on internal subjective states relevant to real-world anger."

    "topic_or_construct": "Exuberance",
    "measured_by": "Positive Activation Rating Scale (PARS)",
    "justification": "The Positive Activation Rating Scale (PARS) was utilized to assess the relative absence to the strong presence of positively valenced agentic emotion. The PARS outcomes correlate with other measures of positive affect, providing a rapid and reliable assessment of the valenced agentic response (exuberance)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Trait Agency",
    "measured_by": "Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire Brief Form (MPQ-BF)",
    "justification": "The Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire Brief Form, specifically its social potency subscale, was used to measure trait agency. The MPQ-BF provides an empirical index of trait reward sensitivity and motivation, which correlates with valenced agentic states and their behavioral outcomes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Agentic Circuit Reactivity",
    "measured_by": "fMRI BOLD response with AMP",
    "justification": "Functional MRI measures of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response to d-amphetamine (AMP) were used to evaluate reactivity in the ventral striatum, particularly the nucleus accumbens. This approach provided insight into the neural circuitry underlying agentic anger and exuberance responses."
