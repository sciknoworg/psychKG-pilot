    "justification": "The study used an intertemporal choice task to assess children's prosocial behavior by examining theirchoices to minimize delay, maximize reward, and trade off between these factors in self- and other-benefitting decisions."

    "measured_by": "Hyperbolic function analysis",
    "justification": "The hyperbolic function was used to model children's discounting behavior, as it provided better fit to the data compared to linear and exponential functions, capturing their tradeoffs between delay and reward."

    "justification": "Children's verbal explanations of their decision-making process were coded to determine the factors they considered, such as delays and rewards, during their choices."
