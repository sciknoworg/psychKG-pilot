    "measured_by": "Original wording from Armor et al. (2008)",
    "justification": "The study used the original wording from Armor et al. (2008) to measure prescribed optimism, which led participants to generally prescribe optimism, with a mean significantly above the scale midpoint of 'accurate'. This replicated previous findings."

    "topic_or_construct": "Prescribed optimism",
    "measured_by": "Estimation wording",
    "justification": "When asked with the new estimation wording that focused on likelihood estimation, the participants' answers reflected accuracy or pessimism about equally often. The modal response was optimism (53% of responses) when asked using the original wording, but the answers reflecting optimism were relatively rare (20% of responses) with the new wording."

    "topic_or_construct": "Lay interpretations of 'optimism' and 'pessimism'",
    "measured_by": "Feeling vs Thinking Questionnaire",
    "justification": "Studies 2 and 3 tested whether the emphasis on feeling versus thinking accounted for the change in results between the different wordings. However, it was found that this distinction did not significantly affect the participants' prescriptions, suggesting that the term 'optimism' can hold many potential meanings."

    "topic_or_construct": "Overoptimism",
    "measured_by": "Optimism-Pessimism-Anchored Scales",
    "justification": "Participants generally prescribed a level of optimism that is greater than what objective standards warrant when asked using familiar language of pessimism, accuracy, and optimism. However, when asked about likelihood estimations, they didn't generally prescribe overestimating the likelihood of desirable outcomes, indicating that overoptimism can vary based on the wording of the scale."
