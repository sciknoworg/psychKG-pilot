    "measured_by": "Mouselab Paradigm",
    "justification": "The Mouselab paradigm was used to study heuristics in multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision-making. Participants choose between multiple gambles whose payoffs depend on a random outcome, with the sequence of clicks tracing their decision strategy. The authors applied this paradigm to test their automatic heuristic-discovery method and validate it against human behavior, demonstrating that this task measures the relevant decision-making constructs."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Strategies (TTB, WADD, SAT-TTB, SAT-TTB+)",
    "measured_by": "K-Means Clustering Algorithm",
    "justification": "K-means clustering was used to identify distinct decision strategies from sequences of clicks in the Mouselab task. Centroids were classified into known heuristics like Take-The-Best (TTB) and Weighted-Additive (WADD), along with newly discovered strategies such as SAT-TTB and SAT-TTB+. This method operationalized the construct of decision strategies in a data-driven way."

    "topic_or_construct": "Information Gathering Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Number of Clicks",
    "justification": "The number of clicks made by participants to reveal payoff information in the Mouselab paradigm served as a direct measure of information gathering behavior. This metric was compared between experimental conditions and against model predictions to assess adaptivity and rationality in information processing."

    "topic_or_construct": "Performance",
    "measured_by": "Relative Reward Earned",
    "justification": "Performance was measured as the relative reward earned on each trial compared to the optimal reward with perfect information, excluding the cost of clicks. This metric allowed for a comparison of human performance to the normative standard set by the resource-rational model across various environmental conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Adaptive Strategy Selection",
    "measured_by": "Strategies Used Across Different Environments",
    "justification": "The frequency of different decision strategies (TTB, WADD, SAT-TTB, SAT-TTB+) used by participants across varied environmental parameters (stakes, dispersion, cost) was measured. This demonstrated how participants adapt their strategies to align with resource-rational predictions."
