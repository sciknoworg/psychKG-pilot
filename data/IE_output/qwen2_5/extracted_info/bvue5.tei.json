    "justification": "The study manipulated decision-making contexts to observe how reference-dependent behavior affects choices, indicating that outcomes are evaluated relative to contextual reference points, as seen in choices in the loss-avoidance context."

    "measured_by": "Behavioral task with magnitude manipulation",
    "justification": "The manipulation of outcome magnitude revealed how participant sensitivity to different reward magnitudes adapts based on the range of outcomes experienced previously, demonstrating range-adaptation in human learning."

    "topic_or_construct": "Outcome value normalization",
    "measured_by": "HYBRID model comparison",
    "justification": "The HYBRID model, combining both absolute and relative value learning, best explained the empirical data, indicating participants' choices reflect a balance between absolute and normalized values influenced by context."

    "topic_or_construct": "Context-dependent valuation",
    "measured_by": "Observations during learning vs. transfer phases",
    "justification": "Context-dependent valuation was inferred through analysis of choices in both the learning and transfer phases, revealing that subjects prefer options more highly when they are consistent with their context-specific valuations, as seen in performance differences across the two phases."
