    "measured_by": "Inclusion of Other in the Self scale",
    "justification": "The Topical Social Survey was used to prime and establish participants' in- and outgroup partisan identity. The 'Inclusion of Other in the Self' scale was administered to measure how strongly participants identified with their ingroup and outgroup, providing a measure of partisan group identity."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social information search",
    "measured_by": "Gambling Task and Election Prediction Task",
    "justification": "Social information search was measured using the Gambling Task in Study 1 and the Election Prediction Task in Studies 2, 3, and 4. Participants were given the option to search the decisions of previous participants, allowing researchers to quantify the amount and extent of social information search initiated by participants."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Confidence ratings in Election Prediction Tasks",
    "justification": "Uncertainty was measured by participants' confidence ratings on an 11-point scale in the Election Prediction Task. Lower confidence levels were used as an indicator of higher uncertainty, allowing the researchers to explore the relationship between uncertainty and social information search and use."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social information use",
    "measured_by": "Adjustment in predictions post-social information",
    "justification": "Social information use was calculated as the adjustment from participants' first predictions to their second predictions after observing social information. This provided a measure of how participants integrated social information into their decision-making process, especially considering the source (ingroup vs. outgroup)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Ingroup bias",
    "measured_by": "Proportion of in-group and out-group information search",
    "justification": "Ingroup bias in social information search was measured by the proportion of information searched from in-group and out-group sources. Higher proportions of in-group searches relative to out-group searches indicated stronger ingroup bias in social information search."
