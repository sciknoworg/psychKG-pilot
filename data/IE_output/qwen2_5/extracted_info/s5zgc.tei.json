    "justification": "The article describes using an experimental paradigm based on a medical diagnosis scenario where participants collect and weigh evidence from blood tests to diagnose patients with one of two diseases, effectively measuring deferred decision making processes."

    "measured_by": "Time-Variant Sequential Sampling Model (tvSSM)",
    "justification": "The study employs the tvSSM to model how participants accumulate evidence and decide when to stop sampling, with a key feature being time-variant decreasing decision thresholds, which better explains participants\u2019 behavior compared to static threshold models."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk and Cost Sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Sampling Behavior Data",
    "justification": "Participants' sampling behavior under different risk and cost conditions are used as a measure of their sensitivity to risk and cost, revealing that they adapt their decision-making strategies based on these factors."

    "topic_or_construct": "Belief Updating",
    "measured_by": "Belief Updating Tasks",
    "justification": "The paper references classic belief updating tasks where participants collect probabilistic information to form and update beliefs about competing hypotheses, which are used to illustrate common biases and suboptimal behaviors that also underlie deferred decision making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Sequential Sampling Processes",
    "measured_by": "Sequential Sampling Models (SSMs)",
    "justification": "SSMs are used to model the cognitive processes involving repeated sampling of information leading to a choice, comparing static versus time-variant thresholds, and incorporating the option to defer a decision in response to accumulating evidence."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Models of Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Models",
    "justification": "Various cognitive models, such as the Constant Threshold Model, Error Cost Stopping Rule, and Baseline Model, are tested against empirical data to evaluate which aspects of human decision making they can best describe."
