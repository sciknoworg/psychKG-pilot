    "topic_or_construct": "creative cognition",
    "measured_by": "value-based decision-making processes",
    "justification": "The article posits that creative cognition can be understood through value-based decision-making processes where ideas are assigned values based on attributes like novelty and usefulness, similar to how value computations occur during decision making in other contexts."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "exploitation and exploration trade-offs in creative cognition",
    "measured_by": "phasic and tonic locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) modes",
    "justification": "The framework suggests that transitions between exploitation and exploration during creative processes are mediated by fluctuations in phasic and tonic LC-NE activity, highlighting the use of pupil diameter as a proxy measure for these norepinephrine modes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "neural valuation processes",
    "measured_by": "functional MRI (fMRI)",
    "justification": "The article cites fMRI studies demonstrating that neural activity in brain regions like the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) correlates with the subjective value of creative ideas, indicating these regions' role in valuation during creative cognition."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "creative thinking tasks (e.g., divergent thinking)",
    "measured_by": "behavioral measures of task performance and strategy use",
    "justification": "The framework recommends using behavioral metrics such as fluency, originality, and switching to a different strategy or solution approach to investigate exploitative and exploratory processes in creative cognition, as these measures can reveal underlying neural mechanisms."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "individual differences in creativity",
    "measured_by": "questionnaire-based measures like the Creative Achievement Questionnaire (CAQ)",
    "justification": "The article highlights the use of self-report questionnaires like the CAQ to measure individual differences in creative achievement, providing a link between real-world creative outcomes and the neurobiological mechanisms discussed."
