    "measured_by": "Apathy Evaluation Scale (Marin et al., 1991) and Apathy Motivation Index (Ang et al., 2017)",
    "justification": "The trait apathy was assessed using a confirmatory factor analysis combining relevant questionnaire scores including the Apathy Evaluation Scale and Apathy Motivation Index, showing that trait apathy was negatively related to state motivation."

    "topic_or_construct": "reward sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Hierarchical generative model",
    "justification": "The computational model showed that state motivation was positively associated with reward sensitivity, meaning that when participants felt more motivated, rewards were perceived as more valuable, leading to changes in their choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "effort sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Hierarchical generative model",
    "justification": "The model was used to test if the coupling between states and choices was driven by fluctuations in effort sensitivity, but it was found that effort sensitivity did not show meaningful associations within the context of the study."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "effort-based decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Effort-based choice task (adapted for smartphone use)",
    "justification": "Participants played a gamified reward-effort discounting task on their smartphones, choosing between routes with varying rewards and effort requirements, which assessed their willingness to exert effort for potential rewards."
