    "justification": "The article discusses using affect ratings as a measure of the subjective value of nonmonetary outcomes, suggesting that these ratings better capture people's preferences in nonmonetary choices compared to monetary equivalents. A sentence from the text supports this: 'An affect rating can be obtained by asking: \"On a scale from 1 (= not at all) to 10 (= extremely), how upset would you be if you experienced insomnia as a side effect of a medication?\"'"

    "justification": "The paper proposes a specific modification to the probability weighting function of CPT that incorporates the maximum amount of affect triggered by a choice problem. This is done through equations defining new parameters \u03b3a and \u03b4a, which depend on the maximum affect. The text explains: 'In a choice problem i in which the maximum absolute affect is a max i, the affective curvature \u03b3 a i of the probability weighting function is given by \u03b3 a i = \u03b3 a max i A'"

    "justification": "The study argues that the subjective value of nonmonetary outcomes should be measured by affective ratings rather than monetary equivalents. It is stated that 'measures of valuation by feeling, such as affect ratings, may be more appropriate than monetary equivalents for estimating the subjective value of nonmonetary outcomes.' This indicates a shift from traditional methods to affect-based valuation."

    "justification": "The eye-tracking experiment measured the time participants spent looking at probability information as a ratio of the total time spent on outcomes and probabilities. This measurement was used to assess the influence of affect on attention. The paper notes: 'First, we tested whether attention to probabilities was lower in the affect-rich than in the affect-poor condition. To that end, we fitted a Bayesian hierarchical beta regression model to the trial-level proportional dwell time on probabilities, including condition as fixed effect and random intercepts and slopes for participants.'"
