    "justification": "The paper describes that for each participant, BFs were calculated using Equation (14) to determine if the cue information was used. Evidence is termed decisive if BF > 10^(1/3) for all guessing parameter values of alpha. Recovery results clearly show cue usage."

    "measured_by": "BF calculation",
    "justification": "The researchers tested BFs for p-frames that include any gender information for each participant. They found very strong evidence (BF \u2264 10^(-2)) that gender information was not used by 99% of the participants, showing decisive support for absences of its use."

    "justification": "The simulation results and real-world data analysis employed Bayesian models and p-frames to assess if specific cues or gender biases shaped participants\u2019 decisions. Interpretation of these analyses confirmed usage/non-usage of given information types."
