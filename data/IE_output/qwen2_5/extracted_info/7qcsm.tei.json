    "measured_by": "Emotion Regulation Task with International Affective Picture System (IAPS)",
    "justification": "The Emotion Regulation Task utilized the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) with watch and rethink conditions to measure participants' ability to regulate their emotional response to neutral, general negative, and BC-related negative pictures. The task quantifies emotional reactivity and regulation through self-reports and neural responses."

    "topic_or_construct": "anxiety related to cancer recurrence",
    "measured_by": "self-reported emotional reactivity using the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and breast cancer-related images",
    "justification": "Self-reported emotional reactivity to IAPS and BC-related images demonstrated that BC patients had higher reactivity than controls, particularly to BC-related pictures, indicating greater anxiety about cancer recurrence. These self-reports corroborated with the fMRI findings showing greater neural reactivity in key brain regions."

    "topic_or_construct": "use of cognitive reappraisal",
    "measured_by": "Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)",
    "justification": "The study examined trait emotion regulation using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), which showed that BMX recipients reported less use of cognitive reappraisal compared to non-BMX recipients, indicating a potential link between this regulation strategy and treatment choice."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "emotional reactivity to BC-related content",
    "measured_by": "fMRI neural activation patterns during the Emotion Regulation Task",
    "justification": "fMRI data revealed that BC patients showed greater activation in the Default Mode Network (DMN) regions, such as the vmPFC, PCC, and precuneus, when viewing BC-related images, indicating stronger emotional reactivity at the neural level compared to healthy controls."
