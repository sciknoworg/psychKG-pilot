    "justification": "The study designed a novel multi-task environment with nine different image categorization tasks. The paradigm varied the cue-target interval (CTI) and introduced the possibility of task transformations, allowing researchers to test participants' ability to dynamically update their task preparation. This setup demonstrates how the custom task switching paradigm was used to measure cognitive flexibility and response adjustment in anticipation of task uncertainty."

    "measured_by": "Transform and Regular Blocks",
    "justification": "The study employed transform blocks, where a small percentage of trials required task transformations, and regular blocks, which did not have such transformations. Participants' performance differences between these blocks helped reveal how task uncertainty affects cognitive preparation. The interaction between CTI length and block type in reaction times was a key indicator of participants' ability to infer and prepare for potential task changes."

    "measured_by": "Stimulus Type and Task Rule Congruency Measures",
    "justification": "Congruency effects were quantified by measuring how stimulus type and task rules influenced response times and accuracy. The significant main effects and interactions observed in these measures provided evidence of how task modulation affects susceptibility to task-irrelevant information, thus serving as a way to assess the stability of task representations under different conditions of uncertainty."

    "topic_or_construct": "Partial Task Transformation",
    "measured_by": "Rule Transform and Stimulus Transform Paradigms",
    "justification": "Experiments 3 and 4 were specifically designed to test whether participants could modulate their task preparation selectively on one dimension of a task. Using rule transform and stimulus transform paradigms, the experiments demonstrated that participants were able to partially destabilize task representations depending on which dimension was subject to transformation."
