    "measured_by": "Evidence Accumulation Models (EAMs)",
    "justification": "The text explains that EAMs, such as the diffusion model, decompose response time and choice, with the decision threshold parameter reflecting participants' speed-accuracy tradeoff strategy. The paper re-analyzes data sets to infer how urgency emphasis influences thresholds, indicating the models can capture decision threshold changes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Drift rate",
    "measured_by": "Evidence Accumulation Models (EAMs)",
    "justification": "The paper discusses drift rate as an EAM parameter reflecting task difficulty. Analyses show that in some studies, drift rate changes under different urgency instructions, demonstrating EAMs as tools for measuring drift rate."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Non-decision time",
    "measured_by": "Evidence Accumulation Models (EAMs)",
    "justification": "Non-decision time, encompassing perceptual and motor processing, is a key EAM parameter. The paper shows that under urgency emphasis, non-decision time may change in various directions across studies, indicating EAMs assess this construct."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Speed-accuracy tradeoff",
    "measured_by": "Speed and accuracy manipulation instructions",
    "justification": "These experimental manipulations aim to selectively influence decision threshold and related constructs. The paper finds these manipulations yield mixed results across models for parameters like drift rate and non-decision time, highlighting their utility in psychological testing."
