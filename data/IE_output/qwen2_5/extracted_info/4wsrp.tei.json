    "measured_by": "drift-diffusion model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The article states that drift-diffusion models 'allow us to estimate preferences (i.e., values) from both choice and RT data,' suggesting that DDM is used to quantify preferences."

    "measured_by": "DDM parameters",
    "justification": "The drift rate in the DDM is described as reflecting 'how a person perceives the options,' indicating that the drift rate extracted from the DDM serves as a measure of the magnitude of perceived differences between options."

    "measured_by": "DDM parameters",
    "justification": "The article explains that starting points in the DDM 'reflect a decision-maker's predisposition towards one category over the other across choice problems,' which means that starting points within the DDM represent pre-existing biases."

    "topic_or_construct": "attribute latencies",
    "measured_by": "time-varying DDM",
    "justification": "Attribute latencies have been estimated through 'formal modeling of choice and RT distributions using a time-varying DDM,' indicating that this method captures the timing with which different attributes enter into the decision process."

    "measured_by": "gaze-informed DDM models",
    "justification": "Gaze-informed DDM models, such as the attentional DDM (aDDM) and gaze-weighted linear accumulator model (GLAM), assume that fixated information gets more weight in the drift rate than non-fixated information, which emphasizes the role of visual attention in guiding decisions."

    "measured_by": "DDM parameters",
    "justification": "The DDM framework suggests that the starting point and drift rate can be related to System 1 and System 2, respectively, allowing the DDM to assess both intuitive and deliberative processes in decision-making."
