    "topic_or_construct": "Neuroticism",
    "measured_by": "Self-report questionnaires",
    "justification": "The paper describes neuroticism as a personality trait associated with suicidal behavior, measured through self-report methods such as dimensional surveys like those used to assess depression and anxiety disorders. These assessments tap into frequent and intense negative emotions that are key aspects of neuroticism."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Impulsivity",
    "measured_by": "Laboratory tasks (e.g., Go-No Go tasks, Balloon Analog Risk Task)",
    "justification": "The paper highlights that studies using laboratory measures, like the Go-No Go task and the Balloon Analog Risk Task, are often employed to assess impulsivity, though findings are sometimes inconsistent with self-report measures. These tasks aim to capture the tendency towards careless, reward-dependent short-sighted behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Control",
    "measured_by": "Stroop task and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)",
    "justification": "The paper mentions the use of the Stroop task and the WCST as tools to evaluate cognitive control in the context of suicidal behavior. Deficits in these tasks, particularly for suicide attempters, indicate difficulties with cognitive control processes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Learning and Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Iowa Gambling Task (IGT)",
    "justification": "The journal reviews studies utilizing the IGT to examine decision-making abilities in suicide attempters. These studies demonstrate poorer performance, suggesting impaired decision-making in individuals who have attempted suicide, thus linking cognitive processes to suicide-risk behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward Learning/Reversal Learning",
    "measured_by": "Reward/Punishment reversal learning tasks",
    "justification": "The text refers to the use of tasks such as reward/punishment reversal learning to examine learning deficits in older suicide attempters. These tasks aim to understand the cognitive processes involved in adapting behavior based on changing reward contingencies."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Delay Discounting",
    "measured_by": "Delay Discounting tasks",
    "justification": "The study mentions the use of delay discounting tasks to assess preferences for immediate versus delayed rewards, an aspect relevant to impulsivity and suicide in populations like late-life depression and addiction."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward Processing",
    "measured_by": "Neuroimaging studies (e.g., fMRI)",
    "justification": "The paper indicates that functional imaging studies, including those utilizing fMRI to assess brain regions involved in reward processing (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex), have been applied to understand how rewardvaluation is altered in suicidal behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Probabilistic Learning",
    "measured_by": "Three-armed bandit task",
    "justification": "The article describes a study utilizing the three-armed bandit task in patients with depression to evaluate probabilistic learning processes, demonstrating deficits among suicide attempters in terms of reinforcement encoding and value-based choice."
