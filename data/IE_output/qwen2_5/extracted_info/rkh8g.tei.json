    "justification": "The article describes SCRI as capturing the dynamic representation of salience, which evolves over time as visual neurons integrate localization and identification signals. This model utilizes competitive and recurrent interactions to explain the salience representation that FEF neurons generate for visual search tasks."

    "measured_by": "FEF visual neuron spiking activity",
    "justification": "The article discusses how the Frontal Eye Field (FEF) visual neurons' spiking activity generates evidence that guides saccade decisions in visual search tasks. The dynamics of this spiking are modulated by factors like set size and target-distractor similarity."

    "topic_or_construct": "Saccade Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Gated Accumulator Model (GAM)",
    "justification": "GAM is used to accumulate the evidence generated by FEF visual neurons as input for making saccadic eye movements. The GAM model predicts saccade response time distributions based on the spiking activity from FEF visual neurons."

    "measured_by": "Transient localization signal (xi(t)) in SCRI model",
    "justification": "The transient localization signal in the SCRI model reflects the initial response to object presence in a visual field, indicating where objects are located without information on their identity."

    "topic_or_construct": "Identification Signal",
    "measured_by": "Sustained identification signal (zi(t)) in SCRI model",
    "justification": "The identification signal in SCRI provides sustained information about the relevance of objects for a given task, driven by ventral stream visual areas reflecting object features."
