    "measured_by": "relative choice share of the target (RST)",
    "justification": "The study uses the relative choice share of the target (RST) as a standard measure of context effects. RST values help quantify the extent of attraction or repulsion effects observed, explaining how choice behavior is influenced by the presence of decoys in decision tasks."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "repulsion effect",
    "measured_by": "relative choice share of the target (RST)",
    "justification": "The RST values were used to measure the repulsion effect, which is defined in the context of this study as choices where the decoy reduces the probability of choosing the target option, contrary to the attraction effect."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision-making (preferential and perceptual)",
    "measured_by": "eye-tracking patterns (gaze transitions)",
    "justification": "Eye-tracking data and gaze transition patterns were recorded to analyze the way participants compared options and attributes. This allowed researchers to infer the strategies participants employed and their relation to observed choice effects such as repulsion."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision-making strategies",
    "measured_by": "multiattribute linear ballistic accumulator model (MLBA)",
    "justification": "The MLBA model was used to predict both the choices made by participants and their associated response times, aiming for a principled characterization of choice behavior. However, the model struggled with predicting the repulsion effect observed in the data."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "context effects in multi-alternative choice",
    "measured_by": "MLBA model without response times",
    "justification": "The adapted MLBA model, only predicting discrete choices without response times, provided an excellent fit to the data, demonstrating the impact of attribute distance on choice proportions as well as highlighting the difficulties of joint choice-latency prediction."
