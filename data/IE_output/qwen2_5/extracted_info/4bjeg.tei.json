    "justification": "The study used a motion capture camera (Microsoft Kinect V1) to record walking trajectories as subjects walked towards their chosen option, which reflected the underlying decision dynamics."

    "topic_or_construct": "intertemporal choice dynamics",
    "measured_by": "Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ)",
    "justification": "The Monetary Choice Questionnaire (Kirby et al., 1999) was used to assess the intertemporal choice dynamics, comprising part of the 47 trials completed by subjects in both walking and mouse-tracking tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "changes-of-mind during decision making",
    "measured_by": "motor trajectory analysis",
    "justification": "Changes-of-mind were detected and analyzed through the motor trajectories (both walking and mouse cursor movements), revealing the tendency of subjects to change their minds more often in the mouse-tracking task compared to the walking task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "discounting behavior",
    "measured_by": "discounting k-values (area under discounting curve)",
    "justification": "Discounting behavior was quantified by calculating individual k-values using the area under the discounting curve (AUC) based on the staircase trials, which were analyzed using individual subjects' indifference points."
