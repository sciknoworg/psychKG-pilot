    "topic_or_construct": "Choice-induced preference change",
    "measured_by": "Spreading of Alternatives (SoA)",
    "justification": "The article defines the spreading of alternatives (SoA) as a measure of choice-induced preference change, where the difference in subjective value ratings between options increases after a choice compared to before. This is used throughout the paper to assess the impact of choice on preferences."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice consistency",
    "measured_by": "Choice preference ratings",
    "justification": "Choice consistency is measured by comparing pre-choice value ratings (dV1) and post-choice value ratings (dV2), demonstrating that the choice consistency improves if post-choice ratings better predict the actual choices made."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice confidence",
    "measured_by": "Slider scale ratings",
    "justification": "The confidence in each choice is measured using a horizontal slider scale ranging from 'Not at all!' to 'Absolutely!', which directly assesses how certain participants were about their preference decisions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Response time (RT)",
    "measured_by": "Timing measurements in the choice tasks",
    "justification": "The time taken by participants to make a choice between snack options is measured, and a negative relationship between choice ease (measured indirectly by SoA) and RT is expected."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value refinement",
    "measured_by": "Intra-choice ratings (dV*)",
    "justification": "Value refinement during choice deliberation is measured by observing intermediate ratings (dV*) provided by participants simultaneously when making choices, which helps to assess the transient nature of preference change."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Preference reversals",
    "measured_by": "Changes of mind (CoM) analysis",
    "justification": "Preference reversals are identified and measured by changes of mind (CoM) analysis, which examines trials where the final preference is opposite the initial preference, providing insight into the dynamic nature of decision-making."
