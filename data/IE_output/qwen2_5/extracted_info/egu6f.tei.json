    "measured_by": "Type 1 and Type 2 processes",
    "justification": "The article discusses how dual process theories involve Type 1 processes, which are fast, intuitive, and automatic, and Type 2 processes, which are slower, deliberative, and verbal. Both types of processes were considered in the context of paramedic decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Feelings of Rightness",
    "measured_by": "Confidence self-report",
    "justification": "The study measured feelings of rightness by asking participants to indicate their confidence level regarding their impressions. Confidence is described as an alternate representation of a feeling of rightness."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Answer Fluency",
    "measured_by": "Response time for impression",
    "justification": "Answer fluency was quantified as the response time participants needed to make an impression, suggesting that easier-to-process impressions are made more quickly."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Typicality",
    "measured_by": "Self-report on a five-point ordinal scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated how typical a patient was compared with others experiencing the same condition using a five-point scale, directly assessing their subjective representation of typical cues."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Likelihood",
    "measured_by": "Positive likelihood ratio (LR+)",
    "justification": "The vignettes were written to present varying levels of likelihood for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) based on published likelihood ratios, enabling an experimental assessment of likelihood's impact on impressions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Paramedic Intuitive Impression Formation",
    "measured_by": "Experimental vignettes with varying likelihood information",
    "justification": "This construct was assessed through participants' responses after viewing vignettes that simulated the pre-arrival information paramedics typically receive, revealing how likelihood, answer fluency, typicality, and confidence affected their impressions."
