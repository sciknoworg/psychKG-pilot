    "measured_by": "group confidence judgment task",
    "justification": "The group confidence judgment task was introduced to assess how individuals exchange information in group settings, particularly focusing on the influence of background noise on decision-making processes. This task measures communication success by comparing pre- and post-conversation decisions among participants."

    "measured_by": "tangram maze task",
    "justification": "The tangram maze task is utilized as a way to measure successful information exchange through participants' ability to navigate a maze using verbal communication. However, this task is noted to have limitations in assessing naturalistic conversations."

    "topic_or_construct": "successful communication in noise",
    "measured_by": "diapix task",
    "justification": "The diapix task, which involves a spot-the-difference activity, is employed to measure effective communication. However, the task provides unbalanced forms of conversation that may not fully represent natural communication dynamics."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "stay/switch behavior",
    "measured_by": "outcome measures of stay/switch behavior",
    "justification": "Outcome measures of stay/switch behavior specifically analyze the decisions of individuals when another group member disagrees with their initial decision. This measure helps in understanding how confidence levels and noise conditions influence decision-making in group communications."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "convergence in group decisions",
    "measured_by": "group convergence measures",
    "justification": "Group convergence measures are used to evaluate the rate at which prior disagreements turn into agreements after discussions. This is analyzed both at pairwise and group levels under different noise conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "voting strategy in group decision-making",
    "measured_by": "confidence slanting and majority voting strategies",
    "justification": "The analysis of voting strategies in group decision-making involves comparing the prevalence of confidence slanting (influenced by the most confident member) and majority voting (influenced by the most popular prior decision). This measure helps in understanding the impact of noise on decision-making strategies."
