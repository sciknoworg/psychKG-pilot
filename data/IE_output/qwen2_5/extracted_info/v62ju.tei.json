    "topic_or_construct": "Spatial allocation of visual attention",
    "measured_by": "Hierarchical Drift Diffusion Model (HDDM)",
    "justification": "The study utilized a hierarchical drift diffusion model to analyze participant performance, decomposing it into decision-related parameters such as decision threshold, drift rate, and nondecision time, reflecting spatial attention differences between inferior and superior visual fields."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Enhanced attention to inferior visual field",
    "measured_by": "Visual search task",
    "justification": "Participants completed a visual search task with targets presented in both inferior and superior visual fields. The task was designed to assess processing and attentional biases in different visual fields, with particular focus on the inferior versus superior asymmetry."

    "topic_or_construct": "Visual processing differences due to Sign Language (SL) experience",
    "measured_by": "Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer",
    "justification": "Luminance sensitivity was measured using the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer in a related study. The analyzer revealed that hearing signers demonstrated higher luminance sensitivity compared to hearing non-signers, specifically for the inferior visual field between 3 and 15 degrees of eccentricity, indicating effects of SL on visual processing."

    "topic_or_construct": "Impulsivity in deaf populations",
    "measured_by": "Continuous performance tests",
    "justification": "Continuous performance tests, including the Gordon Diagnostic and similar variants, have been employed in previous research to assess impulsive responding in deaf children and adolescents, suggesting these tests are relevant for measuring impulsivity within this demographic."
