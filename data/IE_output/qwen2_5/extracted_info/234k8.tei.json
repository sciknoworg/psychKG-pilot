    "topic_or_construct": "Pedestrian road crossing behavior",
    "measured_by": "Crossing task with specific scenarios",
    "justification": "The study included a road crossing task where participants completed simulated traffic scenarios, observing the vehicle's behavior and deciding whether to cross the road. This task directly measures pedestrian crossing behavior under various vehicle conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Pedestrian estimation of vehicle behavior",
    "measured_by": "Questionnaire with stopping/passing judgments",
    "justification": "In the vehicle behavior estimation task, participants responded to a questionnaire after observing segments of traffic scenarios. The questionnaire assessed whether they judged the vehicle was stopping or maintaining speed, capturing their subjective estimates of vehicle behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Crossing decision timing",
    "measured_by": "Zc (distance when pedestrian starts crossing)",
    "justification": "The distance Zc, measured from pedestrian to vehicle when the pedestrian starts crossing, was used to analyze the timing of pedestrian crossing decisions. This metric allows the study of effects from different vehicle behaviors on pedestrian timing."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived yielding behavior",
    "measured_by": "Staircase judgment method",
    "justification": "The mixed-effects logit regression model incorporating initial speed, initial TTC, and driving behavior was applied to pedestrian estimates. The judgments, such as 'stopping' vs. 'passing,' were used to understand how pedestrians perceived vehicle yielding intentions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Visual cues for vehicle yielding",
    "measured_by": "\u03c4 (ratio of visual angle to its change rate)",
    "justification": "The study correlated the visual cue \u03c4, defined as the ratio of visual angle to its change rate, with pedestrian perceptions of vehicle yielding behavior. This direct measurement links visual cues to how pedestrians interpret vehicle actions."
