    "measured_by": "Gaze-derived entropy (H-gaze) and Pupil diameter (physiological estimate of arousal)",
    "justification": "The article explicitly states that policy uncertainty was assessed using gaze patterns and pupil diameter. Specifically, entropy (H-gaze) based on the proportion of gaze fixations on either side of the outcome boundary was calculated, while pupil diameter indexed physiological arousal linked to learning adjustments."

    "topic_or_construct": "Epistemic Uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Gaze-derived standard deviation (EU-gaze)",
    "justification": "Epistemic uncertainty was quantified by the standard deviation in gaze patterns over the range of potential outcomes, capturing the precision of participants' outcome predictions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Trait Anxiety",
    "measured_by": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI Trait)",
    "justification": "The article mentions that participants were grouped based on their scores from the GAD-7 and STAI Trait scales, utilizing clinically recommended thresholds to distinguish between high and low anxiety groups."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty Sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Gaze patterns and pupil diameter",
    "justification": "The study used gaze patterns and pupil diameter measures to assess fluctuating uncertainty signals. Policy uncertainty was tied to increased shifts in gaze across outcome boundaries, while epistemic uncertainty was linked to greater dispersion of gaze patterns."
