    "topic_or_construct": "Olfactory Performance",
    "measured_by": "Sniffin' Sticks",
    "justification": "The paper describes using the Sniffin' Sticks test to assess olfactory performance by evaluating odor identification, as participants were tested for smell dysfunction with the 16-item cued odor identification subtest of the Sniffin' Sticks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Taste Identification",
    "measured_by": "Taste Sprays",
    "justification": "Taste identification was assessed using taste sprays for sweet, sour, salty, and bitter substances, with the requirement that all participants correctly labeled all four taste qualities, indicating the use of taste sprays for this purpose."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Nasal Obstruction",
    "measured_by": "Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Assessment",
    "justification": "The NOSE assessment was used to screen and exclude participants with severe or extreme nasal obstruction scores, indicating its suitability as a measurement instrument for nasal obstruction symptoms."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Hunger",
    "measured_by": "Visual Analogue Scales (VAS)",
    "justification": "Hunger was measured using VAS, with participants rating their hunger levels on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. This indicates the instrument was used to assess subjective hunger states."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Olfactory Perceptual Deviance Processing",
    "measured_by": "Odour Perception Task",
    "justification": "The study utilized an odour perception task during which participants had to determine whether a target odour dominated in presented mixtures, indicating the use of this task to measure olfactory perceptual deviance processing."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Odour Acceptability and Pleasantness Ratings",
    "measured_by": "Visual Analogue Scales (VAS)",
    "justification": "Participants rated the intensity and pleasantness of odours using VAS from 1 to 5, indicating how these scales were used to measure perceived odour characteristics."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attentional Modulation in Olfaction",
    "measured_by": "Task Instructions",
    "justification": "Instructions were given to participants to focus attention on either food or non-food odours, assessing how attentional modulation affects odour perception and decision-making."
