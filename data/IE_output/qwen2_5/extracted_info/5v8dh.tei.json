    "measured_by": "M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion",
    "justification": "The M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion was used to manipulate perceptual bias, and the study found that it influenced both decision responses and subjective experience, indicating its role in assessing perceptual bias (see Results section)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Non-perceptual bias",
    "measured_by": "Base rate manipulation",
    "justification": "A base rate manipulation was employed, which involved altering the relative ratio of certain target stimuli. It was found that this manipulation biased observer responses but not their subjective experience of the stimuli, showing its utility in measuring non-perceptual bias."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Non-perceptual bias",
    "measured_by": "Payoff manipulation",
    "justification": "The payoff manipulation involved manipulating the rewards contingent to decisions. It was shown to affect decision-making without altering subjective experience, demonstrating its effectiveness for measuring non-perceptual bias."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision bias",
    "measured_by": "Signal detection theory (SDT)",
    "justification": "SDT was used to quantify bias and sensitivity independently, allowing researchers to test whether different manipulations were affecting perceptual or non-perceptual processes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceptual decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Reproduction task",
    "justification": "The reproduction task required participants to recreate their subjective experience of stimuli. It was specifically designed to isolate perceptual effects and was used to demonstrate the perceptual nature of the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion versus non-perceptual nature of other manipulations."
