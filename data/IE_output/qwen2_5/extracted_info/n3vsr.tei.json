    "measured_by": "risk-sensitive reinforcement learning task",
    "justification": "The study employed a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning task where participants learned the values and probabilities associated with probabilistic and deterministic machines, which allowed the researchers to quantify valence asymmetries using different learning models, notably the RSTD model with separate learning rates for positive and negative outcomes."

    "topic_or_construct": "risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "risk-sensitive reinforcement learning task",
    "justification": "Participants' choices between probabilistic (risky) and deterministic (safe) options in the risk-sensitive reinforcement learning task reflected their risk preferences, particularly in trials where both options had equal expected value (EV)."

    "topic_or_construct": "valence biases in learning",
    "measured_by": "Asymmetry Index (AI) from RSTD model",
    "justification": "The Asymmetry Index (AI) was computed from the RSTD model parameters (\u03b1+ and \u03b1-) to measure the relative weighting of positive versus negative prediction errors. Higher AI values indicated a greater emphasis on positive prediction errors."

    "topic_or_construct": "subsequent memory performance",
    "measured_by": "memory test for images associated with choice outcomes",
    "justification": "Participants were given a surprise memory test where they had to recognize images that were presented during the learning task alongside choice outcomes, enabling researchers to assess which factors influenced memory encoding and retrieval."

    "topic_or_construct": "self-reported risk-taking",
    "measured_by": "Domain-Specific Risk Taking (DOSPERT) scale",
    "justification": "The DOSPERT scale was used to measure participants\u2019 likelihood of taking risks in five specific domains (monetary, health and safety, recreational, ethical, and social), providing a self-reported assessment of real-world risk-taking tendencies."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "neural and psychological maturation of decision-making",
    "measured_by": "risk-sensitive reinforcement learning task",
    "justification": "By including participants across different age groups, the study used performance in the task to infer developmental differences in neural and psychological mechanisms underlying decision-making under uncertainty."
