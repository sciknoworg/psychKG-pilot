    "measured_by": "Size discrimination task using a 'second-guess' paradigm",
    "justification": "The paper describes experiments where participants identify the largest geometrical shape among multiple alternatives and are given a second chance to choose if their first decision is incorrect. This 'second-guess' paradigm is used to assess how information from initially unchosen options contributes to decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Information processing of unchosen alternatives",
    "measured_by": "Population+noise model (computational modeling)",
    "justification": "The Population+noise model is selected as the best-fitting model across experiments, suggesting that the decision system retains evidence from unchosen alternatives but this evidence is corrupted by noise, providing a framework to understand the suboptimal use of such information in multi-alternative decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC-2)",
    "justification": "Participants reported their confidence on a 4-point scale following their second guesses. Metacognitive sensitivity was operationalized as AUROC-2, indicating that the methodology allowed for the measurement of how well participants could distinguish correct from incorrect decisions based on their confidence ratings."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making and metacognition in multi-alternative contexts",
    "measured_by": "Computational models (Summary, Population, Population+noise)",
    "justification": "The models provided theoretical frameworks to compare different scenarios of information retention and loss in decision-making and metacognition. The Population+noise model, which includes noise affecting evidence for unchosen options, was particularly useful in explaining the experimental findings."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive computations",
    "measured_by": "Dual-channel version of Population+noise model",
    "justification": "This model allowed for the notion that metacognitive judgments may have access to a separate route of evidence, which is less corrupted by noise compared to the route influencing decision-making. This finding suggests that the metacognitive system accesses more information than the decision system."
