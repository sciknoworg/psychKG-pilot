    "measured_by": "mouse-tracking measures (MAD, AUC, prototypes, RT)",
    "justification": "The study used mouse-tracking measures like maximum absolute deviation (MAD), area under the curve (AUC), prototype classification, and reaction time (RT) to quantify the cognitive conflict in decision-making. These measures were used to examine how agency affects conflict when individuals face equity-prosocial behavior dilemmas, revealing differences in conflict levels between agentic and non-agentic participants."

    "topic_or_construct": "prosocial behavior preferences",
    "measured_by": "proportion of prosocial choices",
    "justification": "The study measured the preference for prosocial behavior by recording the proportion of trials in which participants chose the prosocial option over the equitable option. This was used to evaluate how agency influences the likelihood of participating prosocially versus equitably."

    "topic_or_construct": "equity-prosocial tradeoff conflict",
    "measured_by": "mouse-tracking conflict measures",
    "justification": "To understand the conflict individuals experience when navigating tradeoffs between equity and prosocial behavior, the study employed mouse-tracking data to analyze the amount of curvature in mouse trajectories. Greater curvature in the trajectories indicates higher conflict during the decision process."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision-making cognitive process",
    "measured_by": "reaction times (RTs)",
    "justification": "Reaction times were used to understand the cognitive processes involved in decision-making under conditions of agency and no-agency. Longer RTs indicated more cognitive conflict and difficulty in reaching a decision."

    "topic_or_construct": "agency and social preference interaction",
    "measured_by": "interaction effects in mixed-effects models",
    "justification": "The study examined interaction effects between agency and choice using mixed-effects models, which highlight how the cognitive processes associated with certain choices (prosocial/equitable) differed based on whether participants had agency over those choices."
