    "measured_by": "computerized money machine",
    "justification": "The article discusses the use of a computerized money machine to examine differences between decisions made from description versus experience. This tool helps scholars understand how people learn and respond to risk differently based on described information versus personal experience."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "risk perception through description",
    "measured_by": "health statistics (e.g., MMR vaccination Fact Box)",
    "justification": "The article mentions the use of health statistics and fact boxes, such as those for MMR vaccinations, as a means to assess how people perceive risks when the information is presented descriptively. This allows researchers to study how description-based information influences risk perception and decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "risk perception through experience",
    "measured_by": "repeated personal encounters (e.g., repeated exposure to rare risks)",
    "justification": "The article explains that personal experience, such as repeated encounters with rare risks like severe weather events, shapes risk perception. This method is used to explore how actual experiences impact individuals' understanding and response to risks, contrasting it with described information."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "description-experience gap in social interactions",
    "measured_by": "strategic games involving interdependence",
    "justification": "The text cites studies where strategic games are used to observe the description-experience gap in social settings. This enables researchers to gauge how descriptions about interdependence and actual experience influence cooperative behavior."
