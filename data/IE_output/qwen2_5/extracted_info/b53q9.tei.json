    "topic_or_construct": "Intention",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral experiments with disruptions and paths",
    "justification": "The study assessed intention through behavioral experiments where participants navigated to destinations in the presence of disruptions, showing how intention resists disruption and constrains freedom."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Disruption resistance",
    "measured_by": "Experimental task with random and deliberate disruptions",
    "justification": "The study used an experiment where participants' paths were disrupted randomly or deliberately, demonstrating the ability of humans to persevere in original intentions despite these disruptions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Ulysses-constraint of freedom",
    "measured_by": "Experiment with fixed-future vs. open-ended paths",
    "justification": "Participants chose between a fixed-future path that leads to a single destination and an open-ended path that could lead to multiple destinations, illustrating the self-binding aspect of intention."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal leap",
    "measured_by": "Pac-Man-like task with sequential destinations",
    "justification": "By giving participants a chain of destinations and assessing their preference for previous over new destinations, the study measured the temporal leap aspect of intention."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Bayesian theory of mind (BToM)",
    "measured_by": "BToM model for predicting agents' destinations",
    "justification": "The BToM model was used to infer the destination of participants' trajectories, showing enhanced legibility and predictability of human intentions compared to purely desire-driven agents."
