    "justification": "The study used Mouselab to investigate the relationship between SVO and controlled information acquisition. Participants completed two SVO tasks (Ring Task and Slider Task) followed by analyses showing that deviations from a selfish SVO score were linked to differences in decision time, number of acquisitions, and other indicators of information processing (Experiment 1)."

    "measured_by": "Intuitive and Reflective Planning Instructions",
    "justification": "Experiment 2 employed instructions based on Mental Contrasting and Implementation Intentions (MCII) to induce intuitive or reflective decision modes before participants moved to the second SVO task. As a result, participants in the reflective condition spent more time deciding and acquired more detailed information compared to those in an intuitive condition."

    "topic_or_construct": "Controlled Information Acquisition",
    "measured_by": "Mouselab",
    "justification": "Controlled information acquisition was measured using Mouselab data on decision time, total number of acquisitions, number of unique acquisitions, and the transition index. Analysis revealed that Mouselab captured the differences in controlled information acquisition as a function of SVO and decision mode."
