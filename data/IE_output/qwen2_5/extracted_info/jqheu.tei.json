    "measured_by": "Resolution and Calibration measures",
    "justification": "The study decomposed metacognition into resolution and calibration measures. Resolution describes a participant's degree of insight into their choice accuracy, while calibration describes their degree of underconfidence or overconfidence. These measures were calculated from participants\u2019 initial responses to assess their metacognitive abilities."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social Weighting Sensitivity (SWS)",
    "measured_by": "Social psychophysical task",
    "justification": "SWS was measured using a social psychophysical task where participants had to combine their perceptual judgments with those of others, indicated by trial-by-trial multiple linear regression coefficients involving advisors' confidence and participants' revised confidence. This task design allowed researchers to quantify individual differences in SWS."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social Susceptibility and Benefit",
    "measured_by": "Regression analysis of advisor influence and benefit",
    "justification": "Social susceptibility and benefit were quantified through a regression analysis where participants' initial and revised confidence were regressed onto the advisor's signed confidence. The coefficients from these models were used to assess how much participants were influenced by advisors of different reliability."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Belief Formation and Revision",
    "measured_by": "Trial-by-trial regression analyses",
    "justification": "The effects of trial history on belief formation and revision were investigated using trial-by-trial regression analyses, predicting participants' initial and revised confidence based on their own and the advisors' previous confidence and accuracy. These analyses revealed how trial history influenced participants' current beliefs."
