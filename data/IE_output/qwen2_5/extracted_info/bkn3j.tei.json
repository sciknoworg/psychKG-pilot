    "topic_or_construct": "Cooperation",
    "measured_by": "Economic Games",
    "justification": "The article states that economic games are primary tools used to study cooperation by creating controlled conditions that mimic social dilemmas, such as the Public Goods Game or the Prisoner's Dilemma."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social Preferences",
    "measured_by": "Social Preference Models",
    "justification": "Social preference models capture the trade-off between self-regarding and other-regarding concerns during social dilemmas, providing parameters flexible enough to account for different phenomena associated with cooperation, including endogenous and exogenous motives."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cooperative Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Value-Based Framework",
    "justification": "The article introduces a value-based framework, explaining that cooperation involves the integration of multiple modulatory inputs to compute a common currency of subjective values used in cooperative decisions, involving brain regions like the vmPFC and ventral striatum."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Individual Differences in Cooperation",
    "measured_by": "Activations in Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) and Posterior Superior Temporal Sulcus (pSTS)",
    "justification": "Activity in social cognition network regions, particularly TPJ and pSTS, is linked to the representation of others' intentions and social distance, influencing social preferences that modulate cooperation-related value computations."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Ingroup vs. Outgroup Cooperation",
    "measured_by": "Activation in Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)",
    "justification": "Seeing an ingroup member win money is subjectively more rewarding, as reflected in higher activations in the vmPFC, suggesting that group identity directly influences the value of cooperation through neuromodulatory processes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attention Effects on Cooperation",
    "measured_by": "Fixation Time and Visual Attention Manipulation",
    "justification": "Fixation on different options and attention manipulation affect decision-making, including value signals in the striatum and vmPFC. Attending to known cooperators might increase cooperation valuation by priming previous cooperative experiences."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Normative Influences on Cooperation",
    "measured_by": "Activations in the Insula and Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC)",
    "justification": "The insula plays a role in fairness representation and norm updating. Compliance with social norms involves the dlPFC, suggesting that neural representations of norms and expectations directly influence cooperative behavior."
