    "topic_or_construct": "Ambiguity aversion",
    "measured_by": "Gambling task (ambiguous options)",
    "justification": "The paper uses a gambling task that includes ambiguous options where the potential gain or loss was unknown, represented by a question mark. Higher values of ambiguity aversion parameters were significantly related to greater general anxiety, virus anxiety, and perceived virus infection severity."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk aversion",
    "measured_by": "Gambling task (risky options)",
    "justification": "Risk aversion was indexed by the overall number of gambles chosen in the gambling task. The study found that greater risk aversion was associated with a higher perceived severity of potential virus infection."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Loss aversion",
    "measured_by": "Gambling task (comparison of loss vs. no-loss outcomes)",
    "justification": "Loss aversion was measured by comparing choices between gamble options involving losses versus those without losses in the gambling task. Individuals who were less loss-averse at baseline became more anxious over time."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "General anxiety",
    "measured_by": "Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS)",
    "justification": "The OASIS was used to measure general anxiety in the past week. This self-report measure is mentioned explicitly for assessing anxiety levels."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Virus-related anxiety",
    "measured_by": "Questionnaire on virus-related anxiety",
    "justification": "The study employed a questionnaire designed to measure attitudes and anxiety specifically related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It included items related to virus-related anxiety assessed via a visual analogue scale."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Engagement in protective behaviors",
    "measured_by": "Questionnaire on protective behaviors",
    "justification": "A questionnaire assessed engagement in protective behaviors in response to the pandemic using a visual analogue scale. Higher risk-seeking subjects increased their engagement in protective behaviors more over time compared to more risk-averse individuals."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived infection likelihood and severity",
    "measured_by": "Questionnaire items on perceived infection likelihood and severity",
    "justification": "The research included questionnaire items assessing individuals' perceived likelihood of virus infection and the severity of the infection using a visual analogue scale, reflecting their risk perception."
