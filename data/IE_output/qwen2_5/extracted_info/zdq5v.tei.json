    "topic_or_construct": "risk preference",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral experiments (SDSC, SIOC, SISC)",
    "justification": "The paper discusses different ways in which risk preference can be measured behaviorally, including statistically dependent sequential choices (SDSC), statistically independent ordered choices (SIOC), and statistically independent single choices (SISC). These methods are designed to elicit an individual's decision-making behavior under known and immediate uncertainty."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "risk preference",
    "measured_by": "Domain Specific Risk Taking (DOSPERT) Scale",
    "justification": "The paper mentions that risk preference can also be assessed using more subjective measures like the DOSPERT Scale, which is a survey used to evaluate an individual's willingness to engage in risky behavior across different domains."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "risk preference",
    "measured_by": "Frequency measures of risky behavior",
    "justification": "The paper indicates that risk preference can be inferred from frequency measures, which involve tabulating the occasions on which an individual engages in risky behavior. This method often relies on self-reports but can also be based on observed behavior in specific settings."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "temporal discounting",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral-economic intertemporal choice tasks",
    "justification": "In the context of temporal discounting, the paper describes behavioral-economic intertemporal choice tasks where individuals choose between smaller sooner (SS) and larger later (LL) options. These tasks can be structured as SDSC, SIOC, and SISC to elicit individual differences in how they discount future rewards."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "temporal discounting",
    "measured_by": "Barratt Impulsiveness Scale",
    "justification": "The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale is mentioned as one of the survey-based methods used to assess impulsivity, which is closely related to temporal discounting. The scale evaluates various aspects of an individual's impulsive tendencies through self-report."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "temporal discounting",
    "measured_by": "Frequency measures of impulsive behavior",
    "justification": "Similar to risk preference, temporal discounting can also be assessed through frequency measures. These measures capture the number of times individuals engage in impulsive behaviors, providing insight into their tendency to prioritize immediate rewards over future ones."
