    "topic_or_construct": "Disordered eating behaviors",
    "measured_by": "Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q)",
    "justification": "Participants in the disordered eaters (DE) group scored 3 or above on the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and reported current or past symptoms of anorexia nervosa and/or bulimia nervosa, indicating the tool's use to identify disordered eating behaviors."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Eating attitudes and behaviors",
    "measured_by": "Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26)",
    "justification": "DE participants engaged in more binge-eating and purge behaviors than the typical eaters group in the last six months, as measured by the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) questionnaire, demonstrating the connection between the test and eating attitudes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward sensitivity and learning bias",
    "measured_by": "Reward learning task with food stimuli",
    "justification": "The computational model used in the study, which included asymmetric learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors and initial category values, best fit the choice data, revealing relationship between learning biases and reward sensitivity in the reward learning task involving food stimuli."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Arousal and emotional states",
    "measured_by": "Wheel of fortune task",
    "justification": "An Arousal manipulation, where participants won or lost $8 by 'spinning' a wheel of fortune, was included in the study to examine the modulating role of emotional arousal on food biases in reward learning and decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Preference for high- vs. low-calorie food",
    "measured_by": "Food stimuli ratings",
    "justification": "Participants rated food items on healthiness and estimated their calorie content, showing that ratings and estimations varied between disordered and typical eaters, linking these ratings to food preferences."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Interoceptive awareness",
    "measured_by": "Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA)",
    "justification": "While not the focus of the primary analysis, the inclusion of the MAIA in the set of questionnaires administered suggests an awareness of its role in assessing interoceptive processes, which can be relevant to eating behaviors."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Affective dispositions (anxiety, depression)",
    "measured_by": "Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21)",
    "justification": "Questionnaires like the DASS-21, included in the study, assess affective dispositions. Although these variables did not exert independent effects on the primary outcomes, they provide a broader assessment of mental health characteristics related to eating behaviors."
