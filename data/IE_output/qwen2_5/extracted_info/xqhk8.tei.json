    "topic_or_construct": "Memorability",
    "measured_by": "Continuous recognition task",
    "justification": "The study used a continuous recognition memory task where participants identified repeats among a stream of food images, measuring memorability scores through the corrected recognition (CR) method (hit rate minus false alarm rate). This approach allowed the calculation of consistent memorability scores across participants."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value-based decision making",
    "measured_by": "Value-based choice task",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to rate all food items based on preference and then choose items they would like to eat as a snack. This task assessed subjective values and choice behavior, examining how values influenced decisions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Word Memorability",
    "measured_by": "Memorability task with words",
    "justification": "Participants completed a memorability task similar to Experiment 1A but using food names instead of images. Memorability scores for words were calculated, showing high consistency across participants."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective Value of Food Items",
    "measured_by": "Pre-choice rating phase",
    "justification": "Participants rated all food stimuli on a scale from 0 to 10, indicating their preference to eat each item. This rating phase provided subjective value scores used to pair items of similar or different values in the choice task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Semantic Representations of Food Items",
    "measured_by": "Representativeness Task",
    "justification": "Participants rated how well the word labels matched the mental images of food items they envisioned. This task assessed the alignment between food words and images, ensuring the semantic representations' relevance."
