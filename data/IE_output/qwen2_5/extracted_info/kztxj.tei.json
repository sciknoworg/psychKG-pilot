    "justification": "Rich and Gureckis (2018) examined learning trap formation using a task where participants had to categorize cartoon bees as dangerous or friendly based on two feature dimensions. The presence of a learning trap was assessed by observing if participants used a suboptimal one-dimensional rule instead of the optimal two-dimensional rule. This task effectively measured whether participants fell into a learning trap."

    "topic_or_construct": "Learning trap formation",
    "measured_by": "Decision-contingent feedback vs. full feedback",
    "justification": "The study utilized two forms of feedback, decision-contingent and full feedback, to measure the propensity of participants to fall into learning traps. Those receiving only decision-contingent feedback were more likely to adopt a suboptimal rule and fall into the learning trap."

    "topic_or_construct": "Effectiveness of summative feedback",
    "measured_by": "Summative feedback doses (0, 1, 2, or 5 doses)",
    "justification": "To assess its effectiveness, summative feedback provision varied across different doses. The impact was measured by observing the type of categorization rule participants used, with 5 doses showing a significant reduction in learning traps compared to the contour-feedback-only group."
