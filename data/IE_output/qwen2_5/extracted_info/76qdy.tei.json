    "justification": "The study developed a probabilistic foraging game to examine how participants change between different policies under approach and avoidance conditions. This game allows the researchers to identify different policies based on the sequential choice conditions."

    "measured_by": "Multi-heuristic policy",
    "justification": "A multi-heuristic policy was created that considers the probabilistic success of foraging, binary energy state (BES), and wait when safe (WWS) strategy. Bayesian model inference suggests that the multi-heuristic policy performs the best, indicating heuristic-based decision-making in participants."

    "measured_by": "MDP-based optimal policy",
    "justification": "The optimal policy values were derived from a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model using dynamic programming. The capped optimal policy values significantly improved in avoidance forests, indicating enhanced optimal decision-making in those conditions."

    "justification": "The study manipulated levels of approaching gains and avoiding predators in different experimental conditions (approach and avoidance forests). The results suggest that the optimal policy gain importance in avoidance forests, indicating AAC's impact on decision-making strategies."
