    "justification": "The study uses a reference-based subjective value function, expressed as V (E) = 1 / (1 + e^\u2212(E\u2212\u00b5)/\u03c3), where E is the event, \u00b5 is the reference standard, and \u03c3 represents uncertainty. This function quantifies how subjective value increases as reference standards decline."

    "topic_or_construct": "Effort-Based Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Logistic function comparing subjective values",
    "justification": "The study employs a logistic function to model effort-based decisions, computing the probability of choosing to exert effort based on the difference in subjective values between effort-requiring events and alternative less demanding activities or a fixed effort cost."

    "topic_or_construct": "Impact of Uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Parameter \u03c3 in the subjective value function",
    "justification": "The role of uncertainty is captured by the parameter \u03c3 in the subjective value function. The study explores different levels of uncertainty by manipulating \u03c3, demonstrating how it affects the sensitivity to changes in the reference standard."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reference-Dependent Model",
    "measured_by": "Simulations with declining standards",
    "justification": "The paper uses simulations to illustrate how declining standards (\u00b5) influence the subjective value of events and the probability of exerting effort. By manipulating \u00b5 over time, the study quantifies changes in value perceptions and decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Loss Aversion and Deadline Effect",
    "measured_by": "Simulations of changing reference standards as deadlines approach",
    "justification": "The study employs simulations to analyze how the reference standard (\u00b5) decreases as deadlines approach, leading to increased loss aversion and urgency. This is modeled using reference-based subjective value functions to explain heightened valuation of events as they become scarce."
