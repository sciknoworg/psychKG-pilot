    "measured_by": "Horizon Task",
    "justification": "The Horizon Task was used to measure explore-exploit behavior, allowing researchers to quantify directed and random exploration as well as baseline uncertainty aversion and behavioral variability. This is achieved by manipulating the time horizon and evaluating participants' choices between two virtual slot machines (Wilson et al., 2014)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Directed exploration",
    "measured_by": "Change in (high info) between horizon 1 and horizon 6 in the Horizon Task",
    "justification": "Directed exploration was measured as the change in the probability of choosing the more informative option (high info) between short (horizon 1) and long (horizon 6) conditions within the Horizon Task. This captures the increasing value of information as the time horizon for making decisions extends."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Random exploration",
    "measured_by": "Change in (low mean) between horizon 1 and horizon 6 in the Horizon Task",
    "justification": "Random exploration was defined as the change in the frequency of choosing the option with lower observed mean reward (low mean) between short (horizon 1) and long (horizon 6) conditions. This quantifies the tendency to randomly explore options as the time horizon increases."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Baseline uncertainty aversion",
    "measured_by": "(high info) in horizon 1 of the Horizon Task",
    "justification": "Baseline uncertainty aversion was measured by the probability of choosing the more informative option (high info) in the short horizon condition, where there is no benefit to exploration. This reflects the participants' baseline tendency to avoid uncertainty."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Baseline behavioral variability",
    "measured_by": "(low mean) in horizon 1 of the Horizon Task",
    "justification": "Baseline behavioral variability was assessed by the frequency of choosing the lower mean option (low mean) in the short horizon condition, which captures inherent decision noise or variability in participant behavior not related to directed exploration."
