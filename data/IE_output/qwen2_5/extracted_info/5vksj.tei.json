    "justification": "The paper discusses that memory sampling is often measured using reinforcement learning (RL) tasks where memory probes are introduced. The influence of these probes on participants' decisions is captured by a memory sampling model, which shows that probed experiences are treated as more recent than they otherwise would be (Bornstein and colleagues, 2017)."

    "measured_by": "decision tasks with episodic memory reactivation measures",
    "justification": "The paper highlights that the influence of episodic memory on decisions can be measured by examining decision tasks in conjunction with neuroimaging markers. For example, participants' decisions are shown to be influenced by the properties of other decisions made in the same context as probed by memory reactivation markers (Bornstein & Norman, 2017)."

    "measured_by": "drift-diffusion model analyses",
    "justification": "The canonical drift-diffusion model (DDM) is employed to study the integration of evidence from memory in decision-making. It is used to analyze sequential sampling of memories as part of the decision process, demonstrating that memory-guided decisions closely match characteristics of decision variables and can incorporate jumps driven by episodic memory reactivation (Voss et al., 2019)."

    "measured_by": "jump-diffusion model",
    "justification": "The paper proposes using a jump-diffusion model to analyze the irregular and sequential nature of evidence accumulation derived from various memory sources. This method is utilized to evaluate the combination of multiple memory-based evidence sources and their impact on the decision-making timeseries, demonstrating its superiority in fitting two-alternative forced choice data with heterogeneous evidence sources (Voss et al., 2019; Wieschen et al., 2020)."

    "justification": "The paper mentions that response times in decision tasks, cognizant of the accumulated evidence\u2019s impact from memory, are analyzed to predict choices accurately. These times can be improved further by incorporating memory cues at the beginning of each trial, which leads to better out-of-sample predictions (Clithero, 2018)."
