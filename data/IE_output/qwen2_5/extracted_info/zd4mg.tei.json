    "measured_by": "Decision-making task in description and experience formats",
    "justification": "The study uses a decision-making task with both description and experience formats to assess participants' choices when facing problems with different rare outcome favorability. These choices reveal patterns of probability weighting, showing whether participants overweight or underweight rare outcomes in their decision-making processes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Loss aversion",
    "measured_by": "Decision-making task in description format",
    "justification": "The study uses a decision-making task with a description format, where participants rate their choices in gain and loss problems. It demonstrates loss aversion by examining whether participants are more likely to take risks to avoid losses compared to seeking gains, showcasing similarities between adolescents and adults in this construct."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Expected-value sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Decision-making task in description and experience formats",
    "justification": "The study utilizes a decision-making task in both description and experience formats that vary the expected value (EV) of the options. By examining whether participants choose options with higher EV, it measures sensitivity to expected value, revealing differences between adolescents and adults."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Eye gaze bias",
    "measured_by": "Eye tracking setup (Tobii T60XL system)",
    "justification": "Eye tracking technology is employed to measure where participants look while making decisions in the description format. It identifies what participants focus on before making their choices, showing biases towards the options they ultimately select and differences between age groups in their gaze behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Pupil dilation",
    "measured_by": "Eye tracking setup (Tobii T60XL system)",
    "justification": "The eye tracking setup captures pupil dilation data alongside gaze behavior in decisions from description. It is used to explore age differences in physiological arousal linked to decision biases, especially when participants choose options contrary to their typical behavioral patterns."
