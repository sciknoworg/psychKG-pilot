    "justification": "The article explains that NLP models are used to classify participants' unstructured verbal descriptions of their strategies, matching these classifications against their actual behavior and cognitive model parameters. The use of NLP models allows for the analysis of text-based data to understand decision processes."

    "justification": "The framework described in the article involves validating parameters in cognitive models using verbal reports analyzed by NLP models. This shows that the psychological assumptions of cognitive models can be related to actual participant descriptions of their decision-making processes."

    "justification": "Participants' reported choice strategies derived from verbal reports are used to validate their risk preferences. These descriptions include how they evaluated options, whether they took risks, and if they adjusted decisions based on social information."
