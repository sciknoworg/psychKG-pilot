    "justification": "The Weight of Advice (WoA) measure was used to quantify adherence to advice from algorithmic or human sources. Higher WoA scores indicated that participants more strongly incorporated advice from an algorithmic source compared to a human source, as seen in various experimental conditions (Logg et al., 2019)."

    "measured_by": "Weight of Advice (WoA) measure",
    "justification": "The Weight of Advice (WoA) measure also assessed instances of algorithm aversion, where participants were less likely to use algorithmic advice compared to human advice. This was observed when participants experienced imperfect algorithmic forecasts, particularly in certain experimental conditions (Dietvorst et al., 2015)."

    "justification": "Participants' perception of advisor accuracy was directly manipulated by providing them with numerical summaries of past performance accuracy. This manipulation helped assess how the accuracy information influenced advice adherence in the Judge-Advisor System paradigm."
