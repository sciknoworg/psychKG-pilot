    "measured_by": "Random Dot Motion (RDM) Task",
    "justification": "The RDM task was used to test decision-making processes by manipulating coherent dot movement between different directions. Participants were instructed to indicate which direction had more coherent dot movement, providing data on response time and accuracy that was analyzed to test decision-making theories."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-Making Process",
    "measured_by": "Grating Stimuli Contrast Discrimination Task",
    "justification": "Participants performed a contrast discrimination task involving grating stimuli with varying amounts of coherence between the eyes. This task provided complementary data to the RDM task and was used to further validate findings on decision-making, particularly in unequal-evidence conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Evidence Accumulation Architectures",
    "measured_by": "LCA Model (Leaky Competing Accumulator)",
    "justification": "The LCA model, which features partially dependent accumulators, was fitted to the experimental data. Its performance was compared against other models, and it provided the best account of the behavioral data, especially in predicting slower response times under unequal-evidence conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Evidence Accumulation Architectures",
    "measured_by": "FFI Model (Feed-Forward Inhibition)",
    "justification": "The FFI model, featuring input competition between accumulators, was also employed and compared to the LCA model. However, when fitted to the experimental data, it struggled to simulate response times as the total evidence increased in equal-evidence conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Variability in Decision-Making Models",
    "measured_by": "Between-Trial Variability Models",
    "justification": "Between-trial variability was added to the LCA and FFI models, scaling the between-trial variability parameter as a function of the evidence present. This modification was applied to investigate if incorporating such variability would improve the models\u2019 performance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Variability in Decision-Making Models",
    "measured_by": "Within-Trial Variability Models",
    "justification": "Models with within-trial variability mechanisms, activated by stimulus strength, were tested. These were intended to enhance the models' capability to capture magnitude effects in decision-making tasks."
