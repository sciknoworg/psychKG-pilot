    "justification": "The DDM was used to analyze the underlying cognitive mechanisms in semantic prediction, particularly focusing on the drift rate parameter, which reflects the speed of evidence accumulation towards a decision. The analysis showed that participants accumulated evidence faster for targets that were semantically similar to primes in the long condition compared to the short condition."

    "justification": "LMER models were applied to analyze the effects of semantic similarity and condition (long vs. short) on reaction times (RT) and accuracy. The models revealed that participants had shorter RTs and higher accuracy for semantically similar targets in the long condition compared to the short condition, indicating the presence and enhancement of semantic priming."

    "measured_by": "Semantic Similarity Measure",
    "justification": "A semantic similarity measure based on vector differences of word embeddings was used to assess local contextual prediction within the long and short conditions. This measure helped quantify the degree of semantic relationship between primes and targets, thereby capturing the influence of context on prediction."
