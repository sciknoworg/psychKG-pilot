    "measured_by": "post-decision confidence reports",
    "justification": "The study explicitly mentions that after participants made a choice in a value-based decision task (selecting between food items), they were asked to report their confidence level using a continuous rating scale, ranging from 'not at all confident' to 'totally confident.' This directly measures post-decision confidence."

    "measured_by": "eye-tracking data and attentional effort parameter (\u03b8) in GLAM and RUM models",
    "justification": "Eye-tracking data were used to infer the attentional effort parameter (\u03b8) in computational models like the Gaze-weighted Linear Accumulator Model (GLAM) and Random Utility Model (RUM). These models capture how attentional effort fluctuates across trials and influences decision-making and confidence reports."

    "topic_or_construct": "subjective value coding variability",
    "measured_by": "rating variability during repeated rating phases",
    "justification": "Participants rated the desirability of food items on a slider scale during two separate rating phases. The variability in these ratings provided a measure of subjective value coding variability, which was then used to assess its impact on subsequent choice consistency and confidence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision consistency",
    "measured_by": "choice consistency versus value difference and rating variability",
    "justification": "The consistency of decisions (choosing items with a higher value rating) was measured using logistic regression with value difference and rating variability as predictors. This allowed the authors to dissect factors influencing decision precision."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "noise in the decision process",
    "measured_by": "encoding noise (\u03c3_enc) and comparison noise (\u03c3_comp) in the efficient coding model",
    "justification": "The authors utilized an efficient coding model to separate encoding noise (\u03c3_enc), which is value-specific, and comparison noise (\u03c3_comp), which is value-independent. This dissociation helped in understanding how distinct types of noise relate to confidence in value-based decisions."
