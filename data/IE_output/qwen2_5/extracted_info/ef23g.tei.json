    "measured_by": "Spot-The-Differences Task (SPOT)",
    "justification": "The SPOT task was used to measure cheating behavior inconspicuously by presenting participants with cartoon images where they had to identify differences, with incentives for finding a specific number of differences regardless of their actual presence, encouraging cheating. The authors used this task to determine participants' moral defaults and assess changes in (dis)honesty under stress."

    "measured_by": "Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST)",
    "justification": "The MAST was used to reliably induce acute stress in participants through a combination of social and physical stressors, including a hand immersion task in ice-cold water and a mentally demanding arithmetic task under observation. This test served as the stress induction method to examine its effects on cheating behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "Moral Default",
    "measured_by": "Cheating Levels in First Block of SPOT",
    "justification": "Participants' cheating in the first block of the SPOT was taken as a measure of their moral default. This initial cheating behavior allowed the researchers to establish participants' baseline tendency to cheat or be honest, enabling the subsequent assessment of how stress affected this tendency."
