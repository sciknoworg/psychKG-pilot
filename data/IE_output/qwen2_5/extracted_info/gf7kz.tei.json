    "justification": "The paper mentions using the conflict subscale of the Situational Interdependence Scale (SIS) to measure and test the degree to which perceived conflict of interests is influenced by framing effects. This indicates that the SIS specifically measures people's perceptions of conflict in situational contexts."

    "measured_by": "Single-item Measure",
    "justification": "The paper describes a single-item measure assessing beliefs about the other player's behavior, which asks participants to indicate whether the other player is more likely to choose a certain option. This indicates that this specific measure was used to evaluate the participants' beliefs about their interaction partner's behavior in the game."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cooperative Behaviour",
    "measured_by": "Choices in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game",
    "justification": "Cooperative behaviour was assessed through participants' choices in the Prisoner's Dilemma, where they either cooperated or defected based on the game's framing. This shows that participants' choices in the game directly reflected their cooperative behaviour under different framing conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social Preferences",
    "measured_by": "Social Value Orientation Slider Measure",
    "justification": "The study measures social preferences using the social value orientation slider measure, as it is noted that Bernold et al. (2014) previously used this method, and the current studies included direct measurement of social preferences, such as through conditional cooperation and altruistic decisions in a continuous Prisoner's Dilemma setting."
