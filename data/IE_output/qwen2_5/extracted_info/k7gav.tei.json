    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence resolution",
    "measured_by": "Type 2 AUROC measure",
    "justification": "The paper explicitly mentions using the Type 2 AUROC measure to quantify confidence resolution, illustrating that it's an effective metric for assessing metacognitive performance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence",
    "measured_by": "Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model",
    "justification": "For the interrogation session, the authors used the SDT model to determine confidence by computing the absolute distance of the accumulated evidence from the criterion. This application of the SDT framework is a key part of their methodological approach."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive performance",
    "measured_by": "Difference between confidence of correct and error responses",
    "justification": "The paper reports three measures of confidence resolution, one of which is the difference between the confidence levels of correct and incorrect responses. This difference serves as an indicator of metacognitive performance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive performance",
    "measured_by": "Gamma correlation between confidence and accuracy",
    "justification": "The study includes the Gamma correlation between confidence ratings and accuracy as another measure of metacognitive performance, highlighting the link between confidence judgments and actual performance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Integration-to-boundary strategy",
    "measured_by": "Two-Stage Dynamic Signal Detection (2DSD) model",
    "justification": "The 2DSD model is used to explain confidence formation in the free-response session, where confidence is linked to post-decision evidence integration. The model incorporates both the decision-making process and subsequent confidence assessment."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Free-response decision-making",
    "measured_by": "RT and last item evidence",
    "justification": "In the free-response session, confidence is influenced by both reaction time (RT) and the evidence from the last item. These factors serve as predictors of confidence, reflecting the decision-making process in free-response tasks."
