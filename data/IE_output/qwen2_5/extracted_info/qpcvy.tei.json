    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal Expectations",
    "measured_by": "Phasic Pupil Responses",
    "justification": "The article states that phasic pupil responses, reflecting surprise, were larger when rewards were received after longer delays, indicating that participants believed rewards were less likely to arrive as time passed. This aligns with the heavy-tailed temporal expectations hypothesis."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Self-Control Effort",
    "measured_by": "Pre-decision Pupil Diameter",
    "justification": "The study found that pre-decision pupil diameter prior to quit events was highest when quit times deviated most from participants' usual quit times, suggesting that effortful decisions were those that went against typical tendencies, challenging the limited self-control hypothesis."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Persistence Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve",
    "justification": "The AUC of the Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to represent the average number of seconds participants were willing to wait, operationalizing individual differences in persistence behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal Uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Generalized Pareto Reward Timing Distribution",
    "justification": "The study employed a Generalized Pareto distribution to model reward timing, which provided an approximately equivalent reward rate regardless of waiting policy, enabling the study of persistence under temporal uncertainty."
