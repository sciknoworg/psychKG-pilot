    "topic_or_construct": "graduate school success",
    "measured_by": "GRE",
    "justification": "Although standardized admissions tests, like the GRE, predict success during and after graduate school (Kuncel et al., 2001). This indicates the use of the GRE as a measurement instrument for predicting success in graduate programs."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "measurement bias",
    "measured_by": "GRE",
    "justification": "A test is considered to have measurement bias if two test takers with the same underlying level of the construct being measured have different observed scores on the same test. Extant research shows little evidence of measurement bias on the GRE (Berry et al., 2011; Helms, 2006; Kuncel & Hezlett, 2007)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "prediction bias",
    "measured_by": "GRE",
    "justification": "Prediction bias occurs when test scores predict outcomes differently for different groups. Studies indicate that there is little evidence of prediction bias in the GRE (Berry et al., 2011; Helms, 2006; Kuncel & Hezlett, 2007)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "motivation",
    "measured_by": "LORs (Letters of Recommendation)",
    "justification": "Unstructured LORs purportedly 'assess' a variety of constructs such as students' motivation (Kuncel et al., 2014). Additionally, the study used LOR content dictionaries to match motivation-related terms to evaluate differences across various applicant groups."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "critical thinking",
    "measured_by": "LORs (Letters of Recommendation)",
    "justification": "A variety of constructs, including critical thinking, are purportedly assessed via LORs. The research uses content analysis dictionaries for critical thinking terms to analyze differences in LORs for diverse applicant groups."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "personality",
    "measured_by": "LORs (Letters of Recommendation)",
    "justification": "LORs can introduce information about applicants' personality traits (e.g., Aamodt et al., 1993; Peres & Garcia, 1962). The study developed a personality dictionary with positive personality adjectives to analyze LOR content related to personality traits."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "self-efficacy",
    "measured_by": "LORs (Letters of Recommendation)",
    "justification": "Self-efficacy is one of the constructs measurable via LORs (Kyllonen et al., 2005). The study indirectly assesses this through content analysis using terms related to applicants' beliefs in their ability to successfully perform."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "creativity",
    "measured_by": "LORs (Letters of Recommendation)",
    "justification": "Creativity is another construct posited to be measurable through LORs (Kyllonen et al., 2005). The study analyzed LOR content for terms related to an applicant's capacity to perform and identify unique solutions."
