    "topic_or_construct": "Teleological Beliefs",
    "measured_by": "Teleological Beliefs Scale (TBS)",
    "justification": "The TBS measures teleological beliefs about biological and non-biological natural entities by assessing agreement with statements like 'Plants consume CO2 in order to reduce greenhouse gases' across various categories. It provides a quantitative measure of these beliefs, which is well-established in the literature (Roberts et al., 2021)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Anthropomorphism",
    "measured_by": "Anthropomorphism Questionnaire (AQ)",
    "justification": "The AQ contains items that measure participants' attribution of human-like traits to non-human entities (e.g., 'When I was a child, I held birthday parties for my favorite toys'). The questionnaire provides a reliable assessment of anthropomorphic tendencies, with high internal consistency as noted in the study (\u03b1 = .939)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Belief in God",
    "measured_by": "Centrality of Religiosity Questionnaire (r-CRS)",
    "justification": "The reduced version of the r-CRS is used to measure belief in God and other related religious dimensions such as private practice and ideology. Although the questionnaire is slightly abbreviated, it reliably captures religious beliefs and shows excellent internal consistency (\u03b1 = .967)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Inhibition of Intuitions",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)",
    "justification": "The CRT evaluates individuals' ability to inhibit intuitive but incorrect responses in favor of correct ones that require reflection (e.g., calculating problems where the initial answer is a common pitfall). The study utilized an extended version with additional non-math items, demonstrating acceptable internal consistency (\u03b1 = .725) and effectively measuring the construct."
