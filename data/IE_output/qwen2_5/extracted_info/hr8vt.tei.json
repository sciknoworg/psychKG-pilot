    "justification": "Emotion transmission in narratives is measured using a one-dimensional rating scale ranging from 0 to 7, where 0 represents 'not sad at all' and 7 represents 'very sad.' The ratings are averaged from a group of 6-8 independent raters to determine the overall emotional intensity of each retelling."

    "justification": "The performance of quantum and Bayesian models in serial reproduction of narratives is compared using the dataset from Breithaupt et al. (2022). The models predict the distribution of averaged ratings of S_n+1, given the rewritten story from S_n with some averaged ratings x(n). The models were fitted using maximum likelihood techniques and compared using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and a generalization test."

    "measured_by": "averaged ratings of emotion intensity across raters",
    "justification": "The intensity of specific emotions in serial reproduction chains is measured by averaging the ratings of emotional intensity provided by a group of 6-8 independent raters. These ratings were collected for each retelling of the stories across different emotions, enabling the comparison of emotional intensity changes."
