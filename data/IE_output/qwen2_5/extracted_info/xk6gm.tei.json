    "justification": "The article discusses the inclusion of trial-to-trial variability in drift rates, starting points, and non-decision times in the drift diffusion model to account for aspects of human response time distributions. Sequential sampling models in general predict choices together with response time distributions, contributing to the understanding of variability."

    "measured_by": "Autoregressive models and hidden Markov models (HMMs)",
    "justification": "Autoregressive models capture short-term memory effects where the state of the decision-making system is influenced by its previous states. Hidden Markov models are used to capture discrete strategy changes over time, allowing insights into how observers generate different decision strategies ('regimes' or 'mental sets') over trials."

    "justification": "Structured variability models such as dynamic models decompose observed behavioral variability into deterministic and probabilistic sources, while superstatistics approaches jointly fit both observation and transition models to capture temporal dynamics in decision parameters, improving our understanding of how variability unfolds in decision-making."
