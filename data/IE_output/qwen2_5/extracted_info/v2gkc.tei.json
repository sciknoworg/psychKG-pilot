    "justification": "The article uses a perceptual task where participants predict the\u5230\u6765\u65f6\u95f4 of a ball moving across the screen and entering an occlusion. This setup directly measures participants' ability to perform anticipatory timing. The task highlights participants' perception of the ball's velocity and the reliability of their anticipation of future events, quantifying these anticipatory timing skills through response times."

    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty in timing",
    "measured_by": "Manipulations of ball speed, occlusion length, and exposure duration in anticipatory timing tasks",
    "justification": "The article employs variations in ball speed, occlusion duration, and exposure time in the timing task, designed to induce and measure different levels of uncertainty in timing decisions. These manipulations help quantify how participants track time under varying conditions of uncertainty, thereby assessing the construct of uncertainty in timing."

    "topic_or_construct": "High-level planning and time management",
    "measured_by": "Self-report timing problems and procrastination scales",
    "justification": "Participants completed self-report scales focused on identifying difficulties with time management, lateness, and procrastination. These scales were used to measure higher-level issues arising from potential deficits in anticipatory timing, connecting the low-level perceptual decisions in the timing task to real-world timing difficulties."

    "measured_by": "Movement latency and accuracy in a time-based decision selection task",
    "justification": "The task measures participants' temporal performance as they are required to initiate actions based on temporal cues. Performance is gauged via the difference between actual and expected timing of participant responses. This task effectively evaluates how accurately participants anticipate timing requirements for motor planning."

    "justification": "By assessing drift rates (\u03b3) from the reactive decision-making task with various sensory intervals incorporated to manipulate filled/unfilled time periods, the study reveals participants\u2019 adjustments in the perception of time intervals under conditions with reduced sensory input, thus indicating their timing abilities for unfilled intervals."
