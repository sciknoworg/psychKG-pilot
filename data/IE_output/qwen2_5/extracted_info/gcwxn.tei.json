    "justification": "The paper describes that the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) model captures the logarithmic relationship between set size and average RT (Hick's Law). The paper states that incorporating an action uncertainty term into the LBA model improves its ability to explain the set size effect on RT, which suggests the model effectively measures set size effects in relation to RT."

    "measured_by": "Shannon Entropy",
    "justification": "The authors use Shannon entropy to compute a measure of uncertainty over actions and incorporate this into their model. This is done to explain how uncertainty over learned action weights influences RT. The uncertainty term used in their model significantly improves the model's fit to RT data."

    "measured_by": "Delta Rule in Q-Learning",
    "justification": "The RLWM model, which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with working memory (WM), uses a delta rule inspired by standard RL models to update action values. This indicates that the delta rule is the measurement instrument used to capture reinforcement learning's contribution to decision making."

    "measured_by": "Perfect Learning with Trial-by-Trial Decay",
    "justification": "The RLWM model incorporates a working memory module that learns stimulus-response associations perfectly but is subject to trial-by-trial forgetting or decay. This decay mechanism serves as the measurement for the role of working memory in decision making."

    "measured_by": "Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) Model",
    "justification": "The Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) model is employed to represent the evidence accumulation process. It captures the dynamics of competing accumulator drift rates which determine the decision time in the experimental task."

    "measured_by": "Reaction Time Data",
    "justification": "Reaction time data are used alongside choice data to constrain and validate the models presented. The incorporation of RT data is critical for characterizing learning and decision-making processes, demonstrating the use of RT data as a direct measure of underlying cognitive processes."
