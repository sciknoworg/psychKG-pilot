    "justification": "The study measured prosocial tendencies as the proportion of cooperative PGG decisions made by each participant, reflecting broader individual differences in prosociality. This was further validated through a dictator game where participants could allocate money to others, serving as an independent measure of prosociality."

    "justification": "The study created prosocial and antisocial social norms by manipulating the feedback indicating different cooperation levels from two universities (labeled as prosocial and antisocial). Participants' estimates of cooperation levels from each university indexed individual differences in norm-detection, verifying the impact of situational norms on cooperation."
