    "justification": "The study employed face judgment tasks involving faces morphed along a trustworthy gradient to assess trust bias, where participants' judgments of neutral faces served as a marker of individual differences in trust biases."

    "topic_or_construct": "Trustworthy/untrustworthy face perception",
    "measured_by": "Amygdala activation magnitude",
    "justification": "Univariate analyses demonstrated that amygdala activation magnitude tracked the trustworthy gradient, with heightened activation to more trustworthy and untrustworthy faces compared to neutral faces."

    "measured_by": "Amygdala neural pattern similarity using MVPA",
    "justification": "Activated patterns in the amygdala for trustworthy and untrustworthy faces were analyzed for their similarity using Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA); greater similarity was associated with a higher trust bias for neutral faces."

    "topic_or_construct": "Individual differences in trust bias",
    "measured_by": "Amygdala-insula connectivity dissimilarity using beta-series connectivity",
    "justification": "Connectivity analyses using a beta-series approach demonstrated that greater connectivity dissimilarity between the amygdala and insula in response to trustworthy versus untrustworthy faces was associated with a greater trust bias for neutral faces."

    "measured_by": "Univariate anterior insula activation",
    "justification": "The study found that greater univariate activation in the anterior insula to untrustworthy faces was linked to a higher tendency to rate neutral faces as trustworthy."
