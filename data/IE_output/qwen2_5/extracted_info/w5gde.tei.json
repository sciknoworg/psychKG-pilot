    "justification": "The study used probabilistic binary and ternary choices with different presentation orders to measure the influence of the decoy on choices and assess the attraction effect. These choices included sure smaller options and risky larger ones, with some conditions adding an asymmetrically dominated decoy."

    "justification": "The attraction effect was quantified using statistical analysis through Generalized Logistic Mixed Effect Models, evaluating the probability of selecting the target option under different conditions and presentation orders."

    "justification": "The study calculated RST to measure the change in target selection preferences between binary and ternary conditions, confirming the presence of the attraction effect."
