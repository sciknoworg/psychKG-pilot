    "justification": "The paper uses a drift-diffusion model with variable drift rate and collapsing boundaries to explain decision-making in gap acceptance scenarios. The model captures the dynamic accumulation of evidence based on distance and time-to-arrival, reflecting the cognitive processes involved."

    "measured_by": "Variable-drift rate model",
    "justification": "The authors adopt a variable-drift rate model where the drift rate is determined by linear combinations of time-to-arrival (TTA) and distance to account for the dynamic sensory information during driving decisions."

    "justification": "The paper introduces a customized model extending standard drift-diffusion models to incorporate dynamically changing perceptual quantities (distance and TTA) over time, illustrating its effectiveness in predicting driver decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Urgency effect in left-turn driving decisions",
    "measured_by": "Collapsing decision boundaries",
    "justification": "The urgency effect imposed by approaching vehicles is modeled via collapsing boundaries that decrease with the decreasing time-to-arrival, demonstrating a clear link between time-pressure and decision-making thresholds."
