    "measured_by": "Medial Frontal Negativity (MFN)",
    "justification": "The article describes that unfair offers evoked medial frontal negativity (MFN) relative to fair offers, which is linked to the perception of a social norm of fairness being violated. This ERP component is used as an index to understand fairness perception."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotional Expressions",
    "measured_by": "P3 Amplitude",
    "justification": "Emotional expressions (happy, neutral, angry) modulated the P3 amplitude, with neutral expressions evoking a lower amplitude than angry and happy expressions, indicating that emotional expressions affected later components related to offer perception."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fairness Perception",
    "measured_by": "Late Positive Potential (LPP)",
    "justification": "The LPP was found to be sensitive to fairness: unfair offers produced a stronger negativity relative to fair offers, especially over frontal sites, showing a dissociation between different types of offers during later stages of processing."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Interpersonal Touch",
    "measured_by": "ERP amplitudes (N1, MFN, P3, LPP)",
    "justification": "Interpersonal touch (visual, tactile) was observed to affect ERP amplitudes across different event-related potential (ERP) components, such as N1, MFN, P3, and LPP, indicating that touch influenced the processing of offers albeit late stages of perception."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Message Evaluation",
    "measured_by": "Ultimatum Game",
    "justification": "The Ultimatum Game was used as an experimental paradigm to study how different non-verbal behaviors (emotional expressions, touch) by a message sender affected the evaluation of economic proposals by participants."
