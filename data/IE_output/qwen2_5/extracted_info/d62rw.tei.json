    "measured_by": "Four-in-a-row task",
    "justification": "The article uses the Four-in-a-row task, which is an extension of Tic-Tac-Toe, to formally characterize planning ability and its underlying components in participants aged 8-25 years, providing an ecologically valid assessment of complex planning ability."

    "topic_or_construct": "Planning depth",
    "measured_by": "Decision Tree Metrics from Four-in-a-row computational model",
    "justification": "Planning depth, representing how far participants think into the future, was derived from the computational model of the Four-in-a-row task by estimating the depth of the decision tree for each participant's simulated moves, and it was found to improve monotonically with age."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Heuristic quality",
    "measured_by": "Heuristic Function Weights from Four-in-a-row computational model",
    "justification": "Heuristic quality, reflecting the alignment of participants' subjective feature weights with optimal weights, was calculated from the Four-in-a-row task data and was found to show both linear and quadratic age effects, improving most strongly between childhood and early adolescence."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attentional oversights",
    "measured_by": "Feature drop rate from Four-in-a-row computational model",
    "justification": "The feature drop rate, a measure of attentional oversights, was estimated directly from the computational model applied to the Four-in-a-row task. It did not show significant age-related changes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fluid reasoning",
    "measured_by": "Matrix Reasoning Item Bank (MaRs-IB)",
    "justification": "Participants completed the MaRs-IB to assess fluid reasoning, a general cognitive ability that involves applying logic to new problems, with results showing that it was positively correlated with age and partially mediated age-related improvements in planning depth and heuristic quality."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Future orientation",
    "measured_by": "Future Orientation Scale (FOS)",
    "justification": "Self-report measures of future orientation using the FOS were collected. The scale assesses planning, anticipation of future consequences, and time perspective. However, these measures were not associated with the cognitive component processes derived from the Four-in-a-row model."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Impulsivity",
    "measured_by": "Barratt Impulsiveness Scale - Brief (BIS-Brief)",
    "justification": "Participants completed the BIS-Brief to measure their self-reported impulsive personality traits. Similar to future orientation, impulsivity did not correlate with the cognitive component processes quantified by the Four-in-a-row model."
