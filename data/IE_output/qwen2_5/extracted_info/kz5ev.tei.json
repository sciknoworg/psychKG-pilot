    "topic_or_construct": "Goal-directed processes",
    "measured_by": "Proportion of high-probability actions in response to valued and devalued outcomes",
    "justification": "The study measured high-probability actions in response to valued and devalued outcomes to determine whether a devaluation effect occurred, indicating goal-directed behavior in both the test and reacquisition phases."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Habitual processes",
    "measured_by": "Response insensitivity to outcome devaluation",
    "justification": "Participants' continued responding to devalued outcomes despite selective satiation in the original Schwabe and Wolf (2010) study was used as evidence for habitual processes. However, in this study, this measure was not supported, suggesting this behavior is not always indicative of habitual control."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Stress effects on behavior",
    "measured_by": "Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test (SECPT)",
    "justification": "The SECPT was used to induce stress in participants, with its effectiveness verified through subjective ratings of stress, pain, and unpleasantness, as well as physiological measures like salivary cortisol and blood pressure levels."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Outcome valuation",
    "measured_by": "Desire ratings",
    "justification": "Participants rated their desire to consume each liquid before and after devaluation phases, serving as a measure of the effectiveness of the taste aversion procedure in lowering the value of the devalued liquid compared to the valued liquid."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Stress-induced coping",
    "measured_by": "Preference for unhealthy foods",
    "justification": "The alternative model posits that stress can shift priorities towards short-term goals such as stress regulation, potentially leading participants to prefer these options in the goal of regulating their stress."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Outcome devaluation via taste aversion",
    "measured_by": "Response to liquids after mixing them with Tween 20",
    "justification": "The mixing of liquids with the colorless and odorless substance, Tween 20, created a bad taste, serving as a stronger method of outcome devaluation compared to selective satiation."
