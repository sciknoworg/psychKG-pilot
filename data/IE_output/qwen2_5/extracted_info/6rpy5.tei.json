    "measured_by": "Two-Parameter Power Discounting Model",
    "justification": "The two-parameter power discounting function was identified as the optimal model for describing subjective value in effort-based decision-making, allowing for flexible representation of individual differences in effort valuation (Aridan et al., 2019; Arulpragasam et al., 2018)."

    "measured_by": "Two-Parameter Power Discounting Model",
    "justification": "This model was also found to best capture subjective value in risk-related decisions, enabling a comparison of effort and risk discounting within a common computational framework (Aridan et al., 2019; Arulpragasam et al., 2018)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Neural Correlates of Subjective Value",
    "measured_by": "Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA)",
    "justification": "MVPA showed that the dmPFC represents task-independent subjective value information across effort-based and risky decision-making, supporting the common currency theory and expanding the scope of value processing beyond the vmPFC (Jimura & Poldrack, 2012; Kahnt, 2018)."

    "topic_or_construct": " effort-reward integration",
    "measured_by": "combo of univariate fMRI analysis & multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)",
    "justification": "Combining univariate and MVPA techniques allowed the researchers to bridge divergent results from previous studies and to show the critical role of the dmPFC in computing subjective value, suggesting its importance as a potential hub in value-based decision-making independent of cost types (Gross et al., 2014; Piva et al., 2019; Pogoda et al., 2016)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Effort-based valuation",
    "measured_by": "procedure to estimate indifference points (stepwise titration method)",
    "justification": "By estimating indifference points, the researchers could isolate the subjective value of effort-related rewards, thus providing a nuanced understanding of how effort costs influence decision-making (Westbrook et al., 2013; Westbrook et al., 2019)."
