    "topic_or_construct": "Choice anxiety",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported anxiety ratings",
    "justification": "The study directly measured participants' experienced anxiety while making choices by having them rate their anxiety on a scale after each choice task. This measurement was used across Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice value",
    "measured_by": "Bipolar rating scale (-10 to 10)",
    "justification": "In Study 3, participants rated each product on a bipolar scale, which included negative values, to measure the set value more accurately. This allowed for a direct test of anxiety towards low-valued items."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice value",
    "measured_by": "Liking ratings (0 to 10)",
    "justification": "In Study 1 and Study 2, participants evaluated products on a unipolar scale (0-10). This was used to determine the subjective value of sets, which influenced anxiety levels."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice anxiety",
    "measured_by": "fMRI measurement (dACC and AI activity)",
    "justification": "In Study 4, the researchers used fMRI to measure brain activity in anxiety-related regions (dACC and AI) while participants were making choices. The brain activity was positively correlated with self-reported anxiety ratings."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Set salience",
    "measured_by": "Calculated difference between set value and neutral point",
    "justification": "Set salience was calculated based on the absolute difference between the imputed neutral midpoint (average value assigned by participants) and the average value of the products in each choice set. This was used as a predictor of anxiety in the studies, particularly in Study 1 and Study 3."
