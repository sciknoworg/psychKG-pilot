    "measured_by": "Adapted Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire (LEAP-Q)",
    "justification": "The study uses the LEAP-Q to assess participants' proficiency and language use, which supports the measurement of FLE in decision-making and reasoning tasks. The instrument helps identify the participants' language background and experience, crucial for understanding FLE."

    "topic_or_construct": "Judgment of Bullshit Statements",
    "measured_by": "Five-point Likert scale (profoundness ratings)",
    "justification": "Participants rated the profundity of bullshit statements on a five-point Likert scale from 'not at all profound' to 'definitely profound'. This measurement tool was used to evaluate how foreign language affects people's judgment of nonsensical statements."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotional Valence",
    "measured_by": "Language-specific bullshit and mundane statements",
    "justification": "Statement materials were divided into three emotional valence groups (negative, neutral, positive). These variations were used to test the effect of emotional valence on the profundity judgment of bullshit statements in native vs. foreign language."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Dual Process Theory engagement",
    "measured_by": "Statement profundity ratings and post-hoc tests",
    "justification": "The differences in profundity ratings between emotional and neutral statements, analyzed through post-hoc tests with Bonferroni correction, indicate the level of Type 1 (intuitive) and Type 2 (deliberative) processing engaged while judging the statements in L1 and L2."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Load",
    "measured_by": "Language proficiency scales and self-assessment ratings",
    "justification": "Participants\u2019 language proficiency ratings, including self-assessment of speaking, understanding, and reading abilities, indicate the cognitive load demanded by L2 use. Less proficient speakers exhibited modulated effects of emotional valence on statement judgment, implying increased cognitive load impacts Type 2 processes."
