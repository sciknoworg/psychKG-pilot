    "measured_by": "Number of correct, incorrect, and confabulated details",
    "justification": "The study evaluated eyewitness accuracy by counting the total number of correct, incorrect, and confabulated details provided by participants in their statements after different context reinstatement techniques, including virtual context reinstatement, physical context reinstatement, and mental context reinstatement."

    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence-quality relationship",
    "measured_by": "Correlation between confidence ratings and statement accuracy",
    "justification": "The relationship between an eyewitness's confidence in their testimony and its actual quality was measured by calculating the correlation between participants' confidence ratings on a six-item scale and the number of correct, incorrect, and confabulated details in their statements."

    "topic_or_construct": "Context Reinstatement Effectiveness",
    "measured_by": "Analyzes of variance and post hoc analyses",
    "justification": "The effectiveness of different types of context reinstatement (PCR, MCR, VCR) on the quality of eyewitness testimonies was assessed using analyses of variance, with post hoc analyses to explore the differences between conditions in terms of reported details and accuracy."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Free recall performance",
    "measured_by": "Univariate analyses of variance",
    "justification": "Free recall performance, which refers to the accuracy and quality of spontaneous statements, was measured using univariate analyses of variance to determine the effects of different context reinstatement techniques on the number of correct, incorrect, and confabulated details."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cued recall performance",
    "measured_by": "Analysis of variance",
    "justification": "The analysis of variance was used to evaluate how different context reinstatement techniques influenced cued recall performance, measured by the number of correctly recalled details in courtroom-like descriptions."
