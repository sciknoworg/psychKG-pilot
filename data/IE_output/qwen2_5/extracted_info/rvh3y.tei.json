    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)",
    "justification": "The CRT measures the ability to suppress intuitive but incorrect answers in favor of more accurate, analytical responses when solving mathematical word problems. This is supported by its widespread use in assessing cognitive reflection, as detailed in the opening paragraph. (Frederick, 2005)"

    "topic_or_construct": "Belief Bias",
    "measured_by": "Syllogisms Logical Validity Assessment",
    "justification": "The belief bias score is calculated from participants assessing the logical validity of syllogisms, where some have unbelievable conclusions that logically follow, and others have believable conclusions that do not follow logically. This test captures how beliefs can influence logical reasoning. (Evans, Barston, & Pollard, 1983; Markovits & Nantel, 1989)"

    "measured_by": "Revised Paranormal Belief Scale",
    "justification": "Paranormal beliefs are assessed using the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, which includes items like 'It is possible to communicate with the dead' rated on a 7-point Likert scale. This scale measures various domains of supernatural and paranormal beliefs. (Tobacyc, 2004)"

    "topic_or_construct": "Denominator Neglect",
    "measured_by": "Game of Chance Scenarios",
    "justification": "Denominator neglect is measured through a game of chance that presents participants with options of selecting tickets from bowls with different probabilities of winning, assessing the tendency to ignore the denominator in probabilities. (Kirkpatrick & Epstein, 1992; Toplak et al., 2014)"

    "measured_by": "Lipkus Numeracy Scale",
    "justification": "Numeracy is assessed using the Lipkus Numeracy Scale, which consists of 11 mathematical tasks aimed at evaluating basic probability understanding, converting percentages to proportions, and comparing different magnitudes. This instrument captures general numeracy skills effectively. (Lipkus, Samsa, & Rimer, 2001)"

    "topic_or_construct": "Actively Open-Minded Thinking",
    "measured_by": "Actively Open-Minded Thinking Scale",
    "justification": "Actively open-minded thinking is assessed with a scale that includes statements like 'People should revise their beliefs in response to new information or evidence.' Participants rate their agreement on a 5-point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating a stronger belief in open-mindedness. (Stanovich & West, 1997)"
