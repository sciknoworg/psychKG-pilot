    "topic_or_construct": "anhedonia",
    "measured_by": "Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)",
    "justification": "The paper states that the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale is commonly used to assess hedonic capacity in anhedonic individuals, as it measures the ability to experience pleasure based on self-reports."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reward valuation",
    "measured_by": "Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT)",
    "justification": "The EEfRT is used to assess how frequently individuals choose one reward over another and their willingness to engage in physical effort to obtain rewards, revealing less willingness to expend greater effort in anhedonic individuals."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reward prediction error",
    "measured_by": "Monetary Incentive Delay task (MID)",
    "justification": "The MID task measures neural responses to cues that predict potential monetary rewards, showing that anhedonic individuals exhibit lower hemodynamic responses, especially in the ventral striatum, during reward anticipation."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reward learning",
    "measured_by": "Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT)",
    "justification": "Studies using the PRT reveal that depressed participants show a lower learning rate and decreased development of reward response bias, suggesting impaired reward learning associated with anhedonia."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "desire and motivation",
    "measured_by": "Positive Valence System Scale",
    "justification": "The Positive Valence Systems Scale is proposed as a useful alternative to measure the Research Domain Criteria's positive valence system subdomain and better relate to differences in effort valuation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "positive mood reactivity",
    "measured_by": "Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA)",
    "justification": "EMA studies assess the reported levels of enjoyment in response to daily events, showing that depressed patients do not report lower reactivity to positive events despite higher self-reported anhedonia scores."
