    "justification": "The article explains that risk perception varies depending on how probability statements are framed, as demonstrated by experiments such as those by Slovic, Monahan, and McGregor (2000), where clinicians rated risks differently based on the format of probabilistic information presented."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Heuristics in risk assessment",
    "measured_by": "Experiments involving risk scenarios",
    "justification": "The text describes experiments like those by Kahneman and Tversky (1974) that illustrate how individuals use heuristics such as representativeness, availability, and anchoring-and-adjustment to assess probabilities. These experiments measure how such heuristics bias risk judgments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Psychological probabilities",
    "measured_by": "Psychological studies involving subjective judgments",
    "justification": "The paper describes various psychological probabilities (y, y\u00b5, y\u0192, and yb) through empirical studies, like those by Vail (1954), showing how these subjective estimations of probabilities differ from mathematical ones and are influenced by factors like event description."

    "topic_or_construct": "Influence of information format on risk perception",
    "measured_by": "Likelihood judgment experiments",
    "justification": "Studies like that by Slovic et al. (2000, Experiment 3) demonstrate how different formats of presenting risk information (e.g., probabilities vs. frequencies) affect subjective assessments of risk, as when frequency formats led participants to perceive higher risks."

    "measured_by": "Image and affect rating studies",
    "justification": "Research such as that by MacGregor, Slovic, Dreman, and Berry (2000) measures the impact of images and affect associated with different industry groups on financial forecasting decisions, showing how affective feelings influence perceived risks and benefits."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Framing effects on risk-taking",
    "measured_by": "Decision-making under uncertainty experiments",
    "justification": "The text references the work of Roszkowski and Snelbecker (1990), where financial service professionals demonstrated drastically different risk preferences based on the framing of the problem as sure gains versus probable outcomes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotion's role in risk-taking",
    "measured_by": "Experiments measuring physiological responses",
    "justification": "The article cites Bechara, Tranel, and Damasio (2000), who designed a gambling task that used skin conductivity responses (SCRs) to measure anticipatory emotions, revealing how these emotions guided risky decisions even in the absence of conscious reasoning."
