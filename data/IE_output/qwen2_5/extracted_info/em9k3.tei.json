    "measured_by": "functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)",
    "justification": "The article mentions that subjective value signals are correlated with neural activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), indicating that fMRI is used to measure subjective value."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "willingness to pay (WTP)",
    "measured_by": "fMRI",
    "justification": "WTP is linked to neural activity in brain regions like the vmPFC, as shown by fMRI studies, demonstrating its utility in measuring subjective value linked to food choices."

    "topic_or_construct": "social influence on food valuation",
    "measured_by": "fMRI",
    "justification": "The neuroimaging experiment by Nook and Zaki (2015) revealed that neural activity in regions like the ventral striatum and anterior prefrontal cortex were associated with the degree of social conformity in food valuation."

    "topic_or_construct": "brand influence on food choice",
    "measured_by": "fMRI",
    "justification": "McClure et al. (2004) used fMRI to demonstrate that brand information alters neural activity in the vmPFC and dlPFC, indicating the effect of brand images on food valuation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "price effect on food preference",
    "measured_by": "fMRI",
    "justification": "The study by Hare et al. (2008) employed fMRI to show that the price of food and willingness to pay were encoded in specific brain regions, impacting purchasing decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "impact of packaging on food choice",
    "measured_by": "fMRI",
    "justification": "Van der Laan et al. (2012) used fMRI to show that packaging design influenced neural activity in regions like the striatum, indicating its role in food preference."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "effect of labels on food valuation",
    "measured_by": "fMRI",
    "justification": "The study by Enax et al. (2015) found that labels modulate neural activity in the vmPFC and other regions via functional connectivity, showing their impact on food valuation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "impact of taste and flavor on valuation",
    "measured_by": "fMRI",
    "justification": "Small et al. (2007) demonstrated through fMRI that different brain regions\u2014such as the insular cortex, lOFC, and amygdala\u2014are involved in processing taste and flavor to compute overall subjective value."
