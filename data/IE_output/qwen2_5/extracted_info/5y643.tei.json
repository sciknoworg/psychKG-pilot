    "measured_by": "Choice behaviour and attention in a two-armed contextual bandit task",
    "justification": "The paper employs a two-armed contextual bandit task, based on a combination of the multi-armed bandit task and the learned predictiveness design. Choice behaviour is measured by the selection of high-value versus low-value responses, while attention is measured by the participants' gaze fixation on predictive versus non-predictive cues."

    "topic_or_construct": "Unexpected Uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Variability in rewards introduced suddenly in a two-armed contextual bandit task",
    "justification": "Unexpected uncertainty is operationalized by introducing variability in rewards at a set point in the task without prior warning to the participants. This is exemplified by the sudden change condition in the experiment, where reward variability starts after a period of deterministic outcomes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Expected Uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Gradual increase in reward variability in a two-armed contextual bandit task",
    "justification": "Expected uncertainty is operationalized by gradually increasing the level of reward variability over time, as exemplified by the gradual change condition in the experiment, where uncertainty increases slowly over the course of stage one."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attentional Exploration",
    "measured_by": "Proportion of trial time fixating on both predictive and non-predictive cues",
    "justification": "Attentional exploration is measured by tracking participants' eye-gaze to assess the total proportion of trial time they spend looking at both predictive and non-predictive cues. Increased attention to cues overall is interpreted as exploratory attention."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attentional Exploitation",
    "measured_by": "Proportion of trial time fixating on the predictive cue over the non-predictive cue",
    "justification": "Attentional exploitation is measured by analyzing the proportion of trial time that participants spend fixating on the predictive cue in relation to the non-predictive cue. A greater bias towards the predictive cue indicates attentional exploitation."
