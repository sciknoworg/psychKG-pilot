    "justification": "A recent study provided a mechanistic account of the behavioral pattern using the multi-attribute time-dependent drift-diffusion model to compare the effects of perceived tastiness and healthiness on food choice."

    "measured_by": "Functional MRI and behavioral tasks",
    "justification": "Studies showed that the subjective value of a food item can be predicted by a linear combination of nutritive attributes, which is supported by neuroimaging data using functional MRI alongside behavioral tasks."

    "measured_by": "Linear regression and cross-validated correlations",
    "justification": "The linear regression demonstrated that low-level visual information predicts nutrient information and subjective value, and cross-validated correlations were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of these values."

    "justification": "Chikazoe et al. used ultra-high-resolution fMRI combined with multivariate analysis to demonstrate that taste qualities are represented in the insula and response patterns to viewing and tasting foods are distinct."
