    "measured_by": "Positive vs. Negative framing conditions",
    "justification": "Framing was manipulated by presenting options either positively (e.g., \"Notify me\") or negatively (e.g., \"Do NOT notify me\"), measuring how these different wordings influenced participants' willingness to consent to receive future notifications."

    "measured_by": "Temporary vs. Permanent choice conditions",
    "justification": "The study introduced conditions where the organ donation decision was either temporary (renewable every 3 years) or permanent to measure the impact of choice permanence on default effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "Interaction between Framing and Default Effects",
    "measured_by": "2 (Framing: Positive vs. Negative) x 3 (Default: Opt-In vs. Opt-Out vs. No-Default) conditions",
    "justification": "The study combined framing manipulation with default options to measure how framing conditions influenced the effectiveness of default effects in different scenarios."
