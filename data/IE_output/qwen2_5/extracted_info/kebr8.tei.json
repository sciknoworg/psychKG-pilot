    "measured_by": "Full diffusion model parameters (drift rate, threshold, starting point, non-decision time)",
    "justification": "The paper utilized the full diffusion model to estimate parameters such as drift rate (v), threshold (a), starting point (z), and non-decision time (ter), which helped determine the optimal thresholds that maximize RR. These parameter estimates were then compared to participants' actual performance thresholds to assess their proximity to RR optimality."

    "measured_by": "Evidence accumulation modeling (EAM)",
    "justification": "EAM was employed throughout the paper to analyze choice response times and infer latent decision-making variables. The framework was crucial for understanding the balance between speed and accuracy, which is central to optimal decision-making under variable task conditions."

    "measured_by": "Median response time (MRT) and proportion correct (PC)",
    "justification": "The speed-accuracy trade-off under different task conditions was measured using the combination of median response time and proportion correct. This provided insight into participants' adaptive strategies to maximize reward rate within the given constraints."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cautious vs. urgent decision strategy",
    "measured_by": "Decision threshold (a)",
    "justification": "The decision threshold parameter in the diffusion model was used to gauge how cautious or urgent participants were in their decision-making. Higher thresholds indicated more cautious behavior, while lower thresholds suggested urgency."
