    "justification": "The diffusion model was applied to decompose motion coherence response time and accuracy data from children and adults into underlying psychological processes, specifically drift rate, boundary separation, and non-decision time. This approach revealed age-related differences in these parameters, such as lower drift rates and wider boundary separations in younger children compared to older children and adults."

    "measured_by": "Diffusion model parameters",
    "justification": "The study investigated relationships between diffusion model parameters, age, and EEG measures. Parameter estimation and model comparison approaches suggested age-related changes in drift rate and boundary separation, which were more pronounced in perceptual decision-making tasks, highlighting the diffusion model's capability to uncover latent psychological processes not evident from accuracy and response time data alone."

    "measured_by": "Centro-parietal positivity (CPP) EEG component",
    "justification": "Reliable components analysis was used to identify response-locked EEG components that resembled a decision-making process. The most reliable component, maximal over centro-parietal electrodes, resembled the CPP previously linked to drift rate, with steeper ramps linked to higher drift rates. This link suggests a neural basis for age-related differences in perceptual decision-making."

    "measured_by": "Diffusion model parameters",
    "justification": "The diffusion model parameters helped distinguish between decisional and non-decisional components, providing insights into speed-accuracy tradeoffs. Results showed that younger children may exhibit increased response caution and slower sensory evidence accumulation rates, suggesting that both decisional and non-decisional processes are immature in younger populations."
