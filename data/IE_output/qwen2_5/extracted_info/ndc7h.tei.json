    "measured_by": "Judgement Bias Task",
    "justification": "The judgement bias task is used to assess the relationship between affective state and decision-making under ambiguity. Participants' responses to ambiguous stimuli are considered as indicators of their affective state, with more 'optimistic' decisions being associated with more positively valenced affect."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Affective valence",
    "measured_by": "Self-report affect grid",
    "justification": "Participants reported their current mood using a 9x9 computerized self-report affect grid. The horizontal movements on the grid represent changes in mood valence, with movements to the right indicating a more positively valenced mood. This self-report method directly captures the subjective experience of affective valence."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Affective arousal",
    "measured_by": "Self-report affect grid",
    "justification": "The self-report affect grid also measures affective arousal through vertical movements, with upwards movement indicating higher levels of arousal. This allows for the assessment of both valence and arousal components of participants' affective states."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making biases",
    "measured_by": "POMDP model",
    "justification": "The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model was used to characterize decision-making biases in the judgement bias task. The model includes parameters for decision stochasticity, biases toward 'optimistic' decision-making, and effects of within-task experience on these biases."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward responsiveness",
    "measured_by": "Reward Responsiveness Task",
    "justification": "The Reward Responsiveness Task is mentioned as a method used in previous studies to assess how individuals react to rewards. While not the primary method used in this study, it represents a related construct of interest in the broader context of affect and decision-making."
