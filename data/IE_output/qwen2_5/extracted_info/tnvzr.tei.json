    "topic_or_construct": "Complexity aversion",
    "measured_by": "Risky lotteries with varying numbers of outcomes",
    "justification": "The study uses risky lotteries with differing numbers of outcomes to investigate complexity aversion, where complexity is operationalized by the number of outcomes (simple vs. complex lotteries). This measurement approach allowed the researchers to manipulate complexity and observe its effects on decision-making and valuation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive ability",
    "measured_by": "Short version of the Hagen Matrices Test (HMT-S)",
    "justification": "The researchers employed the short version of the Hagen Matrices Test (HMT-S) to measure participants' cognitive ability. This test is a validated measure of induction intelligence and was used to assess individual differences in participants' cognitive capacities, which were hypothesized to moderate complexity aversion."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Valuation",
    "measured_by": "Minimum selling price indicated by participants",
    "justification": "In both experiments, valuation was measured by having participants indicate their minimum selling price for the presented lotteries. This method allowed the researchers to assess the value participants ascribed to different lotteries, including simple and complex ones."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice",
    "measured_by": "Binary choice between simple and complex lotteries",
    "justification": "The choice behavior was measured by presenting participants with a binary choice task, where they had to select between a simple and a complex lottery. This methodology helped investigate complexity aversion in a binary decision-making context."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived complexity and estimation",
    "measured_by": "Mean estimation task and confidence ratings",
    "justification": "The estimation task involved participants estimating the mean of the presented lotteries, with confidence ratings used to gauge their perceived precision. This approach explored the perceptual aspects associated with complexity in valuations."
