    "measured_by": "continuous-outcome task",
    "justification": "The article states that Wilken and Ma (2004) adapted the continuous-outcome task to study how the precision of visual working memory (VWM) changes with memory load. It is widely used by VWM researchers because it yields entire distributions of retrieval errors rather than just error rates."

    "topic_or_construct": "perception of motion direction",
    "measured_by": "continuous-outcome task",
    "justification": "The continuous-outcome task has been used to study the perception of motion direction, as highlighted by studies such as Bae & Luck (2019) and Smith et al. (2022), emphasizing its utility in capturing continuous decision-making processes related to motion perception."

    "measured_by": "continuous-outcome task",
    "justification": "The continuous-outcome task has also been employed to investigate associative recall from episodic memory, as demonstrated by research such as Harlow & Donaldson (2013) and Zhou et al. (2021), indicating its applicability in examining memory retrieval processes."

    "topic_or_construct": "decisions about stimulus attributes (color, orientation, direction of motion)",
    "measured_by": "continuous-outcome task",
    "justification": "The article mentions that decisions about stimulus attributes like color, orientation, or direction of motion, where response alternatives form a closed circular domain, are most widely studied using the continuous-outcome task. This approach captures the nuances of perceptual decision-making in these domains."
