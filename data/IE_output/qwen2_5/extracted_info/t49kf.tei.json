    "justification": "Participants watched animated bus journeys in a virtual environment to make route choice decisions, which allowed researchers to assess how perceived time attributes influence decision-making. The animations provided a method to manipulate and observe how individuals perceive waiting and in-vehicle times."

    "topic_or_construct": "perceived waiting time",
    "measured_by": "structured time estimation task",
    "justification": "Participants took part in a structured time estimation task where they were asked to estimate the average waiting, in-vehicle, and walking times per bus journey. This method provided insight into how accurately participants perceived waiting times as distinct from their perception of other time attributes."

    "measured_by": "statements on importance scales",
    "justification": "Participants used a scale from 0 to 100 to state the relative importance of waiting, in-vehicle, and journey times. This approach helped to reveal individual preferences and subjective judgments of time attributes relevant to decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "preferences for time attributes (waiting vs. in-vehicle time)",
    "measured_by": "route choice decisions in animated and numeric formats",
    "justification": "The experiment included conditions where participants made route choices based on both perceived time from animations and provided numerical values. Analyzing these choices helped in understanding the preference gaps between waiting and in-vehicle times when perception is considered."
