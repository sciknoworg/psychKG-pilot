    "measured_by": "Coin Task Paradigm",
    "justification": "The study used the coin task paradigm to measure how participants integrated prior expectation and sensory evidence by varying uncertainty levels. The reliability of the task was demonstrated through good test-retest reliability, showing that it is a temporally stable measure of individual differences in Bayesian information integration."

    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective likelihood variance",
    "measured_by": "Likelihood-only estimation task",
    "justification": "The subjective likelihood variance was measured through the likelihood-only task, which provides a proxy for participants' perceived uncertainty in likelihood information. However, this parameter demonstrated weak test-retest reliability, suggesting potential practice effects and less temporal stability compared to other measures."

    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective prior variance",
    "measured_by": "Coin Task Paradigm and Trial-by-trial sensory weight",
    "justification": "By analyzing the trial-by-trial sensory weight across different conditions, the study estimated participants' subjective model of where each thrower was likely to throw the coin. The paradigm demonstrated good to moderate temporal stability in this measure, indicating reliable individual differences in perceived uncertainty of prior information."
