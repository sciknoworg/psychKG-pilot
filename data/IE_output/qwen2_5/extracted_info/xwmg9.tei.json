    "measured_by": "Task changes and performance trends",
    "justification": "The participants' decision-making strategies were measured by analyzing their performance trends in response to various changes in the experimental blocks, such as visual changes, goal changes, and terrain changes, to determine whether they employed model-free, model-based, or hybrid strategies."

    "topic_or_construct": "Environment complexity",
    "measured_by": "Fractal dimension of environments",
    "justification": "Participants' ability to navigate environments with different levels of complexity was measured using environments with varying fractal dimensions, showing that performance was best in low-to-mid-range fractal complexity."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Adaptation to environmental changes",
    "measured_by": "Recovery time and performance after changes",
    "justification": "The adaptation to environmental changes was measured by observing participants' recovery time and performance improvement across different stages after the introduction of changes (e.g., visual, goal, or terrain changes)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Hybrid decision-making strategy",
    "measured_by": "Successor Representation",
    "justification": "The hybrid decision-making strategy was measured using the behavioral signature of the Successor Representation algorithm, analyzing participants' ability to adapt more quickly to changes in goal location than to changes in environmental structure."
