    "measured_by": "latent-cause inference model",
    "justification": "The study employed a latent-cause inference model to simulate and analyze estimation biases resulting from variations in distributions of events. This model supports the hypothesis that negativity bias, influenced by the distributional sparsity of negative events, can be explained by biases toward events that are rare and/or variable."

    "measured_by": "average donation estimate task",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to estimate the average donation amount after observing sequences of donation amounts with manipulated sparsity conditions. This task allowed for the assessment of how the distribution of donations (sparse versus dense) influenced the overall estimation, providing insight into the negativity bias mechanism."

    "topic_or_construct": "latent cause inference",
    "measured_by": "Pearce-Hall dynamic-learning-rate model",
    "justification": "The Pearce-Hall model was contrasted with the latent-cause inference model to identify the underlying mechanism driving estimation biases. This model, with its dynamic learning rates, served as an alternative explanation predicted to show density biases, helping to disentangle the role of latent cause inference."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "impression formation",
    "measured_by": "group estimation task",
    "justification": "Participants formed impressions of groups (e.g., towns or casinos) by observing a series of individual instances and estimating average metrics like coffee bean weight or slot machine earnings. These tasks provided insight into how sparsity in event distributions affects group-level impressions and biases."
