    "measured_by": "Bayesian Confidence Hypothesis (BCH)",
    "justification": "The article mentions that the Bayesian Confidence Hypothesis (BCH) is often considered the most prominent theory of confidence. It posits that confidence reflects the probability of being correct, making BCH a direct theoretical framework for measuring confidence ratings through subjective probability."

    "measured_by": "confidence in raw evidence space (CRES)",
    "justification": "The CRES model is described as an alternative to BCH, where confidence is given by setting criteria directly on the raw evidence. The article explains that despite BCH's prominence, the results of the experiments support CRES better, indicating CRES also measures confidence through the strength of sensory evidence rather than probability calculations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "confidence computations",
    "measured_by": "model comparisons",
    "justification": "The experimental designs and analyses relied on fitting and comparing CRES and BCH models with various auxiliary assumptions. The justification for this measurement comes from the models' ability to predict and fit empirical data of confidence criteria more accurately in internal evidence and log-likelihood ratio space."
