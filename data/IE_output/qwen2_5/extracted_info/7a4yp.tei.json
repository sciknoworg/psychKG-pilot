    "topic_or_construct": "prosocial behavior",
    "measured_by": "Prosocial Ecology Task",
    "justification": "The article describes how prosocial behavior was measured using a Prosocial Ecology Task, where participants watched a movie and had the opportunity to interrupt it to earn rewards by exerting effort, either for themselves or an anonymous other person under different environmental conditions. This setup allowed the researchers to assess when and how participants chose to help others."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "environmental influence on prosocial decisions",
    "measured_by": "Prosocial Ecology Task",
    "justification": "The Prosocial Ecology Task manipulated the environmental richness by presenting opportunities in poor or rich environments during the experiment. This helped in measuring the environmental effects on participants' decisions to act prosocially, showing that participants were more likely to help others in poor compared to rich environments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "opportunity costs",
    "measured_by": "computational modelling",
    "justification": "The study employed computational models to quantify opportunity costs in different environments and for different recipients. The models included distinct opportunity cost parameters for each condition, and the results showed that opportunity costs were lower for helping others in poor environments compared to rich environments."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "empathy and emotional motivation",
    "measured_by": "Questionnaire for Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE)",
    "justification": "The QCAE was used to measure individual differences in empathy and emotional motivation. Correlation analyses revealed that higher levels of empathy and emotional motivation were associated with lower opportunity costs when deciding to help others, indicating that these traits influence prosocial decisions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "utilitarian beliefs",
    "measured_by": "Oxford Utilitarianism Scale (OUS)",
    "justification": "The Oxford Utilitarianism Scale was used to measure utilitarian beliefs. The study found that higher scores on utilitarianism were associated with lower opportunity costs when deciding to help others, indicating that utilitarian beliefs also influence prosocial behavior in poor environments."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "anxiety and depression",
    "measured_by": "Depression and Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS)",
    "justification": "The shortened DASS was used to measure anxiety and depression. Analysis of these traits did not find a significant relationship with opportunity costs for prosocial decisions, suggesting that psychiatric traits were not influencing the decision-making in this context."
