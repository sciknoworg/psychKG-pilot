    "justification": "The study employed a range of machine-learning algorithms to predict similarity judgments of monetary amounts and time delays from participants' data. These algorithms, particularly C5.0, random forest, and support vector machines, were found to perform well in predicting these judgments with high accuracy."

    "justification": "The analysis identified that the numerical difference predictor was the most important, followed by logistic, discriminability, and ratio. These predictors were tested for their contributions across various algorithms to predict similarity judgments with high robustness."

    "measured_by": "varImp function in the caret package",
    "justification": "The varImp function provided a measure of predictor importance across different algorithms. It was used to assess which predictors were most useful in making the judgment classifications, offering insight into the robustness of importance across various machine-learning models."
