    "measured_by": "monetary lottery tasks",
    "justification": "Risk-taking attitudes are often assessed through monetary lottery tasks, which examine how people make decisions under risk. Participants choose between a secure option offering a guaranteed reward and a risky option offering a potentially larger reward under uncertainty."

    "measured_by": "inter-temporal choice tasks",
    "justification": "Temporal discounting preferences can be measured using inter-temporal choice tasks, where participants choose between a smaller amount of reward delivered sooner and a larger amount of reward delivered after a longer delay."

    "measured_by": "effort-based decision-making paradigms",
    "justification": "Effort discounting preferences can be measured using effort-based decision-making paradigms, where participants are asked to make choices between options that differ in the reward offered and the effort required to obtain it."

    "measured_by": "observation of others' behavior",
    "justification": "Informational influence helps people adopt the most appropriate behavior in uncertain situations, especially when they believe others have better information or knowledge. This influence can be measured by observing how people's decisions change after seeing the actions or choices of others."

    "topic_or_construct": "normative influence",
    "measured_by": "conformity to group norms",
    "justification": "Normative influence is measured by the extent to which people align their behavior with group norms to gain social approval or avoid social punishment. This is often observed in situations where conformity to a group leads to social rewards."
