    "measured_by": "Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task",
    "justification": "Knutson and colleagues developed the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task to examine reward anticipation and receipt, showing increased activation in ventral striatum during reward anticipation and in the VMPFC during reward receipt."

    "measured_by": "gambling games",
    "justification": "Studies have utilized gambling games to assess reward processing, including a simple card-guessing task by Delgado and colleagues, which found that monetary rewards versus punishments evoke striatum activation."

    "topic_or_construct": "reward processing",
    "measured_by": "neuroimaging studies with concrete rewards (money, food)",
    "justification": "Researchers have employed concrete rewards such as money and food in neuroimaging studies to investigate reward processing, demonstrating activation in various brain regions associated with positive valence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reward processing",
    "measured_by": "neuroimaging studies with abstract rewards (social status, attractive faces)",
    "justification": "Abstract rewards like social status and attractive faces have been used in neuroimaging studies to explore reward processing, showing similar activation patterns in brain regions associated with reward."

    "measured_by": "single-unit recordings and RPE signals",
    "justification": "Schultz and colleagues utilized single-unit recordings to investigate RPE signals in the midbrain, demonstrating changes in neuron activity in response to reward predictions and cue-reward associations."

    "topic_or_construct": "reward processing",
    "measured_by": "neuroimaging studies with aversive outcomes",
    "justification": "Some studies have used aversive outcomes like electric shocks, which subjects aim to avoid, to investigate reward processing. Although beyond the chapter's main focus, this method highlights the rewarding properties of avoiding aversive outcomes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "subjective value of rewards",
    "measured_by": "neuroimaging studies varying reward types",
    "justification": "VMPFC and striatum have been observed to contain reward-related signals for multiple types of rewards, suggesting these areas might represent different rewards on a common scale."
