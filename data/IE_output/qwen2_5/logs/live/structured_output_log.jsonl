As detailed in the Introduction, the optimal policy is proportional to the exponentiated action values, weighted by an inverse temperature parameter \u03b2, and the marginal action distribution. At higher policy complexity, \u03b2 increases, which decreases the influence of the marginal action distribution P (a) on the policy.' This indicates that the model specifically focuses on the probability of action repetition as a means to measure perseveration."}, {"topic_or_construct": "R1421220", "measured_by": "R1421221", "justification": "Time-averaged reward, an important construct for evaluating the performance of decisions made under various conditions, is measured through the trial-averaged reward. As per the analysis in the text, 'To see how the theory predicts a speed-accuracy trade-off, we can visualize the relationship between time-averaged reward and policy complexity in Figure 1F, where we varied the ITI. To maximize time-averaged reward, humans should decrease policy complexity when ITIs are short; although these policies result in less trial-averaged reward, they increase time-averaged reward because they allow agents to perform more actions due to smaller decoding time cost.' This indicates that the trial-averaged reward is used as an instrument to evaluate time-averaged reward."}]}
