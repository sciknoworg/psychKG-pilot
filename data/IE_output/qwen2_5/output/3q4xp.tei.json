    "measured_by": "Comparison of Financial Expectations and Financial Outcomes",
    "justification": "Unrealistic optimism was measured by comparing individuals' expectations about their next year's financial circumstances with the actual financial outcomes. Specifically, the difference between financial expectations (rated on a 3-point scale) and financial outcomes (categorized on a 3-point scale) was used to construct a 5-point scale of unrealistic optimism. This operationalization allowed for individual-level assessment of forecast accuracy."

    "measured_by": "Composite Cognitive Test",
    "justification": "Cognitive ability was assessed using five individual measures: Word Recall, Verbal Fluency, Subtraction Test, Fluid Reasoning, and Numerical Reasoning. These measures covered domains such as memory, verbal skills, and reasoning. A composite cognitive ability score was created by standardizing and combining these scores, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of cognitive function."

    "measured_by": "Self-Reported Financial Mood Scale",
    "justification": "Financial expectations were obtained through responses to a single question asked at each wave of the survey: 'Looking ahead, how do you think you will be financially a year from now?' Participants could answer with 'Better off,' 'Worse off,' or 'About the same.' This provided a simple yet effective scale for measuring short-term financial outlooks and facilitated the comparison with actual outcomes."
