    "measured_by": "Decision-making tasks involving lotteries",
    "justification": "Risk preferences are examined using decision-making tasks involving lotteries to assess choices between high-variance and low-variance alternatives, which helps in understanding risk-averse vs. risk-seeking behavior."

    "measured_by": "Ternary choice tasks with decoys",
    "justification": "Contextual preference reversals, including attraction, similarity, and compromise effects, are measured using ternary choice tasks where a decoy is introduced to observe shifts in preferences."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision history biases",
    "measured_by": "Choice tasks with repeated trials",
    "justification": "Decision history biases, such as repeating or avoiding previous choices, are studied using choice tasks with repeated trials to understand serial dependence in decision-making."

    "measured_by": "Multiattribute choice sets",
    "justification": "Relative coding effects are measured by varying the attributes and values in multiattribute choice sets and observing changes in preference, using models like divisive normalization."
