    "measured_by": "Cups Task",
    "justification": "The article uses the Cups Task, a computerized decision-making task, to measure participants' sensitivity to reward and risk while making choices between certain and uncertain financial outcomes. This task allows for the decomposition of risk and reward elements to study behavioral sensitivity to these constructs independently."

    "topic_or_construct": "Self-reported Real-world Risk-taking Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Domain Specific Risk-Taking Scale (DOSPERT)",
    "justification": "The DOSPERT is used to measure participants' self-reported likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors across various domains such as social, recreational, financial, health, and ethical. This scale provides a real-world risk-taking behavior measure to complement the laboratory task findings."

    "topic_or_construct": "Prospect Theory Computational Model Parameters",
    "measured_by": "Prospect Theory Model",
    "justification": "The prospect theory model is employed to formalize how participants process reward and risk information and calculate subjective values for decision-making. The computational parameters derived from this model help understand the cognitive mechanisms driving reward and risk sensitivity."

    "measured_by": "Target Model",
    "justification": "The target model is used to assess the threshold participants set when jointly evaluating reward and risk during decision-making, providing insights into whether individuals with Early Life Adversity (ELA) have different target thresholds compared to those without ELA."
