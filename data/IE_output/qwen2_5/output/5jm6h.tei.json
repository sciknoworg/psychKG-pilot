    "measured_by": "Subjective Percentile Estimates",
    "justification": "The study used subjective percentile estimates to assess participants' perceptions of their social comparative standing for health-related behaviors. Participants were asked to estimate their percentile standing compared to other participants in the study for various health behaviors, providing a measure of their perceived social status relative to others."

    "topic_or_construct": "Accuracy and Bias in Social Comparative Standing",
    "measured_by": "Actual Frequency Reports and Deviation Scores",
    "justification": "To measure accuracy and bias in participants' estimations, the study also assessed actual behavior frequency reports. Deviation scores were calculated between subjective percentile estimates and actual frequency reports, allowing researchers to identify biases and miscalibrations in participants' assessments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Health Behavior Frequency",
    "measured_by": "Absolute Frequency Questions",
    "justification": "For each health-related behavior, participants answered absolute frequency questions, reporting how often they engaged in the behavior within a given time period. These reports were used as a basis for calculating the participants\u2019 objective percentile, contributing to measures of bias and accuracy."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived Norms for Behavior Frequency",
    "measured_by": "Absolute-Other Questions",
    "justification": "Participants were given absolute-other questions, estimating the frequency or proportion of a typical respondent's behavior. The absolute-other estimates were used alongside self-estimates to test for egocentric weighting in percentile estimates, thereby revealing how participants perceive social norms."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Reflection",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)",
    "justification": "To assess cognitive ability and its potential impact on health-related assessments, participants completed the Cognitive Reflection Test. This was used to explore whether individual differences in cognitive capability related to percentile miscalibration or healthiness judgments."
