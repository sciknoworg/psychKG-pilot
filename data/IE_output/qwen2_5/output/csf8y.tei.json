    "justification": "The paper reports on the use of Alpha Span, Numerical Memory Updating, and Spatial N-Back tasks specifically for measuring working memory during the study. These tasks were part of the cognitive training program and were analyzed for their baseline performance and improvements over 100 daily sessions."

    "measured_by": "Diffusion model drift rates",
    "justification": "The expertise in diffusion model parameters, specifically drift rate, was used to measure the efficiency of evidence accumulation in decision-making tasks. The drift rates were obtained from analysis of three CRTs (Choice Reaction Tasks): digits, letters, and figures, with masking times varying from 12 to 94ms."

    "measured_by": "Drift rates from Choice Reaction Tasks",
    "justification": "The drift rate, a parameter from the diffusion model, was used to assess the interindividual differences in perceptual decision-making efficiency, crucial in understanding how perceptual decision tasks related to WM performance."
