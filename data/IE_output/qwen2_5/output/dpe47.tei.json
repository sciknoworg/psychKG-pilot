    "measured_by": "response times, mean deceleration, mean lateral acceleration, standard deviation of lane position",
    "justification": "Driver Readiness, also known as driver availability, was assessed through various measures of takeover performance, including response times, mean deceleration rates, mean lateral acceleration, and standard deviation of lane position. These metrics were used to evaluate the driver's ability to regain control of the vehicle during critical events. The time budget of the situation had the largest impact on these metrics."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Load",
    "measured_by": "N-back task, NASA-TLX",
    "justification": "Cognitive Load was manipulated using the N-back task during episodes of hands-off Level 2 automated driving. Additionally, the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) was used to measure subjective mental workload. The results showed no consistent effect of cognitive load on takeover timing or quality, suggesting that cognitive load in this context did not significantly impair driver response during critical events."

    "topic_or_construct": "Standard Deviation of Horizontal Gaze",
    "measured_by": "Seeing Machines Driver Monitoring System",
    "justification": "The standard deviation of horizontal gaze (SD YAW) was calculated using the Seeing Machines Driver Monitoring System eye tracker sampling at 60 Hz. This metric indicates the dispersion of gaze and was found to be reduced when drivers were cognitively loaded during hands-off L2 automated driving, reflecting a visual tunneling effect."

    "topic_or_construct": "Takeover Quality",
    "measured_by": "mean lateral acceleration (M_LA), mean deceleration (M_D), standard deviation of lane position (SD_LP)",
    "justification": "Takeover quality was assessed using multiple metrics obtained from post-takeover manual driving performance, including mean lateral acceleration, mean deceleration, and the standard deviation of lane position. These measurements provided a nuanced understanding of driver control after regaining vehicle operation from automation."
