    "measured_by": "Public Goods Game (PGG)",
    "justification": "The article describes the use of Public Goods Games (PGGs) in experimental settings to examine behavior in social dilemmas, where participants decide how much of their initial endowment to contribute to a public good."

    "topic_or_construct": "Confusion Learning Hypothesis (CLH)",
    "measured_by": "Public Goods Game (PGG)",
    "justification": "The confusion learning hypothesis explains that participants cooperate out of confusion in early PGGs and learn to defect as they come to understand the payoff structure. The use of PGGs allows testing this hypothesis by manipulating payoff information and observing behavioral changes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social Preferences Hypothesis (SPH)",
    "measured_by": "Public Goods Game (PGG)",
    "justification": "The social preferences hypothesis suggests individuals behave rationally but not selfishly, considering others' outcomes. PGGs are used to test this hypothesis by observing conditional cooperation, where participants contributors based on others' average contributions."

    "topic_or_construct": "General Trust",
    "measured_by": "General Trust Scale (Yamagishi, 1986)",
    "justification": "Participants completed the General Trust Scale as part of the experimental design, suggesting this measure was used to gauge trust levels, a relevant construct related to cooperation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social Value Orientation (SVO)",
    "measured_by": "Task to Measure SVO Parameters",
    "justification": "The task, based on Mizuno & Shimizu (2023), was used to calculate individual values for altruism and equality. These SVO parameters are crucial for understanding how individuals transform payoff structures and make decisions about cooperation in PGGs."
