    "topic_or_construct": "Trust in AI",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral Trust (Weight on Advice, WoA)",
    "justification": "Behavioral trust was measured using the Weight on Advice (WoA), defined as how much an individual relies on the AI's advice. This was calculated using the Judge-Advisor System paradigm, which assesses the degree to which people change their behavior in response to AI recommendations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Trust in AI",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported Trust Scale",
    "justification": "Self-reported trust was measured by asking participants to indicate their current level of trust in the AI system on a scale from 1 (no trust at all) to 10 (full trust) after every legal case. This subjective measure captured participants' inherent perspectives on their trust in AI."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Human-like Explanations",
    "measured_by": "Case-specific Full-sentence Text Explanations",
    "justification": "Human-like explanations were provided as full-sentence text descriptions that contextualized the AI's reasoning process, offering a sense of human-like intelligence. This type of explanation was compared with abstract keyword-based explanations."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Abstract Explanations",
    "measured_by": "Simple Series of Keywords",
    "justification": "Abstract explanations consisted of a simple series of keywords that represented case-specific information but did not provide a contextualized or human-like rationale for the AI's decision-making process."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "System Accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Deviation from Correct Jail Time Estimate",
    "justification": "System accuracy was operationalized by the extent to which the AI's jail time estimate deviated from the actual jail time. Low accuracy was defined as +/-50% deviation, while high accuracy was defined as +/-10%."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Age",
    "measured_by": "Participant Age",
    "justification": "Participants' age was recorded as a demographic variable, which was found to negatively affect behavioral trust, indicating that older participants were less likely to adjust their estimations based on AI advice."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Affinity for Technology",
    "measured_by": "Affinity for Technology Interaction Short Scale (ATI-S)",
    "justification": "Technical affinity was measured using the ATI-S 4-item scale, assessing participants' general affinity for technology on a 6-point Likert scale."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Law Expertise",
    "measured_by": "10-point Likert Scale",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to rate their level of legal expertise on a 10-point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating greater expertise."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Prosocialness",
    "measured_by": "Prosocial Behavioral Intentions Scale",
    "justification": "Participants' willingness to participate in social situations was measured using the Prosocial Behavioral Intentions Scale, where they rated their likelihood of engaging in prosocial behaviors on a 7-point Likert scale."
