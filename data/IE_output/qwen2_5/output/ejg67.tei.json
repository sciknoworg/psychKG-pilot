    "topic_or_construct": "Prosocial behavior",
    "measured_by": "Modified dictator game",
    "justification": "The study employs a modified dictator game based on Hutcherson et al. (2015) to measure prosocial behavior, where participants decide between proposed monetary offers and a constant default distribution, enabling researchers to assess their willingness to benefit others at their own cost."

    "topic_or_construct": "Empathy",
    "measured_by": "EmpaToM paradigm",
    "justification": "The EmpaToM paradigm (Kanske et al., 2015) is utilized to measure empathy among participants by requiring them to rate the valence of their emotion after watching a video clip of someone narrating an autobiographical experience, thereby quantifying their empathic response."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive functioning",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive functioning battery",
    "justification": "A task battery includes tests like Trail Making tests, Identical Pictures test, Digit Span backward, and Spot A Word test (adapted from Reiter et al., 2017) to measure aspects of cognitive functioning such as processing speed, working memory, and attention."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Inhibitory control",
    "measured_by": "Inhibitory control battery",
    "justification": "A validated computerized task battery (adapted from Wolff et al., 2016) comprising Go-Nogo, Stroop, and Stop Signal tasks is used to assess inhibitory control performance, providing a composite inhibition score for participants."

    "topic_or_construct": "Theory of Mind (ToM)",
    "measured_by": "EmpaToM paradigm",
    "justification": "The EmpaToM task (Kanske et al., 2015) is also used to measure Theory of Mind by having participants answer multiple-choice questions based on a narrator's perspective, distinguishing it from factual reasoning questions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Drift rate in decision making",
    "measured_by": "Hierarchical drift diffusion modeling",
    "justification": "The drift diffusion model analyzes choice and reaction time data to quantify the drift rate, which captures the speed of information accumulation towards deciding to accept or reject offers, reflecting the efficiency of decision-making processes."
