    "measured_by": "Electromyography (EMG)",
    "justification": "EMG measures the myoelectric activity of muscles, which provides insights into motor preparation processes at the muscular level. The text discusses how EMG onsets and muscle activations are critical for understanding the timing and execution of motor responses, especially in decision-making tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "Evidence Accumulation Dynamics",
    "measured_by": "Lateralized Readiness Potential and Mu/Beta Band Activity",
    "justification": "The lateralized readiness potential and decreases in mu/beta band activity during electroencephalography (EEG) measurements reflect the accumulation of sensory evidence in preparation for a response. These physiological markers are used to track the evolution of decision variables over time."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal Preparation Effects",
    "measured_by": "Foreperiod Paradigm",
    "justification": "The foreperiod paradigm involves manipulating the time between a warning signal and the stimulus, revealing how temporal expectations influence motor preparation. The text notes that longer foreperiods lead to increased motor preparation, which can be detected using behavioral and physiological measures."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-Making Processes",
    "measured_by": "Random Dot Motion Task",
    "justification": "The random dot motion task is utilized to study decision-making by presenting moving dots with varying coherence, requiring participants to categorize the net motion direction. Performance metrics like reaction times and accuracy provide insights into the underlying decision-making processes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Short-Term Memory in Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Response Signal Tasks with Delays",
    "justification": "Response signal (RS) tasks with delays between stimulus offset and response signal allow for the assessment of how decisions and motor preparations can be maintained or adjusted over short time periods. Manipulating delays within these tasks offers observations of temporal preparation and sustained activity."
