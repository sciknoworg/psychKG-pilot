    "topic_or_construct": "agency",
    "measured_by": "choose-your-own-adventure narrative task",
    "justification": "Participants' agency was operationalized through a choose-your-own-adventure narrative task where they could make choices that determined the subsequent events (Free condition), partially grant choices (Yoked condition), or have no choice at all (Passive condition). This setup allowed examination of how different levels of agency affected memory."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "episodic memory",
    "measured_by": "free recall test",
    "justification": "The effect of agency on episodic memory was assessed by a free recall test where participants were asked to recall the story they had read as accurately as possible after completing the narrative task, providing a measure of their episodic memory performance."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "semantic centrality",
    "measured_by": "Universal Sentence Encoder",
    "justification": "Semantic centrality, reflecting how interconnected an event was with others via shared meaning, was calculated by converting each event into an embedding vector using the Universal Sentence Encoder and calculating the average cosine similarity with all other events in the story path."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "causal centrality",
    "measured_by": "human-rated causal connections",
    "justification": "Causal centrality was measured through independent human raters judging which pairs of events were causally linked, based on their understanding of the narrative, indicating which events had strong causal connections within the story."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "neighbor encoding effect",
    "measured_by": "correlation between recall scores of neighboring events",
    "justification": "The neighbor encoding effect was assessed by calculating the correlation between the recall scores of immediately previous and next events (neighbors) and the original recall performance vector for each participant, exploring temporal dependencies in memory evoked by agency."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "temporal violation rate",
    "measured_by": "frequency of out-of-order recall segments",
    "justification": "The temporal violation rate was determined by counting how frequently participants recalled events out of the original chronological order, providing insights into the influence of agency on the temporal structure of recall."
