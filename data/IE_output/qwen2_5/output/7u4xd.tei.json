    "measured_by": "Social Delay Discounting Task",
    "justification": "The study used a social version of a delay discounting task to measure how much adolescents altered their discounting preferences after learning about another person's preferences, serving as an index for their susceptibility to social influence."

    "topic_or_construct": "Taste uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Computational modeling of decision variability in social delay discounting",
    "justification": "The study evaluated taste uncertainty through computational modeling, reflecting how uncertain participants were about their choices in the delay discounting task before social influence."

    "measured_by": "Magnetisation Transfer (MT) imaging",
    "justification": "Magnetisation Transfer imaging provided a myelin-sensitive marker that was related to taste uncertainty and its developmental changes, indicating mPFC myelination's role in adolescent susceptibility to social influence."
