    "justification": "The authors found a higher punishment learning rate among the symptomatic group, indicating they learned quickly about negative phenomena. This was analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian estimation with varied levels of priors."

    "justification": "To address the issue of shrinkage in hierarchical Bayesian estimation, maximum likelihood estimation was used, revealing larger distributions for the punishment learning rate among the anxiety group compared to hierarchical models."
