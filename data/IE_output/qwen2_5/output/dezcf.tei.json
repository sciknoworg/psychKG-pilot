    "justification": "The study used a deterministic two-step task adapted from Kool et al. (2016, 2017) to manipulate environmental demands by changing the frequency of first-stage states repetitions and alternations, which influenced participants' reliance on model-based control."

    "measured_by": "Deterministic two-step task",
    "justification": "The deterministic two-step task was also designed to measure model-free control by observing participants' tendency to repeat previously rewarded actions when first-stage states frequently repeat, indicating a lack of generalization between states (model-free behavior)."
