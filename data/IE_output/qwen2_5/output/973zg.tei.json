    "measured_by": "3-point confidence scale",
    "justification": "The article states that uncertainty monitoring in children is typically measured by asking them to explicitly report their confidence on a scale with fixed points, corresponding to greater or lesser confidence. This is exemplified by the study which asks children to rate their confidence using a three-point scale (not sure, a little bit sure, very sure), demonstrating their ability to distinguish levels of uncertainty."

    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty control",
    "measured_by": "Behaviors such as self-allocated study time and seeking help",
    "justification": "The article suggests that uncertainty control is measured through behaviors that children use to regulate decision-making when feeling uncertain, such as varying the amount of self-allocated study time or the tendency to seek help. It indicates that these behaviors can be observed in children even at a young age, serving as a way to optimize decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Implicit sensitivity to uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Forced-choice exploration decisions",
    "justification": "Experiments 2a and 2b in the article examine children's implicit sensitivity to uncertainty through their exploration decisions. Children were offered a choice to explore one of the windows, which allowed researchers to assess which window they perceived as having the most uncertainty, indicating an implicit recognition of uncertainty."
