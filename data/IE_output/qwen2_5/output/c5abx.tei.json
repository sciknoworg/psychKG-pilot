    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive Bias",
    "measured_by": "Meta Mind Task",
    "justification": "The Meta Mind task was designed to measure metacognitive bias reliably, as mean confidence was significantly correlated with the traditional task and demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability. Participants rated their confidence after making perceptual decisions, allowing the task to assess individual differences in overconfidence or underconfidence."

    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive Efficiency",
    "measured_by": "M-Ratio",
    "justification": "Metacognitive efficiency was quantified using the M-Ratio, calculated as the ratio of metacognitive sensitivity to mean accuracy. This measure assessed how well participants' confidence ratings discriminated between correct and incorrect trials. However, the study notes that M-Ratio had poor reliability, especially with fewer trials."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Local Confidence",
    "measured_by": "Confidence Ratings in Meta Mind",
    "justification": "Local confidence was measured by participants' trial-by-trial confidence ratings after making perceptual decisions in the Meta Mind task. These ratings were found to be highly reliable and valid, showing significant associations with broader psychiatric dimensions like anxious-depression and compulsivity."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Global Self-Performance Evaluations",
    "measured_by": "Meta Mind Round-Level Ratings",
    "justification": "Global self-performance evaluations were measured as mean round-level ratings in Meta Mind. After each block of trials, participants estimated their overall accuracy. These evaluations were strongly correlated with local confidence ratings, suggesting a hierarchical structure in metacognitive judgments."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Anxious Depression",
    "measured_by": "Psychiatric Questionnaires",
    "justification": "Anxious depression was measured using items from various self-report psychiatric questionnaires, providing a transdiagnostic metric. This construct was associated with lower local confidence in the Meta Mind task, consistent with established metacognitive biases in this dimension."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Compulsivity and Intrusive Thought",
    "measured_by": "Psychiatric Questionnaires",
    "justification": "Compulsivity and intrusive thought were also assessed using a reduced set of items from self-report psychiatric questionnaires. Higher scores on this dimension were linked to elevated local confidence in the Meta Mind task, indicating a distinct pattern from anxious depression."
