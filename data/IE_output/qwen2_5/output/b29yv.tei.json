    "measured_by": "Drift Diffusion Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "DDM is utilized to explain the fast decision-making behavior in the context of the evidence accumulation model (EAM), with applications ranging from simple binomial forced-choice tasks to perceptual and value-based decision making. This computational model specifically assumes a linear accumulation of evidence and a constant decision boundary, providing a mathematical framework for understanding empirical data on decision-making processes."

    "measured_by": "Centro-Parietal Positivity (CPP) in EEG recordings",
    "justification": "Studies such as those by O\u2019Connell et al. and others validate the existence of an EEG indicator, CPP, which is linked to the process of evidence accumulation. Observations of CPP across different sensory modalities (visual and auditory) provide empirical evidence supporting the assumption that evidence accumulation is universal in perceptual decision-making."

    "measured_by": "Steady-State Visual-Evoked Potential (SSVEP) and CPP in EEG recordings",
    "justification": "Research by O\u2019Connell et al. shows that SSVEP, a sensory response, is present when sensory input is provided, but only the CPP, which is linked to the decision-related evidence accumulation, appears when the stimulus is relevant to the task goal. This indicates that evidence accumulation is selective."

    "measured_by": "Firing rates of neurons in the Lateral Intraparietal Area (LIP) in monkeys",
    "justification": "Behavioral data analyzed using the DDM alongside neural physiological data from monkeys\u2019 LIP neurons show a consistent pattern in which the firing rate increases at a specific rate during decision-making, aligning with the assumption of linear accumulation of evidence in DDM."

    "topic_or_construct": "Constant decision-making criteria",
    "measured_by": "Brain neuron firing rates and EEG amplitude measurements during decision tasks",
    "justification": "Studies like that of Hawkins et al. analyze large datasets including neurophysiological data and find evidence supporting a fixed decision boundary. This is confirmed when the same decision boundary threshold is repeatedly noted in EEG amplitude measurements regardless of participants\u2019 response times."

    "topic_or_construct": "Independence of decision-making and response execution processes",
    "measured_by": "CPP and Left Hemisphere Beta (LHB) in EEG recordings",
    "justification": "EEG studies observing separate patterns of CPP, linked to evidence accumulation for decision-making, and LHB, associated with motor responses, provide evidence for the independence of decision formation and response execution processes, at least in human perceptual decision making."
