    "justification": "Behavioral modeling revealed that anxious participants considered recent punishment feedback trends to a larger extent during stress, indicating an impulsive response to punishment."

    "measured_by": "proportion of repeated selections after punishment-only feedback",
    "justification": "Analysis showed that the Anxious group exhibited a higher proportion of rejections of bandits that were followed by punishment-only feedback in the Threat condition compared to the Safe condition and controls."

    "justification": "The study used a threat of electric shocks in the 'Threat' condition to examine how stress influences punishment avoidance behavior in anxious individuals compared to controls."
