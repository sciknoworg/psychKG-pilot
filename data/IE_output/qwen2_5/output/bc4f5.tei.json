    "justification": "Research using the stay-switch framework has shown that firing rates of neurons in monkey dACC positively correlate with decisions to leave a patch. These firing rates scale with increasing travel time to the next patch, suggesting that dACC neurons may set a threshold for switching and that this threshold is sensitive to the time cost of switch decisions (Hayden et al., 2011)."

    "measured_by": "dACC neuronal activity",
    "justification": "Research using the accept-reject framework has shown that neurons in monkey dACC encode the time cost associated with choosing an option. The activity patterns in a subset of dACC neurons also correlate with the value of rejected offers, suggesting that dACC keeps track of post-decision variables (Blanchard & Hayden, 2014)."

    "measured_by": "dACC BOLD activity",
    "justification": "BOLD signals in dACC and vmPFC have been shown to correlate with the relative value of searching for alternatives over engaging with current options, suggesting that both regions may represent similar information in foraging scenarios and reflect choice difficulty (Shenhav et al., 2016)."

    "topic_or_construct": "dACC function in foraging",
    "measured_by": "dACC BOLD activity",
    "justification": "Studies comparing accept-reject choices with economic ones showed that BOLD activity in the dACC is positively correlated with the value of searching for alternative options whereas vmPFC activity is positively correlated with the chosen option's reward magnitude during binary economic choices, suggesting differential roles in foraging scenarios (Kolling et al., 2012)."

    "topic_or_construct": "patches revisiting in foraging",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral ecology studies",
    "justification": "Empirical work indicates that when animals are allowed to direct their search strategy, they are unequivocally non-random. Chimpanzees direct their search by integrating information about food quantity, handling time and distance from previous encounters to maximize the rate of energy intake (Sayers & Menzel, 2012). This suggests that behavior can be measured through observing strategic foraging behaviors."

    "measured_by": "Grid-world task",
    "justification": "A grid-world task could be used as an assay for extending foraging approaches in neuroscience where participants select the next patch tile they wish to visit, allowing for directed encounters that enable testing of predictions such as lower switching thresholds compared with random encounter designs (as discussed in the Practical Suggestions section)."
