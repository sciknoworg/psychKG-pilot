    "measured_by": "Information Sampling Trust Game",
    "justification": "The study used the Information Sampling Trust Game to assess cooperation decisions, as highlighted in the Experimental paradigm section. This game features an investor and trustee role where the investor shares tokens with a trustee based on the trustee's reciprocation history, providing a measure of cooperation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Trustworthiness Judgement",
    "measured_by": "Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2)",
    "justification": "The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) was used to measure social adjustment and social deficits, particularly in autistic children. It was used to assess cooperation decisions and their relationship to social skills, justifying its relevance in evaluating trustworthiness judgment."

    "topic_or_construct": "Autistic Traits",
    "measured_by": "Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ)",
    "justification": "The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) was utilized alongside the SRS-2 to measure autistic traits. Its inclusion in the study demonstrates its role in assessing how autistic traits impact cooperation and information sampling decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Information Sampling Strategy",
    "measured_by": "Uncertainty Model (Computational Model)",
    "justification": "The Uncertainty model was identified as the best-fitting computational model to describe information sampling behavior in both TD and ASD children. It captured the participants' sampling behavior and provided insights into their decision-making strategies."
