    "measured_by": "Lottery choices used in studies",
    "justification": "The study uses lottery choice scenarios to measure risk preferences of participants when making decisions for themselves versus for others. These lotteries were used across multiple studies (Study 1-4) to assess differences in risk-taking behavior in various domains like gains and losses."

    "measured_by": "SEU model parameters fitted to choice data",
    "justification": "The Social Expected Utility (SEU) model was fitted to the empirical data from each of the four studies conducted. By estimating the \u03b2 parameters for both self- and other-choices, the study evaluated the sensitivity of participants to the differences between alternatives."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social discounting and risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "Social discounting model implementation in SEU",
    "justification": "The Social Expected Utility (SEU) model, incorporating social discounting concepts, was used to explain risk-seeking behavior differences between choices made for oneself and others. This was based on the reduction in value as a function of social distance."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social component in decision-making",
    "measured_by": "SEU model with social modifyinglements",
    "justification": "The SEU model integrates a social component within the standard EU model structure. This allows for testing the hypothesis that introducing social aspects changes risk preferences. Empirical results from studies 1 to 4 were used to support this connection."
