    "measured_by": "Appropriateness Ratings and Rankings",
    "justification": "Experiment aversion is measured by participants rating and ranking the appropriateness of implementing an A/B test compared to applying a single policy. Participants rate each option on a 5-point scale and rank their preferred decisions after reading the vignettes which manipulate the presence or absence of consent (Heck et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2019)."

    "measured_by": "Difference in Ratings",
    "justification": "The A/B effect is defined as the difference between participants' mean policy rating and their rating of the A/B test. This is quantified by analyzing how participants rate the average appropriateness of policies compared to the A/B test in different conditions (Meyer et al., 2019; Heck et al., 2020)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Experiment Appreciation",
    "measured_by": "Comparison with Highest-Rated Policy",
    "justification": "Experiment appreciation is measured by assessing whether participants rate the A/B test higher than their highest-rated policy. This is captured through participants' ratings on a 5-point scale and analyzed across different consent conditions (Heck et al., 2020)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Experiment Endorsement",
    "measured_by": "Rating and Demographics",
    "justification": "Experiment endorsement occurs when participants rate the A/B test as appropriate while rating each policy as neutral or inappropriate. Presence of this sentiment is measured by participants' specific ratings and their demographic questionnaire answers (Heck et al., 2020)."
