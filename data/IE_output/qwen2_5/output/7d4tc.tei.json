    "justification": "The paper used SCRs as a physiological measure to indicate the successful induction of anxiety during the threat condition, as evidenced by significantly higher SCRs compared to the safe condition (Exp.1: t48 =10.44, P < .0001, d = 1.49; Exp.2: t44 =2.06, P = .0444, d = 0.30)."

    "measured_by": "Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)",
    "justification": "The screening questionnaire included the BAI to index clinical anxious symptoms. This tool was used to check if individual differences in trait anxiety affected the results, though no main effects or interactions with learning or post-learning performance were found."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "trait anxiety",
    "measured_by": "State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)",
    "justification": "The STAI was administered as part of the screening questionnaire to measure both state and trait anxiety levels. This comprehensive assessment allowed researchers to evaluate relationships between anxiety levels and learning behavior in the tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "emotional state self-reported measures",
    "measured_by": "Exit Questionnaire",
    "justification": "The exit questionnaire had subjects rate their feelings on various emotional states, including anxiety, during the threat condition. This subjective measurement complemented the physiological measures of anxiety."
