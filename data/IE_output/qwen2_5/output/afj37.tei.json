    "measured_by": "short Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (sMARS)",
    "justification": "The paper uses the short Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (sMARS) to measure math anxiety. Participants were asked to rate their anxiety in different math-related situations on a 5-point Likert scale. The sMARS provides a reliable and concise method for assessing math anxiety as evidenced by its high Cronbach's alpha."

    "topic_or_construct": "Math Avoidance",
    "measured_by": "Choose-and-Solve Task (CAST)",
    "justification": "The CAST was designed to measure math avoidance by having participants choose between easy and hard math problems with varying rewards. Higher levels of math anxiety were associated with greater avoidance of math-related effortful tasks, even when incentivized with higher rewards. This demonstrates that the task effectively captures math-specific effort avoidance linked to math anxiety."

    "topic_or_construct": "Effort Avoidance in Math Context",
    "measured_by": "Hard Choice Probability (HCP)",
    "justification": "The Hard Choice Probability (HCP), derived from the CAST, measures participants' willingness to select hard math problems over easy ones in high-reward situations. The paper shows that a higher math anxiety is linked with a lower HCP, indicating greater effort avoidance in math contexts."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reading Anxiety",
    "measured_by": "short Reading Anxiety Rating Scale (sRARS)",
    "justification": "The paper employs the sRARS, an adaptation of the sMARS, to isolate the math-specific component of math anxiety by measuring anxiety related to reading tasks. It indicates participants' anxiety levels for English courses and exams, facilitating control for non-math-related anxieties."
