    "measured_by": "Puzzle task predictions and video clip change detection",
    "justification": "In Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, the curse of knowledge was measured through tasks where participants, informed or uninformed about a key aspect of the task, predicted how long it would take solvers to solve puzzles or how many other participants would spot changes in video clips. Informed participants systematically underestimated the difficulty faced by others, demonstrating the curse of knowledge."

    "measured_by": "Willingness to pay for information in choice conditions",
    "justification": "In Experiment 2, participants were given the choice to pay $0.50 to receive information on differences in video clips before predicting how many others would notice the differences. Despite the information being harmful, 29 percent chose to pay for it, indicating a valuation of potentially harmful information."

    "topic_or_construct": "Learning and mitigation of the curse",
    "measured_by": "Repetition and feedback in prediction tasks",
    "justification": "Experiment 3 tested whether participants could learn to avoid the curse of knowledge by repeating the prediction tasks with feedback. While there was some evidence of learning with repeated trials, particularly after receiving feedback on actual performance percentages, the effect was not completely eliminated, suggesting partial learning."
