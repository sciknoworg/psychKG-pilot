    "justification": "The Cognitive Reflection Test is used to measure metacognitive sensitivity, as mentioned in the text, to examine cognitive reflection in decision-making contexts. The test consists of several items and assesses the ability of individuals to override intuitive responses with more deliberate reasoning."

    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Confidence ratings",
    "justification": "Metacognitive sensitivity is inferred from confidence ratings and their relationship to response accuracy; individuals typically show higher confidence in correct responses compared to incorrect ones, which helps gauge their awareness of their decision-making accuracy."

    "measured_by": "Self-ratings",
    "justification": "A decrease in the bias blind spot was observed in people using a foreign language, where participants rated their likelihood of falling into decision traps compared to regular people, revealing a heightened awareness of their own potential biases."

    "measured_by": "Syllogism evaluation task",
    "justification": "Research demonstrated that bilinguals evaluating syllogisms (two premises and a conclusion) in their foreign language showed lower conflict detection and distorted metacognition compared to their native language, impacting their reasoning processes."
