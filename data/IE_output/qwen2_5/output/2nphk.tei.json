Participants nominated traits stereotypically associated with White stereotypes for responsible risk-takers, indicating the same methodology but with a contrasting racial association."

    "justification": "In Study 3, the racial visualization of reckless risk-taking was measured using a reverse correlation task. Participants constructed facial images of reckless risk-takers that were perceived as more stereotypically Black and masculine, demonstrating that the visual representation of this prototype is racially associated."
