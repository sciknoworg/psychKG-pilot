    "measured_by": "Artificial lottery choices",
    "justification": "The paper describes how artificial lottery choices were used across several studies summarized in Table 2, which test the desperation and caution predictions of the Desperation Threshold Model. These choices allowed for measuring risk preferences under different economic conditions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Poverty and Risk Taking",
    "measured_by": "Incentivized gambles with moderate stakes",
    "justification": "The research uses incentivized gambles, such as hypothetical choices between certain and risky financial outcomes, to measure risk-taking preferences among individuals experiencing different levels of poverty. Examples include income thresholds and the basic needs threshold for food security."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Desperation Threshold Model (DTM)",
    "measured_by": "Subjective threshold assessments",
    "justification": "The DTM is operationalized by assessing participants' subjective feelings about their adequacy of resources. Studies such as Caballero (2010) use subjective measures of basic needs satisfaction to determine whether individuals are above or below the desperation threshold, influencing their risk-taking behavior."
