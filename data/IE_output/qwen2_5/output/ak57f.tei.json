    "measured_by": "Successor Representation with Importance Sampling (SR-IS) model",
    "justification": "The SR-IS model demonstrates flexible planning and adaptability by learning a more general representation that supports efficient replanning across different spatial domains. This is evidenced by its ability to maintain performance when replanning routes to new goal states in environments like the four-room setup, unlike the standard SR model which shows bias and inefficiency in these tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive map construction",
    "measured_by": "Linear RL model and SR-IS model",
    "justification": "The paper discusses cognitive map construction as a central topic, measuring it using both the Linear RL model (default representation) and the SR-IS model. The SR-IS model, which incorporates importance sampling, is particularly highlighted for its ability to create unbiased, task-general representations that support flexible decision-making, matching the theoretical advantages posited for human cognitive map construction."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Revaluation",
    "measured_by": "SR-IS model in three revaluation tasks",
    "justification": "The SR-IS model is used to measure decision revaluation through reward, policy, and transition revaluation tasks. These tasks replicated human behavior and biases observed in revaluation settings, showcasing the model's ability to capture human replanning patterns and performance, especially in reward revaluation where humans show higher flexibility."
