    "measured_by": "Reward Uncertainty Decision-Making Task",
    "justification": "The study utilized a modified version of the Reward Uncertainty Decision-Making Task developed by Huettel and colleagues (2006) to measure participants' preference for certain versus uncertain monetary rewards, thereby assessing their uncertainty aversion. The task manipulated uncertain reward utility, uncertainty type, and uncertain reward variance to evaluate how marijuana deprivation affected uncertainty aversion in heavy marijuana users."

    "topic_or_construct": "Marijuana deprivation",
    "measured_by": "Difference in days since last use and urine analysis",
    "justification": "The study measured the effects of marijuana deprivation by comparing deprived participants who abstained from marijuana for three days with non-deprived participants who maintained typical use patterns. This was verified by significant differences in days since last use (3.7 vs. 0.5 days, p < .001) and urinalysis results, confirming differential levels of marijuana deprivation between the groups."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reward valuation",
    "measured_by": "Objective monetary rewards with varying levels of uncertainty",
    "justification": "The subjective valuation of rewards was assessed through participants' choices between certain and uncertain monetary rewards. The uncertain rewards were varied in utility, variance, and the level of information about their probability, allowing for an assessment of how marijuana deprivation influenced the subjective value assigned to rewards under different levels of uncertainty."

    "topic_or_construct": "Neuroadaptations in reward processing",
    "measured_by": "Effects of Deprivation Group and Uncertain Reward Utility interaction",
    "justification": "The significant interaction between the Deprivation Group and Uncertain Reward Utility suggested that deprived heavy marijuana users showed a significantly reduced preference for uncertain rewards when their utility was moderately high, which may indicate neuroadaptations in reward valuation processes caused by chronic heavy marijuana use."
