    "justification": "The study used a large online experiment with expert ethicists and laypeople to measure their intuitive judgements when presented with five moral scenarios under different framing conditions. This manipulation tested whether professional ethicists are less susceptible to framing effects than laypeople."

    "justification": "The ethical scenario was presented from both a first-person (actor) and a third-person (observer) perspective, testing whether professional philosophers exhibit the same actor-observer bias as laypeople. The results indicated no significant expert-lay difference for this specific bias."

    "measured_by": "Varying Order of Scenario Presentations",
    "justification": "The order of scenario presentations was varied to assess whether professional ethicists, unlike laypeople, could resist biases caused by the sequencing of the scenarios. Prior studies found similar susceptibility to order effects in both groups."

    "measured_by": "Focus Scenario with Positive/Negative Outcome Variations",
    "justification": "In the Focus scenario, participants were presented with an outcome framed in terms of either positive (saving) or negative (killing) consequences. The results showed that professional ethicists were significantly less influenced by this kind of simple saving/killing framing."

    "justification": "Participants were given a choice between programs with outcomes framed in terms of positive (saving) or negative (dying) prospects, based on the Asian disease problem. Professional ethicists were influenced by this prospect framing but still less so than laypeople."
