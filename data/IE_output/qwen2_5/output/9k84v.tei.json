    "topic_or_construct": "Perceptual decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Auditory discrimination task",
    "justification": "The study uses an auditory discrimination task to examine how rats make perceptual decisions involving evidence accumulation and reaction times. The task involves rats discriminating between different sound frequencies or intensity levels and responding accordingly by withdrawing from the central port."

    "topic_or_construct": "Proactive response timing",
    "measured_by": "Parallel Sensory Integration and Action Model (PSIAM)",
    "justification": "The PSIAM model is implemented to capture the timing of proactive responses, which are independent of stimulus onset but still stimulus-dependent for the choice. The model incorporates an Action Initiation process that accurately predicts proactive response timing when stimulus presentation is omitted."

    "topic_or_construct": "Evidence accumulation timing",
    "measured_by": "Parallel Sensory Integration and Action Model (PSIAM)",
    "justification": "The PSIAM model includes an Evidence Accumulation process to model responses triggered by accumulated evidence. The model helps quantify how reaction times are linked to stimulus strength for certain proportions of responses."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reaction time behavior modulation",
    "measured_by": "Time delay curves",
    "justification": "The researchers utilized time delay curves to assess the advancement or delay of response times compared to a reference distribution. The curves helped identify express responses and their independence from stimulus strength."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Speed-accuracy trade-off in decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Tachometric curves",
    "justification": "Tachometric curves were used to analyze how accuracy varies as a function of reaction time. These curves demonstrated a non-monotonic relationship, suggesting the presence of both proactive and reactive processes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decay of reaction time due to internal factors",
    "measured_by": "PSIAM with internal factors parameterization",
    "justification": "The PSIAM was extended to account for internal factors like fatigue and satiety by modifying the drift of the Action Initiation process. By fitting the model with these factors, it was shown that they slow down response initiation."
