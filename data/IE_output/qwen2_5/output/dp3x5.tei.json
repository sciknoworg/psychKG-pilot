    "justification": "The study adapted scenarios listed in Furnham and Boo (2011) to measure the anchoring heuristic, including estimating the height of the tallest redwood tree, the length of the Mississippi River, and the gestation period of an African elephant."

    "justification": "Availability heuristic was measured using a version of the famous names problem and letter likelihood scenarios from Tversky and Kahneman (1974). Participants were asked questions like whether a randomly sampled English word is more likely to start with a target letter or have it as the third letter."

    "justification": "The recognition heuristic was evaluated via disease prevalence and city population tasks from Pachur et al. (2009). Participants made choices based on the familiarity of different pairs of options, such as comparing the population of different cities."

    "justification": "Representativeness heuristic was measured using the classic Linda problem from Tversky and Kahneman (1983), a lawyer vs. engineer probability problem, and a marble distribution game. Participants were asked to make decisions based on stereotypes and expectations."

    "justification": "The study used three scenarios adapted from Bruine de Bruin et al. (2014) and Strough et al. (2014) to measure the sunk cost fallacy. Participants rated their likelihood to continue or stop a project based on previously invested resources."
