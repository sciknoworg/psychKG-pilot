    "justification": "The Need for Cognition (NFC) scale was used to measure individual differences in intrinsic motivation to exert cognitive effort. Low-NFC individuals were found to be more sensitive to the marginal value of effort investment compared to high-NFC individuals in the task-switching paradigm, as suggested by past work and explored in the current study."

    "measured_by": "Computation of Task Switch Costs",
    "justification": "Task switch costs were computed as the difference between median task switch response times and task repetition response times. These costs were used to measure cognitive control allocation under different incentive conditions, reflecting participants' effortful cognitive processing in task switching."

    "justification": "Participants completed the BIS/BAS scales as a measure of their reward sensitivity and behavioral activation. This measure was included to explore its relationship with the learning effects observed in the study, though it did not show a significant interaction with reward effects on switch costs or incongruence effects."

    "justification": "Flanker task incongruence effects were computed as the difference between median incongruent and congruent response times in the Flanker task. These effects were analyzed to understand the influence of demand contexts and reward incentives on cognitive control allocation."

    "measured_by": "Computational model simulations",
    "justification": "Simulations based on the Yeung & Monsell (2003) task-switching and Flanker models were used to compute the marginal decrease in switch costs and incongruence effects with respect to increases in control input. Comparing these marginal rates under different demand contexts informed the learning of the marginal utility of effort."
