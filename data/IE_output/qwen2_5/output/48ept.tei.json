    "measured_by": "Eye-tracking data",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how eye-tracking was used by various studies (e.g., Blair et al., 2009; Rehder & Hoffman, 2005a) to investigate the selective sampling of information during categorization tasks. The eye movements provided an independent estimate of attention during decision making."

    "measured_by": "Computational model simulations",
    "justification": "The SEA model is used to simulate decision-making scenarios where the balance between exploration and exploitation plays a critical role. Simulations demonstrate how this balance affects learning outcomes and representational density."

    "justification": "The Sampling Emergent Attention (SEA) model's performance metrics are used to measure active sampling behavior in various experiments. For instance, it demonstrates how the model identifies and samples behaviorally-relevant stimulus dimensions over learning blocks."

    "topic_or_construct": "Information value and utility-driven sampling",
    "measured_by": "Gain in utility calculation (G(F_i))",
    "justification": "The SEA model uses the gain in utility calculation from sampling specific features to determine sampling behavior. This measure helps understand which features are deemed more useful for differentiation during categorization."

    "measured_by": "Human eye fixation probabilities",
    "justification": "Eye-tracking studies like Rehder and Hoffman (2005b) reveal human decision-makers' attentional fixation probabilities for different stimuli. These probabilities help uncover the patterns of selective feature sampling."
