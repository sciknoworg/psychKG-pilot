    "justification": "The study utilizes a dual-system RL model to measure the degree of model-based planning during travel decisions in the foraging task, capturing the mixture of model-based and model-free strategies. This model extracts the participants' use of task structure for planning, as evidenced by the model-based weighting parameter w."

    "topic_or_construct": "foraging decisions",
    "measured_by": "hierarchical mixed effects logistic regression",
    "justification": "Hierarchical mixed effects logistic regressions are used to model participants' stay/leave decisions. These regressions incorporate factors such as expected reward rate, average reward rate, and available alternative rewards, providing insights into how participants' knowledge of task structure impacts their foraging decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "return intentions",
    "measured_by": "choice probabilities analysis",
    "justification": "Participants' return intentions, representing their likelihood to revisit an island after a reward outcome, are analyzed using choice probabilities. This method evaluates how reward prediction error and transition types influence return likelihood, identifying the mix of model-based and model-free behaviors."

    "topic_or_construct": "exploration/exploitation trade-off",
    "measured_by": "foraging task",
    "justification": "The foraging task is structured to allow participants to alternate between harvesting (exploiting) and traveling to new islands (exploring). The task provides a direct measure of participants' balance between staying with a current option and seeking alternative rewards."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "model-based vs. model-free behavior",
    "measured_by": "expected reward calculations",
    "justification": "Expected rewards from different islands are calculated to determine whether participants incorporate alternative rewards into their stay/leave decisions. This reveals how model-based participants weigh task structure against model-free reward outcomes in making decisions."
