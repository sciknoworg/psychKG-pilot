    "measured_by": "binary choice amount similarity judgments",
    "justification": "The study used binary choice amount similarity judgments (participants judging pairs of monetary amounts as similar or dissimilar) to measure how unit framing (dollars vs. cents) influenced similarity judgments related to intertemporal choices."

    "topic_or_construct": "intertemporal choice",
    "measured_by": "binary choice delay similarity judgments",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to judge pairs of time delays as similar or dissimilar, which served as a measure to assess how the framing of delays in days versus weeks impacted their similarity judgments and subsequent intertemporal choices."

    "topic_or_construct": "numerical ability",
    "measured_by": "Berlin Numeracy Test questions",
    "justification": "The study assessed participants' numerical ability using four multiple-choice questions from the Berlin Numeracy Test, which evaluated their understanding of statistical and probabilistic computations."

    "measured_by": "mental number line task",
    "justification": "Numeracy was also measured through a mental number line task, where participants estimated the position of numbers on a line ranging from 1 to 1000, providing insight into their numerical magnitude representations."

    "measured_by": "slider-based judgments",
    "justification": "While not analyzed in the primary study, slider-based judgments where participants were asked to select the smallest value dissimilar from a reference value were collected to provide a metric for similarity judgments."
