    "measured_by": "Vividness Rating Scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated the vividness of their simulation using a 5-item measure with three forward-scored items and two reverse-scored items, adapted from Meyer et al. (2019). The vividness score was computed as the mean rating of these items, indicating how effectively participants imagined the future event. This scale was used across several studies to assess the degree of mental imagery involved in simulation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Everyday Simulation",
    "measured_by": "Thought and Talk Ratings",
    "justification": "Participants rated the extent to which they naturally simulated options through thinking and talking about them over time. These ratings, combined into an overall everyday simulation score, provide insight into how frequently and vividly participants considered certain options in their daily lives, linking it to decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Likelihood to Choose",
    "measured_by": "Likelihood Ratings Scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated their likelihood of choosing each option using a scale from 0 to 100 percent. This measure directly assessed how probable they felt about selecting each option, before and after various psychological interventions like simulation or control tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Option Valence",
    "measured_by": "Positive and Negative Valence Ratings",
    "justification": "Participants rated the positive and negative valence of each option using separate scales from 0 (\u201cNot at all\u201d) to 10 (\u201cExtremely\u201d). These ratings were combined into an overall valence score to measure the initial attractiveness of each option, helping to isolate the effects of simulation on choice likelihood."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Outcomes",
    "measured_by": "Binary Choice Task",
    "justification": "In controlled scenarios like snack or video choices, participants chose between two options after a simulation manipulation. The binary choice task allowed researchers to directly observe the impact of simulation on final choices, providing a clear behavioral measure of the simulation effect."
