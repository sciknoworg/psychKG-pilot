    "justification": "The paper discusses how participants are asked to provide probability judgments, such as judging the probability that an event has occurred, directly reflecting their perception of likelihood. This is supported by the sentence: 'Participants are asked to provide probability judgments (e.g., Sloman et al., 2004; Fox & Rottenstreich, 2003; Costello & Watts, 2014; Dasgupta, Schultz, & Gershman, 2017;..., etc.).'"

    "topic_or_construct": "Estimates",
    "measured_by": "Point estimates",
    "justification": "The document mentions 'participants may be asked to estimate the exact number of dots (i.e., estimates)'. This refers to participants directly providing a singular estimate value without broader intervals."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence Intervals",
    "measured_by": "Emotional quantiled reports",
    "justification": "The text states, 'they may also be asked to provide a confidence interval for the estimate (iii. confidence interval). Alternatively, participants could be asked to decide whether the number of dots was greater or smaller than some predefined boundary...with associated responses times.' This reflects the measurement of participants' estimated range of values with certain confidence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choices",
    "measured_by": "Binary or multi-alternative responses",
    "justification": "The research involves situations where 'participants could be asked...to decide whether the number of dots was greater or smaller than some predefined boundary', which illustrates a binary choice setup, fundamental to decision-making studies."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Response Times",
    "measured_by": "Latency measures for decision-making",
    "justification": "The papers analyze 'the elapsed times for making such decision...for example, by asking participants whether or not there were greater than 25 dots (...response times (vi. response times)), specifying explicit measurement of time taken for participants' responses."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence Judgments",
    "measured_by": "Post-decision confidence scales",
    "justification": "The confidence judgments are measured by 'elicit[ing] their confidence rating for either of these responses (v. confidence in the decision)', indicating a specific scale used to assess confidence post-decision."
