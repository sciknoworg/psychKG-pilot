    "measured_by": "4-point confidence scale",
    "justification": "The article mentions that subjects 'rated their confidence on a 4-point scale, where 1 corresponds to low confidence and 4 corresponds to high confidence.' This indicates a direct measurement of confidence using a self-reported rating scale."

    "measured_by": "linear regression analysis of confidence for correct vs. error trials",
    "justification": "The article uses linear regression to predict confidence by stimulus difficulty separately for correct and error trials, calculating slopes (\u03b2) for each manipulation to determine presence or absence of the folded-X pattern."

    "measured_by": "inverse cumulative standard normal distribution",
    "justification": "d' values were calculated using the inverse cumulative standard normal distribution transforming hit rates and false alarm rates, reflecting performance sensitivity. This calculation was central in analyzing stimulus manipulations\u2019 effects."

    "justification": "Experiment 2 utilized two-way repeated-measures ANOVAs to analyze all six possible two-way interactions among size, spatial frequency, noise, and tilt offset manipulations, indicating their statistical interactions on both accuracy and confidence."
