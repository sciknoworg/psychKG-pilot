    "topic_or_construct": "expertise",
    "measured_by": "confidence ratings",
    "justification": "The article discusses how experts exhibit high confidence in their decisions, using confidence ratings as a key measurement instrument. This is evidenced by the study's hypothesis that experts have higher confidence compared to nonexperts, as displayed in Figure 1."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "social projection",
    "measured_by": "estimates of others' judgments",
    "justification": "The article measures social projection by assessing the degree to which individuals estimate the judgments of others. Experts are said to have a lower projection rate compared to nonexperts, as illustrated in Figure 2."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "expertise",
    "measured_by": "projection accuracy",
    "justification": "Projection accuracy, which is the difference between an individual's projection and the actual average estimation, is used as an indicator of expertise. The article argues that a combination of high confidence and low projection can signify expert judgment."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "sensitivity to item difficulty",
    "measured_by": "adaptation of projection rates",
    "justification": "Experts' ability to adapt their projection rates to the difficulty of items is measured. This adaptation is more pronounced in expert choices (correct minority) as compared to nonexperts, as demonstrated using Bayesian hypothesis testing and shown in Figure 3."
