    "measured_by": "6-point Confidence Scale",
    "justification": "Participants rated their confidence in their decision on a 6-point scale ranging from 'sure error' to 'certainly correct'. This scale directly measures their perceived level of confidence associated with their decision regarding the color dominance of the dots."

    "topic_or_construct": "Prediction Error",
    "measured_by": "Model-generated Feedback Manipulation",
    "justification": "Feedback values were manipulated between 'high' and 'low' conditions across trial blocks, with these values reflecting model-predicted confidence. This manipulation allowed for the assessment of prediction error between participants' internal confidence estimates and external feedback."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence Calibration",
    "measured_by": "Dynamical Low-Dimensional Confidence (DLDC) Model",
    "justification": "The DLDC model was used to capture participants' dynamic updating of confidence based on feedback. It minimized the prediction error between feedback and confidence, updating parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 trial-by-trial to reflect changes in confidence computation."
