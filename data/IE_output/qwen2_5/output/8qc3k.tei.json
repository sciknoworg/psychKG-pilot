    "justification": "Preference reversals were assessed by comparing participants' baseline preferences before the introduction of a decoy with their final preferences after witnessing the decoy in various context-dependent choice sets."

    "justification": "Participants' decision-making processes were measured through a bet system in Experiment 1b and preference points in Experiment 2, where they indicated their preferences in different choice contexts and attributes."
