    "topic_or_construct": "Depression",
    "measured_by": "Beck Depression Inventory-II",
    "justification": "The article mentions that 'individuals identified as severely depressed at pre-treatment (with Beck Depression Inventory-II scores of greater than 24) experienced greater gains in the individualised treatment group.' This indicates that the Beck Depression Inventory-II is used to measure depression severity."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Anxiety",
    "measured_by": "Burns Anxiety Inventory",
    "justification": "In discussing the studies by Persons et al. (2006), the article references participants with 'at least four sessions of symptom data on the BDI or the Burns Anxiety Inventory,' suggesting that the Burns Anxiety Inventory is used to assess anxiety levels."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Marital satisfaction",
    "measured_by": "Not explicitly specified (implied measures of global marital satisfaction)",
    "justification": "The article describes Jacobson et al. (1989) comparing 'standardized protocol treatment and a clinically-flexible treatment,' stating that 'couples in both treatments showed significant gains on the two measures of global marital satisfaction.' While no specific scales are named, this suggests measures of general marital satisfaction were used."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Bulimia nervosa",
    "measured_by": "Not explicitly specified (clinical measures related to bulimia symptoms and related psychopathology)",
    "justification": "Ghaderi (2006)'s comparison between individualized and standardized protocol treatments for bulimia nervosa noted 'statistically significant changes' and 'superior gains on four of approximately 22 treatment outcome variables.' It implies that measures assessing bulimia symptoms and related constructs were used."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB)",
    "measured_by": "Not explicitly specified (functional analysis measures)",
    "justification": "In discussing single case studies, the article notes Iwata et al. (1994) reporting 'single-subject analyses of the reinforcing functions of self-injurious behavior (SIB) in individuals with developmental disabilities,' implying idiographic assessments and functional analysis were applied."
