    "measured_by": "Two-armed bandit task with DRAW, GUESS, and FIND conditions",
    "justification": "The paper uses a specifically designed two-armed bandit task to study human exploration patterns. In the DRAW condition, participants aim for a reward tied to a target color, while in the GUESS condition, they freely sample options to learn color-outcome associations. These conditions assess exploration without immediate reward maximization."

    "measured_by": "Computational model of sampling choices",
    "justification": "A computational model was employed to describe patterns of information seeking in participants' sampling choices, capturing elements like sensitivity to uncertainty, repetition bias, and the use of initial sampling phases to estimate exploration strategies."

    "topic_or_construct": "Choice imbalance",
    "measured_by": "Difference in the number of choices of the most and least chosen option",
    "justification": "The difference in the number of choices between the most and least chosen option over time was computed as a measure of sampling imbalance, which differed significantly among the experimental conditions, revealing distinct exploration patterns."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Patterned sampling of choice options",
    "measured_by": "Number of initial samples and threshold strength parameters",
    "justification": "The findings suggest individual differences in the patterned sampling of choice options, which were measured by the number of initial samples participants took from each option in the initial sampling phase and the participants' threshold strength."

    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty reduction in exploration",
    "measured_by": "Sensitivity parameter inf in a computational model",
    "justification": "The computational model included a sensitivity parameter 'inf' that preserved the sensitivity of choices to the uncertainty of option-outcome associations. This parameter highlighted differences between conditions in terms of sensitivity to uncertainty."
