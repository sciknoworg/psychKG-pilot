    "topic_or_construct": "Utilitarianism and Deontology",
    "measured_by": "Process Dissociation procedure",
    "justification": "The study used the Process Dissociation procedure with 16 scenarios from Conway & Gawronski (2013) to independently measure deontological and utilitarian inclinations in moral decision-making, allowing for the estimation of both inclinations without the confounds seen in traditional trolley problem scenarios."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Physical Fatigue",
    "measured_by": "Acute physical exercise on a Monark cycle ergometer",
    "justification": "Participants underwent a physically demanding cycling exercise protocol designed to induce significant physical fatigue, as evidenced by a large increase in their heart rate post-exercise, thereby manipulating their physiological state to observe effects on moral judgments."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Heart Rate",
    "measured_by": "Polar RS400 cardio frequency meter",
    "justification": "Heart rate was measured using a Polar RS400 cardio frequency meter prior to, during, and after the physical exercise to confirm the exercise induced a significant physiological change indicative of physical fatigue."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk-taking",
    "measured_by": "Self-created set of lotteries",
    "justification": "Although not directly related to the primary research question, risk-taking was measured using a self-created set of lotteries to control for potential confounding variables unrelated to the study's main constructs."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Disgust Sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Three Domain Disgust Scale",
    "justification": "The Three Domain Disgust Scale was used alongside a self-created Sounds of Disgust Scale to measure disgust sensitivity, another variable of interest not directly related to physical fatigue or moral judgments but relevant for broader psychological context."
