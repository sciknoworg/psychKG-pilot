    "measured_by": "Eight-item information avoidance scale",
    "justification": "The article states that information avoidance was assessed using two items drawn from the eight-item information avoidance scale by Howell & Shepperd (2016). This suggests a direct measurement of individuals' tendency to avoid learning about risks, especially regarding hurricane preparedness."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived Burden",
    "measured_by": "Two item checks (e.g., 'Reducing radon would be burdensome for me')",
    "justification": "The perceived burden of taking action was measured with two items assessing the burden of reducing radon levels. The scales used (1 = not at all true; 10 = very true) averaged to form an index of perceived burden (\u03b1 = .80), directly linking these items to the concept of perceived burden."

    "topic_or_construct": "Financial Resources",
    "measured_by": "Income scale and Financial Security measures",
    "justification": "Financial resources were measured through a combination of methods: an 8-point income scale and a financial security measure assessing participants' ability to handle financial challenges. These measures are directly linked to an individual's financial resources available."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Likelihood to Act",
    "measured_by": "Items such as 'Likelihood to repair\"",
    "justification": "Participants' likelihood to take action against radon risk was measured directly by asking their likelihood of repairing their home if it had high radon levels, providing a quantifiable measure of their actual intentions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Information Avoidance (Radon Context)",
    "measured_by": "Eight-item information avoidance scale and Dichotomous decision",
    "justification": "Experiment 2 not only utilized the eight-item information avoidance scale but also measured information avoidance behaviorally, capturing whether participants chose to learn about their neighborhood's radon level."
