    "topic_or_construct": "Risk propensity",
    "measured_by": "Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)",
    "justification": "The article describes using BART to quantify risk propensity by measuring the mean number of pumps made by participants across problems, as it captures individuals' risk attitude and relates to real-world risk-taking behaviors."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk propensity",
    "measured_by": "Columbia Card Sorting task",
    "justification": "The Columbia Card Sorting task is introduced as a cognitive task to measure various aspects of risk behavior, though the text doesn't detail specific measures, indicating its general relevance to risk propensity studies."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk propensity",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive models",
    "justification": "The paper discusses the use of cognitive models like the two-parameter BART model, Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) model, Bias-From-Optimal (BFO) model, and extended Win-Stay Lose-Shift (WSLS) model to infer latent parameters that represent risk propensity and consistency."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk propensity",
    "measured_by": "Risk Propensity Scale (RPS)",
    "justification": "The RPS is described as a questionnaire specifically designed to measure general risk-taking tendencies, with specific items and a scoring system tied to risk behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk propensity",
    "measured_by": "Risk Taking Index (RTI)",
    "justification": "The RTI assesses risk propensity across six different domains using a Likert scale, providing a comprehensive measure of risk attitude."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk propensity",
    "measured_by": "Domain Specific Risk Taking scale (DOSPERT)",
    "justification": "DOSPERT is used to evaluate domain-specific risk-taking behaviors and perceptions, splitting risk-taking from risk perception, which helps in understanding nuanced risk behaviors."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk propensity",
    "measured_by": "Optimal Stopping Problem tasks",
    "justification": "The optimal stopping problem tasks involve sequential decision-making and require participants to choose the best option under uncertainty, with cognitive models inferring individual differences in risk propensity."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk propensity",
    "measured_by": "Bandit problems tasks",
    "justification": "Bandit problems are used to study decision-making under risk and uncertainty. Cognitive models are applied to infer parameters reflecting risk-taking behaviors and consistency."
