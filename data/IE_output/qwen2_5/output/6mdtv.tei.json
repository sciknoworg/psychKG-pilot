    "measured_by": "Conservative Dual-Criteria method",
    "justification": "The CDC method is applied to assess whether the graphs show a clear change in behavior by tracing continued mean and trend lines, increasing their height, and counting the number of points above the lines to determine if a threshold is met, indicating a functional relation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Functional Relation between intervention and behavior change",
    "measured_by": "Support Vector Classifier",
    "justification": "The support vector classifier, a machine learning algorithm, projects the data into a higher dimension and uses a hyperplane to separate the data, categorizing each graph based on eight extracted features, indicating the presence or absence of a functional relation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Baseline Stability (Trend Stability)",
    "measured_by": "Waiting for Stability Protocol",
    "justification": "Researchers waited for the baseline series to stabilize, meaning the trend in Phase A reached minimal levels, before introducing the treatment. This protocol aimed to facilitate comparison across phases, especially using visual inspection."

    "topic_or_construct": "Baseline Stability (Variability Stability)",
    "measured_by": "Maximum Allowable Standard Deviation",
    "justification": "In the context of variability stability, researchers used the last three points of Phase A to ensure the standard deviation was below a predefined threshold before introducing the intervention, aiming to reduce variability's impact on baseline stability."

    "measured_by": "Monte Carlo Simulation Analysis",
    "justification": "The study employed Monte Carlo simulations to generate time series and AB graphs with varying characteristics. Applying the CDC method and support vector classifier helped examine Type I error rates and power across different baseline lengths and graph properties."
