    "justification": "The study uses the ATTSO scale, originally a 35-item measure reduced to 15 items (and further revised to 26 for this study), to assess participants' attitudes toward the treatment of people convicted of sexual offences. The scale uses a 5-point Likert scale to measure attitudes, with higher scores indicating more negative attitudes."

    "measured_by": "Custom measure for support",
    "justification": "A custom 10-item measure was developed to assess participants' degree of support for specific conditions included in s. 161. Participants rated statements regarding the clarity, practicality, and potential impact of each condition on a 6-point Likert scale. This allowed for an assessment of how supportive participants were of the particular restrictions placed on individuals subject to 161 orders."

    "measured_by": "Order Scenarios measure",
    "justification": "Participants were presented with 10 hypothetical scenarios and asked to determine whether the scenarios should constitute a breach of the 161 order conditions. This measure, labeled 'Should Breach', captured participants' subjective opinions about the enforcement of 161 orders."

    "topic_or_construct": "Objective legal enforcement decisions regarding 161 orders",
    "measured_by": "Order Scenarios measure",
    "justification": "The Order Scenarios measure also included items asking participants if the scenarios could constitute a breach based strictly on the wording of the s. 161 conditions. This 'Could Breach' measure aimed to capture an objective interpretation of the legal conditions."
