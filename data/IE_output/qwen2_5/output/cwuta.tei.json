    "measured_by": "PVQ-40 questionnaire",
    "justification": "The paper discusses the measurement of personal values using the PVQ-40 (Schwartz et al., 2001), which includes descriptions like 'It is important to them/him/her to adapt to nature and to fit into it.' These descriptions are analyzed for their alignment with Schwartz's value model and the Universal Motivational Map (UMM)."

    "topic_or_construct": "values hierarchy",
    "measured_by": "values-related decision-making tasks",
    "justification": "The experimental evidence section indicates that the authors tested the hierarchical influence of values on decision-making using a range of tasks, including the Raven's Progressive Matrices and the Guilford et al.'s Alternative Uses Test. This supports the theory of a hierarchical structure of values."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "hierarchical motivational types",
    "measured_by": "online questionnaires and decision-making challenges",
    "justification": "The supplementary material mentions that participants completed online questionnaires followed by decision-making challenges, likely including the values-related questionnaire. These tasks were used to explore the hierarchical influences of values on motivation."

    "measured_by": "World Values Survey + World Happiness Report data",
    "justification": "The text indicates the authors compare the World Values Survey and the World Happiness Report, referencing correspondence between expected values, self-expression, and happiness levels in nations. This alignment is a justification for their evolutionary theory."

    "measured_by": "NEO-PI-R and related trait scales",
    "justification": "The paper discusses known relationships between values and traits, using references to the NEO-PI-R as a standard measurement tool for the Big Five dimensions. It also considers the HEXACO model as an expansion on the Big Five, illustrating how these traits interact with values."
