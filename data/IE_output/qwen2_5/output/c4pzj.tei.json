    "justification": "Metacognition was measured using a psychophysical task where participants made repeated perceptual judgments and rated their confidence. Metacognitive efficiency was quantified using the meta-d' metric from signal detection theory, which controls for task performance and bias (Nicholson et al., 2020; Fleming & Daw, 2017)."

    "justification": "Mentalizing ability was assessed using the Frith-Happ\u00e9 Triangle Task, where participants watched short animations of moving triangles and classified their interactions into random, goal-directed, or Theory of Mind animations. Participants' accuracy in categorizing and interpreting the interactions served as a metric of mentalizing ability (Abell et al., 2000)."

    "justification": "The Autism Quotient-10 (AQ-10) and the Rapid Autism Adult Disability Screener-14 (RAADS-14) were used to assess self-reported autistic traits. These questionnaires evaluated various aspects of social and non-social autistic traits, with higher scores indicating more pronounced autistic features (Allison et al., 2012; Eriksson et al., 2013)."
