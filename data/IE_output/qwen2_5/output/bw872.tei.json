    "measured_by": "Vividness ratings and reality judgments in a single-trial psychophysical task",
    "justification": "Participants were instructed to vividly imagine a stimulus while looking at dynamic noise, and then report the vividness of their imagery. On a critical trial, a stimulus was gradually presented, and participants were asked whether they thought a real stimulus had been presented or if what they experienced was only in their imagination. This task directly tested perceptual reality monitoring by assessing how participants distinguish between imagination and reality."

    "topic_or_construct": "Imagery vividness",
    "measured_by": "Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ)",
    "justification": "The VVIQ was used to measure participants' general imagery vividness. This questionnaire provides a validated method to assess individual differences in the vividness of visual mental imagery, which is a key construct in understanding how imagery and perception interact."

    "topic_or_construct": "Imagery vividness",
    "measured_by": "Imagery vividness ratings within-task",
    "justification": "Within-task imagery vividness ratings were used as the primary measure of mental imagery vividness in the study. Participants provided these ratings on each trial, making them more predictive of task effects compared to the VVIQ. The within-task measure was more closely aligned with the experiences relevant to the experimental design."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceptual visibility",
    "measured_by": "Forced-choice animacy discrimination task and ratings in fMRI experiment",
    "justification": "In the fMRI experiment, perceptual visibility was measured through a forced-choice animacy discrimination task and through ratings on a 4-point scale. This allowed researchers to assess the neural correlates of perceptual visibility in regions like the pre-SMA, anterior insula, and right dlPFC, showing that these areas also track imagery vividness."

    "topic_or_construct": "Neural correlates of imagery vividness and perceptual visibility",
    "measured_by": "Cross-decoding multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data",
    "justification": "The study used cross-decoding multivariate pattern analysis to find that the same brain areas (pre-SMA, anterior insula, right dlPFC) encoded both imagery vividness and perceptual visibility in similar ways, supporting the hypothesis that these experiences share common neural substrates."
