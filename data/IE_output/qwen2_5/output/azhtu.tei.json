    "justification": "The study measured the extent of parental intervention by recording the percentage of subtasks (out of 11) that parents completed for their child during the dressing task, providing a clear metric for the studied construct."

    "measured_by": "Self-report on a 1-5 scale",
    "justification": "Parents reported their beliefs about their child's capability to put on clothes on a scale from 1 ('not at all capable') to 5 ('extremely capable') after interacting with their child, directly assessing the parental perception of child skill."

    "topic_or_construct": "Subtask difficulty",
    "measured_by": "Average time for children to complete each subtask",
    "justification": "The difficulty of each subtask was operationalized using the average time it took children to independently complete it, based on preliminary data, thus providing a quantitative measure of task difficulty."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived learning rewards",
    "measured_by": "Experimental condition assignment",
    "justification": "Parents were assigned to either a Learning condition, where the dressing task was framed as a learning opportunity, or a Control condition, where it was not, allowing for the measurement of perceived learning value impact on parental decision-making."
