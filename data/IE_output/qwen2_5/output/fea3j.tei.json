    "measured_by": "Kent Face Matching Test (KFMT)",
    "justification": "Participants completed the short version of the Kent Face Matching Test, comprising 20 match and 20 mismatch face pairings, to assess their decision-making in face identification tasks. The study utilized signal detection measures (d\u2032 and criterion) to analyze performance across different response option conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Unfamiliar face matching",
    "measured_by": "Response options (Same/Different, Same/Not-Same, Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial)",
    "justification": "The framing of these response options was manipulated across experiments to examine their influence on decision-making properties in unfamiliar face matching. However, results indicated no significant effects of the response options on accuracy, sensitivity, decision-making criterion, or response times."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision criterion in face matching",
    "measured_by": "Signal detection theory measures (criterion)",
    "justification": "The criterion was calculated using hits and false alarms from participants' decisions in match vs. mismatch trials. The expectation was that framing would influence decision criterion, but the study found no significant effect on criterion, highlighting the robustness of face matching under different response option conditions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Base rate effects in face matching",
    "measured_by": "Controlled base rate conditions",
    "justification": "Participants were randomly assigned to conditions with either equal (50%) or unequal (80%) match base rates. The results consistently showed that base rate manipulation significantly influenced decision criterion, indicating the importance of base rate information in face matching decisions."
