    "justification": "The study uses a computational reinforcement learning model to assess model-based decision-making, where a higher value for the model-based contribution parameter indicates greater model-based decision-making. This is supported by computing and analyzing various parameters in the model, such as the inverse temperature, learning rate, and mixing weights."

    "measured_by": "two-step sequential decision-making task",
    "justification": "Children and adults were given a modified sequential decision-making task that involved choosing spaceships leading to different planets with rewards. The deterministic transition structure and stake manipulation (high and low stakes) were designed to encourage and examine model-based decision-making. The task behavior was analyzed using various models to assess the degree of model-based decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "metacontrol of decision-making",
    "measured_by": "differences in model-based contribution between high and low stakes",
    "justification": "Metacontrol is calculated as a difference score in the degree of model-based decision-making expressed during low and high-stake trials. A higher positive value reflects better metacontrol. This assessment was done by evaluating the model-based contribution parameter under different stake conditions using the computational reinforcement learning model."
