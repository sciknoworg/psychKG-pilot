    "justification": "The article states that the Impartial Intergenerational Beneficence Inventory (IIBI) was used to measure impartial intergenerational beneficence, which indicates equal concern for all future generations.

    "justification": "The study utilized the Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES) to examine the precise generation at which moral concern for future generations drops to zero.

    "justification": "The study included an intervention inspired by longtermist philosophy where participants were asked to imaginatively prevent near-future harm and reflect on the interconnectedness of people across time. This intervention was shown to effectively increase intergenerational concern and expand temporal moral horizons."
