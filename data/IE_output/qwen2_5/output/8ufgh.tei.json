    "measured_by": "Social Decision Scheme (SDS) theory",
    "justification": "SDS theory is one of the most widely used frameworks used within the combinatorial approach to group decision making. It maps different member preference distributions to different consensus choices made by the group, indicating its usage in measuring group decision outcomes and, implicitly, the learning processes involved."

    "topic_or_construct": "Hidden profile phenomenon in group decision making",
    "measured_by": "Hidden Profile Paradigm",
    "justification": "The hidden profile paradigm was introduced by Stasser and Titus (1985) to demonstrate that information shared by all group members dominates the group discussion when compared with unshared information. This specific paradigm is used to measure the extent to which groups can process differing pieces of information and whether they can overcome the information sharing bias."

    "measured_by": "Information Asymmetries Model",
    "justification": "The Information Asymmetries Model by Brodbeck et al. (2007) categorizes conditions that lead to poor information processing in groups into negotiation focus, discussion bias, and evaluation bias, which helps understand how different features of group decision making influence information sharing and learning."

    "topic_or_construct": "Learning in fully interacting groups",
    "measured_by": "Truth Wins and Truth Supported Wins models",
    "justification": "Laughlin's concepts of Truth Wins and Truth Supported Wins models explain how correct minority influence can occur for demonstrable tasks, implying that these models can be used to understand learning processes in groups where shared task representations facilitate informed decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Group decision-making performance with regard to information processing",
    "measured_by": "Shared Mental Models",
    "justification": "Shared mental models, which include task and team models developed from Cannon-Bowers et al. (1993), are utilized to enhance group performance and decision-making accuracy. This suggests that investigating the shared mental models can be a way to measure how well a group processes information and learns to perform tasks more effectively."
