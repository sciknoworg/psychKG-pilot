    "measured_by": "slider scale in perceptual decision-making task",
    "justification": "Participants used a slider scale to report their level of confidence after each trial, where they adjusted a marker to indicate their choice and confidence level. This method was integral in measuring how confidence levels changed across different phases of the experiment (alone, together, and alone again)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "confidence matching",
    "measured_by": "comparison of confidence ratings between participant and partner",
    "justification": "Confidence matching was assessed by calculating the absolute difference between the participant's confidence and their partner's confidence before interaction (alone) and during joint decision making (together). A smaller difference during interaction was indicative of confidence matching."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "metacognitive learning",
    "measured_by": "computational model using metacognitive prediction errors",
    "justification": "A computational model was used to investigate how participants form metacognitive estimates of uncertainty by combining incoming sensory data with prior beliefs about confidence learned from themselves and others. This modeling approach revealed the mechanisms underlying the observed confidence biases."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "metacognitive sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Type II ROC curves for confidence ratings",
    "justification": "Metacognitive sensitivity was measured using Type II ROC curves constructed from confidence ratings, broken into 50 cumulative bins. The area under these ROC curves reflected a non-parametric measure of metacognitive sensitivity, providing insight into participants' insight into their decision correctness."
