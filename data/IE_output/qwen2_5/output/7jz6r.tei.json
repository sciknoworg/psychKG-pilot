    "topic_or_construct": "Affective Paternalism",
    "measured_by": "Self-Reported Motivations",
    "justification": "Participants in Experiment 1 were asked about their motivations behind paternalistic choices using self-report methods. This allowed the researchers to identify if decisions were made due to affective paternalism motivations, remarkably if participants felt the least uneasy about their choices, indicating the role of affect in paternalistic decisions."
