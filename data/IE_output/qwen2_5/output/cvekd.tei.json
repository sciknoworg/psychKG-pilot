    "justification": "The article discusses how sociability is associated with social projection, which is linked to affiliative motives. Research indicates that perceived similarity (measured through social projection) predicts liking. Self-enhancement serves power motives, while social projection serves sociability motives."

    "justification": "The ultimatum game is used in this article to explore social perception in terms of competence and morality judgments. These dimensions are associated with both power (proposers' initial offers) and sociability (responders' decisions to accept or reject). The game allows for the operationalization of power dynamics and cooperative tendencies."

    "measured_by": "Adjective Ratings of Competence and Morality",
    "justification": "The article reports an informal study where participants rated proposers and responders on competence and morality using adjectives like 'competent, intelligent, and rational' and 'moral, benevolent, and principled.' The correlations between these ratings are used to assess social projection in the context of the ultimatum game."

    "topic_or_construct": "Self-Enhancement",
    "measured_by": "Trait Adjective Self-Ratings",
    "justification": "Participants rated themselves on the same competence and morality adjectives used for players in the ultimatum game, providing a measure of self-enhancement. The data demonstrate a tendency for self-enhancement as individuals rated themselves more positively compared to others in terms of morality and competence."
