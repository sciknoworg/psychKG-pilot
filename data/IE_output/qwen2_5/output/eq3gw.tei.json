    "justification": "The difficulty of coping with income shocks was assessed using a 7-point scale, where 1 indicates no difficulty at all and 7 indicates significant difficulties. This method was used in Experiment 2 to measure the psychological impact of different types of financial shocks."

    "topic_or_construct": "income shocks impact on daily life",
    "measured_by": "negative impact rating scale (1 to 7)",
    "justification": "Participants rated how much the financial shock would impact their daily lives using a 7-point scale, with 1 indicating no negative impact and 7 indicating significant negative impacts. This assessment was part of Experiment 2 to gauge the personal consequences of financial stress."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "perception of loss from financial shocks",
    "measured_by": "agreement scale (1 to 7)",
    "justification": "Participants indicated their level of agreement that the shock felt like a pure loss to them using a 7-point scale, where 1 is completely disagree and 7 is completely agree. This scale helped measure the emotional response to income versus expense shocks in Experiment 2."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "willingness to save for future financial emergencies",
    "measured_by": "willingness scale (1 to 7)",
    "justification": "A 7-point scale was used to measure participants' willingness to save money for future unforeseen financial challenges, ranging from not willing at all (1) to very willing (7). This was recorded in Experiment 2 to assess changes in saving behavior post-shock."

    "topic_or_construct": "self-confidence and positive self-image improvement",
    "measured_by": "self-affirmation procedure (personal experience description)",
    "justification": "Participants in Experiment 3 were asked to describe a personal experience that made them feel successful and proud. This self-affirmation procedure aimed to improve self-confidence and mitigate the psychological effects of financial shocks, demonstrating the link between this construct and the intervention."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "coping methods for financial shocks",
    "measured_by": "multiple choice options for coping methods",
    "justification": "In Experiment 1, participants selected from a list of coping methods to understand how they perceive and handle income and expense shocks. This set of options was designed to reflect common financial coping strategies used by individuals."
