    "justification": "The article employs a streamlined version of prospect theory to measure loss aversion, where the parameter \u03bb captures loss aversion, with individuals being considered loss averse for \u03bb > 1. The estimated \u03bb values were obtained through a hierarchical Bayesian application of this model. This method is explicitly mentioned as a way of capturing individual differences in loss aversion."

    "measured_by": "Behavioral Definition of Loss Aversion",
    "justification": "The paper uses a behavioral definition based on the proportion of riskier choices in mean-preserving pairs. Participants who choose a riskier option less frequently are considered more loss-averse. This measure reflects people's decision-making behavior under given choices, indicating loss aversion directly from the choices rather than relying on a parametric model."

    "measured_by": "Two-Alternative Forced Choice Task",
    "justification": "The study uses a two-alternative forced choice task, where participants pick between two lotteries in each trial. This task is employed because it has desirable psychometric properties and is immune to engagement issues compared to the accept/reject task. Participants' choices in this task are analyzed to assess loss aversion, providing stability across conditions."
