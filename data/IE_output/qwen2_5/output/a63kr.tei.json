    "measured_by": "Type-2 AUC",
    "justification": "The article explains that the Type-2 AUC measures how well confidence ratings distinguish correct from incorrect Type-1 responses, thereby serving as a nonparametric measure of metacognitive sensitivity."

    "topic_or_construct": "Type-2 Accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Meta-d'",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how meta-d', a metric derived from signal detection theory, quantifies metacognitive accuracy by representing the information available for Type-2 decisions in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio."

    "topic_or_construct": "Type-1 Accuracy",
    "measured_by": "d'",
    "justification": "d' is defined as z(hit rate) - z(false alarm rate), serving as a standardized measure of Type-1 performance that can be directly compared across different decision-making tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence Rating Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Response-Congruent Evidence Rule",
    "justification": "The paper evaluates the response-congruent evidence rule as a metacognitive heuristic that calculates confidence ratings by focusing on the selected response, demonstrating hyper-metacognitive sensitivity under certain variance-covariance structures."

    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence Rating Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Balance of Evidence Rule",
    "justification": "The balance of evidence rule, used for decision-making and confidence construction, is described as a normative approach that achieves optimal performance when variance structures are equal."

    "measured_by": "Bidimensional Signal Detection Theory (SDT)",
    "justification": "Bidimensional SDT is employed to simulate different variance-covariance structures affecting Type-1 and Type-2 performance, allowing the paper to evaluate various metacognitive heuristics under realistic conditions."

    "measured_by": "Yes/No and 2AFC Tasks with Type-1 and Type-2 Metrics",
    "justification": "The paper uses Yes/No and 2AFC tasks, alongside metrics like d' and meta-d', to analyze the psychological and metacognitive accuracies in blindsight patients following lesions to the primary visual cortex."
