    "measured_by": "Eye movement patterns and dwell behaviors",
    "justification": "The paper extensively discusses how eye movement data, including dwell patterns, dwell frequencies, and dwell times, were used to infer the underlying cognitive processes involved in risky decision-making. This connection is justified by the assumption that specific patterns of eye movements correspond to distinct decision-making strategies like the Priority Heuristic (PH), Expected Value (EV), and Minimax Heuristic (MM)."

    "measured_by": "Choice consistency and strategy check",
    "justification": "Participants' choices were assessed for consistency with the instructed decision strategies (PH, EV, MM) using both gaze behavior analysis and a strategy check that tested participants' understanding and application of the strategies. This measurement directly links the accuracy of strategy application to observable behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "Information acquisition and processing behavior",
    "measured_by": "Dwell patterns and transitions",
    "justification": "The study used the Search Metric (SM) to evaluate dwell patterns, distinguishing between attribute-wise transitions (within-option transitions) and option-wise transitions (between-option transitions). For instance, the PH and MM resulted in between-option transitions, while EV resulted in within-option transitions, allowing the inference of specific processing behaviors for each decision strategy."
