    "topic_or_construct": "model-based reinforcement learning (RL)",
    "measured_by": "flexible mixture reinforcement learning (RL) model",
    "justification": "The flexible mixture RL model quantified the contributions of both model-based and model-free components of control, adapting mixtures based on task conditions like reward contingency, magnitude, and transition reliability. The model was better at capturing behavioral variance than non-RL models, as supported by AIC scores."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "model-free reinforcement learning (RL)",
    "measured_by": "flexible mixture reinforcement learning (RL) model",
    "justification": "Similarly to the model-based RL, the flexible mixture RL model incorporated the influence of model-free components on behavior, adapting them based on task variables. This model provided a superior fit compared to simpler regression models."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reward prediction error (RPE) within model-based RL",
    "measured_by": "transition reliability and reward magnitude manipulations",
    "justification": "The study demonstrated that model-based RPEs contributed to adaptation by manipulating reward contingency, where state-transition reliability impacted the predictability of rewards and led participants to change their reliance on model-based versus model-free strategies."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "individual variability in model-based vs. model-free control",
    "measured_by": "cluster analysis using mixed-effect logistic regression estimates",
    "justification": "Participants were clustered based on their sensitivity to various task manipulations, which revealed distinct groups showing predominant characteristics of model-based, model-free, mixed strategies, or non-RL alignments, providing evidence for individual differences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "behavioral flexibility vs. inflexibility",
    "measured_by": "response time analysis",
    "justification": "The response time (RT) data helped differentiate participants showing flexible arbitration between model-based and model-free strategies from those predominantly using one approach, like the Mixture group showing swapping patterns aligning with the arbitration hypothesis."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reward prediction errors (RPEs) and model proficiencies",
    "measured_by": "experimental manipulations of reward magnitude reliability and transition reliability",
    "justification": "Manipulations of reward and transition reliability altered RPEs within model-based and model-free systems, affecting participant behavior in line with the hypothesis of a reliability-driven arbitration process."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "model-free RPEs",
    "measured_by": "reward magnitude reliability manipulation",
    "justification": "The influence of model-free RPEs on behavior was observed during periods of low reward magnitude reliability, where the model-free system's reliability was more pronounced, causing participants to adopt more model-based behavior."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "impulsivity",
    "measured_by": "Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS)",
    "justification": "Self-report measures of impulsivity were associated with decreased reliance on both model-based and model-free control mechanisms, highlighting a potential behavior pattern linked with atypical reinforcement learning strategies."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "obsessive-compulsive behavior",
    "measured_by": "Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R)",
    "justification": "Self-report scores on the OCI-R were lower in participants who relied more on model-based control strategies, suggesting a possible inverse relationship between trait compulsivity and effective model-based planning."
