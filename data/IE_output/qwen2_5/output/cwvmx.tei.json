    "justification": "Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, and Anderson (1994) used the Iowa gambling task to study risk-taking and disinhibition in patients with damage to their ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The task involves selecting from decks of cards to achieve the optimal balance of rewards and punishments. The authors found that OFC patients were less sensitive to losing money, indicating the task's role in measuring compulsivity through punishment sensitivity."
