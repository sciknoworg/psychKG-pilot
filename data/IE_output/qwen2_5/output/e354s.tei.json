    "measured_by": "dynamical weighted evidence and visibility model (dynWEV)",
    "justification": "The dynWEV model is a dynamical version of a previously proposed static confidence model, it includes parallel accumulation of evidence for decision and visibility, without penalization for accumulation time, making it suitable for measuring decision confidence in experimental data."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision confidence",
    "measured_by": "drift diffusion confidence model (DDConf)",
    "justification": "The DDConf model is based on the drift diffusion model and assumes confidence is inversely proportional to the square root of decision time. It is used to measure how confidence changes as a function of time in decision tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision confidence",
    "measured_by": "dynamical two-stage signal detection model (dynaViTE)",
    "justification": "The dynaViTE model includes both decision and visibility evidence accumulation processes and considers their weights in forming confidence judgments. It is used to measure confidence by combining evidence from different sources in a decision task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision confidence",
    "measured_by": "race models (IRMt, PCRMt)",
    "justification": "Race models describe confidence based on the balance of evidence between competing accumulators. The IRMt and PCRMt models are used to measure confidence in decision scenarios that involve multiple alternatives."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision confidence",
    "measured_by": "two-stage dynamic signal detection model (2DSD)",
    "justification": "The 2DSD model combines decision theory with confidence judgments by assuming confidence depends solely on post-decision evidence. It is utilized to measure confidence based on the evidence accumulated after the decision is made."
