    "measured_by": "Bimodality Coefficient and Kullback-Leibler Distance",
    "justification": "Polarization is measured using both the bimodality coefficient (BMC) and the Kullback-Leibler Distance (KLD) in this study. The BMC quantifies the degree of bimodality in the data, while the KLD measures the difference between the true information distribution and the distribution of information sampled by participants. These metrics were used to evaluate how different information search tasks influence polarization."

    "topic_or_construct": "Extremism",
    "measured_by": "Variance Ratio",
    "justification": "Extremism is quantified using the variance ratio, which compares the variance of the information sampled by participants to the variance of the true information distribution. Higher variance ratios indicate more extreme information sampling."

    "topic_or_construct": "Information Sampling",
    "measured_by": "Number of Information Pieces Sampled",
    "justification": "Information sampling is measured by the average number of pieces of information participants sampled per condition. This metric helps determine the extent to which participants engage in seeking additional information in choice, comparison, and rating tasks."

    "justification": "Dogmatism was assessed using a 20-item, 7-point Likert scale from Altemeyer (2002). This measurement tool helped evaluate participants\u2019 inclination to maintain beliefs even in the presence of countervailing evidence."

    "justification": "Personal Need for Structure was measured using a 12-item, 6-point Likert scale from Neuberg & Newsom (1993). This scale includes subscales for Desire for Structure and Reaction to Lack of Structure, providing insights into individuals' preferences for simplicity and structure."
