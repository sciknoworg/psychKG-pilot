    "justification": "The article describes using a three-item composite scale to measure decision-makers' predictions of targets' judgments of their reputation. The items were similar across studies, such as '[The Target / I] liked [me / the Decision-Maker] for committing this act', which directly aligns with measuring expectations."

    "justification": "In Study 3 and subsequent studies, composite scales measured both the emotional reactions and perceived instrumental value of necessary evils. For example, in Study 3, the emotional reaction was measured with items such as '[I / The Target would] feel angry', indicating a specific instrumental measurement of reactions."
