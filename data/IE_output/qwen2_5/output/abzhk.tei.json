    "topic_or_construct": "Decision making ability",
    "measured_by": "Evidence Accumulation Models (EAMs)",
    "justification": "The study leverages EAMs such as the Diffusion Decision Model (DDM) and variant models like ARD to measure decision-making processes across different tasks, attributing parameters to latent cognitive constructs like information processing ability, urgency, and response caution."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reversal Learning",
    "measured_by": "RL-Rev Task",
    "justification": "The RL-Rev Task assesses individuals' ability to update their representation of the most valuable stimulus when the reward probabilities switch mid-task, and this is measured using the RL-ARD model, capturing parameters like learning rate and drift rate."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off in Learning",
    "measured_by": "Reinforcement Learning Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off Task (RL-SAT)",
    "justification": "The RL-SAT uses RL-EAMs with urgency components and distinct thresholds for speed-accuracy trade-offs, assessing strategic decision-making under varying time constraints."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Working Memory Performance",
    "measured_by": "Reference-Back Task (RB)",
    "justification": "The RB task uses a specialized RDM variant to isolate cognitive costs of working memory updating and comparison, with parameters reflecting urgency, evidence for each stimulus, and effects of trial type."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Control under Interference",
    "measured_by": "Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT)",
    "justification": "The MSIT assesses cognitive control using an EAM framework with separate drift rates for Flanker and Simon interference effects, capturing participants' ability to handle multitask challenges."
