    "topic_or_construct": "risk-seeking behavior",
    "measured_by": "emotional reactivity and neural markers",
    "justification": "The text indicates that under-regulation of emotions (or unchecked emotional reactions) is associated with risk-seeking behavior, highlighting the role of neural markers and emotional reactivity in contributing to these decision-making patterns."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "risk-averse behavior",
    "measured_by": "emotional regulation",
    "justification": "Over-regulation of emotions, as measured by various emotion regulation strategies, is linked with risk-averse behavior. The paper notes that excessive regulation of emotions can lead to sub-optimal decision outcomes, including a tendency toward risk-averse choices."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "emotion regulation",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reappraisal Strategy",
    "justification": "Throughout the text, cognitive reappraisal is described as a specific emotion regulation strategy frequently examined in the neuroscience literature. It is utilized to guide thoughts and actions, improve decision-making, and influence neural processes associated with risky decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "intolerance of uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "emotional responses during uncertain situations",
    "justification": "Intolerance of uncertainty is associated with heightened negative emotional states during uncertain situations, as indicated in the text, which supports the need for emotion regulation strategies like cognitive reappraisal."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision making",
    "measured_by": "Multi-stage processes involving several cognitive functions",
    "justification": "Decision making is characterized through a multi-stage process involving identifying a problem, evaluating possible outcomes, taking decisive action, anticipating the outcome, dealing with the outcome, and post-decision experiences. Cognitive appraisal and various neural processes are employed in each stage."
