    "justification": "The paper investigates signatures of reinforcement learning in a large-scale data set of human decisions from online chess platforms, specifically examining how players' choices in chess openings are influenced by past actions and outcomes. The analysis shows that players are more likely to repeat a decision if it led to a win, indicating reinforcement learning principles are at work."

    "justification": "The research examines social learning by analyzing how players are influenced by the move choices of their opponents. Observing an opponent decline the gambit increases the player's likelihood to also decline in future instances, suggesting social learning impacts decision-making. Additionally, the repetition of opponent's decisions when those resulted in player loss further shows social learning effects."

    "measured_by": "Exploration and Exploitation Metrics",
    "justification": "Players' decision-making is analyzed by measuring their exploration behavior, that is, whether they consistently repeat successful moves or try out alternative moves. The probability of shifting between moves decreases with experience, indicating a shift from exploratory to exploitative strategies as players better learn the game."

    "measured_by": "Response Times",
    "justification": "Response times serve as a measure of cognitive resources spent on decision-making in chess. Longer response times are associated with a higher probability of declining the gambit, suggesting that players who think longer make better-informed decisions, possibly engaging in deeper forward planning."
