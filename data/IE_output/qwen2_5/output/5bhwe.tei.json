    "justification": "The EVC theory proposes that dACC integrates signals of incentives and demands for control, including processing conflict and surprise, to determine the best allocation of cognitive control across tasks. Evidence from studies confirms that dACC activity tracks both conflict and surprise during value-based choice tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "Processing conflict",
    "measured_by": "Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC) activity",
    "justification": "dACC activity increases with the level of conflict during a choice task, which supports the integration of information pertinent to determining the Expected Value of Control (EVC) and thereby adjusting cognitive control."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Unexpected events (surprise)",
    "measured_by": "Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC) activity",
    "justification": "Similar to processing conflict, dACC activity also scales with the unexpectedness of a stimulus or outcome, which provides evidence for its role in integrating surprise as an important variable in the EVC model to optimize control allocation."
