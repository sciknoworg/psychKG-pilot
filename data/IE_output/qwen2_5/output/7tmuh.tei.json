    "measured_by": "Intoxicated Driving Decision Making Task",
    "justification": "The study used a computerized decision task where participants were presented with hypothetical scenarios varying in the number of drinks consumed and the cost of a ride service, assessing whether participants would choose to drive or take a ride home. This task was used to identify compensatory vs. non-compensatory decision strategies."

    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective intoxication",
    "measured_by": "Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)",
    "justification": "Participants reported their level of subjective intoxication using a VAS from 0 ('not at all') to 100 ('extremely') at various points under intoxication, indicating a direct measure of perceived intoxication levels."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived danger of alcohol-impaired driving",
    "measured_by": "Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)",
    "justification": "Participants rated the perceived danger of driving when intoxicated using a VAS from 0 ('not at all') to 100 ('extremely'), providing insight into their risk perceptions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Intoxicated driving intentions",
    "measured_by": "Hypothetical driving scenarios",
    "justification": "Participants' willingness to drive after consuming alcohol was measured through hypothetical scenarios asking if they would drive specific distances at their current intoxication level. This provided data on intentions under intoxicated states."

    "topic_or_construct": "Baseline AID attitudes",
    "measured_by": "Likert scale item",
    "justification": "Participants' baseline attitudes toward alcohol-impaired driving were assessed with a single item asking them to rate the danger of driving within 2 hours after having 3 drinks on a Likert scale from 1 ('not at all dangerous') to 4 ('very dangerous'), indicating pre-existing perceptions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "AID behavior",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported frequency",
    "justification": "Participants reported the number of times they had driven in the past 3 months and 1 year after consuming 3 or more drinks within a 2-hour period, capturing their actual behavior related to alcohol-impaired driving."
