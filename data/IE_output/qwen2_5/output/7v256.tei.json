    "measured_by": "Inverse Decision-Making Model",
    "justification": "The paper extensively uses the inverse decision-making model to test and predict how people infer others' preferences from observed choices. The model assumes that people reason about others' preferences by inverting a decision-making model that maps preferences to choices (e.g., using Equation 2). These inferences are validated through experiments comparing model predictions to human judgments."

    "measured_by": "Logit Choice Model",
    "justification": "The logit model is used as a decision function within the inverse decision-making approach to predict choice probabilities based on additive utilities. The paper demonstrates how this model fits observed human rankings well, indicating it effectively measures how participants infer preferences."

    "topic_or_construct": "Feature-Based Inference",
    "measured_by": "Weighted Feature Model",
    "justification": "The feature-based approach characterizes people's choices using choice features and maps them directly to preferences. A weighted feature model is developed to integrate various choice features and predict participants' inferences. This model is compared to the inverse decision-making model for predictive accuracy."

    "topic_or_construct": "Preference Inference Principles",
    "measured_by": "Principle of Non-Common Attributes",
    "justification": "The paper discusses the principle of non-common attributes from Jones's and Davis's (1965) correspondent inference theory, which suggests that fewer non-common attributes in a chosen option indicate a stronger preference. The inverse decision-making model successfully captures this principle through its probabilistic framework."

    "topic_or_construct": "Utility Priors",
    "measured_by": "Normal Distribution",
    "justification": "The paper uses a normal distribution with specific mean and variance parameters as the prior for utilities in different attributes. This prior distribution is assumed in the inverse decision-making models to infer decision-makers' preferences given observed choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Positive and Negative Utilities",
    "measured_by": "Experiments with Positive and Negative Attributes",
    "justification": "The paper compares the performance of the inverse decision-making model in conditions where attributes are positive (candies) and negative (electric shocks). The way participants rank choices differently under positive and negative attributes provides insights into how people handle these different types of utilities."
