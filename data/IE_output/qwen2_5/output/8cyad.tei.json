    "measured_by": "Diffusion Decision Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The paper employs the Diffusion Decision Model (DDM) to analyze choices made under various behavioral interventions, fitting the model to participants' choice probabilities and response times to derive key parameters such as starting points, drift rates, and decision boundaries."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Pre-decisional Bias",
    "measured_by": "Starting Point Parameter in DDM",
    "justification": "The starting point parameter in the DDM is used to assess pre-decisional biases, showing how social norms, recommendations, and defaults create an automatic pre-decisional response bias favoring certain options, increasing their choice probability and reducing RTs."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Preference Evaluation",
    "measured_by": "Drift Rate Parameter in DDM",
    "justification": "The drift rate parameter in the DDM is used to evaluate how interventions like social norms, recommendations, and informational prompts influence participants' preferences for certain options during the deliberation process."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Deliberation and Decision Thresholds",
    "measured_by": "Decision Boundary Parameter in DDM",
    "justification": "The decision boundary parameter in the DDM captures how interventions like accountability, accuracy instructions, and time pressure affect the degree of deliberation and the error probability that participants are willing to accept before making a decision."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Behavioral Interventions",
    "measured_by": "Multiple Contextual Factors and Manipulations",
    "justification": "Various behavioral interventions such as social norm, recommendation, default, cognitive load, emotion, and time pressure are systematically manipulated within the experiments and their effects are captured using the DDM parameters."
