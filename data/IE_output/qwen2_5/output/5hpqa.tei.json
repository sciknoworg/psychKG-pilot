    "justification": "The paper uses Experiment 1 to demonstrate how observers learn and combine novel cues (colour, angle, shape, height) with familiar cues (spreads) to estimate the location of hidden objects. The experiment quantifies the variable error as a measure of precision when using these cues alone or in combination."

    "measured_by": "colour-angle-spread cues, colour-shape-spread cues",
    "justification": "Experiment 2 assesses the ability to combine two novel cues (colour and angle, or colour and shape) with each other and with a familiar cue (spread) to improve location estimates. The analysis compares combinations of these novel and familiar cues to establish their effectiveness in reducing variability."

    "measured_by": "variability measures and reliability-weighted averaging",
    "justification": "The study examines whether the combination of novel and familiar cues adheres to Bayesian-like principles, analyzing the variability in responses and comparing them to the optimal variable error predicted by reliability-weighted averaging."
