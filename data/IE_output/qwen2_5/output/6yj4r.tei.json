    "measured_by": "Psychometric model with exponent k parameter",
    "justification": "The study used a psychometric model with an exponent k parameter to capture compression (k < 1) of numerical values in the averaging task, demonstrating that participants compressed extreme numerical values in tasks with lower processing demands."

    "topic_or_construct": "Anti-compression of numerical values",
    "measured_by": "Psychometric model with exponent k parameter",
    "justification": "The same psychometric model's exponent k parameter was used to demonstrate anti-compression (k > 1) of numerical values in the comparison task, showing that anti-compression emerges in cognitively demanding tasks where processing resources are limited."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Recency bias",
    "measured_by": "Leakage parameter l",
    "justification": "The leakage parameter l in the psychometric model indicated a 'recency' bias, showing that participants gave greater weighting to later-presented samples, a finding consistent with previous research."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Overall bias towards larger numbers",
    "measured_by": "Offset bias b parameter",
    "justification": "The offset bias b parameter in the model captured an overall bias towards larger numbers, reflecting that choice decisions were more strongly driven by higher sample values, a phenomenon observed across all experimental conditions."
