    "topic_or_construct": "Extreme pro-group actions",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive and personality measures linked with political conservatism and dogmatism",
    "justification": "The psychological profile of individuals endorsing extreme pro-group actions is a combination of the signatures for political conservatism (e.g., caution, reduced strategic information processing) and dogmatism (e.g., reduced evidence accumulation, impulsivity), suggesting these factors together contribute to predicting extreme pro-group actions."
