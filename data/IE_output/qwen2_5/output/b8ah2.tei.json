    "measured_by": "Sensitivity (d')",
    "justification": "In Experiment 1, a linear increase in sensitivity (d') was observed as the tilt magnitude of a high-contrast Gabor patch was increased in fine-scale increments, supporting a linear transformation. In Experiment 2, sensitivity initially increased but then plateaued and slightly decreased with larger tilt magnitudes of a low-contrast Gabor patch, indicating a non-linear transformation."

    "measured_by": "Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models",
    "justification": "ANNs trained on orientation categorization tasks mirrored the human performance in transformation patterns. For fine-scale increments, ANNs showed a linear increase in internal evidence with tilt magnitude. For coarse-scale increments, the transformation was non-linear, initially increasing and then stabilizing."

    "justification": "The study utilized sensitivity (d\u2032) as a measure of performance in discriminating Gabor patches. The d\u2032 values helped to evaluate how well subjects could distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise orientations in both high- and low-contrast conditions."
