    "justification": "The paper discusses using the Wiener diffusion process to model evidence accumulation in decision-making tasks, highlighting its capacity to predict choice probabilities and response times (RTs). This process is central to understanding how the brain performs cognitive tasks based on noisy neural representations."

    "measured_by": "Ratcliff's diffusion decision model parameters",
    "justification": "The paper details how adjusting parameters such as decision boundary and drift rate within the Ratcliff diffusion decision model can explain the speed-accuracy tradeoff phenomenon. This illustrates how the model's parameters can capture variability in decision-making performance under different task conditions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Drift Rate Variability",
    "measured_by": "Across-trial variability parameters",
    "justification": "The text emphasizes that variability in drift rate across trials is crucial for modeling slow errors. This variability allows diffusion models to capture finer-grained properties of RT distributions and relates to how the brain aggregates information to solve von Neumann\u2019s problem."

    "measured_by": "LDLIV Model Predictions",
    "justification": "The LDLIV model (Linear Drift, Linear Infinitesimal Variance) is introduced as a neurally-inspired model that successfully predicts empirical data by incorporating principles of separate accumulation, boundedness, and positivity. The model's predictions are validated against experimental data from decision-making tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "Neuronal Firing Rates",
    "measured_by": "Positive, Bounded Distributions",
    "justification": "The paper suggests that evidence in accumulators has distributions resembling positive, bounded neuronal firing rates. The fittings of models like LDLIV to empirical data support this interpretation by mirroring the statistical properties of neural processes."
