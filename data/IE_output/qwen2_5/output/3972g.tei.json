    "topic_or_construct": "reward prediction errors (RPEs)",
    "measured_by": "Rescorla-Wagner model",
    "justification": "The study utilized a Rescorla-Wagner reinforcement learning model to estimate RPEs during the decision-making task, capturing how participants update value information based on feedback. This was later correlated with memory performance."

    "topic_or_construct": "perceptual memorability",
    "measured_by": "normed perceptual memorability ratings",
    "justification": "The images used in the experiment were drawn from a database with normed perceptual memorability ratings, providing an objective measure of the intrinsic memorability of stimuli."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "positive affect",
    "measured_by": "state-trait anxiety index (STAI-T), Zung depression scale (SDS), and obsessive-compulsive inventory (OCI-R) as latent factors",
    "justification": "Using psychometric surveys, factor analysis identified positive affect as one of the latent factors, allowing the researchers to measure its impact on the relationship between RPEs and memory."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reward-driven memory enhancement",
    "measured_by": "successful recognition of stimuli associated with higher RPEs",
    "justification": "The researchers found that participants better remembered stimuli associated with positive RPEs, indicating a direct link between reward-driven value and memory enhancement."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "intrinsic memory enhancement",
    "measured_by": "successful recognition of stimuli with higher perceptual memorability",
    "justification": "Stimuli with higher normed perceptual memorability ratings were more likely to be correctly recognized, demonstrating the role of intrinsic information in memory."
