    "measured_by": "Membership function of verbal probability",
    "justification": "The study uses the membership function of verbal probabilities to measure the directionality, as it represents the numerical translations participants associate with verbal expressions. For instance, Honda and Yamagishi (2017) and Juanchich et al. (2013) show that membership values for verbal probabilities help infer the directionality and degree of uncertainty conveyed."

    "measured_by": "DbBS (Decision by Belief Sampling) model predictions",
    "justification": "The framing effect is assessed using predictions from the DbBS model across different experiments. The model captures how participants' decision ratings differ when presented with positive versus negative verbal probabilities, revealing a framing effect. The DbBS model quantitatively predicts decision behaviors and makes inferences about the probabilistic beliefs and reference points."

    "measured_by": "Phrase choice task",
    "justification": "Participants' tendencies to select positive or negative phrases when conveying probabilistic information are measured through a phrase choice task. In Experiment 3, participants selected among 16 phrases for different probability scenarios, and their preferences for positive versus negative phrases were recorded. This task measures the psychological mechanisms influencing directional phrase choices."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reference point hypothesis influence",
    "measured_by": "Listeners' recommendations based on verbal probabilities",
    "justification": "The influence of the reference point hypothesis is measured by analyzing listeners' recommendations on treatment effectiveness based on positive or negative verbal probabilities. Results from Study 1 of Teigen and Brun (1999) reveal higher recommendation degrees for positive verbal probability descriptions compared to negative ones, demonstrating that reference points affect interpretations and decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Probabilistic beliefs in decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Beta distribution parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2)",
    "justification": "Participants' probabilistic beliefs are measured using the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 of the beta distribution, estimated through hierarchical Bayesian analysis. These parameters define the shape of the probabilistic belief distribution, reflecting decision-makers' subjective evaluations of uncertain events. For example, positive phrases led to lower \u03b1 and \u03b2 values compared to negative phrases."
