    "topic_or_construct": "Self-regulation strategies",
    "measured_by": "Mindful Attention Task",
    "justification": "Participants were trained to use mindful attention to regulate their responses to alcohol cues. The task involved 'mentally taking a step back in order to observe the situation and their responses in an impartial and non-judgmental manner,' which is assessed during an alcohol fMRI task and an ecological momentary assessment."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Self-regulation strategies",
    "measured_by": "Perspective-taking Task",
    "justification": "The perspective-taking strategy was measured through a task where participants took the perspective of specific peers when exposed to alcohol cues. In the MRI session, participants imagined the reactions of their peers, and this was further reinforced through external cues in the ecological momentary assessment."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Alcohol craving",
    "measured_by": "Galician Beverage Picture Set",
    "justification": "The Galician Beverage Picture Set was used to elicit and assess alcohol craving. Participants viewed images of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages and rated their craving on a scale, which helps measure the effectiveness of self-regulation interventions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social network proximity",
    "measured_by": "Friendly Universe Task",
    "justification": "This task was used to capture participants\u2019 ego-networks beyond their immediate social groups, including information about node attributes and connections. It allows researchers to construct a broader view of social connections which might influence self-regulation and alcohol consumption."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotion regulation",
    "measured_by": "Emotion Regulation Questionnaire",
    "justification": "The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire is administered as part of the survey measures, evaluating how participants regulate their emotions. This is relevant to understanding the role of emotion regulation in self-regulation strategies related to alcohol consumption."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Trait mindfulness",
    "measured_by": "Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale",
    "justification": "Trait mindfulness was assessed using the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale as part of baseline and follow-up surveys. This measure helps in understanding participants' inherent difficulties or ease in regulating emotions, a key factor in the effectiveness of mindful attention strategies."
