    "justification": "The experiments measured differences in participants' demonstrations and observers' inferences when motivated either to merely 'Do' or to 'Show,' comparing their behavior to simulated belief-directed and instrumental models. The results showed that the belief-directed model captured key aspects of communicative demonstrations, indicating that participants engaged in belief-directed planning."

    "justification": "In Experiments 1b and 2b, observers were presented with trajectory data from 'Do' and 'Show' conditions. Their accuracy and confidence were measured with mixed-effects models showing that observers in communicative conditions performed better when interpretations aligned with pragmatic action."

    "justification": "Infant and child observer studies, such as those by Hernik and Csibra (2015), measured looking times to assess whether infants detected violations of expectations about tool use. The resulted showed higher looking times for incongruent versus congruent demonstrations in communicative conditions, supporting pragmatic interpretation."

    "justification": "Kir\u00e1ly et al. (2013) measured whether infants were more likely to imitate a demonstrator's action based on communicative cues compared to non-communicative contexts. Infants imitated more frequently in the communicative condition when hands were free, a measure of pragmatic interpretation."

    "justification": "Butler and Markman (2012) measured children\u2019s exploration behaviors (e.g., attempts to pick up blickets) after observing demonstrations of causality. Greater exploration in communicative conditions suggests an ability to interpret and infer causal information."
