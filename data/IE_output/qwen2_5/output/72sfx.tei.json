    "justification": "The paper describes a simplified n-armed bandit task where participants choose from different options to collect rewards. The choice patterns and switching behavior were analyzed as indicators of systematic exploration. This task was designed to assess exploration strategies."

    "measured_by": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) Model",
    "justification": "A computational RL model was developed to assess participants' exploration strategies. The model included systematic and random exploration parameters to evaluate the influence of choice lags (a proxy for uncertainty) on participants' decisions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Uncertainty-Based Exploration",
    "measured_by": "Hidden Option Reward Task",
    "justification": "In Experiment 2, the hidden option reward task manipulated uncertainty by hiding the reward value of one option. This task was used to assess whether children's exploration choices were driven by uncertainty, providing evidence for uncertainty-based exploration."
