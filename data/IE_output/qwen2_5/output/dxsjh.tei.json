    "topic_or_construct": "Centroparietal positivity (CPP)",
    "measured_by": "EEG",
    "justification": "The centroparietal positivity (CPP) reflects accumulated sensory evidence and culminates to a threshold voltage around the time of the response. It appears in decision-making tasks and is measured through EEG techniques, showing the same temporal dynamics and spatial topography regardless of sensory and response modalities."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Effector-selective motor preparation EEG activities",
    "measured_by": "EEG",
    "justification": "Effector-selective motor preparation activities, such as the lateralized readiness potential and changes in mu/beta band over the motor cortex, are EEG signals that reflect decision variables mapped onto actions. They appear after onset latency of the CPP and disappear when participants make mental decisions without communicating the outcome."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Premotor and motor times (PMT and MT)",
    "measured_by": "EMG",
    "justification": "The EMG technique measures electrical activity in muscles, which is used to partition reaction time (RT) into premotor time (PMT) and motor time (MT). PMT measures the time from stimulus onset to EMG onset, while MT measures from EMG onset to the response."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Partial EMG bursts",
    "measured_by": "EMG",
    "justification": "Partial EMG bursts are small muscular excitation events that sometimes occur during PMT and do not generate a sufficient force to produce a response. EMG recordings are used to detect these bursts, which are affected by the decision-making process and motor preparation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Motor preparation variable",
    "measured_by": "GCDF model",
    "justification": "The gated cascade diffusion model with a filtering mechanism at the motor preparation level (GCDF) incorporates smoothing mechanisms at the motor preparation level to capture how evidence accumulation processes are transmitted to motor responses. Parameters like leakage and filtering are used to represent the motor preparation stage."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Neural drive to muscle fibers",
    "measured_by": "GCDF model",
    "justification": "GCDF predicts the neural drive to muscle fibers by calculating the evidence-dependent dynamics of the underlying motor preparation signal. Comparisons with full-wave rectified EMG signals confirm that the model captures these neural drive patterns."
