Various experimental conditions manipulated the speed of response times to observe their effects on trust and quality evaluations."

    "justification": "Studies 4a and 4b explicitly manipulated the perceived difficulty of the task for making predictions, with variations in response times indicating whether difficult or easy tasks would lead to different evaluations of prediction quality by participants."

    "measured_by": "Perceived effort from response time",
    "justification": "The experimental setup allowed participants to infer the effort put into generating a prediction based on the speed of the response time, with slower responses interpreted as indicating more effort."
