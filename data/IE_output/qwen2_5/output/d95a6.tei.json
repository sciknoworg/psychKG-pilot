    "justification": "The value-based decision game was used to measure choice perseveration by observing participants' tendency to stick to an initial choice even when an alternative becomes more attractive, thus allowing the evaluation of stability and flexibility in decision making."

    "measured_by": "inter-trial interval (ITI) manipulation",
    "justification": "The ITI manipulation was employed to assess the stability in decision making by introducing more or less time between trials, which impacts the residual activity from the previous decision and affects the likelihood of sticking to the previous choice."

    "topic_or_construct": "flexibility in decision making",
    "measured_by": "stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) manipulation",
    "justification": "The SOA manipulation was utilized to evaluate flexibility in decision making by presenting options with a temporal delay, biasing participants towards the later-presented option and reducing the bias towards the previously chosen one."
