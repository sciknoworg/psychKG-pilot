    "topic_or_construct": "Children's Understanding of Social Structure",
    "measured_by": "Decision-making patterns in group stories",
    "justification": "Children were presented with stories about two groups, the 'Wugs' and 'Flurps,' that differed in their decision-making structures\u2014either hierarchical or egalitarian. The stories did not explicitly mention the structure, allowing children to infer it from the characters' actions. This setup measured children's ability to distinguish and reason about different social structures."

    "topic_or_construct": "Children's Preference for Egalitarian Groups",
    "measured_by": "Children's preference for groups with shared decision-making",
    "justification": "In Study 2, children were asked an open-ended question about what was different between the two groups and whether they would prefer one group over the other. The majority of children (28 out of 32) chose the egalitarian group, indicating a preference for groups that share decision-making equally."

    "topic_or_construct": "Children's Inference of Resource Distribution",
    "measured_by": "Prediction of resource sharing by group members",
    "justification": "Children predicted how many strawberries a new member of each group would share with another member. Older children consistently predicted that members of the egalitarian group would share more resources than members of the hierarchical group, demonstrating their ability to infer resource distribution based on group structure."

    "topic_or_construct": "Children's Ability to Identify Leadership",
    "measured_by": "Ability to identify 'someone in charge' within groups",
    "justification": "Children were asked which group had someone in charge. Older children (ages 6-8) were more likely to correctly identify the hierarchical group as having a leader, showing an age-related improvement in recognizing leadership within social structures."
