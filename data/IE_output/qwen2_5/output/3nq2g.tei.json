    "measured_by": "dynWEV model",
    "justification": "The dynWEV model incorporates both decision-relevant evidence and stimulus reliability in computing confidence, providing a more accurate fit compared to other models in terms of the relationship between stimulus discriminability, confidence, and response time distributions. This model includes a postdecisional accumulation period and a visibility process, allowing it to account for confidence judgments effectively."

    "topic_or_construct": "choice decision process",
    "measured_by": "drift diffusion model",
    "justification": "The drift diffusion model represents one process that evolves linearly with varying drift rates depending on the stimulus. It is used to measure binary decision-making processes by assessing when the accumulated evidence reaches a boundary, thereby triggering a decision. The model includes mechanisms such as inter-trial variability in drift rates and non-decision time components."

    "topic_or_construct": "decision confidence",
    "measured_by": "two-stage dynamical signal detection model (2DSD)",
    "justification": "The 2DSD model includes a postdecisional period of evidence accumulation after the initial decision is made. This allows the model to account for variations in confidence judgments and is used to measure decision confidence by comparing the accumulated evidence to set criteria."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "multiple-alternative decision process",
    "measured_by": "race models",
    "justification": "Race models assume multiple accumulation processes, one for each possible decision alternative. The decision is made when one of the processes hits its boundary first. These models are suitable for measuring decision-making in multi-alternative tasks."
