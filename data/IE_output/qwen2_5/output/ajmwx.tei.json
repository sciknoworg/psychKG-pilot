    "measured_by": "fixation times",
    "justification": "Fixation times are directly recorded and analyzed to quantify the attentional bias that influences the choice behavior, as fixating longer on an item increases its likelihood of being chosen."

    "justification": "The standard deviation of the posterior distribution over value is used as a measure of posterior uncertainty, which is integrated into the utility computation to reflect uncertainty aversion in decision-making."
