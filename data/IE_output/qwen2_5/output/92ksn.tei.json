    "topic_or_construct": "Mobile Vibration Reward Response",
    "measured_by": "Vibration Response Questionnaire",
    "justification": "The article describes a Vibration Response Questionnaire where participants rated various vibrotactile stimuli on items like 'This vibration is like a reward'. This scale was used to measure participants' subjective reward response to different vibration durations."

    "topic_or_construct": "Impulsivity",
    "measured_by": "Barratt Impulsiveness Scale",
    "justification": "The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale was used to measure participants' levels of impulsivity, with selected items from the full 30-item version reflecting impulsive behavior. Higher impulsivity was linked to stronger vibration reward responses in several studies within the paper."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward Sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Reward Sensitivity Scale",
    "justification": "A reward sensitivity scale was used in Study 1 and other studies, consisting of items like 'When good things happen to me, it affects me strongly'. The scale captured how sensitive participants were to rewards and was correlated with mobile vibration reward responses."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Touch Proclivity",
    "measured_by": "Need for Touch Scale",
    "justification": "The Need for Touch Scale included items like 'I feel more confident making a purchase after touching a product' and was used to assess participants' general tendency towards seeking tactile experiences, which may influence their response to mobile vibrations."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Mobile Notification Valence",
    "measured_by": "Notification Valence Survey",
    "justification": "A survey asked participants about the valence of their daily mobile notifications, with items like 'What percentage of the notifications that you receive are welcome?'. Higher valence notifications were linked to stronger vibration reward responses."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Classical Conditioning of Vibration Reward",
    "measured_by": "Multi-arm Bandit Conditioning Task",
    "justification": "In Study 4, the Multi-arm Bandit Conditioning Task was used to condition participants to associate a neutral vibration with either a reward or a loss. This demonstrated that conditioned positive valence led participants to associate a neutral vibration with a reward response."
