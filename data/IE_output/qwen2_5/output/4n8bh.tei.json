    "justification": "The research employed estimation tasks where participants provided personal estimates and then second estimates after receiving social information. The sensitivity to social influence (S) was calculated as the weight given to the social information, which assesses how much participants adjusted their estimates based on the social information received."

    "measured_by": "Median of X values",
    "justification": "Collective and individual accuracies were measured by defining collective accuracy as the absolute value of the median of the log-normalized estimates across individuals and questions. Individual accuracy was measured as the median of the absolute values of the log-normalized distance between individual estimates and the true value, assessing accuracy improvements after social information exchange."

    "measured_by": "Treatment conditions: Sorted, Unsorted, Aggregated",
    "justification": "The paper defined three treatment conditions (Sorted, Unsorted, and Aggregated) to examine how participants integrate and respond to social information differently. The conditions manipulated whether participants received individual estimates, random estimates, or an aggregated mean, influencing their estimation strategies."
