    "justification": "The article uses dilemmas adapted from Maier et al. [31] where options are framed such that following the rule coincides with action or inaction, to measure how LLMs respond under conditions of omission bias. Results show that all LLMs preferred the CBR option significantly less when it coincided with action than with omission."

    "measured_by": "Reframed moral dilemmas altering framing of the CBR or rule option",
    "justification": "By reversing the framing of the yes/no options in dilemmas, the study demonstrates that LLMs display a tendency to endorse responses framed as 'no' compared to humans. Notably, this bias was consistent across various prompts."

    "justification": "Collective action problems from Burga et al. [48] and Gro\u00df et al. [49] are used to assess levels of altruism in both humans and LLMs. Results indicated LLMs showed more altruistic responses compared to human participants."

    "measured_by": "Trolley problem variants",
    "justification": "The study utilized trolley problems and similar dilemmas to differentiate between choices based on cost-benefit reasoning and adherence to moral rules. LLMs often showed preferences that reflected naive cost-benefit reasoning rather than rule adherence."
