    "measured_by": "Perceived Support for Policy Issues",
    "justification": "The study examined participants' expectations of different racial groups' policy support by asking them to rate the degree to which various racial groups supported specific policies, such as welfare, low-income housing, and establishing English as the official language. These ratings were analyzed to determine if expectations aligned with policy-stereotype matching predictions, showing that participants expected groups disadvantaged in a policy domain to support related policies."

    "measured_by": "Perceptions of Policy Preferences and Coalitional Expectations",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to indicate their guesses of how much different racial groups (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian Americans) would support various policies. The results were analyzed to see if participants expected White policy attitudes to broadly differ from those of a broad coalition of racial minorities, indicating alignment with White-minority dichotomy predictions."

    "measured_by": "Sorting Task for Coalitional Preferences",
    "justification": "In Study 2b, a sorting task was used to assess expectations of coalitions where participants were asked to place different racial groups into coalitions for various policies. The analysis revealed that expectations of coalitions were more consistent for disadvantaged groups, reflecting stereotypes related to coalitional encoding."

    "measured_by": "Self-Reported Policy Support in National Surveys",
    "justification": "Study 4a used data from the American National Election Studies Time-Series Study to measure actual policy preferences of different racial groups regarding federal spending for low-income individuals and immigration. The findings were then compared to stereotypic expectations captured in previous studies, revealing limited support for the policy-stereotype matching model."

    "measured_by": "Resource Allocation and Voting Preferences",
    "justification": "In Study 5, participants made decisions and allocated resources in hypothetical scenarios affecting Black and Asian American communities. These choices were analyzed to determine the extent to which individuals employed racial-political stereotypes to strategically enhance or suppress the political influence of racial minority groups, demonstrating real-world application of stereotypes."
