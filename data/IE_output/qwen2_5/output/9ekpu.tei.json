    "topic_or_construct": "Working Memory Capacity",
    "measured_by": "Operation Span",
    "justification": "The text states that Operation Span is a complex span task used to assess working memory capacity, specifically noting it as an example of a storage-plus-processing task that is heavily reliant on the central executive component. These tasks are designed to prevent rehearsal of items by introducing a secondary processing task."

    "topic_or_construct": "Working Memory Capacity",
    "measured_by": "Reading Span",
    "justification": "Reading Span is another complex span task mentioned for assessing working memory capacity, which involves an interwoven processing task (reading comprehension) and is used to measure an individual's ability to maintain information while processing complex cognitive demands."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attention Control",
    "measured_by": "Antisaccade Task",
    "justification": "The Antisaccade Task is described as a pure accuracy-based measure of attention control that requires an individual to overcome the prepotent response to a stimulus and instead focus on a target elsewhere, tapping into attentional mechanisms necessary for inhibitory control."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attention Control",
    "measured_by": "Selective Visual Arrays",
    "justification": "Selective visual arrays tasks are noted for measuring individual differences in selective attention by requiring participants to filter out distractors and focus on relevant stimuli, thus highlighting the role of attention control in performance variation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fluid Intelligence",
    "measured_by": "Raven's Matrices",
    "justification": "Fluid intelligence is mentioned in relation to tasks like Raven's Matrices, which assess reasoning and problem-solving abilities. The paper suggests that attention control factors heavily influence performance on such tasks, linking attention control to fluid intelligence."
