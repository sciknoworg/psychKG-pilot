    "justification": "The study explicitly measured risky choice biases in different decision contexts using a structured choice task comprising blocks of trials with discrete contexts, supported by outcomes showing significant differences in risk preferences based on the decision context presented (e.g., t-tests highlighting differences in risky choices for target options between contexts)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Memory for Extreme Outcomes",
    "measured_by": "First Outcome Report Test and Frequency Judgment Test",
    "justification": "Memory biases for extreme outcomes were assessed via two tests conducted post-choice task: a first outcome reported test and a frequency judgment test. These tests demonstrated that participants were more likely to recall and ascribe higher frequencies to extreme outcomes in their respective decision contexts, indicating contextual memory effects."

    "topic_or_construct": "Context-dependent Memory",
    "measured_by": "Recontextualized Choice in Test Blocks",
    "justification": "The role of encoding context on subsequent choice was measured by testing participants in the final phase with altered contexts. Participants\u2019 choices aligned with the original encoding context rather than the retested context, suggesting memory is tied more to encoding context than retrieval context."
