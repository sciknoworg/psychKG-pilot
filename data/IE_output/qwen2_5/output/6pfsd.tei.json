    "justification": "Confidence ratings were systematically collected to assess participants' belief about which deck provided the higher average reward. The scale, which ranged from 50 (total uncertainty) to 100 (complete confidence), was used to explore the effects of observational learning, losses, and choice agency on confidence. Confidence ratings were lower in contexts with losses and fewer own choices, as demonstrated across the experiments."

    "topic_or_construct": "Observational Learning",
    "measured_by": "Observation trials and Choice trials",
    "justification": "The frequency of observation was manipulated in the experiments by offering participants the choice to observe another agent or make their own choices. The level of observational learning was observed to increase in contexts with frequent losses and expert observees. Observation trials were contrasted with choice trials to analyze the influence of agency (own choices) versus observation on confidence and decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Agency",
    "measured_by": "Own choices vs. Observation trials",
    "justification": "The influence of choice agency was measured by comparing blocks where participants had complete choice agency (always made their own choices) with blocks where observation was randomly interleaved with choice trials. Higher confidence was observed in situations where participants made more of their own choices, illustrating the impact of choice agency on metacognitive confidence."

    "topic_or_construct": "Reward Valence",
    "measured_by": "High reward vs. Low reward blocks",
    "justification": "Reward valence was manipulated by offering blocks with high rewards and low rewards. Participants were less confident in their judgments in low reward blocks despite choosing the best alternative more often. This indicates that reward valence influenced confidence, with higher rewards supporting greater confidence."
