    "justification": "The article discusses the use of reading times, measured through eye movements or self-paced reading, as a common type of data explained by dynamical models in psycholinguistics. This is noted in the context of how the mparse model predicts reading times for various sentence structures."

    "measured_by": "Splitting probabilities",
    "justification": "The paper discusses splitting probabilities as a measure to understand how the parser, mparse, differentiates between various parses of ambiguous sentences. This is specifically linked to splitting probabilities calculated for the example sentence with two possible parses."

    "measured_by": "Conditional first-passage times",
    "justification": "The conditional first-passage times are explained as a measure used by the mparse model to predict reading times given the preference for a particular parse. The article mentions that these can be used to testable predictions about reading behavior in different parse conditions."

    "measured_by": "Exit time distribution",
    "justification": "The article introduces the exit time distribution as a method mparse uses to predict the time it takes to process each word or group of words till an absorbing state is reached, which corresponds to a recognizable parse."

    "measured_by": "Splitting probabilities and Conditional first-passage times",
    "justification": "The text suggests that splitting probabilities and conditional first-passage times can be used to predict performance on comprehension questions. These metrics are proposed as a way to link online reading behavior with comprehension."

    "topic_or_construct": "Dynamical sentence comprehension",
    "measured_by": "mparse model",
    "justification": "The entire paper is centered around mparse, a new dynamical model of sentence comprehension. Although mparse itself is not directly a measurement instrument, it forms the basis for generating predictions with other measurements mentioned, tying the model's theoretical framework to empirical methods."
