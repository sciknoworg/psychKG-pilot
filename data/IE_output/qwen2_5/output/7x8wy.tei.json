    "topic_or_construct": "Energy Saving",
    "measured_by": "Card Spread Position",
    "justification": "The article mentions that to save energy in decision making, spectators are more likely to pick cards from a more reachable position in a spread. The magician strategically places desired cards in positions that are easier to reach, such as the third card from the left if the spectator is right-handed, which directly measures the cognitive bias of energy saving in decision making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Expectation",
    "measured_by": "Magician's Attitude and Instructions",
    "justification": "The expectation construct is measured by the magician's demeanor and choice of words, which can minimize the spectator's anticipation. This approach ensures less scrutiny on the deck during a decision-making task, illustrating the construct's impact on attention and decision logic."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reactance",
    "measured_by": "Psychological Resistance",
    "justification": "Reactance is measured by the spectators' tendency to resist obvious choices to reestablish a sense of freedom. The article uses an example of magicians presenting a card visibly obvious so the spectator resists and picks the magicians' desired card instead, exemplifying manipulation via psychological reactance."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reasoning",
    "measured_by": "Mathematical Formulas with Perception",
    "justification": "Reasoning is assessed through spectators' mental calculations affected by mathematical constructs. Magicians can force decisions using simple yet hidden formulas that return a predictable outcome regardless of the spectator\u2019s inputs, incorporating mathematical reasoning and spectator perceptual limits."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Memory",
    "measured_by": "Deck\u536b\u751f\u5229\u7528\u6280\u5de7",
    "justification": "Memory's role in decision-making is captured through use of marked cards or well-practiced techniques that exploit spectator's memory decay or primacy/recency effects. For example, providing time between the control tactic and decision-making obscures the magician's manipulation, measuring reliance on memory processes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Perception",
    "measured_by": "Saliency of Card Presentation",
    "justification": "Perception is measured by manipulating the spectator\u2019s visual focus on certain cards via saliency. Marking the back of a card or mise-en-sc\u00e8ne makes it more noticeable yet seemingly incidental, a direct measurement of perception's impact on apparent free decision-making."
