    "justification": "The coordination task, consisting of 25 items designed to model 'meeting' style coordination problems, was used to assess intergroup and intragroup tacit coordination performance, as individuals and groups attempted to match responses on various tasks."

    "justification": "Consensual salience, which is tested through the majority-wins decision scheme, was demonstrated in cases where a majority of group members selected the same option, increasing the likelihood of successful coordination."

    "measured_by": "truth-wins decision scheme",
    "justification": "Disjunctive salience was measured using the truth-wins decision scheme, where the focal point, suggested by at least one group member, was likely to be adopted, even if not initially a majority position."

    "topic_or_construct": "focal points",

    "justification": "Focal points were identified as the most commonly selected responses across all groups and individuals, which indicates their effectiveness in achieving tacit coordination."
