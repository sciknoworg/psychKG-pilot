    "justification": "The article states, 'We assessed narcissism using the NPI-15. For the scale, participants were given 15 pairs of phrases; one phrase represented a narcissistic response, the other a non-narcissistic response.' This indicates that the NPI was used to measure narcissism as a psychological construct."
