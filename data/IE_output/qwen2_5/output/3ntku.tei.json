    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived freedom of choice",
    "measured_by": "Free-sliding visual analogue scale",
    "justification": "Participants provided ratings of their perceived level of freedom for the left and right rooms using a free-sliding visual analogue scale ranging from 'Not free' (0) to 'Very free' (10), indicating that this scale was used to measure their subjective experience of freedom in making choices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice behavior bias",
    "measured_by": "Choice proportions analysis",
    "justification": "The article described a method for calculating choice bias by analyzing the proportion of trials participants selected the room with more options over the room with fewer options, demonstrating that this metric was employed to measure the bias towards choice availability."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Utility-seeking behavior",
    "measured_by": "Linear regression analysis",
    "justification": "The researchers performed a linear regression analysis to predict participants' choices based on comparative values, using this method to quantify how utility-seeking influenced choice behavior in the experiment."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Motion trajectory variability",
    "measured_by": "Discrete Fr\u00e9chet distance",
    "justification": "The discrete Fr\u00e9chet distance was used to measure path variability by calculating the similarity between participants' trajectories and the mean trajectory for each condition, reflecting the deliberation process during decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Changes of mind during decision-making",
    "measured_by": "X-flips analysis",
    "justification": "X-flips, or large-scale changes of direction in the decision trajectories, were detected using a 2x5 ANOVA to assess how often participants changed their path mid-choice, evidencing the analysis of decision dynamics."
