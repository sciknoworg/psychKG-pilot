    "topic_or_construct": "Beauty responses",
    "measured_by": "Subjective reports of beauty experience",
    "justification": "The article states, 'Since there is no independent biological marker that can be used to identify neurobiological states as beautiful, all such studies rely on subjects reporting whether they experience something as beautiful or not.' This indicates that subjective reports are used as the primary method to measure beauty responses."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Aesthetic evaluations",
    "measured_by": "Neuroimaging experiments (e.g., fMRI)",
    "justification": "The text mentions, 'Current evidence from human neuroimaging experiments suggests that aesthetic evaluations rely on the engagement of neural nuclei that generate degrees of pleasure and displeasure.' This shows that neuroimaging techniques are employed to measure how the brain responds during aesthetic evaluations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Liking and wanting processes",
    "measured_by": "Reinforcement learning models",
    "justification": "The passage explains, 'Reinforcement learning models suggest that organisms use their experiences of how likable an object is to form habits about which parts of the world it should approach, and which it should avoid.' Thus, reinforcement learning models are used to measure liking and wanting processes in the context of pleasure."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Pleasure ratings",
    "measured_by": "Rating scales for different evaluative judgments (e.g., beauty, pleasantness, liking)",
    "justification": "The paper notes, 'Experiments where the same pool of stimuli are rated according to different kinds of evaluative judgments, such as pleasantness, liking, or beauty, have consistently found that beauty judgments are highly correlated with pleasure ratings.' This implies that rating scales for different judgments are used to measure pleasure."
