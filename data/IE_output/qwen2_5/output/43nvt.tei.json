    "measured_by": "Dictator game",
    "justification": "The dictator game serves as a key experimental paradigm for studying factors associated with people's decisions about redistributing resources. In a typical dictator game, one player (the dictator) decides how to distribute resources between themselves and another player (the recipient), providing insights into social preferences and behaviors like fairness, generosity, and inequality aversion."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Inequality aversion",
    "measured_by": "Fehr-Schmidt model",
    "justification": "The Fehr-Schmidt model captures inequality aversion, including aversion to both advantageous and disadvantageous inequality, as non-economic parameters to explain redistribution decisions. This model considers how dictators balance self-interest with fairness concerns in economic decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social image concerns and social norms",
    "measured_by": "Andreoni-Bernheim social image model",
    "justification": "The Andreoni-Bernheim social image model incorporates social image concerns and norms to explain decision making. It suggests that dictators\u2019 redistribution decisions are influenced by how their actions reflect on their reputation and alignment with social expectations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fairness preference and altruism",
    "measured_by": "One-person single-shot dictator game",
    "justification": "One-person single-shot dictator games help isolate innate contributions of fairness preference and altruism by removing strategic considerations and reciprocity, allowing researchers to observe non-strategic motivations for sharing in a controlled setting."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Big Five Agreeableness and HEXACO Honesty-Humility",
    "measured_by": "Dictator game",
    "justification": "Research has shown that individuals with stronger traits of Big Five Agreeableness and HEXACO Honesty-Humility redistribute more money to recipients in dictator games, demonstrating the link between these personality traits and prosocial behaviors."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Recipient identity (social distance)",
    "measured_by": "Dictator game",
    "justification": "Recipient identity, such as nationality or kinship, modulates dictators' decisions by affecting perceived social distance. Dictators tend to give more money to recipients with whom they share a closer social connection, like family members or compatriots."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Framing effects",
    "measured_by": "Dictator game with varied descriptions",
    "justification": "Framing effects in dictator games are observed when altering the wording of game descriptions influences the dictators\u2019 sharing behavior, even with the underlying game logic unchanged. This highlights how language can trigger specific traits or perceptions."
