    "measured_by": "Dopamine Release in the Dorsal Striatum",
    "justification": "The study indicates that primary reward signals for glucose metabolism, such as when glucose is oxidized into ATP, result in dopamine release in the dorsal striatum. This release is essential for sustaining reinforcement behavior, as demonstrated by studies where this dopamine release is blocked by 2 deoxyglucose (2-DG) causing a decline in reinforce behaviors such as licking for glucose (Tellez et al., 2013b)."

    "measured_by": "Dopamine Responses in VTA",
    "justification": "Research shows that water consumption's reinforcing effect involves dopamine responses in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) triggered by changes in systemic osmolality and rehydration. Direct infusion of water into the stomach, bypassing oral consumption, elicits the same dopamine response, whereas a dehydrating hypertonic solution does not (Grove et al., 2022). This demonstrates that the post-oral reward signal for water consumption is linked to systemic rehydration."

    "measured_by": "Intragastric Infusion of Carbohydrates or Nutrients",
    "justification": "Studies involving mice have conditionally paired flavors with intragastric delivery of carbohydrates, showing that such conditioning leads to the development of preferences for previously neutral or unappealing flavors. This indicates that taste preferences can be shaped by the post-ingestive effects of nutrients, rather than solely by immediate oral cues (Difeliceantonio et al., 2018)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Oral Proxy Rewards in Food Intake",
    "measured_by": "Response of Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc) in Ventral Striatum",
    "justification": "Early oral sensory signals, which function as proxy rewards, predominantly activate the ventral striatum, particularly the nucleus accumbens. This activation precedes the arrival of post-oral primary reward signals and helps bridge the delay between action and reward, facilitating quicker learning and value assignment to food consumption (Grove et al., 2022; Tellez et al., 2016)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Nutrient-specific Reward Pathways for Fat and Sugar",
    "measured_by": "Activation of Distinct Gut-Brain Circuitry",
    "justification": "The brain has separate but parallel gut-brain circuits for recognizing and processing rewards from different macronutrients like fat and sugar. Specifically, fat is sensed in the upper intestine through a pathway involving PPAR-\u03b1 activation and vagus nerve signaling, whereas glucose oxidation generates its reward via the hepatoportal vein and nodose ganglion neurons, both converging on dopaminergic midbrain circuits (McDougle et al., 2024; Han et al., 2018)."
