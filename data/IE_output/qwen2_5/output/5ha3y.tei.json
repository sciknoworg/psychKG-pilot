    "measured_by": "Facial electromyography",
    "justification": "Topolinski and Strack employed facial electromyography to measure people's responses immediately following surprising information, observing that participants flexed their corrugator muscles, which indicated negative valence, suggesting this method can quantify the impact of surprise."

    "measured_by": "Simple two-armed bandit task",
    "justification": "The study simulated a simple two-armed bandit task to investigate the relationship between stay probability and reward history, finding that a reward history generating larger surprises affected the stay probability within the surprise-sensitive utility model."

    "topic_or_construct": "Surprise",
    "measured_by": "Risky probabilistic learning task",
    "justification": "The risky probabilistic learning task was used to simulate and compare different reinforcement learning models, showing that the proposed surprise-sensitive utility model explained risk aversion choices by incorporating the effect of surprise on outcome value."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Aversion Choices",
    "measured_by": "Surprise-sensitive utility model",
    "justification": "The study utilized the surprise-sensitive utility model to explain risk averse choices and found that risk aversion increased as the modulation rate of surprise increased, indicating the model's relevance in measuring this construct."

    "topic_or_construct": "Prediction Error",
    "measured_by": "Q-learning model",
    "justification": "The Q-learning model was used as a base model where the prediction error updates the predicted outcome value. This model forms the basis for understanding how discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes influence subsequent decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Autism Spectrum Disorder",
    "measured_by": "Surprise-sensitive utility model",
    "justification": "The paper describes that the surprise-sensitive utility model could explain certain behavioral symptoms of autism, such as avoidance of social situations, by showing how unexpected events might decrease the value of subsequent choices disfavoring less predictable options."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making under uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Four-armed bandit task",
    "justification": "Goris et al.'s gamble task, a kind of four-armed bandit task, was used to test the surprise-sensitive utility model. The task had choices with different levels of reward predictability, helping to investigate the generalizability of the surprising outcome-value relationship."
