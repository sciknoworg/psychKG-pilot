    "justification": "The study used M ratio (the ratio of meta-d\u2032 to d\u2032) and M dif f (the difference between meta-d\u2032 and d\u2032) to measure metacognitive efficiency. These measures were based on signal detection theory (SDT) and quantified how well participants' confidence levels differentiated between correct and incorrect judgments relative to their actual knowledge."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "political knowledge",
    "measured_by": "d\u2032 as specified in an SDT framework",
    "justification": "Political knowledge was quantified using d\u2032, which measures participants' ability to discern true from false political statements based on their true-positive and false-positive rates. This was an objective-level measure used to assess their ability to accurately evaluate political information."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "metacognitive sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "meta-d\u2032",
    "justification": "Metacognitive sensitivity was quantified using meta-d\u2032, which represents the degree to which participants' confidence judgments differentiated between correct and incorrect accuracy judgments, given their level of knowledge. This measure helped evaluate participants' ability to assess the accuracy of their political knowledge."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "statement concordance",
    "measured_by": "concordance coding based on slant, truth, and political views",
    "justification": "The concordance coding was used to operationalize statement concordance, which considered a statement's slant, its truth, and the participant's political views. This method categorized statements as concordant, discordant, or neutral, helping to analyze metacognitive efficiency across different statement types."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "statement congruency",
    "measured_by": "coding based on slant alignment with political views",
    "justification": "Statement congruency was operationalized using coding based on the alignment of a statement's slant with a participant's political views. This helped in determining whether statements were congruent (aligned) or incongruent (misaligned) with the participant's ideology, affecting metacognitive sensitivity and efficiency."
