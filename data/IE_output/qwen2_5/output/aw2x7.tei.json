    "measured_by": "Binary choice task featuring a sure and a risky option",
    "justification": "The experiments in the study use a binary choice task with a sure and risky option to investigate epistemic curiosity as a potential driver of increased risky choice rates in the presence of partial feedback, where participants value the uncertainty resolution associated with risky choices."

    "topic_or_construct": "Anticipated regret",
    "measured_by": "Binary choice task with complete feedback",
    "justification": "The study employs a binary choice task with complete feedback to explore how anticipated regret could be influencing increased risk-taking when participants consider the potential regret from not choosing the option that delivers the best outcome most of the time."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Feedback effects on decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Experimental design with partial or complete feedback conditions",
    "justification": "The researchers systematically manipulate the presence or absence of feedback (both partial and complete) across multiple experiments to assess its impact on risk preferences and decision-making processes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk preferences",
    "measured_by": "R-rate (risky-choice rate)",
    "justification": "Risky choice rates are used as a primary measure to quantify individuals' propensity to choose risky options over sure or safe options across various experimental conditions, including different feedback settings."

    "topic_or_construct": "Optimal choice rate",
    "measured_by": "O-rate calculation accounting for Expected Value (EV) maximizing choices",
    "justification": "The optimal choice rate, or O-rate, is measured as the frequency with which participants choose the option with the highest expected value, allowing the researchers to evaluate the impact of feedback on decision optimality."

    "topic_or_construct": "Learning hypothesis",
    "measured_by": "Trial-by-trial analysis of risky choice rates",
    "justification": "The trial-by-trial dynamics analysis allowed the researchers to test the learning hypothesis by assessing whether the effect of feedback on risky choices gradually increases over trials, which would indicate learning from feedback."
