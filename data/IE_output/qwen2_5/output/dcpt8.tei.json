    "topic_or_construct": "Arousal",
    "measured_by": "Skin Conductance",
    "justification": "Skin conductance measures the electrical conductance of the skin in response to sweat secretion, which increases with arousal. It is commonly used to measure arousal in political psychology studies, such as in response to political stimuli. Increases in skin conductance are linked to heightened arousal in response to both positive and negative stimuli, including political news and rhetoric (Potter & Bolls, 2012)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Emotional Valence",
    "measured_by": "Facial Electromyography (fEMG)",
    "justification": "fEMG measures the electrical activity of facial muscles associated with emotional responses, particularly the corrugator supercilii for negative emotions and the zygomaticus major for positive emotions. It has been used in political psychology to detect rapid, automatic affective responses to political information. For example, stronger corrugator activity is found in response to negative political stimuli, supporting its use as a measure of valence (Bakker et al., 2021)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attention",
    "measured_by": "Heart Rate Variability",
    "justification": "Heart rate variability can indicate attentional processes, with decreases in heart rate suggesting increased cognitive focus on stimuli. In political psychology, it has been used to measure attention to political news, showing stronger differences in responses to negative versus positive news, indicative of greater attention to negative content (Soroka & McAdams, 2015)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Visual Attention",
    "measured_by": "Eye Tracking",
    "justification": "Eye tracking measures visual attention by recording gaze patterns, useful for analyzing how individuals focus on political stimuli in media. In political psychology, it has revealed differences in visual attention toward congruent versus incongruent stimuli, indicating selective attentional biases in information processing (Coronel & Federmeier, 2016)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Neural Processing",
    "measured_by": "Electroencephalography (EEG)",
    "justification": "EEG captures brain activity to measure cognitive and affective processing of political stimuli. In political psychology, event-related potentials (ERPs) like the N400 have been used to examine semantic and affective incongruity in response to political information, providing deeper insights into early cognitive processes (Morris et al., 2003)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Ideological Differences",
    "measured_by": "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)",
    "justification": "fMRI measures brain activity to explore ideological differences in neural responses. In political psychology, it has been used to investigate how liberals and conservatives differ in brain region activation (e.g., amygdala) when processing political information, contributing to the understanding of the neurological basis of political orientation (Kanai et al., 2011)."
