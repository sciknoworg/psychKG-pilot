    "justification": "The development of MODe-Lite was designed to assess decision-making processes in cancer multidisciplinary tumor boards. It retains the critical elements of the original MODe tool while simplifying them for clinical practice, ensuring its use can aid in quality improvement and streamlining of processes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Holistic Input in Clinical Collaboration",
    "measured_by": "MODe-Lite Tool",
    "justification": "The study specifies that holistic inputs tend to be underrepresented in tumor board decision-making but are essential for implementing treatment recommendations. The MODe-Lite tool specifically scores separate domains for holistic input and clinical collaboration to help teams assess and improve these aspects."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Team Collaboration and Contribution",
    "measured_by": "MODe-Lite Tool",
    "justification": "MODe-Lite includes a domain to assess clinical collaboration. It evaluates the contributions of different team members, highlighting that collaboration can be suboptimal yet critical for effective decision-making in tumor board meetings."

    "topic_or_construct": "Case Complexity in Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "MODe-Lite Tool",
    "justification": "The MODe-Lite tool is shown to positively correlate with the MeDiC (Measure of case-Discussion Complexity) tool, validating its ability to measure the impact of case complexity on decision-making processes in multidisciplinary tumor boards."
