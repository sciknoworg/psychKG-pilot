    "measured_by": "Signed KL Divergence (DKL)",
    "justification": "The article uses signed KL divergence to formally quantify the shift in model parameters (km and ku) due to social influence, capturing the difference between participants' discounting distributions before and after exposure to others' preferences. This metric was selected to evaluate overall changes in susceptibility."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal Impulsivity",
    "measured_by": "Preference-Uncertainty (KU) Model",
    "justification": "The KU model was applied to quantify participants' temporal impulsivity (km) by estimating their discount rate distribution and discount parameters. This model allowed for the evaluation of baseline temporal discounting preferences and subsequent changes in response to social influence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Preference Learning",
    "measured_by": "Delegated Intertemporal Choice Task",
    "justification": "Participants engaged in the delegated intertemporal choice task, which involved learning and making choices about future rewards. This task was used to assess their baseline temporal discounting preferences and their susceptibility to social influence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Damaged mPFC Impact",
    "measured_by": "Voxel-Based Lesion Symptom Mapping (VLSM)",
    "justification": "VLSM analyses were conducted to correlate specific mPFC subregion damage with behavioral changes such as increased susceptibility to impulsive social influence and temporal impulsivity. This method localized the causal influence of the damaged areas on the respective psychological constructs."
