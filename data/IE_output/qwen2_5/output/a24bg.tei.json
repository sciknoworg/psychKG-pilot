    "justification": "The paper describes competitive decision-making environments using various games like Matching Pennies, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Elemental, and Dice Dual. These games assess participants' strategies, particularly their tendency to shift behaviors following wins or losses, which is a key aspect of competitive decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Win-stay and lose-shift biases",
    "measured_by": "Item-based shift rate analysis",
    "justification": "The item-based shift rate is used to measure the tendency of participants to stick with their current strategy after a win (win-stay) or shift after a loss (lose-shift). This metric is analyzed across different competitive decision-making games to determine how participants adjust their strategy based on the outcome of previous trials."

    "topic_or_construct": "Rule-relevant shift behavior",
    "measured_by": "Between-category shift rate",
    "justification": "Between-category shift rate is used to quantify rule-relevant shift behavior in the Dice Dual game. This metric specifically measures changes in response categories (e.g., from odd to even numbers) that have a direct impact on the game's outcome, reflecting intentional strategic adjustments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Rule-irrelevant explorative behavior",
    "measured_by": "Within-category shift rate",
    "justification": "The within-category shift rate is employed to measure rule-irrelevant explorative behavior. This metric observes shifts within the same category (e.g., from one odd number to another) that do not impact the outcome's probability, indicating random exploration rather than strategic decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Number of response options influence",
    "measured_by": "Parametric manipulation of 2-, 4-, 6-response options in Dice Dual",
    "justification": "The number of response options available to the participants is manipulated to understand its influence on decision-making. This is achieved by altering the response options in the Dice Dual game, allowing researchers to observe how increased options impact shift behaviors and strategic choices."
