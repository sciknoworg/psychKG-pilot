    "justification": "The text states that participants completed the revised version of the 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' (RME) test, which is commonly used as a measure of social perceptiveness, as part of the experimental design. (See A-4: An illustration of the 'Reading the Mind in the Eye' test used in phase one of the experiment.)"

    "measured_by": "Performance on hard room assignment tasks",
    "justification": "Skill was defined as the sum of the participant's score on the two hard room assignment tasks. This measure is based on the participant's performance, specifically the normalized score on these tasks compared to the maximum possible score. The justification is provided in the text where it is noted that participants\u2019 scores on core hard task instances highly correlate with their scores on single task instances, validating its use as a measure of skill level."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive style diversity",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported task-solving preferences",
    "justification": "Cognitive style is operationalized through participants self-reporting their preferences, like solving style (pragmatic vs. tenacious), focus (optimizer vs. satisficer), and tolerance for constraint violations. This self-report mechanism allows researchers to categorize individuals into these dichotomies, as explained in the Design of Phase One Experiment section."
