    "measured_by": "Custom Economic Game Task",
    "justification": "The study developed a novel experimental paradigm where participants' decisions to leave social interactions were influenced by the fairness of partners and the social environment. This approach allowed researchers to measure opportunity cost processing through participants' leaving times in different social settings."

    "topic_or_construct": "Depression",
    "measured_by": "Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21)",
    "justification": "Participants completed the DASS-21 questionnaire, which measures depression symptoms. The researchers used these scores to correlate with leaving times, revealing how depression affects responses to fairness and social environment quality."

    "topic_or_construct": "Loneliness",
    "measured_by": "De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DGLS)",
    "justification": "The DGLS was used to assess participants' levels of loneliness. The study findings indicated that higher loneliness scores were associated with altered decisions to leave social interactions under varying conditions of fairness and environment quality."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Fairness-Adapted Drift Diffusion Model (DDM)",
    "justification": "The evidence accumulation model was used to account for the cognitive processes underlying decisions to leave social interactions. The Fairness-DDM was the best fit compared to other models, showing that social decision-making in this context depends on fairness-based evidence accumulation."
