    "justification": "The paper utilizes the Linear Threshold Model (LTM) to capture human behavior in sequential decision-making tasks. The authors demonstrate that this model accurately accounts for participants' stop search behavior across different environments and real-world tasks."

    "measured_by": "Independent Threshold Model (ITM)",
    "justification": "The Independent Threshold Model (ITM) serves as a baseline to assess subjects' optimal stopping behavior, providing maximal flexibility and an upper limit on how well any threshold model can describe decision-making."

    "measured_by": "Biased Optimal Model (BOM)",
    "justification": "The Biased Optimal Model (BOM) is employed to explore sequential search behavior by assuming humans use thresholds that deviate systematically from optimal thresholds, but results indicate it performs worse than the Linear Threshold Model."

    "topic_or_construct": "optimal stopping task",
    "measured_by": "Cut-off Model (CoM)",
    "justification": "The Cut-off Model (CoM) is inspired by the optimal decision rule for the secretary problem. However, the paper states its performance was extremely poor, indicating it is not suitable for characterizing human behavior in the tasks under study."
