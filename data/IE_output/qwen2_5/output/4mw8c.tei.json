    "justification": "The paper employs Stanford CoreNLP to calculate review polarity indexes (RPIs) from Yelp reviews, which are used to study cognitive sequential dependencies. This is justified because RPI measures the implicit rating and emotional stance captured in textual data, offering insights into sequential decision-making processes outside the laboratory."
