    "measured_by": "Finger speed during decision-making",
    "justification": "The study shows that finger speed during decision making provides an implicit online measure of instantaneous confidence. Fluctuations in finger speed correlate with post-decision confidence ratings, suggesting it tracks online confidence in real-time."

    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence",
    "measured_by": "Subjective confidence ratings",
    "justification": "Participants rated their subjective confidence after each decision on a continuous vertical scale. This explicit measure of confidence was correlated with other measures like accuracy and movement speed, validating its use as an indicator of confidence."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Number of correct responses",
    "justification": "The accuracy of decisions was measured by the number of correct responses in each condition, providing a straightforward measure of how well participants performed in the task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision process",
    "measured_by": "Finger movement trajectories",
    "justification": "The trajectory of the participants' finger movement was tracked continuously, revealing how evidence accumulation and confidence evolve over time in the decision-making process."
