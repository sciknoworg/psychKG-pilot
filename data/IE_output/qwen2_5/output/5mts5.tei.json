    "measured_by": "Stroop Task",
    "justification": "The article frequently references the Stroop task as a paradigm used to investigate cognitive control, specifically mentioning it in the context of testing goal-conflicting thoughts and monitoring of cognitive control (e.g., cognitive control is often investigated using conflict paradigms such as the Stroop task)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Conflict Monitoring",
    "measured_by": "Error-Related Negativity (ERN)",
    "justification": "The text explains that the error-related negativity (ERN) is an event-related potential measured at frontocentral electrode sites and operationalized as a sharp negative deflection within 100 ms after errors. It is linked to performance monitoring and conflict monitoring processes arising in the anterior mid-cingulate cortex."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Conflict-related Negative Affect",
    "measured_by": "Peripheral Nervous System Arousal",
    "justification": "The peripheral nervous system arousal, including heart rate, skin conductance, and pupil dilation, is discussed as a method to assess the aversive nature of conflict. Changes in these physiological indicators suggest that conflict and errors are associated with heightened arousal."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Negative Affect from Conflict",
    "measured_by": "Affective Priming Paradigm",
    "justification": "The affective priming effect is used to show that negative words are categorized more quickly if preceded by incompatible relative to compatible Stroop stimuli, suggesting that conflict triggers negative affect."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective Anxiety in Decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Self-report measures of anxiety",
    "justification": "Boosted activation in the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) correlated with the subjective anxiety felt toward win-win decision conflicts, indicating that these decision-related conflicts trigger a state of aversive arousal."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Conflict",
    "measured_by": "Conflict Negativity (CN)",
    "justification": "The Conflict Negativity (CN) is an ERP component indicative of conflict monitoring during value-guided decision-making. It peaks at frontocentral sites, showing maximal amplitudes for high-conflict compared to low-conflict choice decisions."
