    "justification": "The article describes that empathic concern was evaluated using the 28-item version of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), focusing on the empathic concern subscale (7 items). Higher scores on this subscale were linked to greater interest in outcomes affecting others."

    "topic_or_construct": "Charitable giving",
    "measured_by": "Average charitable donations across seven incentivised donation decisions",
    "justification": "Charitable giving was measured by having participants indicate the percentage of winnings they wanted to donate to charity, with a random decision chosen for implementation. Participants demonstrating higher interest in information about others relative to themselves showed greater charitable giving."

    "topic_or_construct": "Information-seeking preferences",
    "measured_by": "Opt-in vs. Forced-choice experiments",
    "justification": "The paper assessed participants' preferences for seeking positive versus negative information about outcomes for themselves or others via two experiment conditions: opt-in (Experiment 1) and forced-choice (Experiment 2). This setup allowed researchers to measure the tendency to seek or avoid information actively or passively without the ability to influence outcomes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Positive vs. Negative Information Seeking",
    "measured_by": "Generalised Linear Mixed-Effects Models (GLMM)",
    "justification": "GLMMs were used to model choices related to seeking or avoiding information with fixed and random effects considering variables like valence, probability of outcomes, and recipient type. This showed a significant preference for positive information across different scenarios."
