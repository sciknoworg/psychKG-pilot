    "justification": "The CSSL model was used to predict participants' choices in a dual-environment task where they solved linear and nonlinear decision problems. This model explicitly learns to associate different environments with appropriate decision strategies, demonstrating the strategy selection process (details in 'Contextual strategy selection learning' section)."

    "justification": "The WADD model represents a cue-based strategy often used in linear environments. In this experiment, it was used and compared with other models to predict participants' choices in the linear decision-making task (details in 'Identifying the strategies adopted by the participants' section)."
