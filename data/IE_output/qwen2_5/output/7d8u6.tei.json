    "measured_by": "Label \u2192 Picture Categorisation Task",
    "justification": "The study employed a label \u2192 picture categorisation task where participants judged whether pictured items belonged to categories named in preceding labels. This task was used to measure performance and assess the basic-level advantage through response times and accuracy."

    "topic_or_construct": "Sensorimotor Distance",
    "measured_by": "Multidimensional Ratings of Sensorimotor Strength",
    "justification": "Sensorimotor distance was measured using Lynott et al.'s (2020) sensorimotor norms, which provided multidimensional ratings of perceptual and action-related experiences for concepts, allowing for an evaluation of representational similarity between category and member concepts."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Linguistic Distance",
    "measured_by": "Log Co-occurrence Frequencies from a Subtitle Corpus",
    "justification": "Linguistic distance was calculated based on log co-occurrence frequencies in a subtitle corpus consisting of 200 million words in British English, capturing the overlap in linguistic distributional patterns between category and member labels."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Categorical Gradedness",
    "measured_by": "Gradedness-adjusted Sensorimotor and Linguistic Distance Measures",
    "justification": "Categorical gradedness was operationalized through adjusting sensorimotor and linguistic distance measures based on linguistic distributional information, reflecting the idea that less-representative category members are implicitly categorised at the subordinate level."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Typicality",
    "measured_by": "Traditional Typicality Ratings",
    "justification": "Participant ratings gauged the typicality of category members on a scale from 'very poor' to 'very good' examples of their category level, though the study found these ratings were ineffective in predicting categorisation performance."
