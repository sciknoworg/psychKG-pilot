    "measured_by": "Decision times",
    "justification": "The article mentions 'differences in future decision time are determined by the type of outcome caused by the current action,' specifically noting the phenomena of post-loss slowing and post-loss speeding, which are measures of decision times as a way to gauge responsiveness to feedback."

    "topic_or_construct": "Interpretation of neutral outcomes",
    "measured_by": "Feedback-related negativity (FRN)",
    "justification": "The text states that FRN amplitudes following draws are often statistically indistinguishable from unambiguously negative outcomes like losses, highlighting FRN's role in measuring the brain's electrophysiological response to feedback valence."

    "topic_or_construct": "Behavioral flexibility following outcomes",
    "measured_by": "Shift behavior proportions",
    "justification": "The study examines the proportion of shift behavior following outcomes (win, lose, draw) indicating the behavioral flexibility shown by participants. For example, 'shift proportions were significantly modulated by a main effect of draw value,' showing how shift behavior was used to measure participants' flexibility."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Optimistic bias or depressive realism",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral responses to draws as wins or losses",
    "justification": "The article discusses that 'the responses can speak to the degree of optimistic bias or depressive realism held as a trait,' suggesting that analyzing how individuals treat neutral outcomes (like draws) in relation to clear wins or losses can reveal their inherent biases."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Subjective interpretation of draws",
    "measured_by": "Post-draw speeding",
    "justification": "The paper indicates that post-draw speeding responses 'establish a connection between neutral (draw) outcomes and explicitly negative (lose) outcomes,' implying that the reaction time following neutral outcomes is a valid measure of their subjective interpretation."
