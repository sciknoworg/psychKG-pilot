    "justification": "The study uses type-2 ROC analysis to evaluate the diagnostic power of RT in discriminating between correct and incorrect responses, indicating that RT can serve as a proxy for response correctness without requiring additional cognitive or temporal demands."

    "topic_or_construct": "Response Correctness",
    "measured_by": "Confidence Ratings",
    "justification": "Type-2 ROC analysis is traditionally grounded in confidence ratings, which serve as a subjective measure of an observer's own behavior in discriminating the correctness of their response."

    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive Accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Meta-d\u2032 Index based on RT",
    "justification": "The study calculates the meta-d\u2032 index using RT to quantify the observer's ability to discriminate response correctness, suggesting that RT can be an implicit measure of metacognitive accuracy, particularly useful when explicit introspective measures are not available."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive Accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Meta-d\u2032 Index based on Confidence",
    "justification": "Meta-d\u2032 values are derived from confidence ratings to assess the observer\u2019s metacognitive performance. The study notes a high correlation between meta-d\u2032 based on confidence and RT, indicating shared information about response correctness."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive Sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Interaction between RT and Confidence",
    "justification": "By combining RT with confidence and including their interaction in type-2 ROC analysis, the study reveals that RT provides unique diagnostic power, especially at shorter response times, offering new insights into the dynamics of perceptual decision-making."
