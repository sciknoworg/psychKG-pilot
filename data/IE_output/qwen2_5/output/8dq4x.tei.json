    "measured_by": "faith in intuition scale",
    "justification": "The scale assesses how much individuals trust their initial feelings about people, using items like 'I trust my initial feelings about people' (Epstein et al., 1996), and it has been linked to physiognomic beliefs even when items directly referencing appearance-based impressions are omitted."

    "topic_or_construct": "Belief in biological determinism of personality traits",
    "measured_by": "lists of personality traits rated for biological basis",
    "justification": "Participants rate traits (e.g., warmth, trustworthiness, competence) on a scale from not at all based on biological nature to extremely based on biological nature, capturing the belief that personality traits are determined by biological factors (Haslam et al., 2004)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Entity beliefs about personality",
    "measured_by": "items related to fixed mindset about personality",
    "justification": "The belief that personality traits are fixed and essential is measured with items like 'The kind of person someone is, is something basic about them, and it can't be changed very much' (Levy et al., 1998). Despite past studies linking this to physiognomic beliefs, the present studies did not find a significant association."

    "measured_by": "belief in a just world scale",
    "justification": "This scale measures the belief that people generally get what they deserve, using items such as 'I feel that people get what they deserve' (Lipkus, 1991). It was found to be positively related to physiognomic beliefs."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive reflection",
    "measured_by": "cognitive reflection test (CRT)",
    "justification": "The CRT measures the tendency to override an intuitive but incorrect answer with a more reflective and correct one, using items like 'If you are in a race and you pass the person in second place, what place are you in?' It was not found to be significantly related to physiognomic beliefs (Thomson & Oppenheimer, 2016)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Need to evaluate",
    "measured_by": "need to evaluate scale",
    "justification": "This scale captures the extent to which people form opinions about everything, with items like 'I form opinions about everything' (Jarvis & Petty, 1996). It was not found to have a significant association with physiognomic beliefs."
