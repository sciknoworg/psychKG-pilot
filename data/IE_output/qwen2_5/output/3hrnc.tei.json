    "justification": "The paper highlights the use of the DOSPERT scale to measure tendencies toward engaging in different types of risky behaviors from five domains: financial, health, recreation, social, and ethical. The DOSPERT scale is an established instrument used to study risky decision making across various domains, showcasing its utility in capturing individual differences in risk-taking behavior."

    "measured_by": "Extended DOSPERT Inventory",
    "justification": "The study employed an expanded version of the DOSPERT inventory consisting of 150 behaviors. Participants rated their likelihood of engaging in these behaviors, using these ratings as a measure of their propensity toward each type of risky behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "Individual Differences in Risk-Taking",
    "measured_by": "Psychometric Measures (Gender, Age, Personality)",
    "justification": "The paper discusses prior research where DOSPERT ratings were used alongside psychometric measures such as gender, age, and personality variables. This was done to understand how these variables influence variance in risk-taking behaviors, showing how risk taking varies based on individual characteristics."

    "topic_or_construct": "Individual-Level Decision Weights",
    "measured_by": "LLM-Based Decision Models and Ridge Regression",
    "justification": "The study employed large language models and ridge regression to derive attribute weights that describe an individual's preferences across various risky behaviors. These weights help explain the correlations in ratings across individuals, offering insights into how personal preferences influence decision-making."
