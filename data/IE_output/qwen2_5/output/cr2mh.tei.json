    "measured_by": "Change your mind task",
    "justification": "The study introduces a novel 'change your mind' task where participants made two-alternative forced choices and had the opportunity to change their response after receiving spurious feedback. This task was designed to capture volitional cognitive flexibility in a context where rule learning or set-shifting was not required."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive flexibility",
    "measured_by": "Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)",
    "justification": "The paper explains that the WCST is used to measure the ability to transition between cognitive-attentional sets, highlighting its use in assessing cognitive flexibility."
