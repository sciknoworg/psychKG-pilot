    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive control functions",
    "measured_by": "anti-saccade, Flanker, and Stroop tasks",
    "justification": "The article mentions that the ability to focus attention on task-relevant aspects and suppress distracting information has been studied using the anti-saccade, Flanker, and Stroop tasks. These tasks are used to measure cognitive control functions such as working memory and inhibition."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "strategy updating",
    "measured_by": "Spontaneous Strategy Switch Task",
    "justification": "The experiment used the Spontaneous Strategy Switch Task, which assesses the ability of participants to discover and implement a novel strategy. This task required participants to respond based on spatial location or stimulus color, allowing a measure of their ability to shift from one strategy to another."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "working memory",
    "measured_by": "digit-sorting task",
    "justification": "The research included a working memory test where participants completed a digit-sorting task. This measure was used to evaluate the maximum number of items that participants could retain and sort correctly, serving as an index of their working memory capacity."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "response inhibition",
    "measured_by": "LateGo and NoGo trials",
    "justification": "Performance on LateGo and NoGo trials was used to measure response inhibition by assessing false alarm rates, specifically the tendency of participants to make premature key presses in these task conditions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive flexibility",
    "measured_by": "task switching",
    "justification": "The text implies that cognitive flexibility, related to task switching, involves the ability to discover new strategies or update ongoing decision-making processes, which was probed indirectly through the main experimental paradigm."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "executive function",
    "measured_by": "Stroop task",
    "justification": "The Stroop task was employed to assess executive function, specifically the ability to inhibit prepotent responses. Researchers looked at the difference in reaction time between congruent, incongruent, and neutral trials."
