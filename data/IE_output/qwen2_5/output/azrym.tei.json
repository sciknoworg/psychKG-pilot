    "measured_by": "Semi-structured interviews",
    "justification": "The article describes conducting semi-structured interviews with patients using the Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) method to measure and visualize connections among constructs like rejecting conventional treatment. The interviews explored narratives around the patient\u2019s decision-making process."

    "topic_or_construct": "Lay theory of illness causation (etiology)",
    "measured_by": "Semi-structured interviews and code categorization",
    "justification": "The paper discusses encoding patient interviews to explore different lay theories of illness causation, including psychosocial, genetic, nutritional, and vitalistic factors. The categorization of these codes helped reveal differences between biomedicine and CAM users in understanding health."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Push factors (negative experiences)",
    "measured_by": "Semi-structured interviews and code categorization",
    "justification": "The authors used semi-structured interviews to identify push factors, such as dissatisfaction with conventional treatments and side effects, which were then coded for analysis. This analysis revealed differences in the ways these factors played into patient decision-making between biomedicine and CAM groups."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Pull factors (dispositions)",
    "measured_by": "Semi-structured interviews and code categorization",
    "justification": "Patient interviews were used to explore pull factors like the preference for natural treatments and intuitive decision-making. These factors were coded and analyzed to show how they influenced the choice between conventional and alternative medicine."

    "measured_by": "Semi-structured interview questions",
    "justification": "The article mentions areas of the semi-structured interview included \u2018Epistemology,\u2019 which covered the sources of health-related information and the appraisal of that information. This element was analyzed through coding and ENA."

    "topic_or_construct": "Ontology in health",
    "measured_by": "Semi-structured interview questions",
    "justification": "Interview questions about explanatory models of illness and health, etiology, and patient journey choices were used to explore patient beliefs and narratives about health and illness. These were coded for prominence and interaction."
