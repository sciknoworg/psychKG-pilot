    "topic_or_construct": "human decision-making accuracy",
    "measured_by": "response accuracy",
    "justification": "The text states that 'Decision-making is measured objectively using response accuracy and confidence calibration with accuracy', which directly links decision-making accuracy to the use of response accuracy as the measurement."

    "topic_or_construct": "confidence calibration",
    "measured_by": "role of confidence and accuracy relationship",
    "justification": "The text refers to 'confidence calibration (positive association between confidence and accuracy)', indicating that confidence calibration is measured by how well an individual's confidence ratings relate to their actual accuracy."

    "topic_or_construct": "AI UQ representation impact on decision-making",
    "measured_by": "different visualization types (needle vs. dotplot)",
    "justification": "The paper compares 'performance with distributions of uncertainty probabilities to point-estimated probabilities, as well as two different visualizations of uncertainty...needle vs. dotplot,' which shows that AI UQ impact was measured through different visualization types."

    "justification": "Participants were assessed on 'risk literacy using the Berlin numeracy test,' as stated in the methodology section."
