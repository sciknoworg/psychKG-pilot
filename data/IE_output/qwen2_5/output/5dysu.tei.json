    "justification": "The paper argues that the 5S model from EoE provides a specific method for simulating others' minds by detailing decision-making mechanisms based on desires, beliefs, and emotions, thus enhancing the application and explanatory power of Simulation Theory in understanding Theory of Mind."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Theory of Mind (ToM)",
    "measured_by": "Simulation Theory (ST)",
    "justification": "The research discusses the use of Simulation Theory to understand the mental states of others by imagining oneself in the same situation and simulating the other person's behavior in response, which is a central aspect of studying Theory of Mind constructs."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Emotions in Theory of Mind",
    "measured_by": "Economics of Emotions (EoE) Model",
    "justification": "The EoE model categorizes desires based on their role in decision-making and defines the associated emotions as either positive or negative depending on their contribution to satisfaction, thereby allowing the analysis of emotional components within ToM processes."

    "topic_or_construct": "False Belief Reasoning",
    "measured_by": "Ice Cream Task Example",
    "justification": "The paper illustrates false belief reasoning using an example involving Mary and an ice cream vendor as part of the 5S model, showcasing how this scenario can be used to understand and predict mental states based on desires and beliefs."
