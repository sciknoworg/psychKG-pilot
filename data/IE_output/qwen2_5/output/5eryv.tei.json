    "measured_by": "Alternative Uses Task (AUT)",
    "justification": "The article states that 'Divergent thinking tasks are often used to assess creative ability, the ability to produce original and useful ideas' and specifically mentions that 'Perhaps the most common divergent thinking measure is the alternative uses task (AUT; Guilford, 1967; Runco & Acar, 2012)'. This task requires participants to generate as many unusual uses as possible for a given object."

    "measured_by": "Creative-or-Not task (CON-task)",
    "justification": "The CON-task is described as a timed, two-choice decision-making task used to examine participants' decisions on whether presented ideas for everyday objects are creative or not. It is used to study the cognitive underpinnings of the evaluation phase in divergent thinking."

    "topic_or_construct": "Individual differences in creativity conceptions",
    "measured_by": "Self-reported importance ratings of originality and utility",
    "justification": "Participants indicated the importance of originality, innovativeness, utility, and appropriateness for evaluating creativity on a scale from 1 (not important at all) to 5 (very important). These ratings were compared to participants' implicit values derived from the CON-task data."

    "justification": "The DDM parameters, particularly the drift rate (\u03b4), were regressed on the originality and utility ratings of the stimuli to assess individual differences and correlations in how people weigh originality and utility when judging creativity."
