    "topic_or_construct": "Search behavior",
    "measured_by": "Active search task with mouse clicks",
    "justification": "The study investigates search behavior through an active search task where subjects use mouse clicks to search for targets in computer-illustrated scenes, avoiding confounding factors like eye movements or real-world searches."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Scene Semantics",
    "measured_by": "Human ratings and Bayesian ideal observer model",
    "justification": "Scene semantics are measured through human ratings of likely target locations within computer-illustrated scenes in Experiment 1, which are then used to construct Bayesian models for optimal search behavior in Experiment 2."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Recent Experience",
    "measured_by": "Experimental blocks with congruent, incongruent, and random target probabilities",
    "justification": "Recent experience is manipulated via experimental blocks where target locations are either congruent with, incongruent with, or randomly distributed relative to scene semantics, allowing for the study of learned probabilistic target distributions over time."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Prior Knowledge",
    "measured_by": "Likert ratings of expected target locations",
    "justification": "Prior knowledge is quantified using Likert ratings from Experiment 1, where subjects rated the likelihood of various targets appearing in specific locations, forming the basis for the Bayesian ideal observer's prior beliefs."
