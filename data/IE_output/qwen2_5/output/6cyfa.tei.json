    "justification": "The article describes an outdoor activity where students throw paper airplanes at targets to understand risky decision-making, classifying participants as risk-averse, risk-neutral, or risk-loving based on their chosen distances."

    "measured_by": "distance chosen in the airplane task",
    "justification": "Students who chose a distance of less than the optimal distance (4.12 meters) were considered risk-averse because they sacrificed higher possible payoffs to increase their probability of success."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "risk loving",
    "measured_by": "distance chosen in the airplane task",
    "justification": "Students who chose a greater distance than the optimal value were considered risk-loving. They preferred higher possible payoffs, even though they were riskier, as observed in their task choices."

    "topic_or_construct": "risk behavior",
    "measured_by": "bomb risk elicitation task",
    "justification": "The article mentions the bomb risk elicitation task as another method of assessing risk behavior, although the focus is on the paper airplane task, it references this task in the context of similar educational economic concepts."

    "justification": "The utility function U(G(d)) is used to classify participants into different risk attitudes based on the distances they chose in the paper airplane task, applying expected utility theory."
