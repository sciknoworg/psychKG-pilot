    "measured_by": "Physical effort (grip force) task",
    "justification": "The article describes a physical effort task where participants have to choose between a more difficult version requiring higher physical effort (grip force) or an easier version for lower rewards, to understand how people discount rewards by physical effort."

    "topic_or_construct": "Effort-based decisions",
    "measured_by": "Higher cognitive demand (harder maths puzzle) task",
    "justification": "The task involves participants choosing between tasks of varying cognitive demands, like solving harder maths puzzles, illustrating how cognitive effort impacts decision-making and reward discounting."

    "topic_or_construct": "Motivation",
    "measured_by": "Effort-based decision tasks combined with computational modeling",
    "justification": "The use of computational models in conjunction with effort-based decisions tasks highlights the underlying mechanisms of motivational impairments in both clinical and non-clinical populations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive effort",
    "measured_by": "Forcing people to switch attention between peripherals",
    "justification": "Participants are tasked with switching attention between various peripheral tasks, revealing how rewards are hyperbolically discounted as effort increases, showcasing the computational mechanism behind cognitive effort costs."

    "topic_or_construct": "Prosocial effort",
    "measured_by": "Effort-based decision tasks adapted for prosocial conditions",
    "justification": "Specific tasks are adapted to include a prosocial aspect where participants choose to exert effort for the benefit of others, demonstrating how prosocial decisions are made and the higher discounting seen in these scenarios."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fatigue impact on effort",
    "measured_by": "Computational models incorporating fatigue states",
    "justification": "The models used take into account fatigue levels, both recoverable and unrecoverable, to predict the impact on willingness to exert subsequent efforts, highlighting how fatigue dynamically influences decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Opportunity costs of exerting effort",
    "measured_by": "Patch foraging tasks",
    "justification": "Patch foraging tasks are used to demonstrate how participants make decisions about staying in a location or seeking alternative options, representing the real-world decisions made considering rewards relative to time spent."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Motivational impairments",
    "measured_by": "Effort-based decision-making paradigms",
    "justification": "These paradigms help to discern between different underlying factors of impairment such as loss of reward incentivization vs. sensitivity to effort costs and provide insights into the underlying pathophysiology rather than relying solely on self-reported scales."
