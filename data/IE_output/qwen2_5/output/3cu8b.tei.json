    "measured_by": "Driving Simulator Experiment with Decision Outcomes and Response Times",
    "justification": "The study employs a driving simulator experiment where participants decide whether to turn left before or after an approaching automated vehicle. This methodology allows researchers to measure decision outcomes (Go or Stay) and response times."

    "topic_or_construct": "Human perception of AV behavior",
    "measured_by": "Negative rating button presses",
    "justification": "Participants' subjective perception of the interaction was assessed by asking them to press a negative rating button on the steering wheel if the AV's behavior was confusing, weird, or unintuitive. This provides insights into how participants perceived the AV's maneuvers."

    "topic_or_construct": "Evidence accumulation process in human decision-making",
    "measured_by": "Drift-diffusion model",
    "justification": "The researchers used the drift-diffusion model to capture the cognitive processes behind participants' decisions and response times. This model simulates how humans accumulate evidence over time to make decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Impact of AV maneuvers on human behavior",
    "measured_by": "Mixed-effects regression models",
    "justification": "The study statistically analyzes the relationship between different AV maneuvers (e.g., deceleration nudge, acceleration nudge) and human decision outcomes and response times using mixed-effects regression models, providing quantitative insights into the influence of AV behavior."
