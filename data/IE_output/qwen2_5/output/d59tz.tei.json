    "measured_by": "Stated Probability (SP) assessment",
    "justification": "Participants explicitly rated each E-option on a probability scale from 0% to 100%, which allowed for a direct numerical measure of their inferred probability of winning a point for each symbol, rather than relying solely on observed behavior in choice tasks."

    "justification": "The values of experiential cues (E-options) were inferred through participants' choices and feedback in a probabilistic learning task where they repeatedly chose between pairs of abstract symbols associated with probabilistic outcomes, allowing for the iterative updating of subjective values of each option."

    "measured_by": "Pie-chart lotteries",
    "justification": "The symbolic values were visually represented using pie-charts, where different sections of the chart indicated the probability of gaining or losing a point, allowing for a precise, explicit representation of probabilistic outcomes."

    "measured_by": "Hybrid choices behavior in Experiential-Symbolic (ES) phase",
    "justification": "The ES phase choices revealed that participants\u2019 selection behavior was largely influenced by the symbolic value provided by pie-charts despite having learned experiential values during the LE phase, suggesting a systematic neglect of previously learned experiential values during ES decisions."

    "measured_by": "Option-specific indifference points from ES and EE phases",
    "justification": "By fitting logistic functions to participants' choices, the authors estimated indifference points that index the subjective values of experiential options relative to symbolic options, allowing them to compare how experiential and symbolic values are integrated or neglected in hybrid decision tasks."
