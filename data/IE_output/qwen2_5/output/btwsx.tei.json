    "justification": "The research employs the 19-item Impulsivity and Sensation Seeking Scale (ImpSS), which measures impulsivity and sensation-seeking using true-or-false items tailored to these constructs. This measurement is utilized to assess participants' individual differences regarding these traits in the context of hurricane-related behavior and threat perception."

    "measured_by": "Single-item scale and Social and Economic Conservatism Scale (SECS)",
    "justification": "Political orientation is measured through both a single-item scale (-3 = mostly liberal to 3 = mostly conservative) and the Social and Economic Conservatism Scale (SECS). The latter assesses feelings about social and economic conservative issues separately. These instruments capture the spectrum of participants' political leanings and their impact on perilous situations like hurricanes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Big-Five Personality Traits",
    "measured_by": "Mini-IPIP and Big Five Inventory (BFI-44)",
    "justification": "Studies 1 and 2 use the 20-item International Personality Item Pool (Mini-IPIP) to measure the Big-Five personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion). Study 3 uses the 44-item Big Five Inventory (BFI-44). Both scales use a response scale to assess the degree to which participants endorse each trait, providing a comprehensive evaluation of personality and its role in preparing for hurricanes."
