    "measured_by": "Eye-tracking device (gaze and pupil size)",
    "justification": " Subjects wore an eye-tracking device during the 2-arm bandit task to record their gaze and pupil size, providing insights into how they allocated attention towards factual and counterfactual outcomes, thus measuring counterfactual learning."

    "topic_or_construct": "Confirmation bias in reinforcement learning",
    "measured_by": "Computational RL model with distinct learning rates",
    "justification": "The computational model compounded learning rates for confirmatory and disconfirmatory prediction errors, effectively measuring the confirmation bias as subjects considered more confirmatory outcomes while updating expectations."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Attention allocation in reinforcement learning",
    "measured_by": "Gaze tracking with eye-tracking device",
    "justification": "Gaze tracking data analyzed fixation patterns, showing different gaze behavior towards factual and counterfactual outcomes, thus measuring subjects' attention allocation dynamics in reinforcement learning."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Pupil size response",
    "measured_by": "Eye-tracking device (pupil size)",
    "justification": "Pupil size data measured changes in arousal states and perceived task difficulty in response to factual outcomes, indicating its use as an arousal-related measure linked to the reinforcement learning task."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice behavior and preferred responses",
    "measured_by": "Choice preferences and response patterns",
    "justification": "The behavioral data showed key signatures of confirmation bias, including the tendency to persevere and select unique options based on choice reinforcement, indicating its measurement through task performance metrics."
