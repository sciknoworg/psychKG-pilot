    "topic_or_construct": "Empathy for victims",
    "measured_by": "Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)",
    "justification": "In Study 1, participants who scored high on dispositional empathic concern (EC) as assessed with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) judged accidental harms to be less morally permissible, demonstrating the use of IRI as a measure of empathy."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Empathy for victims",
    "measured_by": "Empathy Index",
    "justification": "In Study 2, a positive association between higher self-report scores of the Empathy Index and condemnation of accidents was found, confirming the Empathy Index as a measure of empathy related to moral judgment."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Empathy for victims",
    "measured_by": "Empathy-Compassion Task (ECT)",
    "justification": "In Study 3, a positive correlation was observed between empathy scores from the Empathy-Compassion Task and the severity of judgments for accidents, indicating the task's relevance for measuring empathy in assessing moral judgments."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Perceived victim suffering",
    "measured_by": "Trial-by-trial ratings",
    "justification": "In Study 4, trial-by-trial ratings of perceived victim suffering for each moral vignette predicted harsher moral condemnation only for accidental harms, showing how these ratings effectively measured empathy linked to moral judgments."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Moral condemnation of harm",
    "measured_by": "Blame judgments for accidents",
    "justification": "The study demonstrated that increased activation in the empathy network during the judgment phase was predictive of greater moral condemnation of harmdoers for accidental harms specifically, establishing blame judgments as a measure of moral condemnation influenced by empathy."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Empathy network activity",
    "measured_by": "Percent Signal Change (PSC) in fMRI",
    "justification": "The fMRI study utilized percent signal change in the empathy network (measured with fMRI) to show increased activation during the reading and judgment phases for negative outcome conditions, linking neural activity to empathy and moral judgments."
