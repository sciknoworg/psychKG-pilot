    "justification": "The paper investigates whether intermittent control activation in humans can be modeled as a decision-making process using the drift-diffusion model. The model robustly replicates the control activation patterns observed in human operators during a virtual inverted pendulum balancing task."

    "justification": "The study utilizes a drift-diffusion model to treat control activation as a decision-making process based on evidence accumulation. The model's ability to reproduce the action point distribution observed in human operators supports this approach."
