    "topic_or_construct": "Felt Ambivalence",
    "measured_by": "Felt Ambivalence Questionnaire",
    "justification": "The article explicitly states that the Felt Ambivalence Questionnaire (Priester & Petty, 1996) was used to measure the metacognitive awareness of ambivalence about self-generated topics. This scale includes three items assessing conflict, indecision, and mixed reactions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Recurrence",
    "measured_by": "Three-item scale",
    "justification": "The recurrence of ambivalence was measured using a three-item scale that included questions about how frequently and recently participants felt ambivalent about the topic. The scale was designed based on previous research on time perception of psychological states, ensuring its efficacy in assessing the temporal dynamics of ambivalence."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Motivation for Effortful Coping",
    "measured_by": "Custom Four-Item Scale",
    "justification": "A custom-made four-item scale was devised to measure the motivation for effortful problem-focused coping. Items include willingness to change an ambivalent attitude and resolve ambivalence, despite requiring significant effort. This scale was validated for internal consistency and adapted from prior research instruments."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Potential Ambivalence",
    "measured_by": "Two Split Semantic Differential Scales",
    "justification": "Potential ambivalence was assessed using two split semantic differential scales, in line with the methodology proposed by Kaplan (1972). This measurement captured intrinsic levels of ambivalence inherent to the attitude objects before they became salient in decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Importance of the Attitude Object",
    "measured_by": "Single Item Measure",
    "justification": "The importance of the self-generated attitude object was measured with a single-item scale. Respondents rated the extent to which the topic was important to them, ensuring a direct and clear assessment of\u6001\u5ea6 significance in the context of ambivalence."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Consideration of Future Consequences",
    "measured_by": "Concern with Future Consequences Subscale",
    "justification": "The revised two-factor version of the Consideration of Future Consequences scale by Joireman et al. (2012) was employed. Specifically, a four-item subscale assessed participants\u2019 consideration of future consequences when making decisions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Negative Affect",
    "measured_by": "Two-item Measure",
    "justification": "Negative affect related to perceived recurrence was measured with two items asking participants to rate the extent to which they felt negative about the frequency of thinking about the ambivalent topic. This brief measure effectively captured the negative emotional reactions linked to recurring ambivalence."
