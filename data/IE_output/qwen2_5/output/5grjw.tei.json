    "justification": "The effect of attention on the postdictive illusion of choice is measured using a spatial cueing paradigm. This paradigm directly manipulates attention by presenting valid (aligned with the red circle) and invalid (misaligned with the red circle) cues, which influences participants' choice behavior."

    "justification": "The paper evaluates whether the memory of choices was affected by visual changes, leveraging differences in response patterns under various delay conditions. This analysis is used to differentiate between perceptual and memory accounts of the postdictive effect."
