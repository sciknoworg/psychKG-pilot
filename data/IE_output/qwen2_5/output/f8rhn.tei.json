    "measured_by": "VTE-like behaviors (reorientations)",
    "justification": "The paper indicates that place-strategies during probe trials and strategy training were associated with VTE-like behaviors, specifically reorientations, as observed through measures like changes in orientation and pauses before making a choice. This is consistent with rodent studies showing VTE behaviors during the use of place-strategies."

    "topic_or_construct": "response-strategies",
    "measured_by": "stereotyped trajectories",
    "justification": "Response-strategies were characterized by the development of rapidly initiated, stereotyped trajectories that participants adopted with experience. These stereotyped trajectories were indicative of model-free learning and were observed during participants' navigation in response-training phases."

    "topic_or_construct": "model-based behavior",
    "measured_by": "VTE-like behaviors (reorientations)",
    "justification": "Model-based behavior, represented by place-strategies in this study, was linked to VTE-like behaviors such as increased reorientations, longer dwell times at decision points, and more variable, less efficient navigation routes. These observations align with the theory that model-based learning involves more deliberation and flexibility."

    "topic_or_construct": "model-free behavior",
    "measured_by": "stereotyped trajectories",
    "justification": "Model-free behavior, represented by response-strategies, was measured through the observation of stereotyped, stable, and efficient trajectories adopted by participants. These trajectories were associated with rapid decision-making and consistent navigational patterns."

    "measured_by": "VTE behaviors",
    "justification": "Deliberation during human virtual navigation was measured using VTE behaviors, which were identified through characteristics like increased rotations, pausing, and revisitations at decision points, especially in high-cost locations when using place-strategies."
