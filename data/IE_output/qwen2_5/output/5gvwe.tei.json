    "measured_by": "Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) task",
    "justification": "The DRM task is described as one of the most widely used methods to study false memory formation, where participants memorize lists of semantically related words and later recognize critical lures not presented during the encoding phase, indicating false recognition."

    "topic_or_construct": "decision-making processes in recognition memory",
    "measured_by": "mouse-tracking paradigms",
    "justification": "Mouse-tracking paradigms are used to isolate the dynamics of response conflict and indecision in decision-making processes during the DRM task. The study employs this method to analyze latent decisional stages subserving recognition memory with measures like maximum deviation from direct path and sample entropy."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "semantic similarity",
    "measured_by": "distributional semantic models (DSMs)",
    "justification": "Semantic similarity between words is indexed using the cosine of angles between vectors derived from a DSM, built using neural networks like CBOW. This similarity measure is used to predict participants' dynamics in the DRM task, especially in false and veridical recognitions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "episodic and semantic memory contributions to memory judgments",
    "measured_by": "combined analysis using distributional semantic models and mouse-tracking data",
    "justification": "By analyzing both participants' choices in the DRM task and their associated mouse trajectories, the study provides an insight into the interaction between semantic and episodic memory in responseselection, challenging the existing frameworks of false memory theories."
