    "justification": "The study employed a 7-item measure from the IRI, which is a well-established scale designed to assess empathetic concern ratings on a scale from 1 to 5. Items were modified to measure the concern for outgroup and in-group members separately, showing reliability scores (\u0251outgroup = .72, \u0251ingroup = .53)."

    "justification": "This scale was used to measure the extent to which individuals identify with left and right ideologies, focusing on social (norms and hierarchies) and economic issues in India. It has been adapted for the Indian context with acceptable internal consistency scores for the first two factors but not for economic ideology."

    "measured_by": "Moral dilemmas tasks (Transplant, Fumes, Burning Building)",
    "justification": "Participants responded to modified versions of these moral dilemmas on a scale indicating willingness to make utilitarian choices in sacrificial scenarios involving ingroup and outgroup members. This approach was used to measure moral decision-making in the context of resource allocation."

    "justification": "The BIDR-16 scale, which provides separate scores for Self-Deceptive Enhancement and Impression Management, was used to account for potential social desirability biases affecting the responses. It incorporates a 7-point rating scale and is multi-dimensional."
