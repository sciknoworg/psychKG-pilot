    "measured_by": "Relative Coding Models",
    "justification": "The study used relative coding models to analyze the participants' choice proportions in a three-choice scenario. These models included a relative coding parameter, \u03c9, which, when estimated as a negative value, indicated a violation of the IIA axiom. This violation was observed when the presence of a third alternative influenced the relative proportion of choices between the first two alternatives."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Confidence",
    "measured_by": "Confidence ratings on a four-point scale",
    "justification": "Participants reported their confidence in their decision using a four-point scale after completing the dot numerosity discrimination task. The dud-alternative confidence boost was observed as an increase in mean confidence ratings when an irrelevant alternative was included, highlighting the subjective metacognitive aspect of decision confidence."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Response Time (RT)",
    "measured_by": "Timing of participant responses",
    "justification": "Response times were measured by calculating the time taken by participants to respond after stimulus presentation. Data for RT was analyzed using mixed linear regressions, showing that RT was faster for target choices compared to distractor choices, indicating the temporal dimension of decision-making processes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Evidence Accumulation in Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Max vs. Next (MVN) Algorithm",
    "justification": "The MVN algorithm, which monitored the evidence accumulation rate over time for each alternative, was used to explain complex patterns of choice, response time, and confidence. The model effectively captured the participants' behavioral trends across a range of dud alternative values."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence Boost due to Dud Alternatives",
    "measured_by": "Early-stage Confidence Variable",
    "justification": "The early-stage confidence variable, derived from the initial 350 ms of MVN dynamics in the model, explains the irrational increase in decision confidence when a dud alternative is present. This variable, derived from experimental data, aligns with findings from TMS studies on the timing of confidence formation."
