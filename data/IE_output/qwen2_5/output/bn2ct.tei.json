    "topic_or_construct": "aversive apprehensions",
    "measured_by": "threat-of-shock paradigm",
    "justification": "The study uses the threat-of-shock paradigm where participants are verbally instructed that an electric shock might occur in certain conditions, allowing researchers to assess the impact of sustained apprehensions on cognitive processes (page 1, paragraph 3)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reward reversal learning",
    "measured_by": "probabilistic reward reversal task",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to choose between two images differentially reinforced with monetary wins or losses, requiring them to learn and adjust their choices as the stimulus-reward contingency reversed during the experiment (page 3, paragraph 1)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "emotional arousal",
    "measured_by": "skin conductance level and heart rate",
    "justification": "Skin conductance levels and heart rate were recorded as indicators of autonomic nervous system activation to assess emotional arousal in threatening versus safe contexts (page 6, paragraph 2)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "difficulties in emotion regulation",
    "measured_by": "Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale",
    "justification": "The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale was used to measure the participants' ability to regulate their emotions effectively, which was hypothesized to correlate with their performance in the task (page 5, paragraph 1)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "negative urgency",
    "measured_by": "UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale",
    "justification": "The UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale was used to assess negative urgency, a tendency to act rashly under negative emotions, which was hypothesized to correlate with participants' error rates in the task (page 5, paragraph 1)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "perceived threat",
    "measured_by": "self-assessment manikin ratings",
    "justification": "Participants were asked to rate the threat and safety contexts on the self-assessment manikin scale after the experiment, which served as a manipulation check to ensure that the experimental manipulation was effective (page 4, paragraph 3)."
