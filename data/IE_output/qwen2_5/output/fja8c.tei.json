    "measured_by": "Think Aloud technique",
    "justification": "The study used Think Aloud as a method to investigate the thought processes of experts and novices during fingerprint analysis, capturing sequential thoughts as participants verbalised their decision-making process. This method allowed for detailed insights into the mechanisms driving expert performance."

    "topic_or_construct": "attentional focus in fingerprint examination",
    "measured_by": "Think Aloud verbalisations",
    "justification": "Attentional focus on local versus global details was measured through the verbalisations captured by the Think Aloud technique. Experts focused more on local print characteristics, while novices concentrated more heavily on broader global features and surface-level characteristics."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "analytical processes in fingerprint analysis",
    "measured_by": "Think Aloud verbalisations",
    "justification": "The Think Aloud technique captured how both experts and novices approached systematic evaluations of evidence, including the use of declarative and procedural knowledge and the ability to apply established rules and protocols. Experts demonstrated broader analytical processes through their verbal reports."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "evidence evaluation in fingerprint analysis",
    "measured_by": "Think Aloud verbalisations",
    "justification": "Verbalisations from the Think Aloud procedure revealed differences in how experts and novices weighed evidence, assessed its quality and reliability, and associated confidence or risk levels. Experts exhibited far greater critical appraisal compared to novices."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision-making processes",
    "measured_by": "Think Aloud verbalisations",
    "justification": "Think Aloud verbalisations provided insights into how experts and novices formed initial hypotheses, validated data, considered alternative explanations, and critically appraised evidence before reaching conclusions in fingerprint analysis tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "problem representation in fingerprint analysis",
    "measured_by": "Think Aloud verbalisations",
    "justification": "Through Think Aloud verbalisations, the study examined how experts and novices conceptualised and articulated print quality challenges, uncertainty, and causal factors contributing to analysis obstacles, highlighting nuanced differences in their problem representation."
