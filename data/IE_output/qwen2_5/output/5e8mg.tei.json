    "measured_by": "Drag-and-drop task",
    "justification": "The study by Dupont et al. (2022) used a task where participants dragged numbered circles in sequence to the bottom of a screen, with specific colors indicating the need to set external reminders for certain items. This task measures how participants choose between holding information in short-term memory and offloading it to the external environment."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value-based decision making",
    "measured_by": "Monte Carlo reinforcement learning simulation",
    "justification": "The paper simulates the decision-making processes behind cognitive offloading using a Monte Carlo reinforcement learning model. This model balances rewards associated with remembering items against the costs of internal memory and offloading strategies, illustrating value-based decision making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Memory accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Memory tests in experimental conditions",
    "justification": "Accuracy for remembering high- and low-value items when offloading is allowed versus when it's not is measured in experimental conditions. These tests help assess the impact of cognitive offloading on memory performance."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Opportunity cost of internal memory",
    "measured_by": "Accuracy reduction with increasing memory load",
    "justification": "Accuracy measures when storing different numbers of items (e.g., 3 vs. 6) in internal memory demonstrate the opportunity cost associated with using limited memory capacity. This is used to simulate the benefits of offloading information externally."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Effort sensitivity in offloading",
    "measured_by": "Variation in offloading rate with physical effort",
    "justification": "The study by Chiu and Gilbert (2023) manipulated the physical effort required to set reminders, showing how changes in effort sensitivity influence the offloading rate of participants."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Individual differences in offloading",
    "measured_by": "Correlation with working memory capacity",
    "justification": "Studies have shown a negative correlation between internal memory ability and offloading rate, indicating that individuals with poorer memory ability are more likely to offload information, which can be measured through memory capacity assessments."
