    "justification": "The study measures decision planning certainty using decision time, where partners making quick decisions (2\u20134 seconds) are considered certain and those taking longer (14\u201316 seconds) are considered uncertain in decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Implementation Certainty",
    "measured_by": "Movement Kinematics (Smoothness and Directness)",
    "justification": "Decision implementation certainty was measured by analyzing the smoothness and directness of hand movements during decision execution. Partners with smooth and direct movements were seen as certain, while those with jittery and indirect movements were seen as uncertain."

    "justification": "The trustworthiness of a partner was assessed using the Prisoner's Dilemma and Stag Hunt games, where participants were asked to choose between partners based on their observed decision-making and implementation cues."
