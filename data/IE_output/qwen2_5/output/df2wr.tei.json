    "measured_by": "Estimation methods combining global estimates and detailed component analysis",
    "justification": "In their study, Wansink and Sobal (2007) used two methods to quantify daily food decisions: a global estimate and a detailed breakdown of components ('when,' 'what,' 'how much,' 'where,' and 'with whom'). The difference between these estimates was used to infer the number of mindless decisions, highlighting the concept of mindless eating."

    "topic_or_construct": "Frequency of Daily Food Decisions",
    "measured_by": "Global estimate followed by detailed component analysis",
    "justification": "Participants initially provided a global estimate of their daily food and beverage decisions, which averaged 14.4 decisions. Subsequently, a detailed breakdown of meal, snack, and beverage components yielded a much higher average of 226.7 decisions, demonstrating the methodological approach used to quantify these decisions."

    "measured_by": "Survey and observational methods with varying levels of aggregation",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how different operationalizations and measurement methods (e.g., mealtime length effects from Dallacker et al. (2023), household food purchases from the USDA, and fridge door openings from Elias et al. (2007)) yield various contextual food decision estimates. These methods highlight the importance of the context in which decisions are made."

    "measured_by": "Mobile sensing",
    "justification": "The text mentions the potential of mobile sensing, which uses smartphones, wearables, and smart devices to gather detailed behavioral data on food intake, purchasing decisions, and mealtime practices, thus offering a way to contextualize food-related decisions."

    "justification": "Qualitative research approaches like vignettes and interviews were used by Gr\u00f8nh\u00f8j and others to explore food decision-making within diverse cultural contexts, providing insights into how cultural differences influence food-related decisions."
