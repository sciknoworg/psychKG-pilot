    "justification": "The paper employs the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which divides populations into 16 subpopulations based on four dichotomous dimensions, to model personality types in both human and bot simulations. This instrument was used to explore how different personality types, particularly Thinking (T) and Feeling (F), influence decision-making in the prisoner's dilemma and power to take game."
