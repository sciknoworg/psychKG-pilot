    "justification": "The study used a 5-item measure originally developed by Mallett (2012) and adapted by Moore and Yang (2020) to assess participants' eco-guilt, which measured their guilt associated with actions related to climate change. The measure had a high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.91)."

This scale aimed to capture participants' intentions to engage in pro-climate civic actions, reflecting the spillover effects beyond individual behavior."
