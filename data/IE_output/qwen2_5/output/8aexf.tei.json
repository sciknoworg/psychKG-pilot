    "topic_or_construct": "Depression",
    "measured_by": "Trust Game",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how participants with depression play the trust game, which involves decision-making under varying interpersonal contexts. This game is used to simulate and understand interpersonal behavior in depressed individuals, especially their adaptability and decision-making in response to social cues and context switches."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Social Anxiety Disorder",
    "measured_by": "Trust Game",
    "justification": "Social anxiety disorder is modeled using simulations based on the trust game. The paper describes how different subtypes of social anxiety (insecure-avoidant and trauma-and-defeat) exhibit distinct patterns of decision-making and belief updating in this game, reflecting increased risk aversion and avoidance behaviors."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Interpersonal Functioning",
    "measured_by": "Trust Game",
    "justification": "The theoretical framework and simulations focus on interpersonal functioning in mental disorders, particularly depression and social anxiety. The trust game is used as an experimental paradigm to study how individuals infer and make decisions about their interpersonal contexts."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward Sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Preference Parameter Adjustments in trust game models",
    "justification": "Simulations with biased preference parameters demonstrate perturbations in the vector, which affects the agent's reward valuation and response to win or loss outcomes. This directly reflects deviations in reward sensitivity seen in depression."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Observational Uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Observation Model Adjustments",
    "justification": "Observational uncertainty is simulated by manipulating the matrix, which affects the agent's ability to map observations accurately to hidden states. This is relevant for understanding perceptual disturbances or 'cognitive immunization' in depression or social anxiety."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Fatalistic Expectations",
    "measured_by": "Transition Matrix Adjustments",
    "justification": "Fatalistic beliefs about future environments are simulated using perturbed transition matrices ( ). Perturbations here, reflecting pessimistic expectations about context stability, manifest as deficits in real-world social cognition."
