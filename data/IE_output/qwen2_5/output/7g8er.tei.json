    "topic_or_construct": "Decision-making heuristics",
    "measured_by": "Online survey with open-ended questions",
    "justification": "The study employs an online survey with open-ended questions to elicit the rules of thumb mushroom foragers use. Respondents were asked what heuristics they use for safe foraging, identifying edible or poisonous mushrooms, and finding good foraging patches. This method directly measures the heuristics used by foragers."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cultural transmission of foraging knowledge",
    "measured_by": "Participant responses to learning sources",
    "justification": "The learning sources of foraging knowledge are gathered from participant responses, revealing that foragers learn primarily from parents, grandparents, and through books and internet resources. These responses directly measure the cultural transmission channels of foraging knowledge."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Selective attention in foraging",
    "measured_by": "Search task with visual cues",
    "justification": "Study 2 uses a search task with visual cues (pictures of different terrains) to measure foragers' selective attention in identifying mushroom species. Experienced foragers reported a higher number of species, indicating refined selective attention."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive search strategies",
    "measured_by": "Open questions on search heuristics",
    "justification": "The use of open questions in the survey allows for the extraction of cognitive search strategies such as area-restricted searches and the recognition of specific terrain features, which are key components of foraging practices."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk management in foraging",
    "measured_by": "Heuristics for identifying poisonous mushrooms",
    "justification": "The survey includes questions about heuristics used to avoid poisonous mushrooms, directly measuring strategies for managing risk in foraging. Heuristics like avoiding white mushrooms or those with spots are recorded."
