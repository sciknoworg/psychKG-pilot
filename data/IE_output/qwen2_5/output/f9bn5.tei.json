    "measured_by": "assessment tools",
    "justification": "The ACBS research agenda calls for the development of tools to assess functioning and well-being, indicating a need for assessment tools that can effectively measure these constructs beyond traditional symptom-based measures."

    "topic_or_construct": "change processes in treatment",
    "measured_by": "tools to assess change processes",
    "justification": "The need for tools to assess change processes in the moment is emphasized as it can help clinicians guide decision-making during treatment, ensuring that interventions are producing the desired change processes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "clinical decision-making",
    "measured_by": "progress monitoring tools",
    "justification": "Clinicians are poor at recognizing deterioration and lack effective action plans when treatments fail. Progress monitoring tools like the Outcome Questionnaire-45 (OQ-45) can help them register patient worsening more accurately."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "case conceptualization",
    "measured_by": "case formulation-driven approach",
    "justification": "The case conceptualization guides clinical work by identifying treatment targets, personalizing treatment, and supporting collaborative relationships, which requires a case formulation-driven approach for effective therapeutic strategies."
