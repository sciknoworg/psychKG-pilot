    "measured_by": "Sharp wave-ripples (SWRs)",
    "justification": "SWRs have been found in rodents and humans and are associated with memory consolidation during sleep, rest, and awake episodic memory retrieval. Studies demonstrate their role in replaying past experiences to strengthen memory traces (Axmacher et al., 2008; Staresina et al., 2015)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Spatial Navigation",
    "measured_by": "Place cell recordings",
    "justification": "Place cell recordings in the hippocampus reveal spatial firing selectivity during navigation tasks in rodents, underpinning the cognitive map for spatial navigation (O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971; O'Keefe and Conway, 1978)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal Credit Assignment",
    "measured_by": "Sequential Replay (Backward Replay)",
    "justification": "Sequential replay, particularly backward replay, supports temporal credit assignment in the brain by retracing\u5956\u52b1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8def\u5f84action sequences and assigning credit where sufficient when rewards may be delayed (Lin, 1992; Ambrose et al., 2016)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Planning",
    "measured_by": "Forward Replay during Awake SWRs",
    "justification": "Forward replay of neural sequences during awake SWRs is indicative of planning processes, often starting at the current location and projecting forward toward the goal location (Kudrimoti et al., 1999; Foster and Wilson, 2006)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Map",
    "measured_by": "Grid Cells in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex",
    "justification": "Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex demonstrate regular spatial firing patterns that form a coordinate system for representing space, contributing to the cognitive map and spatial navigation (Hafting et al., 2005; Fyhn et al., 2007)."
