    "topic_or_construct": "Impulsive Choice",
    "measured_by": "Delay Discounting Task (DDT)",
    "justification": "The delay discounting task measures impulsive choice by assessing decisions between smaller, immediate rewards and larger, delayed rewards, reflecting an individual's tendency to prefer short-term gratification over long-term benefits."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Impulsive Choice",
    "measured_by": "Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT)",
    "justification": "The Cambridge gambling task measures impulsive choice through participants' willingness to wait for larger bets, evaluating their impulsivity based on decision-making under time pressure."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Impulsive Action",
    "measured_by": "Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT)",
    "justification": "While the CGT primarily measures impulsive choice, performance on the task, particularly the betting stage, reveals impulsive action through the ability to inhibit premature responses, as higher impulsivity correlates with greater propensity to make hasty bets."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Temporal Discounting",
    "measured_by": "Hyperbolic Discounting Model (DDT parameter k)",
    "justification": "The temporal discounting parameter k in the hyperbolic discounting model quantifies how much the subjective value of a reward decreases with delay, indexing impulsive choice tendencies in the delay discounting task."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Time Cost Sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Luce Choice / Bet Utility Model (CGT parameter \u03b2)",
    "justification": "The \u03b2 parameter in the Luce choice / bet utility model of the Cambridge gambling task reflects the cost associated with waiting for bets, showing the extent to which individuals anticipate the temporal cost of delayed rewards."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Externalizing Psychopathology",
    "measured_by": "Delay Discounting Task (DDT)",
    "justification": "Temporal discounting on the delay discounting task has been associated with externalizing psychopathologies like aggression, suggesting its utility in reflecting dimensions of personality-related impulsivity."
