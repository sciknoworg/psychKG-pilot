    "justification": "The paper discusses the application of variational inference using factorized distributions to approximate complex posteriors. This approximation simplifies the posterior by assuming independence between variables, which facilitates computation but may face limitations in certain perceptual tasks."

    "justification": "The point estimate observer model is introduced as a computationally cheaper alternative to the Bayesian observer, optimizing over world states and using the most probable state for each category. This approach avoids the need for full Bayesian integration and is evaluated across several perceptual tasks."

    "justification": "The discussion mentions how response biases can be modeled as shifts or miscalibrations of the decision criterion. This approach applies to models that generate a continuous decision variable, such as the point estimate observer and Bayesian observer."

    "justification": "Sampling observers, including those based on importance sampling, are discussed as approximations to the Bayesian observer. These methods use samples from distributions to estimate integrals, potentially converging to the Bayesian solution with a sufficiently large number of samples."
