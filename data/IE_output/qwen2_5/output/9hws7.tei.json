    "topic_or_construct": "information-seeking behavior",
    "measured_by": "virtual slot machine task",
    "justification": "The study employed a virtual slot machine task where participants chose between revealing cards early (at a cost) or waiting for automatic revelation. This task measures participants' willingness to pay for non-instrumental information, highlighting their information-seeking behavior."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cost sensitivity in information seeking",
    "measured_by": "revealing cards at different cost levels",
    "justification": "People were less willing to reveal cards as the cost for revealing increased, reflecting cost sensitivity in their information-seeking behavior. This was measured by the frequency with which participants chose to reveal cards at cost levels of 0, 5, 10, and 15 points."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "curiosity-driven information seeking",
    "measured_by": "choice to reveal cards early",
    "justification": "Participants revealed cards early despite no instrumental value, driven by curiosity. This behavior was measured through the proportion of times participants chose to reveal the first, second, and third cards, even when revealing was costly."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "reward anticipation",
    "measured_by": "likelihood of revealing cards based on potential rewards",
    "justification": "The study assessed how the probability of revealing the third card was influenced by the identity and match of the first two cards, demonstrating reward anticipation. This was measured by observing participants' choices when different reward magnitudes were indicated by the first card."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "pattern completion preference",
    "measured_by": "probability of revealing the third card",
    "justification": "Participants were more likely to reveal the third card when the first two cards were identical, potentially due to a preference for pattern completion. This was measured through comparing probabilities of revealing the third card when the first two cards matched versus when they were different."
