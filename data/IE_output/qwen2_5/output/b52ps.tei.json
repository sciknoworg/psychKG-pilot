    "measured_by": "Proportion of Choices in Risky Alternative",
    "justification": "The article describes using the proportion of choices in the risky alternative as a measure of risk preference. In the experiments, participants' risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviors are inferred from how often they opt for alternative choices that carry more reward uncertainty."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Attitude",
    "measured_by": "Choice of Alternatives under Different Feedback Conditions",
    "justification": "The psychological construct of risk attitude is assessed by examining participants' choices between safe and risky alternatives in the context of partial and reverse feedback conditions, thereby linking risk-seeking behavior to the type of feedback received."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Learning from Experience",
    "measured_by": "Sequential Choice Behavior in Simulated Environments",
    "justification": "Participants' learning from experience is measured by their sequential choice behavior in a simulated environment where they repeatedly choose between alternatives with different payoffs and observe the outcome based on feedback type."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Perception",
    "measured_by": "Attribution of Risk to Alternatives Based on Payoffs",
    "justification": "Participants' perception of risk is inferred from how they attribute risk to different alternatives based on the observed payoffs (high, low, and their probabilities) in various experimental conditions, reflecting their subjective valuation of uncertainty."
