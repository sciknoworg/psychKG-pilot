    "measured_by": "Delay discounting task with varying delays",
    "justification": "Temporal discounting is measured through a task where participants choose between a smaller, immediate reward and a larger, delayed reward. The delay discounting task, with varying time intervals, is used to assess the discounting behavior over time."

    "topic_or_construct": "Spatial-temporal discounting",
    "measured_by": "Virtual reality task with varied walking speeds",
    "justification": "The study further explores spatial-temporal discounting by adjusting the walking speed in the virtual reality environment. This manipulation helps in distinguishing the effects of distance versus time on the discounting of rewards, thus measuring the interaction between spatial and temporal discounting."
