    "justification": "The text describes using logistic regression to model the impact of past stimuli and responses over trials. It quantifies sequential effects, supporting the understanding of how past trials influence concept categorization."

    "justification": "The text details computing excess choice probabilities and fitting reduced models to participants' behavior, explicitly capturing positive and negative effects of past stimuli, demonstrating these as key measurements for sequential decision impact."
