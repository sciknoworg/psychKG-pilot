    "justification": "The study used a Process Dissociation procedure with two types of sacrificial scenarios (congruent and incongruent) to independently estimate deontological and utilitarian inclinations. This method allowed researchers to calculate the D-parameter (deontology) and U-parameter (utilitarianism), as described in Conway & Gawronski (2013)."

    "justification": "Participants underwent acute physical exercise to induce fatigue. In Experiment 1, heart rate was measured using a Polar RS400 cardio frequency meter, while in Experiment 2, a finger Jumper JPD-500F pulse oximeter was used. These methods confirmed the physiological impact of the fatigue manipulation on participants."
