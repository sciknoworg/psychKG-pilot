    "topic_or_construct": "Jumping to Conclusions (JTC) Bias",
    "measured_by": "Beads Task",
    "justification": "The beads task is widely used for measuring the JTC bias, where participants draw beads from jars with different proportions of colored beads, and decide on the jar's contents with limited evidence. This task reflects the tendency to make decisions based on insufficient information."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Jumping to Conclusions (JTC) Bias",
    "measured_by": "Decision Threshold Beads Task (DTBT)",
    "justification": "The DTBT adapts the original beads task to assess decision thresholds on the basis of objective probabilities and a signal detection analytical approach. It determines how much probability is needed for children to feel confident enough to make a decision, providing an innovative measure for decision thresholds."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Threshold",
    "measured_by": "Decision Threshold Beads Task (DTBT)",
    "justification": "The DTBT is specifically designed to measure the decision threshold in primary school children using objective probability values, addressing limitations of the original beads task and offering a more reliable measurement based on SDT."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Confirmation Bias",
    "measured_by": "Self-Assessment Questionnaire",
    "justification": "The confirmation bias is measured using a six-item self-assessment questionnaire that evaluates the degree to which participants believe their initial impressions are correct, suggesting a tendency to selectively seek information supporting pre-existing beliefs."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Alternation Bias",
    "measured_by": "Self-Developed Instrument",
    "justification": "An alternation bias is assessed with a self-developed instrument where participants create sequences of coin-throw results that they consider random, revealing their expectations for alternations in random sequences."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Epistemic Certainty Beliefs",
    "measured_by": "Adapted Items",
    "justification": "Epistemic certainty beliefs are assessed using nine adapted items from a questionnaire, evaluating children\u2019s beliefs about the certainty of knowledge they have acquired."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Self-Concept in Data-Related Tasks",
    "measured_by": "Items from a Questionnaire",
    "justification": "Children\u2019s self-concept in data-related tasks is assessed with six items evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale, measuring the perception of their abilities related to tasks involving data."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "General Self-Efficacy",
    "measured_by": "Short Form Self-Efficacy Scale",
    "justification": "General self-efficacy is measured using a short scale consisting of three items rated on a 5-point scale, evaluating children\u2019s confidence in their abilities to handle challenges."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Mathematics Grade",
    "measured_by": "Self-Reported Mathematics Grade",
    "justification": "Mathematics performance is assessed by self-reported grades from participants, reflecting their perceived achievement level in mathematics, which is reverse-scored for analysis."
