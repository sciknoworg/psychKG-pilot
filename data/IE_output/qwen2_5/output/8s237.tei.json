    "measured_by": "Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT)",
    "justification": "The Berlin Numeracy Test was used to measure objective numeracy. It involves four challenging items that assess a person's ability to comprehend and effectively use statistical and probabilistic information, indicating its role as a measure of objective numeracy."

    "topic_or_construct": "subjective numeracy",
    "measured_by": "Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS)",
    "justification": "Subjective numeracy was assessed using the Subjective Numeracy Scale, which includes self-report questions like 'How good are you at working with percentages?', capturing a decision maker's own confidence in their numerical abilities."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "approximate numeracy",
    "measured_by": "Symbolic Number Mapping Task",
    "justification": "Approximate numeracy was measured using the symbolic-number mapping task, in which participants were asked to locate numbers on a number line anchored with 0 and 1000, reflecting their intuitive capability to perceive and manipulate numbers."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "numeracy",
    "measured_by": "scale developed by Lipkus et al.",
    "justification": "The numeracy scale developed by Lipkus et al. includes relatively easy items such as calculating probabilities from given data, and was used in several studies to assess participants' basic understanding of probabilities and numbers."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "numeracy",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Reflection Test",
    "justification": "The Cognitive Reflection Test includes items that require participants to think beyond surface-level responses, such as the well-known 'lily pads doubling' puzzle, used to measure deeper numeracy comprehension."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "numeracy",
    "measured_by": "Abbreviated Numeracy Scale (ANS)",
    "justification": "The Abbreviated Numeracy Scale, developed using item response theory, consists of items from commonly used numeracy tests and was used to evaluate participants' understanding and application of numerical information."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "financial knowledge",
    "measured_by": "Financial knowledge questions",
    "justification": "Financial knowledge was measured through 20 true-false and multiple-choice questions assessing understanding of financial concepts like bonds vs. stocks, contributing to the evaluation of numeracy's impact on financial decision-making."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "financial well-being",
    "measured_by": "financial well-being questions",
    "justification": "Financial well-being was measured using ten questions on a 5-point scale regarding perceived financial well-being, indicating its relationship with participants' confidence and satisfaction in their financial management."
