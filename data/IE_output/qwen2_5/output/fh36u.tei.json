    "justification": "The study uses the expected value maximization model as a benchmark for optimal decision-making, defining EV consistency as choices that maximize expected value. This model is used to monitor changes in decision strategy in response to different payoff conditions."

    "justification": "The study evaluates adaptive strategy selection by presenting participants with choice problems that differ in payoff conditions. The authors analyze participant responses to these problems to assess strategy adaptation based on relative and absolute differences in value."
