    "topic_or_construct": "Decision threshold strategy",
    "measured_by": "Fixed and Collapsing Thresholds Diffusion Models",
    "justification": "The study uses the fixed and collapsing thresholds diffusion models to measure participants' decision threshold strategies across different experimental conditions, discussing their parameters and fitting the models to participants' response times and accuracies quantitatively."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Reward rate optimization",
    "measured_by": "Optimal fixed threshold reward rate calculation",
    "justification": "The optimal fixed threshold reward rate is calculated for each participant to assess if they adopted collapsing thresholds to maximize reward rate, suggesting a direct measurement approach for this construct in Experiment 1 specifically."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Speed-emphasis instructions",
    "measured_by": "Verbal instructions and response times",
    "justification": "The impact of speed-emphasis instructions on participants' decision strategies is assessed by comparing their response times with verbal instructions that emphasize speed, showing the influence of such instructions on the decision-making process."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Speed deadlines",
    "measured_by": "Decision deadline manipulation",
    "justification": "Using a decision deadline, Experiment 2 manipulates participants' urgency in decision-making, allowing the collapsing and fixed thresholds models to reveal how this influences their decision strategies."
