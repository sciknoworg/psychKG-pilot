    "topic_or_construct": "adaptive learning",
    "measured_by": "predictive eye movements",
    "justification": "The paper demonstrates that participants' adaptive learning in the task was assessed via their predictive eye movements as they anticipated the locations of briefly presented digits, indicating successful metalearning and adaptive inference to environmental changes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "expected uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Gaussian distribution with stable mean",
    "justification": "Expected uncertainty was operationally measured using the Gaussian distribution with a fixed width but a stable mean, as participants were expected to learn and adapt from small prediction errors reflecting normal fluctuations."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "unexpected uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Uniformly distributed outliers",
    "justification": "Unexpected uncertainty was measured by randomly inserting uniformly distributed outliers that do not conform to the known unreliability of predictive cues, requiring participants to update their beliefs about the underlying context."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "trait anxiety",
    "measured_by": "questionnaires or decision-making tasks",
    "justification": "While not directly measured in this specific study, the paper references previous works where trait anxiety was linked to dimensions of psychopathology and adaptive learning, potentially measured through questionnaires or decision-making tasks assessing baseline anxiety levels."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "metalearning",
    "measured_by": "change in learning rate over time",
    "justification": "The degree of metalearning within the study was measured by the change in learning rate over the course of the task, as participants calibrated their behavior to the current context's higher-order statistics through experience."
