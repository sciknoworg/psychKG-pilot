    "justification": "The study used various binary choice tasks involving job options and medications under different framing conditions (choose vs. reject) to measure the impact of default effects, observing participant preferences for specific options when defaults were present."

    "measured_by": "Choose vs. Reject framing conditions in decision scenarios",
    "justification": "The researchers incorporated framing effects by manipulating whether participants were asked to choose or reject options, which allowed them to assess the differential impact of positive vs. negative framing on participant decision-making."
