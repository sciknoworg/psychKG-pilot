    "measured_by": "Generalised linear mixture model (GLMM) and t-test",
    "justification": "The study uses a GLMM to analyze the data on metacognitive accuracy, calculating it as described in the literature. Specifically, the metacognitive accuracy is compared between force conditions using a t-test to assess the effect of physical effort on confidence relative to decision accuracy."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perceptual decision accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Weibull cumulative distribution function",
    "justification": "The accuracy of participants' perceptual decisions is evaluated using Weibull cumulative distribution fitted on the averaged data points of each condition, indicating how the difficulty level of the visual stimulus manipulates the participants' response."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision confidence",
    "measured_by": "0-6 scale",
    "justification": "Participants reported their confidence level of the decision on a scale of 0-6 immediately after making a decision about the net direction of the dot-motion, providing a measure for their confidence in their perceptual decision."
