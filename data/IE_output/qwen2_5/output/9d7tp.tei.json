    "measured_by": "Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-SR)",
    "justification": "The study used the WAI-SR to assess the quality of the collaborative relationship between users and the LLMs, focusing on emotional bond, goal agreement, and task alignment. Participants rated their interactions using this measure, indicating its relevance for evaluating therapeutic alliance in this context."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Clinical Performance",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Therapy Scale Revised (CTSR)",
    "justification": "Clinicians evaluated the clinical performance of the LLMs using the CTSR, a standard tool for assessing the proficiency of therapists in delivering cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This scale evaluated dimensions such as therapeutic relation, structure and time management, conceptual integration, and therapeutic change."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Goal Agreement",
    "measured_by": "Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-SR)",
    "justification": "The WAI-SR's goal agreement subscale was used to measure how well users perceived their therapy goals aligned with those suggested by the LLM. Users in the LLM + Limbic Layer condition rated this dimension higher, indicating enhanced goal alignment facilitated by the Limbic Layer."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Task Alignment",
    "measured_by": "Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-SR)",
    "justification": "The task alignment subscale of the WAI-SR evaluated users' satisfaction with the therapeutic tasks recommended by the LLMs. Users reported higher satisfaction with the task alignment when interacting with the LLM augmented with the Limbic Layer."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Therapeutic Relation",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Therapy Scale Revised (CTSR)",
    "justification": "The therapeutic relation dimension of the CTSR measured how clinicians perceived the relationship building between the LLM and the user. Clinicians rated the therapeutic relation higher for the LLM + Limbic Layer, demonstrating better relationship building."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Structure and Time Management",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Therapy Scale Revised (CTSR)",
    "justification": "This dimension of the CTSR evaluated the LLM's ability to maintain session structure and manage time effectively. The LLM + Limbic Layer showed significant improvements in this area, indicating enhanced structure and time management capabilities."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Conceptual Integration",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Therapy Scale Revised (CTSR)",
    "justification": "The conceptual integration dimension of the CTSR gauged the LLM's ability to develop and integrate appropriate conceptualizations within the therapy framework. The LLM + Limbic Layer demonstrated significant improvements, indicating better integration of clinical concepts."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Therapeutic Change",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Therapy Scale Revised (CTSR)",
    "justification": "This dimension of the CTSR evaluated the application of cognitive and behavioral methods to facilitate therapeutic change. The LLM + Limbic Layer scored higher in this area, showing its enhanced ability to facilitate therapeutic change."
