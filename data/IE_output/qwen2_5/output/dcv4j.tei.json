    "measured_by": "eye-tracking data",
    "justification": "The paper uses eye-tracking datasets to analyze attentional and decision processes. These datasets include information acquisition data, capturing where participants focus their attention during decision-making tasks such as intertemporal choices, risky choices, and effort allocation choices."

    "topic_or_construct": "utility formation",
    "measured_by": "utility accumulation models (WAD, EW, WP, TAL)",
    "justification": "Various utility formation assumptions are tested through models like WAD (weighted additive), EW (equal weights), WP (weighted pros), and TAL (tallying). These models predict how attributes are weighted and aggregated into utilities based on sampled information."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "utility accumulation",
    "measured_by": "Attentional Accumulator model",
    "justification": "The Attentional Accumulator model is used to examine how utilities accumulate during the decision-making process. It predicts that increased attention to a choice option leads to a higher probability of choosing that option."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "attentional sampling",
    "measured_by": "general attention model",
    "justification": "The general attention model is employed to predict the probability of fixating on a particular piece of information. It incorporates factors like within-option and within-attribute transitions, novelty, and previously sampled attribute values."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "decision strategies",
    "measured_by": "decision models (Dynamic LEX, Dynamic WAD, WAD Accumulator, among others)",
    "justification": "Different decision models are tested to understand the strategies used by decision-makers. These models predict choice probabilities based on sampled information and utility accumulation behaviors."
