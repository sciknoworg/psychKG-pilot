    "measured_by": "Parental Belief Systems",
    "justification": "The paper highlights that parental cognitions, such as beliefs, attitudes, and expectations, are crucial in influencing parenting behavior. The work of Sigel's 1985 book, 'Parental Belief Systems,' is cited as a foundational text for studying parental cognitions, indicating that this scale or instrument was used to measure and conceptualize these cognitions in parenting research."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Parental Decision Factors",
    "measured_by": "Decision Factors in Parenting",
    "justification": "The paper introduces the Parenting as Decision-Making (PaDM) paradigm, where parents consider various decision factors like expected outcomes, effort, and opportunity costs. This focus on decision factors in the paradigm represents a structured approach to measuring how parents weigh and integrate multiple considerations into their parenting behaviors."

    "topic_or_construct": "Moment-to-Moment Parenting",
    "measured_by": "Ecological Momentary Assessment",
    "justification": "The paper discusses the ability of intensive longitudinal designs, such as Ecological Momentary Assessment and daily diary studies, to capture the short-term dynamics and variability of parenting behavior. These methods are suggested as suitable for assessing the moment-to-moment fluctuations in parenting under the PaDM paradigm."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Parenting Costs and Benefits",
    "measured_by": "Cost-Benefit Calculus",
    "justification": "The text explains that a decision-making perspective on parenting should consider the perceived costs, such as time, effort, potential child reactions, and social disapproval, in addition to the perceived benefits of parenting behaviors. This involves measuring and analyzing the cost-benefit calculus as parents make parenting decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Parenting Stress and Emotions",
    "measured_by": "Emotion Induction Techniques",
    "justification": "To study the impact of stress and emotions on parenting decisions, the paper suggests the use of emotional induction techniques in laboratory experiments. This approach enables researchers to examine how emotional states influence parents' depth of deliberation and decision factors in parenting."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Co-parenting and Joint Decision Making",
    "measured_by": "Joint Decision Making Measures",
    "justification": "The paper mentions the need for tools like measures of joint decision making, as described in the decision science literature, to understand the dynamics of parenting decisions made by co-parents. This includes assessing factors such as cooperative or conflictual interactions and their impact on parenting decisions."
