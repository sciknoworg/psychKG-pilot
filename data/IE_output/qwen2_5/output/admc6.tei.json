    "measured_by": "Willingness-to-pay (WTP)",
    "justification": "The anchoring effect was measured using WTP, where participants were asked to state the maximum amount they would pay for market goods after being influenced by a randomly assigned anchor. This measurement was employed across multiple experiments to assess how anchoring affects consumer preferences and judgments."

    "topic_or_construct": "Anchoring effect",
    "measured_by": "Willing-to-buy (WTB) prompt",
    "justification": "Participants were first asked whether they would purchase the item for a random price indicated by a high or low anchor using the WTB question. This prompted subsequent responses, including WTP values, with the WTB serving as an initial condition that tested the effect of the anchor on purchase intention and subsequent valuation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Relative Preference Reversals",
    "measured_by": "WTP ranks between items",
    "justification": "Relative WTP ranks were used to gauge preference reversals caused by anchoring, where higher WTP was observed for items associated with higher anchors within the same experiment, particularly in Studies 1-4, where these rankings changed according to the presented anchors."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Preference and Choice Dynamics",
    "measured_by": "Choice Selection",
    "justification": "Choice selections were recorded to test if anchoring effects on WTP carry over to actual consumer choices. In most experiments, participants were instructed to choose between items after providing WTP judgments, with choice selections indicating the effect (or lack thereof) of the anchoring on their final decisions."
