    "topic_or_construct": "Memory Discriminability",
    "measured_by": "Area Under the Curve (AUC)",
    "justification": "The paper explains that AUC is a common measure of memory acuity, where higher values indicate better performance. This is justified by the theoretical connection between AUC and the discriminability of targets and lures, supported by underlying evidence distributions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Eyewitness Identification",
    "measured_by": "Lineup Receivers Operating Characteristic (ROC) Analysis",
    "justification": "The paper focuses on using lineup ROC analysis to evaluate the performance of eyewitness identification procedures. It discusses the construction and interpretation of full lineup ROCs to assess various aspects of lineup decisions."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Strategies Impact",
    "measured_by": "Piecewise-Linear ROC",
    "justification": "The paper examines how decision strategies influence piecewise-linear ROCs, noting that these strategies exacerbate information loss when mapping evidence states to discrete response distributions, especially with smaller sample sizes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Theoretical Optimal Performance",
    "measured_by": "Model-Based Continuous ROC",
    "justification": "The paper discusses how model-based continuous ROCs represent the optimal performance that can be achieved with access to the theoretical mixture distributions representing joint outcomes of memory strength and lineup responses."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Information Theoretical Measure",
    "measured_by": "Expected Information Gain (EIG)",
    "justification": "EIG is introduced as a measure that incorporates all lineup responses and factors, such as prior probability of guilt and judgment calibration, to assess the usefulness of witness responses in real investigations."
