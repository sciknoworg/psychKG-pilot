    "topic_or_construct": "Punishment sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Conditioned punishment task",
    "justification": "The study employs a conditioned punishment task to identify how individuals learn from and adapt to punishment, highlighting differences in punishment sensitivity among participants."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Causal inference deficits",
    "measured_by": "Attack inferences and CS-action contingencies",
    "justification": "The study identifies causal inference deficits through participants' ability to correctly infer and update their understanding of punishment contingencies (R1\u2192CS+\u2192Attack) during the task."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive-affective-behavioral integration failure",
    "measured_by": "Singular value decomposition (SVD)",
    "justification": "SVD analysis is used to represent the relationships between action-related bias measures per cluster, capturing the cognitive-behavioral trajectories that distinguish different phenotypes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Behavioral phenotypes",
    "measured_by": "TwoStep clustering",
    "justification": "TwoStep clustering was used to identify three distinct behavioral phenotypes (Sensitive, Unaware, Compulsive) based on participants' responses and decision-making strategies in the punishment task."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Trait-like differences in punishment learning",
    "measured_by": "Test-retest reliability",
    "justification": "The study demonstrates trait-like stability of punishment phenotypes by reassessing participants six months later and finding that behavioral phenotypes tracked consistently across tests."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Flexibility",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI)",
    "justification": "The CFI measures one's ability to think adaptively in challenging situations, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive flexibility. This measure was applied in this study to try to link adaptive thinking to punishment learning."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Habitual tendencies",
    "measured_by": "Habitual Tendencies Questionnaire (HTQ)",
    "justification": "The HTQ assesses inclinations to enact repeated behavior without conscious thought, presented here as a measure to explore the relationship between habitual tendencies and punishment phenotypes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Alcohol use patterns",
    "measured_by": "Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)",
    "justification": "The AUDIT measures alcohol consumption patterns over the past 12 months. It was included in this study to explore whether alcohol use patterns are related to the observed punishment learning phenotypes."
