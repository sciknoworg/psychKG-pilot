    "justification": "The paper discusses the DDM as a widely used computational model for quantifying evidence accumulation processes during decision-making across various fields including psychology. It is used to examine individual differences in cognitive tasks and response times."

    "justification": "The process of evidence accumulation in decision-making is modeled using the DDM, which describes how information is accumulated over time until a decision is made based on crossing a decision boundary."

    "justification": "The paper demonstrates the use of HDDM with a regression model to test the impact of conflict levels on the drift rate parameter in decision-making processes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "speed-accuracy trade-off",
    "measured_by": "decision boundary parameter in DDM",
    "justification": "The decision boundary parameter in the DDM represents the trade-off between speed and accuracy of decision-making. Higher boundaries lead to increased accuracy at the expense of slower response times."

    "topic_or_construct": "non-decision time",
    "measured_by": "non-decision time parameter in DDM",
    "justification": "Non-decision time, another parameter estimated by the DDM, captures processes outside the decision-making phase, such as sensory encoding and motor execution times."
