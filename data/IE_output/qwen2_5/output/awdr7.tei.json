    "measured_by": "Random generation paradigm",
    "justification": "The paper employs the random generation paradigm where participants repeatedly simulate outcomes of gambles. This method was used to investigate how utility biases influence mental simulation processes. The justification is supported by the experiments in which participants' generated outcomes were analyzed based on gain, loss, and control domains."

    "topic_or_construct": "Starting point bias",
    "measured_by": "Bayesian ANOVA analyses",
    "justification": "The starting point bias was identified using Bayesian ANOVA analyses to compare the first number in repeated conditions with one-off conditions. This analysis revealed that participants often began with smaller or more probable outcomes as initial responses, suggesting a starting point bias."

    "topic_or_construct": "Probability judgment accuracy",
    "measured_by": "Comparison of generated histograms and probability judgments",
    "justification": "Probability judgments were compared with the distribution of randomly generated numbers across experiments. This was done to evaluate if participants' mental simulations aligned with their explicit probability estimates, revealing how utility influences their accuracy."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Individual differences in utility influence",
    "measured_by": "Individual Bayesian ANOVAs and confidence ellipses",
    "justification": "The paper uses individual-level Bayesian ANOVAs and visualizes individual biases using confidence ellipses. These methods allowed for identifying subgroups of participants who remain uninfluenced by utility in mental simulations, demonstrating the importance of considering individual differences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Optimism and Neutrality hypotheses",
    "measured_by": "Neutrality hypothesis and distribution-wise comparisons",
    "justification": "The paper compares participants' results with the Neutrality hypothesis and evaluates fitting to Utility-Weighted Sampling (UWS) models. The dominance of the Neutrality hypothesis showed that many participants remained unbiased by outcome utilities, particularly in simpler probabilities."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Prediction task differences",
    "measured_by": "Comparison with random generation tasks",
    "justification": "Predictions of outcomes are compared to random generation responses. This comparison, across Experiments 3 and 4, shows that these tasks are guided by shared cognitive processes like mental simulation, but the accuracy feedback in predictions tends to reduce desirability biases."
