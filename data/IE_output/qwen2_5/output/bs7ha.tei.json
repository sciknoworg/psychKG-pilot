    "justification": "The study assessed whether the irrelevant color of the target object influenced the detection of changes in shape, suggesting that this effect could be used to infer if the color entered VWM. The presence of the irrelevant-feature distracting effect is cited in the text as a measure supporting the inclusion of task-irrelevant features in VWM."

    "justification": "The same experimental paradigm was used to explore the dimensional memory filter hypothesis, evaluating whether memorizing a fixation color led to the automatic inclusion of all other colors in the VWM for encoding. Participants' slower responses when the irrelevant color changed suggest VWM representations include the target color through the filter."

    "justification": "Experiment 1 measured participants' response times and accuracy on a search task following the location retention task. A matched color effect\u2014slower responses when a distractor matched the target color\u2014suggested that task-irrelevant information could enter VWM. This counters Zhu et al.'s proposal of a reselection process requiring additional selection."
