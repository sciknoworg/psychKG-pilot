    "measured_by": "Sequential Sampling Model (specifically Racing Diffusion Model - RDM)",
    "justification": "The Racing Diffusion Model was used to analyze choices and response times in the discrete choice experiment (DCE) stimuli, allowing the researchers to distinguish between decision threshold and utility adjustments. The DIC-based model comparison showed the impact of deadline and verbal instruction manipulations on speed-accuracy tradeoffs."

    "measured_by": "Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) Stimulus",
    "justification": "The DCE stimulus was used to measure the utilities of attributes within multi-attribute choices for pizza delivery and mobile phones. The participants' choices, reflected in their DCE responses, were analyzed to quantify the subjective values placed on different attributes within the preferential options."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Thresholds under Time Pressure",
    "measured_by": "Speed-Accuracy Manipulations through Deadlines and Verbal Instructions",
    "justification": "The experimenters used explicit deadlines and verbal instructions to manipulate time pressure and measured its impact on decision thresholds. Analysis revealed that participants adjusted their decision thresholds in response to time pressure, impacting decision speed but not the utilities of the attributes."

    "topic_or_construct": "Latent Psychological Process of Preference Accumulation",
    "measured_by": "Racing Diffusion Model within a Sequential Sampling Framework",
    "justification": "The model translated choices and response times into latent variables like drift rate, threshold, and non-decision time, uncovering that latency in preference accumulation (decision thresholds) varied with time pressure, while utilities remained stable."
