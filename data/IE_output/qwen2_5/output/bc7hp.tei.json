    "measured_by": "Milkman Task",
    "justification": "The Milkman Task was developed specifically to measure foraging behaviour, allowing participants to collect milk as a reward while making decisions to switch between cows. This task was designed to test suboptimality in foraging under time-constrained conditions, relevant to understanding how participants decide to persist or switch based on reward rates."

    "topic_or_construct": "depressive symptoms",
    "measured_by": "Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)",
    "justification": "The PHQ-9 was used to assess depressive symptoms among participants. The study examined the relationship between depressive symptoms and foraging behaviour by correlating results from the Milkman Task with PHQ-9 scores."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "apathy",
    "measured_by": "Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES)",
    "justification": "The AES was employed to evaluate individual differences in apathy. The study investigated how apathy, as measured by the AES, might relate to foraging behaviour, particularly in the context of age-related differences."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "processing speed",
    "measured_by": "Choice Reaction Time Task",
    "justification": "The Choice Reaction Time Task was used to measure processing speed. Participants\u2019 reaction times were recorded, and median reaction times were analyzed as an indicator of cognitive processing speed, which could potentially influence foraging decision-making."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "executive function or planning abilities",
    "measured_by": "Tower of London Task",
    "justification": "The Tower of London Task was utilized to assess participants' executive function or planning abilities. The task required moving discs to match specific patterns, providing a measure of participants' planning and problem-solving skills."
