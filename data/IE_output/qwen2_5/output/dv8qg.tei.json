    "measured_by": "Observe or Bet Task",
    "justification": "The paper discusses the 'observe or bet' task, introduced by Tversky & Edwards (1966), as a means to study the explore-exploit dilemma in decision making under uncertainty. This task requires participants to choose between observing for information or betting for rewards, directly assessing their strategy in balancing information gathering and immediate rewards."

    "measured_by": "Dynamic vs Static Conditions in Observe or Bet Task",
    "justification": "The paper investigates how participants adjust their decision strategies based on the assumption of a static versus a dynamic environment within the 'observe or bet' task. The two conditions assess how beliefs about the world's changeability impact the explore-exploit trade-off."

    "topic_or_construct": "Belief State and Action Selection",
    "measured_by": "MDP (Markov Decision Process) Model",
    "justification": "The paper employs an MDP analysis to derive optimal decision policies for static and dynamic environments, allowing researchers to measure how closely human behavior approaches these optimal strategies through the observe or bet task."

    "topic_or_construct": "Evidentiary Decay in Uncertain Environments",
    "measured_by": "Process Models with Evidence Decay Parameter",
    "justification": "The paper introduces process models that incorporate an evidence decay parameter to assess how people weigh recent versus older observations differently in dynamic versus static conditions, revealing insights into their learning strategies."

    "topic_or_construct": "Observation and Bounding Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Sequence of Observations and Bets",
    "justification": "Direct analysis of participants' sequences of actions (observations versus bets) during the experiment allows measurement of how people distribute their observation vs. betting behavior over time, highlighting front-loading strategies and switching behavior."
