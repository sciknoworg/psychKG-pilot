    "measured_by": "EWA model",
    "justification": "The EWA model is used to formalize a selfish strategy based on reinforcement learning and utility maximization. It incorporates a learning rule that updates preferences for each token amount based on actual and imagined payoffs. This aligns with the concept of selfish motives guiding individual decisions in the game (Camerer & Ho, 1999)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cooperative social motives",
    "measured_by": "CC model",
    "justification": "The Conditional Cooperation (CC) model defines cooperative motives in terms of beliefs about others' contributions and preferences for one's own contribution. It formalizes a cooperative strategy where individuals may match or undermatch the contributions of others, providing a framework for understanding conditional cooperation (Fischbacher & G\u00e4chter, 2010)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Social motive selection",
    "measured_by": "SMS model",
    "justification": "The Social Motive Selection (SMS) model employs latent mixture modeling to infer whether an individual's choices are best explained by selfish or cooperative motives. It combines the EWA and CC models and uses Bayesian inference to categorize individuals as primarily driven by either motive in decision-making scenarios (current paper's SMS approach)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Competitive personality types",
    "measured_by": "Kelley and Stahelski's trait-based conception",
    "justification": "According to Kelley and Stahelski (1970), competitive personality types are characterized by behaviors such as rarely contributing to shared resources and perceiving others' actions as more competitive. Their perspective links individual differences in personality traits to social decision-making, specifically in shared resource problems."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cooperative personality types",
    "measured_by": "Kelley and Stahelski's trait-based conception",
    "justification": "Kelley and Stahelski (1970) also identified cooperative personality types, characterized by readiness to contribute to shared resources and perceptions of both competitive and cooperative intentions in others' actions. This trait-based conception links individual differences to cooperative behavior patterns in social decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Altruistic preferences",
    "measured_by": "Charness and Rabin's three parameter utility function",
    "justification": "Charness and Rabin (2002) proposed a utility function consisting of parameters for the other player's outcome and a shift parameter based on non-cooperation. This function formalizes altruistic preferences by incorporating considerations for others' outcomes in addition to one's own in decision-making."
