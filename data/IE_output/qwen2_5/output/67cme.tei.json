    "justification": "The study manipulates the Ultimatum Game with offers of varying fairness to investigate the MFN's response, aiming to determine its sensitivity to social context. The MFN was found to be insensitive to norm representation and offered fairness, suggesting it may not be as socially sensitive as previously thought."

    "measured_by": "MFN",
    "justification": "Boksem & De Cremer showed that unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game elicited MFN, which was correlated with participants' sense of justice sensitivity, indicating the MFN responds to perceived unfairness."

    "measured_by": "MFN",
    "justification": "The text indicates that MFN is used to measure the response to different offer types (fair, unfair, and generous) in the Ultimatum Game, providing insight into the ERP patterns related to fairness judgments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "social context effects on ERP responses",
    "measured_by": "MFN",
    "justification": "The study investigates whether the MFN is affected by social context (norm-compatible, incompatible, self representation) by analyzing ERP responses, finding that these representations did not interact significantly with fairness, suggesting the MFN may not be as socially sensitive as expected."
