    "measured_by": "Hierarchical Drift Diffusion Model (HDDM)",
    "justification": "The HDDM was used to examine the computational processes underlying the behavioral results, specifically focusing on the drift rate, starting point bias, and boundary separation parameters. This model allowed researchers to evaluate the efficiency of evidence accumulation in reaching either of the two decision boundaries, influenced by spatial frequency and emotion-guided attention."

    "measured_by": "Signal Detection Theory (SDT) Measures: d' and c",
    "justification": "The perceptual sensitivity (d') and response bias (c) were measured using Signal Detection Theory. These measures demonstrated that endogenous emotion-guided attention biased decision-making, particularly for low spatial frequency stimuli, showing a conservative response bias."

    "measured_by": " facial images with high spatial frequency (HSF) and low spatial frequency (LSF) variations",
    "justification": "The study manipulated spatial frequency in facial stimuli, showing that high spatial frequency (HSF) signals were more effective than low spatial frequency (LSF) signals in guiding perceptual decisions under emotion-guided attention, challenging the traditional low-road hypothesis."
