    "measured_by": "Choice Behavior in Risky Decision-Making Task",
    "justification": "The paper discusses measuring risk tolerance using choice behavior in a risky decision-making task (RISK) where participants chose between two lotteries in the gain and loss domain conditions, highlighting its importance in estimating risk tolerance."

    "measured_by": "Choice Behavior in Risky and Ambiguous Decision-Making Task",
    "justification": "Ambiguity tolerance is measured through choice behavior in a task (AMB) where participants chose between a certain reward and a lottery under conditions of varying ambiguity. The measure helps in understanding how ambiguity affects decision-making strategies."

    "measured_by": "Choice and Response Time in Intertemporal Choice Task",
    "justification": "The discount factor is estimated using both choice and response time data in an intertemporal choice task (ITC), where participants made choices between immediate and delayed monetary rewards, demonstrating how they trade off time and reward."

    "measured_by": "Hierarchical Bayesian Models with Sequential Effects",
    "justification": "Sequential effects on decision-making parameters, such as risk and ambiguity tolerance, are measured using hierarchical Bayesian models that incorporate trial order information. This approach shows that trial-trial dependencies significantly impact parameter estimates and psychological interpretations."

    "measured_by": "Hierarchical Bayesian Drift-Diffusion Model",
    "justification": "Risk tolerance is also measured using a hierarchical Bayesian drift-diffusion model that analyzes response times in addition to choice behavior. This model allows for a more detailed understanding of the decision-making process by incorporating evidence accumulation rates."
