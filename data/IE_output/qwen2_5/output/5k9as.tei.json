    "justification": "The Model of Ambivalent Induced Discomfort, or MAID, is used to outline how people cope with the discomfort arising from attitudes that include both positive and negative evaluations, specifically attitudinal ambivalence. This model illustrates that individuals employ emotion-focused strategies to reduce discomfort when facing conflicting evaluations within their attitudes (van Harreveld, van der Pligt, et al., 2009)."

    "measured_by": "Induced-Compliance Paradigm",
    "justification": "The induced-compliance paradigm is one of the methods used to measure cognitive dissonance, where participants are prompted to act contrary to their attitudes for an insufficient external justification (Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959). This leads to an experience of dissonance due to the inconsistency between their behavior and attitudes."

    "measured_by": "Mouse-tracking studies",
    "justification": "Mouse-tracking studies are employed to quantify cognitive conflict by analyzing participants' mouse trajectories when making decisions. These studies reveal that ambivalent people exhibit more conflicted movements when assessing options, indicating the presence of felt ambivalence (Schneider et al., 2015)."

    "measured_by": "Experience Sampling Method (ESM)",
    "justification": "Experience Sampling Method is used to study daily fluctuations of ambivalence and dissonance in various decision-making contexts. This approach captures real-time fluctuations of cognitive conflict in daily life by repeatedly sampling individuals' experiences throughout the day (Pauer, Rutjens, et al., 2024)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Problem-focused Coping",
    "measured_by": "Attitude Change Measures",
    "justification": "Problem-focused coping strategies aim to address the discrepant evaluations or cognitions that underlie cognitive conflicts. Attitude change measures assess the effectiveness of these strategies by examining changes in individuals' attitudes before and after coping with conflict (e.g., Brehm, 1956)."
