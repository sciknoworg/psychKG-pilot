    "justification": "The paper discusses the aDDM as a relevant model that integrates attention with decision values, demonstrating its relevance in understanding how fixation patterns relate to decision making in value-based choices. The model's use in previous studies is mentioned to justify its applicability and connection to value-based decision making, particularly influencing fixations and choice biases."

    "measured_by": "Liking ratings and fixation time",
    "justification": "Participants in the study provided liking ratings for food items, which were used as an independent measure of true values. These ratings and fixation patterns (duration and number of fixations) were tracked using eye-tracking technology during binary and trinary choice tasks. These measures were used to assess and predict choice biases and fixation dynamics."

    "justification": "Optimal information sampling during simple choices was characterized using a metalevel MDP framework. The near-optimal policy for fixation sequences was identified using an approximation method that considers various features like Value of Computation (VOC) and cost functions. This demonstrates the model's capacity to explain observed fixation patterns and their relationship to choices, indicating the construct's measurement through computational simulations."

    "justification": "The paper investigates whether the model accurately accounts for fixations\u2019 influence on choices. It examines correlations between fixation durations and the likelihood of choosing items, particularly in trinary versus binary choices, using fixation advantage as a metric. These measurements facilitate an understanding of how attention relates to value-based decision outcomes."
