    "measured_by": "Choice proportions and generalized linear mixed modeling (GLMM)",
    "justification": "The authors measured the impact of retro-cueing on choices by analyzing choice proportions, which increased the likelihood of choosing an option recommended by the cued attribute. GLMM was used to isolate the cueing effect and show that it was significant (e.g., 69% in cued trials vs. 53% in non-cued trials, p < .001)."

    "topic_or_construct": "Decision strategy selection",
    "measured_by": "Compensatory WADD and non-compensatory TTB heuristic use",
    "justification": "The study assessed strategy selection through choice data, finding that cued trials led to reduced use of the TTB strategy (55% MCue trials vs. 58% in NoCue trials, p = .01) and increased use of the WADD strategy, which was supported by GLMM analysis. This was further validated using gaze data in Experiment 3."

    "topic_or_construct": "Memory availability of attribute information",
    "measured_by": "Retro-cue paradigm combined with a multi-attribute choice task",
    "justification": "By manipulating the presence of retro-cues in a multi-attribute choice task, the authors were able to observe how increased availability of attribute information from memory affects weights and strategies. For instance, cueing an attribute supported the use of compensatory strategies."

    "topic_or_construct": "Information search behavior",
    "measured_by": "Eye-tracking data (gaze transitions)",
    "justification": "Eye movements, particularly gaze transitions between attributes and options, provided insight into information search behaviors. More attribute-wise transitions were associated with a compensatory strategy use (as found in Experiments 1 and 2), and this was supported by SI index analysis."

    "topic_or_construct": "Adaptive Toolbox model instantiation",
    "measured_by": "Adapted model with added parameters \u03b4 and \u03b3",
    "justification": "The Adaptive Toolbox model was adapted to incorporate the retro-cue effects on strategy selection and option weighting. The adapted model provided a better fit than the original when including the parameters \u03b4 and \u03b3, showing improvement in BIC across all three experiments."
