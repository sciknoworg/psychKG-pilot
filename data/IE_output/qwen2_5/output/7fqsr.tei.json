    "measured_by": "Four-in-a-row task",
    "justification": "The study utilized a child-friendly game named the Four-in-a-row Task, and through a best-first-search computational model fitted to participants' performance, planning depth was estimated. The planning depth metric reflects the number of steps considered by each participant during the task."

    "topic_or_construct": "heuristic quality",
    "measured_by": "Four-in-a-row task",
    "justification": "Heuristic quality was assessed using the same computational model applied to the Four-in-a-row task. This quality was defined by the correlation between the value function's predictions and actual game outcomes in various states, reflecting decision-making efficiency."

    "topic_or_construct": "feature drop rate",
    "measured_by": "Four-in-a-row task",
    "justification": "The feature drop rate, indicating the frequency of participants overlooking potential board features during decision-making, was derived from the computational model parameters in the Four-in-a-row game."

    "topic_or_construct": "fluid reasoning",
    "measured_by": "Matrix Reasoning Item Bank (MaRs-IB)",
    "justification": "The study employed the Matrix Reasoning Item Bank to evaluate fluid reasoning, correlating age-related improvements in reasoning abilities with other cognitive measures."

    "measured_by": "Future Orientation Scale (FOS)",
    "justification": "The Future Orientation Scale was used to measure participants' orientation towards future events as a self-reported metric, comparing it against the cognitive metrics from the Four-in-a-row task."
