    "justification": "The article mentions that SIV was calculated using the final value at the end of the IDM task, estimated by a CIPC-implemented computational model. Specifically, SIV was defined as the difference between the final values of new stimuli (N1) and high-probability stimuli (HP1) from the IDM task, indicating the extent to which intrinsically learned values could overcome extrinsically learned values. This measurement method was implemented following Zhu et al. (2024a), using a validated model."

    "justification": "The article specifies that the Hurst exponent obtained from detrended fluctuation analysis (DFAe) was used to quantify LRTC in the study. DFAe values were derived from resting-state EEG data, with higher DFAe values indicating a stronger LRTC. This measurement was consistent across three resting states (EC1, EC2, and EC3), confirming that LRTC in intrinsic brain activity varies and correlates with decision-making behavior."

    "measured_by": "Ratio of New Stimuli Chosen in Old-New Trials",
    "justification": "The article describes that the ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials was calculated as an index of the balance between intrinsically learned values and extrinsically learned values in IDM. A higher ratio indicated that individuals were more likely to choose stimuli based on intrinsic preferences rather than extrinsic ones, reflecting a greater reliance on intrinsically learned values."

    "measured_by": "CIPC (Choice-Induced Preference Change) Model",
    "justification": "The study uses a CIPC-based computational model to estimate the final values of stimuli in IDM. This allows researchers to determine how participants' choices during the IDM can affect their future preferences and values attributed to the stimuli. The model provides insights into intrinsic learning processes that shape decision-making, as validated in previous works by Zhu et al. (2024a)."

    "measured_by": "Inverse-Transformed Reaction Times",
    "justification": "To assess reactive behavior related to intrinsic and extrinsic value processing, the study employed reaction times for different types of IDM trials (old-old, old-new, new-new). RTs were inverse-transformed to address data skewness before analysis, thus providing a more accurate representation of decision responsiveness."
