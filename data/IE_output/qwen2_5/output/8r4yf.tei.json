    "justification": "The paper discusses the measurement of automatic behavior in others using a large-scale survey and an evaluation of short video stimuli. In Study 1, a survey among a representative US-based population assessed the perceived percentage of interactions involving automatic behavior. In Study 2, participants rated video clips on attributes like 'rote' behavior to evaluate how people perceive automaticity in others."

    "measured_by": "speed and consistency of participant judgments in Study 2",
    "justification": "In Study 2, the paper measures how quickly and reliably participants can attribute automaticity to others\u2019 behavior using short video clips. High inter-participant reliability (r = 0.939) and similar reaction times for automaticity ratings compared to other attributes suggest distinct but fast and consistent judgments."

    "topic_or_construct": " Toggle detection in everyday interactions",
    "measured_by": "participant reports of scripted behavior frequency",
    "justification": "The paper measures the frequency with which people detect automatic or scripted behavior in everyday interactions, particularly in Study 1. Participants reported an average of 44.5% of interactions involving automatic behavior over the past week, indicating the construct's prevalence."
