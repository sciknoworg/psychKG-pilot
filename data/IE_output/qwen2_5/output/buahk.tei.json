    "justification": "The paper uses meta-d'/d', also known as Mratio, developed by Maniscalco & Lau (2012), to estimate metacognitive efficiency, which is central to exploring the positive relationship between metacognitive efficiency and metacognitive bias."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "metacognitive bias",
    "measured_by": "average confidence rating",
    "justification": "Metacognitive bias is operationalized as the average confidence rating of subjects. The study examines this by computing the average confidence for each subject as part of the analysis."

    "topic_or_construct": "metacognitive efficiency",
    "measured_by": "meta-d'",
    "justification": "In addition to Mratio, the study also tests metacognitive sensitivity, meta-d', revealing similar findings but with less noise, which supports the robustness of the relationship between metacognitive efficiency and metacognitive bias."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "confidence",
    "measured_by": "n-point confidence scale",
    "justification": "Confidence is measured using an n-point scale, where subjects report their confidence in their decisions. The original scales vary across tasks but include a 4-point scale in Tasks 1 and 2 and an 11-point scale in Task 3."
