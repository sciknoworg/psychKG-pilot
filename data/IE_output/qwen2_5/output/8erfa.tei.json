    "justification": "The study used a social discounting task where participants made decisions to keep money for themselves or share it with others at varying social distances, operationalizing altruism as objectively measured real-world costly generosity."

    "justification": "The social discounting task was utilized to measure prosocial preferences by assessing participants' willingness to sacrifice monetary rewards for the benefit of others at different social distances."

    "measured_by": "neural activation in amygdala and rostral ACC",
    "justification": "Neural activity in the amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was measured and found to encode the subjective value of others' welfare differently in altruists compared to controls, suggesting a neural correlate for the value placed on the welfare of others."

    "topic_or_construct": "loving-kindness meditation (LKM) effects",
    "measured_by": "difficulty ratings and neural activation",
    "justification": "The study measured the effects of LKM training on decision difficulty ratings and neural activation during social discounting, finding that LKM increased the subjective difficulty of decisions to share with socially distant others but did not change neural activation patterns related to the subjective value of distant others' welfare."

    "topic_or_construct": "altruists' generosity mechanisms",
    "measured_by": "neural activation patterns during social discounting",
    "justification": "The mechanisms underlying altruists' generosity were investigated using neural activation patterns during social discounting. The findings contradicted the hypothesis that altruists' generosity reflects greater effortful control but supported the hypothesis that it reflects true valuation of distant others' welfare."
