    "measured_by": "Sensory evoked potentials (SEPs)",
    "justification": "The text discusses sensory attenuation for movement initiation, with studies using electrical stimulation of the median nerve and recording somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to reveal suppression during movement or preparation. This supports the connection between precision in movement and SEPs as a measurement tool."

    "topic_or_construct": "Multisensory integration for body representation",
    "measured_by": "Rubber Hand Illusion studies",
    "justification": "The paper reviews multisensory integration using the Rubber Hand Illusion, where precision in sensory gain controls the weight of visual over proprioceptive signals, demonstrating the role of precision in body representation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Causal inference and self-other distinction",
    "measured_by": "Force-matching task",
    "justification": "The force-matching task is mentioned as a means to study sensory attenuation and its relation to agency, supporting the construct of causal inference in self-other distinction in the active inference framework."
