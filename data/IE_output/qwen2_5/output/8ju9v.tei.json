    "justification": "In Study 1, participants selected investigations aimed at either incriminating or exonerating the suspect, with confirmation bias manifesting through their tendency to choose investigations that aligned with their prior beliefs about the suspect\u2019s guilt. This experiment method directly measures participants' confirmation bias by their selection preferences."

    "justification": "Study 2 measured participants\u2019 selection of investigations under varying evidence strengths and crime severities. By analyzing the percentage of incriminating vs. exonerating investigations chosen, the study quantified the degree of confirmation bias within different contextual factors, thereby associating the topic with the chosen instruments."

    "justification": "In Study 3, participants' selection of investigations and the outcomes of those selections were evaluated with respect to their final decisions about the suspect's guilt. The relationship between choosing confirmatory investigations and conviction rates provided a direct measure of how confirmation bias influences legal decision-making, thus linking the construct with the measurement."
