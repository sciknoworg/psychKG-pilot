    "justification": "The researchers employed a dual alpha model based on prospect theory computational modeling to quantify loss sensitivity parameters. They found that loss sensitivity decreased over the course of the day, as indicated by the changes in \u03b1loss."

    "topic_or_construct": "Risk taking for potential gains",
    "measured_by": "Risky decision making task with gain trials in The Great Brain Experiment",
    "justification": "Gain trials involved participants selecting between a safe option with guaranteed gains and a risky option with either a higher gain or zero. This trial type helped isolate the effect of time of day on potential gains."

    "topic_or_construct": "Mixed trial risk-taking",
    "measured_by": "Mixed trial options from The Great Brain Experiment",
    "justification": "Mixed trials required participants to choose between a certain zero outcome and a gamble involving both potential gains and losses. These trials were used to assess how participants balanced gains and losses when making decisions."
