    "justification": "Participants completed the short version of the Glasgow Face Matching Test (GFMT), which measures the accuracy of face matching under various mask conditions, including unmasked, one face masked, and both faces masked. Accuracy was measured based on the majority decision of participants in combined decision-making scenarios."

    "measured_by": "Kent Face Matching Test (KFMT)",
    "justification": "The Kent Face Matching Test (KFMT) was used in Experiment 2 to evaluate face matching performance. The KFMT consists of pairs of images with identity matches and mismatches, and was considered a harder task compared to the GFMT. Participants noted whether the faces in each pair showed the same person or two different people under different mask conditions."

    "measured_by": "Combined Decision-Making Analysis",
    "justification": "The WoCE was measured by calculating the majority decision of all participants when matching faces, comparing binary decisions in Experiment 1 and 6-point confidence ratings in Experiment 2. The improvement in accuracy from individual performance to group (crowd) decision-making is used to quantify the WoCE."

    "topic_or_construct": "Response Bias",
    "measured_by": "Criterion Analysis",
    "justification": "The response bias among individuals and in crowds was measured using criterion values. Positive criterion values indicate a conservative bias toward responding 'different', while negative values signal a liberal response bias of responding 'same'. This was used to examine how decision biases evolve as crowd size increases."
