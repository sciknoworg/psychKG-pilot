    "measured_by": "Physical Effort Discounting Task (PEDT)",
    "justification": "The study used a Physical Effort Discounting Task (PEDT) designed to assess behavioral responses to the effort required for physical exercise, such as treadmill walking or jogging. The task was adapted to participants' individual physical capabilities, and participants chose between a small immediate reward and a larger reward after completing a specified level of physical effort."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "cognitive effort discounting",
    "measured_by": "Cognitive Effort Discounting Task (CEDT)",
    "justification": "A Cognitive Effort Discounting Task (CEDT) was employed to assess the impact of cognitive effort on decision-making. The CEDT utilized an N-back task with varying levels of cognitive load, ranging from 0-back to 3-back, to determine participants' willingness to exert cognitive effort for a larger reward."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "delay discounting",
    "measured_by": "Delay Discounting Task (DDT)",
    "justification": "A Delay Discounting Task (DDT) was implemented to evaluate participants' preferences towards immediate versus delayed rewards. Participants chose between a smaller reward available immediately and a larger reward available after a certain delay, with the duration of the delay as the variable factor."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "physical effort discounting",
    "measured_by": "Effort Discounting Questionnaire (EDQ)",
    "justification": "In the online survey (Study 2), an Effort Discounting Questionnaire (EDQ) was used to measure hypothetical preferences for physical effort. Participants indicated their perceived difficulty of effortful activities and their willingness to complete them for different rewards."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "delay discounting",
    "measured_by": "Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ)",
    "justification": "The Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ) was utilized to assess delay discounting through hypothetical choices between smaller immediate rewards and larger delayed rewards. Participants selected their preferences out of 27 forced-choice questions."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "pain intensity",
    "measured_by": "Visual Rating Scale (VRS)",
    "justification": "Current pain intensity was assessed using an 11-point Visual Rating Scale (VRS), which ranged from '0, no pain at all' to '10, worst pain possible.' Participants rated their pain levels before and after the tasks to track any changes."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "central sensitization",
    "measured_by": "Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI)",
    "justification": "The Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) was used to quantify the degree of symptoms associated with central nervous system sensitization. The inventory consists of 25 statements related to health symptoms, scored on a 5-point temporal Likert scale."
