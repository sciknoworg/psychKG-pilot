    "measured_by": "Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) Model",
    "justification": "The SAT models like the LBA have been established as feasible models that account for the speed-accuracy tradeoff by analyzing joint distributions of choices and response times, as shown in Experiments 1 and 2. The LBA model's ability to analyze these variables together provides insights into the underlying psychological mechanisms of the SAT."

    "measured_by": "Conventional Statistical Analysis (ANOVA and Logistic Regression)",
    "justification": "The conventional statistical analysis using ANOVA for response times and logistic regression for accuracy provided evidence for biased decision thresholds, supporting the SAT through separate analyses of speed and accuracy data. This method's application in Experiment 1 further confirmed the finding."

    "topic_or_construct": "Perception Shifts",
    "measured_by": "Self-rated Speed and Accuracy",
    "justification": "Participants' self-reported perceptions of their speed and accuracy were used to measure shifts in their subjective evaluation of fast and slow or accurate and inaccurate decisions. In Experiment 1, evidence showed that these shifts influenced decision thresholds, even with objective feedback."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Goal Activation",
    "measured_by": "Perceptual Discrimination Task",
    "justification": "Experiment 2 used a perceptual discrimination task to test goal activation\u2019s influence, showing participants with a history of faster decision tasks responded more quickly in an unrelated task. This confirmed goal activation persisted even in different contexts."

    "topic_or_construct": "Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff (SAT)",
    "measured_by": "Threshold Adjustment Simulation",
    "justification": "A simulation modeled threshold adjustments based on perceived speed and decision outcomes. It demonstrated how perception shifts cause lasting differences in thresholds, helping explain the SAT phenomenon in repeated decision-making contexts."
