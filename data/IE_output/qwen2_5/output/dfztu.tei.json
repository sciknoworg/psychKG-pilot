    "measured_by": "Foraging task",
    "justification": "The paper discusses a novel foraging task designed to explore how humans make patch-leaving decisions. This task allows researchers to observe participants' behavior in structured foraging environments, such as planets with varying resources."

    "topic_or_construct": "environment structure learning",
    "measured_by": "Multimodal Bayesian model",
    "justification": "The multimodal Bayesian model was used to investigate how participants learn the latent structure of the foraging environment, including different planets types and their transitions, which is central to the paper's exploration of learning and decision-making processes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "model-based planning",
    "measured_by": "Custom two-step foraging task",
    "justification": "The paper uses a custom foraging task that includes multiple planet types and transition structures to measure participants' ability to conduct model-based planning in a more complex, structured environment."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "strategic decision variability",
    "measured_by": "Individual model fitting",
    "justification": "The paper assesses individual differences through model fitting, which helps identify whether participants are better represented by multimodal or unimodal learners, thereby measuring strategic decision variability."
