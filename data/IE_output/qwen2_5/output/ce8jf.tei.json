    "topic_or_construct": "Perceptual Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Signal-Detection Theory",
    "justification": "The article discusses that signal-detection theory is used to formalize how the brain performs sensory inference in perceptual decisions, highlighting its utility in relating sensory uncertainties to perceptual outcomes."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Perceptual Uncertainty",
    "measured_by": "Variance of Gaussian Distribution",
    "justification": "The text specifies that perceptual uncertainty can be quantified by the variance of a Gaussian distribution, indicating higher uncertainty when a decision-maker considers a broader range of possible speeds, such as in estimating the speed of a car."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Economic Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Risk Measures (Variance of Outcome Distributions)",
    "justification": "The article explains that economic decision-making under risk can be measured using the variance of potential outcomes, where higher variance indicates greater uncertainty about the result."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Risk Attitudes in Economic Decisions",
    "measured_by": "Expectation-Based Approaches (Expected Utility Theory, Prospect Theory)",
    "justification": "The paper presents expectation-based approaches like expected utility theory and prospect theory as useful tools for modeling individual risk preferences and decisions about risky options."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Bayesian Inference in Economic Choices",
    "measured_by": "Learning Rate Adjustments",
    "justification": "Within the context of learning from experience, the article highlights that Bayesian inference approaches describe how uncertainty-dependent learning rates shape economic decision-making in changing or uncertain environments."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Shared Mechanisms in Decision-Making",
    "measured_by": "Neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG)",
    "justification": "The text mentions that neuroimaging techniques, particularly fMRI and EEG, were used to highlight shared and distinct neural mechanisms in perceptual and economic decision-making."
