    "justification": "The article discusses 'meta-d\u2019' as a model-based measure that assesses the sensitivity of the metacognitive judgements, indicating how closely related the confidence ratings are to the actual correctness of the choices. The value 'meta-d\u2019' measures this sensitivity directly, making it a tool to evaluate metacognitive sensitivity."

    "measured_by": "M-ratio",
    "justification": "The M-ratio is presented as a method to quantify metacognitive efficiency by adjusting for the underlying ease of the decision-making problem. It compares the metacognitive sensitivity measure (meta-d\u2019) with the type-1 sensitivity (d\u2019), thereby normalizing the sensitivity for the quality of inference, showcasing the efficiency of the metacognitive process."

    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive sensitivity",
    "measured_by": "Meta-I",
    "justification": "Meta-I is introduced as a measure of mutual information between the rectitude of the actor and the confidence ratings, which is a model-agnostic approach that quantifies the metacognitive sensitivity without relying on a specific model of type-1 choice, making it a suitable metric for assessing the relationship between confidence and accuracy."

    "topic_or_construct": "Metacognitive efficiency",
    "measured_by": "Meta-I r1 and Meta-I r2",
    "justification": "The ratios meta-I r1 and meta-I r2 are proposed as measures of metacognitive efficiency that normalize the mutual information (Meta-I) to account for the actor's performance or the entropy of accuracy, offering an evaluation of absolute efficiency without the dependency on the type-1 performance."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Confidence reporting granularity",
    "measured_by": "Different confidence bin levels",
    "justification": "The article explores the effect of varying the number of confidence rating levels (bins) on metacognitive measures. It demonstrates that increasing granularity can lead to higher meta-I and meta-I r measures, reflecting a finer discrimination between levels of confidence and thus a better assessment of metacognitive sensitivity and efficiency."
