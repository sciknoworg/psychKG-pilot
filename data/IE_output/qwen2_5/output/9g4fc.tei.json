    "measured_by": "Cloud height, visibility, likelihood of safe flight assessment",
    "justification": "The article reports that pilots exposed to a high anchor reported higher assessments of cloud height, visibility, and likelihood of safe flight compared to those exposed to a low anchor, indicating the anchoring and adjustment effect was being measured in these variables."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Bias: Confirmation Bias",
    "measured_by": "Choice of disconfirmatory vs. confirmatory evidence",
    "justification": "The study concluded that participants did not value disconfirmatory evidence over confirmatory evidence, using items phrased differently for disconfirmatory and confirmatory scenarios to measure this bias."

    "topic_or_construct": "Cognitive Bias: Outcome Bias",
    "measured_by": "Vicarious judgement of risk and vicarious assessment of risk",
    "justification": "The study found that participants exposed to negative outcomes assessed situations as worse and were less likely to conduct similar flights, while positive outcomes showed no effect, assessing situations as neutral, thus measuring outcome bias."
