    "justification": "The study used win-stay and lose-shift as measures to assess behavioural consistency following win and loss outcomes in win and loss maximization contexts, illustrating how these mechanisms predict performance consistency."

    "measured_by": "unsigned prediction error (UPE)",
    "justification": "The behavior disruption was linked to the relationship between expected and observed outcomes via the use of unsigned prediction error (UPE), supporting the hypothesis that failure's impact arises from unmet expectations rather than absolute negative outcome."

    "measured_by": "win maximization vs. loss maximization conditions",
    "justification": "The study manipulated participants' goals to intentionally maximize wins or losses, and the behavioral consistency was measured in these contexts, showing that performance disruption is context-dependent rather than intrinsic to failure."
