    "measured_by": "Race Implicit Association Test (IAT)",
    "justification": "The paper outlines the use of the Race Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure implicit racial preferences, stating that implicit measures predict behaviors like friendliness in interracial interactions, biases in medical decision-making, and hiring discrimination. The IAT examines differences in response times between compatible and incompatible phases, assessing indirect associations."

    "measured_by": "diffusion model analysis of IAT data",
    "justification": "The study employs diffusion models to analyze IAT data, extracting parameter v to reflect ease of decision-making. This parameter measures speed and accuracy during decision-making, reflecting the influence of associative memory content on the simplicity or difficulty of decisions, particularly in IATs involving racial associations."

    "topic_or_construct": "IAT parameter a (response caution)",
    "measured_by": "diffusion model analysis of IAT data",
    "justification": "The diffusion model is used to calculate parameter a, which describes the response caution in decision-making tasks. It quantifies the amount of information sampled before making a decision, indicating participants\u2019 choices between speed and accuracy during incompatible and compatible IAT trials."

    "topic_or_construct": "IAT parameter t0 (non-decision-related processes)",
    "measured_by": "diffusion model analysis of IAT data",
    "justification": "Parameter t0, derived from diffusion models applied to IAT data, measures non-decision-related processes such as stimuli encoding and motor responses. Changes in t0 help assess whether interventions affect processes outside the actual decision-making, independent of cognitive association alterations."
