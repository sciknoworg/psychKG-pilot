    "topic_or_construct": "overtrust",
    "measured_by": "VR indices of information foraging",
    "justification": "The VR system measures indices of information foraging, such as headset movement variability and eye tracking, which are used to explore potential determinants of overtrust."

    "topic_or_construct": "overtrust",
    "measured_by": "VR indices of threat-related autonomic arousal",
    "justification": "The VR system collects indices of threat-related autonomic arousal, including shifts in pupil dilation or grip strength, as potential determinants of overtrust."

    "topic_or_construct": "immersion",
    "measured_by": "participant self-reports",
    "justification": "Participants provide self-reports of their immersion levels on a 7-point Likert scale, which assesses how immersed they feel in the VR environment."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "trust",
    "measured_by": "willingness to trust the robot in future surveys",
    "justification": "Final surveys include ratings of the participants' willingness to trust the robot in the future, measured on a 7-point Likert scale."

    "topic_or_construct": "overtrust",
    "measured_by": "behavioral predictors",
    "justification": "Behavioral predictors of overtrust include percentage of time gazing at the robot, distance maintained to the robot, and exit looks, which are tracked and analyzed in the VR system."
