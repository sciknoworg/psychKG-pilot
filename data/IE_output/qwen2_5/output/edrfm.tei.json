    "measured_by": "Free Choice Paradigm",
    "justification": "The article discusses the free choice paradigm as a method used to study cognitive dissonance, where participants choose between two options of similar value and subsequently value their chosen option more highly. This paradigm has been consistently used to demonstrate how dissonance can lead to changes in beliefs and attitudes to justify past actions."

    "topic_or_construct": "Self-Perception Theory",
    "measured_by": "Observation of Own Behavior",
    "justification": "The text explains that self-perception theory suggests people infer their beliefs and desires by observing their own actions, as they lack introspective access to these underlying mental states. Experiments supporting this theory involve participants inferring preferences based on their choices, validating this measurement approach."

    "measured_by": "Bayesian Inference",
    "justification": "The paper describes how rationalization can be modeled as IRL, where Bayesian inference is used to infer beliefs and desires from observed actions. This method approximates rational inference to deduce underlying mental states that align actions with goals or objectives."

    "topic_or_construct": "Rationalization",
    "measured_by": "Thought Experiments",
    "justification": "The article suggests thought experiments as a cognitive mechanism where individuals use implicit intuitive knowledge to derive explicit theories. This parallels rationalization, as both aim to unpack implicit information into clearer, more usable representations."
