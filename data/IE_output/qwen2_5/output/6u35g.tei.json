    "measured_by": "response time",
    "justification": "The response times of participants, measured via the duration between the start of the video playback and the moment a decision key was pressed, provide insights into the cognitive dynamics of merging decisions. Shorter response times are associated with accept decisions, reflecting early evidence favoring the gap acceptance."

    "topic_or_construct": "visual attention distribution",
    "measured_by": "eye movements/relative dwell time on the mirror",
    "justification": "The total proportion of decision trial time spent looking at the side mirror, measured through eye tracking data, reveals correlations between attention allocation and merging decision outcomes. This helps to understand how drivers' visual focus on critical information influences their decision-making process."

    "topic_or_construct": "time pressure in merging decisions",
    "measured_by": "time-to-arrival of overtaking vehicle",
    "justification": "The time-to-arrival variable, measured as the time it takes for an oncoming vehicle to reach the participant\u2019s position, impacts response times and decision outcomes. Shorter TTAs lead to faster accept decisions due to increased perceived time pressure."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "gap acceptance likelihood",
    "measured_by": "duration of glances in the side mirror",
    "justification": "The duration of glances directed at the side mirror, measured through eye tracking data, is negatively associated with the probability of accepting the gap. This supports the hypothesis that different attention allocation patterns underlie different decision outcomes, especially under varying time pressure conditions."
