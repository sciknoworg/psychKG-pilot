<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory: Validating an Adapted Version of the Beads Task</head><p>Decision-making under uncertainty is a common experience in everyday life. There are many situations in which a person has to base a decision on only ambiguous evidence. In such situations, it is common for people to jump to conclusions, which may lead to false beliefs such as superstitious or conspiracy-related beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Georgiou et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kuhn et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sanchez &amp; Dunning, 2021)</ref>. For instance, a person could hear about a politician who has been accused of misconduct and immediately assume the politician's guilt or innocence without examining the evidence or considering alternative explanations. Such jumping to conclusions could also be directed against whole groups (e.g., refugees) and may result in prejudice. In these times of fake news and artificial intelligence, it is crucial for people to be more thoughtful about developing their beliefs and any corresponding behaviors.</p><p>The level of certainty a person needs to make a decision can be described as a decision threshold. More specifically, the decision threshold is the minimum probability an individual needs to feel confident enough to make a decision given the available information <ref type="bibr">(Moritz et al., 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Moritz et al.</ref> found that healthy individuals need between around 81% and 93% certainty to make a decision when confronted with probabilistic reasoning tasks <ref type="bibr">(Moritz et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moritz et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moritz et al, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moritz et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Veckenstedt et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>However, in these studies, the observed decision thresholds were based solely on subjective probabilities estimated by the participants, and they must therefore be deemed prone to error <ref type="bibr">(Moritz et al., 2007)</ref>. Moreover, the available studies have involved only adult participants and have focused on clinical settings. Whereas it has been shown that fostering more cautious decision-making in younger individuals (e.g., primary school children) is possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Stark et al., 2025)</ref>, measurement instruments that are sufficient for empirically determining decision thresholds specifically in children in the context of statistics education have yet to be developed.</p><p>With the present study, we aimed to validate a newly adapted version of the beads task <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dudley et al., 1997a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dudley et al., , 1997b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Garety et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huq et al., 1988)</ref>, namely, the decision threshold beads task (DTBT), which can determine primary school children's decision thresholds on the basis of objective probability values by using a signal detection analytical approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Green &amp; Swets, 1966)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of Jumping to Conclusions in Decision-Making</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Jumping to Conclusions Bias and Related Constructs</head><p>The concept of the decision threshold originates from research on the jumping to conclusions (JTC) bias. This cognitive bias is defined as making decisions based on a feeling of certainty, even though the available evidence is not strong enough to justify the decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Garety et al., 2005)</ref>. Previous research on the JTC bias has predominantly focused on clinical settings, especially in patients with schizophrenia (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Garety et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huq et al., 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Meta-analytical evidence has consistently revealed that the JTC bias is positively related to delusional beliefs in patients with schizophrenia (g = 0.53, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dudley et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">g = 0.28, McLean et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">r = .10, Ross et al., 2015)</ref>. However, the JTC bias is not limited to clinical populations; in fact, it has also been found in nonclinical groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Freeman et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ross et al., 2015)</ref> and has been found to be associated with superstitious or conspiracy-related beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Georgiou et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kuhn et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sanchez &amp; Dunning, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Although the JTC bias has been studied broadly, research has yet to identify the factors that contribute to its development. There are several factors that have been found to be related to the JTC bias or for which it makes theoretical sense for them to be connected to it in young children in the context of statistics education. We address some of these cognitive biases, cognitive outcome variables, motivational constructs, and demographic variables next.</p><p>Cognitive biases such as the JTC bias can be viewed as misunderstandings of statistical concepts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ben-Zvi &amp; Garfield, 2008)</ref>, with the JTC bias being a manifestation of the failure to account for variability. Interestingly, <ref type="bibr">Moritz et al. (2016)</ref> even stated that "patients [with schizophrenia] may reason like 'bad statisticians'" (p. 93), implying that the JTC bias may arise from an inadequate understanding of a situation's statistical properties. Other cognitive biases are related to the JTC bias, perhaps because they also represent misunderstandings of statistical concepts. For instance, there is evidence that the JTC bias is related to the bias against disconfirming evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Balzan et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">McLean et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moritz et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Veckenstedt et al., 2011)</ref>. Therefore, it might also be connected to other biases such as the confirmation bias and the alternation bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1971)</ref>. Whereas the JTC bias results in quick, often unfounded conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fine et al., 2007)</ref>, the confirmation bias and the bias against disconfirming evidence help sustain these conclusions by selectively focusing on information that supports them <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Balzan et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gagliardi, 2023)</ref>. The alternation bias describes a person's tendency to expect more alternations between random events than probability laws imply <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1971)</ref>. Just like the JTC bias, the alternation bias might be related to a person's understanding of the concept of variability. This view that cognitive biases such as the JTC bias are related to misunderstandings of statistical concepts found support from a study in which an extracurricular intervention for primary school children in the context of statistics education significantly reduced the JTC bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Stark et al., 2025)</ref>.</p><p>The JTC bias can also be viewed as overconfidence when insufficient evidence is given.</p><p>Young children show a strong tendency to be overconfident (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lipko et al., 2009)</ref> and frequently overestimate their own performances <ref type="bibr">(Finn &amp; Metacalfe, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Goecke et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, the JTC bias might be stronger in younger age groups and lower grade levels. Also, younger children tend to see knowledge as certain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Conley et al., 2004)</ref>. Thus, the JTC bias might also be related to less sophisticated epistemic certainty beliefs.</p><p>Another potential factor contributing to the JTC bias is intelligence, as there is evidence that IQ is negatively associated with the JTC bias in both adults (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Freeman et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ross et al., 2016)</ref> and children <ref type="bibr">(Gregersen et al., 2022)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Similarly, McLean et al. (2020)</ref> found that individuals who are better at understanding and using odds are less likely to jump to conclusions. Furthermore, mathematics competency is related to higher statistical literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lai et al., 2011)</ref>. As the JTC bias can be viewed as a misunderstanding of statistical concepts, this bias might also be related to lower mathematics competency. This relationship could imply that individuals who tend to jump to conclusions might lack the mathematical knowledge needed to process and interpret probabilities effectively.</p><p>The fact that Möller et al. <ref type="formula">2020</ref>showed a link between self-concept in mathematics and achievement raises the question of whether a similar relationship exists between selfconcept in data-related tasks and the JTC bias. Whereas there is no direct support for this idea yet, it warrants investigation because higher confidence in one's own conclusions could be related to a higher JTC bias. Interestingly, <ref type="bibr">Moritz et al. (2020)</ref> found no significant correlation between the JTC bias and general self-esteem, suggesting that the bias might not be related to broad self-concept measures. Thus, it is possible that the JTC bias is more closely connected to domain-specific motivational constructs, such as statistics-related self-concept, which could offer an important direction for future research.</p><p>Lastly, there is conflicting evidence on whether there are gender differences in overconfidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bandiera et al., 2022)</ref>. To our knowledge, no research has specifically focused on gender and the JTC bias. Thus, whether there is a relationship between the two remains unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measuring the JTC Bias</head><p>The beads task <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dudley et al., 1997a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dudley et al., , 1997b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Garety et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huq et al., 1988</ref>) is widely used for measuring the JTC bias. In this probabilistic reasoning task, participants draw beads from one of two jars with different proportions of colored beads without knowing which jar they are drawing from. For example, one jar may contain 85 orange and 15 black beads, whereas the other jar contains 15 orange and 85 black beads. After each bead is drawn, participants have to decide whether they are certain enough to identify which of the two jars the beads were drawn from-or they can draw an additional bead. If they decide to draw an additional bead, the previously drawn bead is returned to the jar. They can draw up to 20 beads.</p><p>Although the sequence of the beads is described as random to the participants as a cover story, it is held constant across participants. The most commonly used metric in this task is called draws to decision (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Garety et al., 2005)</ref>, which refers to the number of beads a person draws before deciding. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Garety et al. (2005)</ref> interpreted a higher number of draws to decision as a more cautious decision-making process. Even though the beads task has proven useful for researching the JTC bias, it has several shortcomings. First, the JTC bias is often assessed with only a single item, which can lead to low reliability estimates <ref type="bibr">(Moritz et al., 2012)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Moritz et al. (2013</ref><ref type="bibr">Moritz et al. ( , 2017</ref> found that the 4-week test-retest reliability of the classical beads task amounted to only r = .20.</p><p>Second, more draws to decision do not always indicate a higher probability of being correct.</p><p>For instance, three orange beads provide stronger evidence for the predominantly orange jar than three orange beads and one black bead. Finally, whereas more draws to decision are typically seen as indicating more cautious and desirable decision-making, there is also the risk that excessive draws reflect an overly cautious, inefficient decision process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Decision Threshold.</head><p>To address the shortcomings of the beads task in measuring the JTC bias, <ref type="bibr">Moritz et al. (2006)</ref> introduced the decision threshold. The decision threshold is the minimum probability required for a person to feel confident enough to make a decision in a probabilistic reasoning task. For instance, a person with a decision threshold of 95% would accept hypotheses as true only when they perceived at least a 95% certainty that it was true. As the JTC bias has mostly been studied in adult patients and not in children, we present findings from the adult patient group below. In their study, <ref type="bibr">Moritz et al. (2006)</ref> presented 20 multiple-choice knowledge questions with four response alternatives in the style of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire television game show to 32 patients with schizophrenia and 38 healthy controls. For each question, participants were asked to rate the plausibility of each possible answer with values ranging from 0% to 100% (in steps of 10%). Participants were also given the option to rate the answer alternatives as true or false. <ref type="bibr">Moritz et al. (2006)</ref> found that patients with schizophrenia rated response alternatives as true based on significantly lower probability ratings (85.9%) than healthy controls did (92.7%). Consecutive studies also found confirming evidence of a lower decision threshold in patients with schizophrenia (71% -85%) than healthy controls (81% -93%; <ref type="bibr">Moritz et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moritz et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moritz et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Veckenstedt et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, the authors concluded that a lower decision threshold speaks of a more pronounced liberal acceptance of hypotheses. However, these estimates of the decision threshold always relied on the participants' subjectively rated probability values. These subjective estimations have been found to underestimate the objective probabilities in the beads task <ref type="bibr">(Moritz et al., 2007)</ref>. Using objective probability values could make the measurements of the decision threshold more accurate. To do so, in this study, we expanded the conventional beads task to derive decision thresholds using a signal detection analytical approach. In this approach, multiple items with different objective probability values can be used to determine the threshold below which a person does not make a decision but above which they do make a decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expanding the Beads Task: The Decision Threshold Beads Task.</head><p>To our knowledge, no studies have measured the decision threshold in children.</p><p>However, this age group is particularly relevant for studying the development of decisionmaking processes and the JTC bias at an early stage. As the JTC bias is related to superstitious beliefs, conspiracy-related beliefs, and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dudley et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Georgiou et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kuhn et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">McLean et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ross et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sanchez &amp; Dunning, 2021)</ref>, studying the decision threshold in children may provide information on the development of the JTC bias and could add to knowledge of how to design early interventions to reduce the JTC bias. Such interventions have been called for <ref type="bibr">(Gregersen et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>For the present study, we adapted the beads task <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dudley et al., 1997a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dudley et al., , 1997b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Garety et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huq et al., 1988)</ref> to measure the decision threshold with objective probabilities that were specifically tailored for primary school children. We named it the decision threshold beads task (DTBT). As in the original beads task, children have to decide whether a certain collection of beads have been drawn from one of two jars. Instead of letting the participants draw the beads themselves, we present items in which fictional participants already drew a certain number of beads. By doing so, we could control the probabilities for each item.</p><p>We used van der Leer et al.'s (2015) formula to calculate the probabilities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Pr((n , n )|A) = 1 1 + − , where = 1 − &gt; 1 (1)</formula><p>In this formula, the probability of jar A is calculated as depending on the number of beads with the more common color in that jar (na), the number of beads with the less common color in that jar (nb), and the probability of drawing a bead with the more common color in that jar (p). In this way, we could calculate the probabilities for the more probable jar for all items.</p><p>When choosing the more probable jar, the probabilities of being right ranged from 50% to 99.9%. For instance, for Item 1, the probability of being right is 85%; for Item 7, it is 99.5%;</p><p>and for Item 12, it is 70%. By having many different items with different probabilities, we could use a signal detection analytical approach to assess each individual's decision threshold.</p><p>Signal detection theory (SDT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Green &amp; Swets, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Stanislaw &amp; Todorov, 1999</ref>) is a</p><p>framework that is used to analyze decision-making under uncertainty. It distinguishes between a signal (a meaningful stimulus) and noise (random background stimuli) and helps determine the ability to detect signals amidst noise. In our case, the signal is the certainty of having identified the correct jar. The stronger the evidence (probability) of being right, the stronger the signal. With the help of SDT, we can then calculate the response bias, which is the tendency to lean toward seeing the signal as present or absent. In our case, we need to calculate the decision threshold, which describes the probability that needs to be met for a person to be confident enough to make a decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims of The Present Study</head><p>In the present study, we evaluated the adapted version of the beads task (i.e., the DTBT)</p><p>to measure the decision threshold. As current measurement instruments of the decision threshold rely on subjective probabilities, we wanted to add an approach that relied on objective probabilities to determine decision thresholds to develop a more accurate measurement instrument, using the beads task as the basis.</p><p>For Research Question 1, we first investigated whether our new measurement instrument was suitable for measuring decision thresholds in primary school children. To this end, we tested the accuracy of the measurement instrument by using an SDT approach.</p><p>Additionally, we checked whether the resulting values of the decision threshold were plausible by comparing them with the range we expected them to be in and by checking overall whether higher objective probabilities resulted in more decision-making.</p><p>For Research Question 2, we examined the construct validity of the decision threshold.</p><p>We investigated the correlations with the measure of draws to decision. The decision threshold should be positively related to draws to decision, as they are both indicators of the JTC bias.</p><p>We expected partial convergence between the two constructs because they both assess the JTC bias but from different perspectives. Therefore, their correlation should be between .40 and .70 <ref type="bibr">(Carlson &amp; Herdman, 2012)</ref>. Additionally, we investigated the correlations with other related constructs. We expected the decision threshold to be related to other variables to a similar but not identical degree to what previous research found for their relationships with the JTC bias.</p><p>For variables that have not yet been research in connection to the JTC bias, we expected them to be related to the decision threshold as argued in the theoretical background. More specifically, we expected that the decision threshold would be negatively related to the confirmation bias and the alternation bias. We expected that the decision threshold would be positively related to more sophisticated epistemic certainty beliefs, math grade, self-concept in data-related tasks, age, and grade level. Finally, we did not expect the decision threshold to be correlated with general self-efficacy or gender.</p><p>The research objectives of the present study were not preregistered.

In each item, children saw two different jars: one with 85 orange beads and 15 black beads and one with 15 orange beads and 85 black beads (or 60:40 and 40:60 respectively;</p><p>for an example item, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Garety et al., 2011)</ref>. They were told that one of the two jars was chosen at random and that beads were then drawn at random with replacement from that jar. The order of the beads was predetermined. After each draw, the children could decide whether they wanted to see another bead or if they already knew which jar the beads were drawn from. All drawn beads were visible at any time to aid memory. Draws to decision was then used as the outcome measure. Fewer draws suggest a greater JTC bias. We created a mean value for each participant. Additionally, we calculated the correlation between the two items to judge the beads task's reliability (r = .56, p &lt; .001; α = .72).</p><p>Decision Threshold Beads Task. We adapted the original beads task <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dudley et al., 1997a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dudley et al., , 1997b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Garety et al., 2005)</ref> to assess the decision threshold on the basis of objective probabilities with a signal detection analytical approach. We developed three sets of eight items each. In each set, two jars with different ratios of beads (85:15 and 15:85; 70:30 and 30:70; 60:40 and 40:60) were shown (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). The participants were told that each child from a group of children randomly drew beads from one of the jars. Each item varied in how many beads were drawn and which proportion of colors they had, resulting in different probabilities of being right for each item. For each item, the participating children had to decide whether they were sure enough that they could say which jar the beads were drawn from and indicate that jar or whether they were not sure enough. There were no incentives to make the children's behavior tend toward deciding or not deciding. Therefore, the instrument measures the decision threshold on the basis of the children's personal reasons for making the decisions. For example, for the first item, Alex drew one black bead, resulting in an 85% probability for the mainly black jar being right. For the fifth item, Erik drew three black beads. The probability that the beads were drawn from the primarily black jar was 99.5%. Therefore, a person with a 95% decision threshold should not be certain enough for the first item to decide which jar the bead came from, whereas they should be certain enough for the fifth item to choose the primarily black jar. Further information on the calculation of the decision threshold is presented in the results section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Sample Items From the Decision Threshold Beads Task Confirmation Bias. We assessed children's confirmation bias with six items from a selfassessment questionnaire (e.g., "My first impression usually seems to be correct"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rassin, 2008)</ref>. The items were rated on a scale ranging from 1 (that's not true at all) to 5 (that's exactly true). Internal consistency was low (α = .50).</p><p>Alternation Bias. We assessed the alternation bias with a self-developed instrument.</p><p>Participants were told to create three sequences of 20 coin-throw results that looked random to them. Therefore, values could range from 0 (no alternations) to 19 (only alternations). For example, the sequence HTTTHTHHHTHTHTHTTHHT has 13 alternations. The closer the children were to a mean value of 9.5 alternations across all three items, the lower the alternation bias. Internal consistency was low (α = .52).</p><p>Epistemic Certainty Beliefs. We assessed children's epistemic certainty beliefs with nine adapted items (e.g., "If you have found something out, it is certainly true"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Conley et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Urhahne &amp; Hopf, 2004)</ref>. The items were rated on a scale ranging from 1 (that's not true at all) to 5 (that's exactly true). Internal consistency was low (α = .52).</p><p>Self-Reported Mathematics Grade. Math performance was assessed by asking the participants "What grade did you get in math on your last report card?" Answer options ranged from 1 (the highest grade) to 6 (the lowest grade). For ease of interpretation, grades were reverse-scored so that higher grades represented higher levels of achievement. Also, it was possible to select "I haven't yet gotten a math grade" or "I don't know anymore," both of which were coded as missing.</p><p>Self-Concept in Data-Related Tasks. We assessed children's domain-specific selfconcept with six items (e.g., "Anything that has to do with data is easy for me"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arens et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gaspard et al., 2015)</ref>. The items were rated on a scale ranging from 1 (that's not true at all) to 5 (that's exactly true). Internal consistency was low (α = .47).</p><p>General Self-Efficacy. We assessed general self-efficacy with the short form of the selfefficacy scale from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beierlein et al. (2012)</ref>. In three items, children were asked to rate statements (e.g., "I can rely on my skills in difficult situations") on a scale ranging from 1 (that's not true at all) to 5 (that's exactly true). Internal consistency was acceptable (α = .65).</p><p>Descriptive statistics for all variables are presented in <ref type="table">Table SM1 in the Supplementary</ref> Material on the OSF (https://osf.io/b6kfj/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head><p>All analyses were computed in R (version 4.4.1, R Core Team, 2024). As a first analysis, we calculated the descriptive statistics for all DTBT items.</p><p>For Research Question 1, we calculated the decision threshold using a signal detection analytical approach with the psycho package <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Makowski, 2018)</ref>. We determined hits, false alarms, misses, and correct rejections on the basis of whether the children decided on a jar or were not sure enough and whether the objective probability was below or above the mean of all items' objective probabilities (79.5%). For example, choosing the correct jar on an item with a probability of 85% would be a hit, whereas not deciding or choosing the wrong jar would be a miss. To compute the response bias c, we used the following formula by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Macmillan (1993)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= −1 * ϕ −1 (H) + ϕ −1 (F) 2 (2)</formula><p>In this formula, the inverse phi function (ϕ −1 ) converts probabilities into z scores.</p><p>Therefore, the z score for the hit rate and the z score for the false alarm rate are added up and averaged by dividing the sum by 2. Then this average is multiplied by -1, so negative values of c reflect a bias toward deciding early and positive values reflect a bias toward not deciding. To calculate the decision threshold (dt), we multiplied the response bias (c) by the standard deviation of all items' objective probabilities (17.4%) and added this product to the mean probability (79.5%). This approach ensures that dt integrates both the individual's tendency to decide early or late (as captured by c) and the variability in the objective probabilities of the items (standard deviation). The mean anchors the threshold in the central tendency of the distribution, whereas the standard deviation scales the bias to account for the spread of the probabilities. This combination provides a context-sensitive threshold that reflects both the individual's response tendencies and the characteristics of the decision environment:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= * 0.174 + 0.795 (3)</formula><p>Additionally, we calculated the decision threshold using a range of cut-off values rather than relying solely on the mean probability (79.5%). This approach was taken to examine whether the calculated decision threshold values depended on the placement of the cut-off value separating signal and noise trials. By systematically varying the cut-off values from 55%</p><p>to 95% in increments of 5%, we aimed to test the sensitivity of the decision threshold to different cut-off values for signal versus noise. This approach allowed us to account for the possibility that the specific choice of a cut-off value (e.g., the mean) might introduce bias or limit generalizability, as the distribution of probabilities in the data set might interact with the decision-making process differently at various cut-off values.</p><p>Furthermore, to follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Paulhus and Petrusic's (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Goecke et al.'s (2022)</ref> approach, we calculated an aggregated mean decision threshold across all these decision threshold values to derive a more robust and stable estimate of the decision threshold. This robust estimate minimizes the potential for the impact of any individual threshold value to skew the results and reflects an averaged, context-independent decision threshold. To maintain the interpretability and validity of the decision threshold values, any resulting values exceeding 100% (which are not feasible probabilities) were capped at 100%. This capping ensured that all values would remain within the meaningful probability range. Lastly, there were no missing values in the calculation of the DTBT, ensuring the completeness and reliability of the data.</p><p>To evaluate whether the DTBT accurately measured the decision threshold, we analyzed its performance using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Stanislaw &amp; Todorov, 1999)</ref>. ROC analysis is a standard method in SDT that illustrates the trade-off between sensitivity (the ability to correctly identify true positives) and specificity (the ability to correctly reject false positives) across a range of decision thresholds. By plotting the hit rate (proportion of correct decisions in signal trials) against the false alarm rate (proportion of incorrect decisions in noise trials) for different cut-off values, we gained insight into how effectively the DTBT is able to discriminate between true signals and noise.</p><p>To summarize the discriminative accuracy of the DTBT, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curves. The AUC is a robust and widely accepted measure that captures the overall performance of a decision-making tool. AUC values range from 0.5 (indicating chance-level discrimination, equivalent to random guessing) to 1.0 (indicating perfect discrimination). This metric provides a single, interpretable score that reflects the DTBT's ability to differentiate between trials with true signals and noise trials, offering a quantitative evaluation of its accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Stanislaw &amp; Todorov, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, to assess the plausibility of the children's responses, we examined whether the range of values produced by the DTBT was realistic and consistent with expectations (i.e., between around 50% to 100%). We also calculated the correlation between the objective probability of each item and the percentage of children who were confident enough to make a decision. This correlation provided further validation by testing whether the children's decisions were aligned with the probabilistic structure of the items, thereby supporting the plausibility and validity of the DTBT as a measure of decision thresholds.</p><p>For Research Question 2, we wanted to assess the relationships between the decision threshold, draws to decision, and additional variables to assess construct validity. Therefore, we calculated Pearson's correlations between all variables with the R package Hmisc <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Harrell, 2024)</ref>. Because there were missing values on most variables, we calculated pairwise complete correlations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> presents descriptive statistics for all DTBT items. The mean value describes the percentage of children who were certain enough to choose the more probable jar (1) and how many were not able to decide or chose the less probable jar (0). The correlation between the mean value and the objective probability was r = .86 (95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.71, .94]</ref>, p &lt; .001). This finding indicates that the children's decisions were plausible and rational, that is, as the objective probability increased, so did their certainty in deciding. Note. All items were answered by all N = 299 children.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision Threshold Distributions</head><p>The goal of this analysis was to examine whether the calculation of decision thresholds depended on the specific cut-off values used to separate hits and false alarms from misses and correct rejections. The challenge arises because the placement of this cut-off value, such as using the mean of all items' objective probabilities (79.5%), may influence the resulting decision thresholds, potentially introducing bias or limiting the generalizability of the findings.</p><p>To address this issue, we calculated decision thresholds using multiple cut-off values to test the robustness of the DTBT. Specifically, we first calculated one decision threshold using the mean of all objective probabilities (79.5%) as the dividing line. Additionally, we calculated nine more decision thresholds using cut-off values ranging from 55% to 95% in increments of 5%. This approach allowed us to assess how different placements of the signal-noise threshold affected the resulting decision thresholds. Finally, to create a robust overall estimate, we calculated the mean decision threshold across these values by employing the method used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Paulhus and Petrusic (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Goecke et al. (2022)</ref>. By analyzing these distributions (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>), we could better understand the results of the decision thresholds across varying cutoff values. This step ensured that our conclusions were not overly dependent on the arbitrary choice of a single cut-off value and thereby provided a comprehensive and nuanced assessment of the decision threshold.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Histograms of Decision Thresholds Based on Cut-Off Values Between Signal and Noise</head><p>Note. dt_795 describes the decision threshold with a cut-off value of 79.5%. dt_55 to dt_95 describe the decision thresholds with cut-off values from 55% to 95%. dt_m describes the mean decision threshold for all nine decision thresholds with cut-off values from 55% to 95%.</p><p>The decision thresholds exhibited strong correlations with one another, with all correlation coefficients exceeding .85 (see the Supplementary Materials <ref type="figure">Figure SM2</ref>, https://osf.io/b6kfj/). Thus, the primary differences between these thresholds lie in the range of values they represent. As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the distributions of the decision thresholds varied considerably. For instance, the distribution of the decision threshold set at the cut-off value of 55% shows a range of values spanning from approximately 20% to 80%. These values are implausible given that the objective probabilities for all items ranged from 50% to 99.9%.</p><p>By contrast, the mean decision threshold provides more reasonable results, with values ranging from just below 50% to 100%. Consequently, we opted for the mean decision threshold as our final metric, as it can be assumed to yield more robust results (M = 67.02%, SD = 10.47%; similar to <ref type="bibr">Goecke et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Paulhus &amp; Petrusic, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ROC Curve Analysis</head><p>To assess the accuracy of the measurement instrument, we analyzed ROC curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Stanislaw &amp; Todorov, 1999)</ref>. To do so, the hit rate is plotted against the false alarm rate, and the AUC is calculated to judge the instrument's accuracy. We calculated the AUC for all possible cut-off values set from 50% to 99% in steps of 1% (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>. It is desirable to find consistent results across all different item thresholds with AUCs close to 1.00. All AUCs ranged from .84 to 1.00. Because these values can vary between .50 (chance level) and 1.00 (perfect accuracy; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Stanislaw &amp; Todorov, 1999)</ref>, the accuracy of the DTBT was consistently high, independent of which cut-off value was chosen. Thus, our instrument measured the decision threshold with high accuracy.</p></div>

As expected, the decision threshold and draws to decision were correlated between .40 and .70 (r = .51, p &lt; .001) and therefore showed partial convergence <ref type="bibr">(Carlson &amp; Herdman, 2012)</ref>. This finding endorses the assumption that the two instruments measure a similar construct from different perspectives. As expected, confirmation bias was negatively associated with the decision threshold (r = -.24, p &lt; .001) and draws to decision (r = -.14, p = .013). Therefore, children with a higher confirmation bias have a lower decision threshold and fewer draws to decision.</p><p>Interestingly, we found a significant positive correlation between the decision threshold and math grade (r = .19, p = .009) but not between draws to decision and math grade (r = .03, p = .692). These findings indicate that children with better math grades have a higher decision threshold but do not differ in their draws to decision.</p><p>Age and grade level were also positively correlated with the decision threshold (r = .20, p &lt; .001; r = .17, p = .003) and draws to decision (r = 0.26, p &lt; .001; r = 0.27, p &lt; .001),</p><p>respectively. In line with our expectations, these findings suggest that older students and those in higher grades tend to take more draws to reach a decision and have a higher decision threshold.</p><p>There were no more significant relationships with the decision threshold or draws to decision, indicating that students with different levels of the alternation bias, epistemic certainty beliefs, self-concept in data-related tasks, general self-efficacy, or gender did not differ in their decision thresholds or draws to decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>With the present study, we aimed to introduce and validate a newly adapted measurement instrument for assessing the decision threshold by using objective probability values and signal detection theory with primary school children. The accuracy of the measurement instrument was demonstrated by the AUCs of the ROC curves, which were high with values between .84 and 1.00. Also, the resulting decision threshold values were plausible in their range and in the fact that we found more decision-making for items with higher certainty. The construct validity of the new task was largely demonstrated. As expected, it was positively correlated with the beads task with an effect size between .40 and .70 and therefore demonstrated partial convergence <ref type="bibr">(Carlson &amp; Herdman, 2012)</ref>. Moreover, the decision threshold was significantly positively associated with age, grade level, and math grade and significantly negatively associated with confirmation bias. It was not associated with self-concept in data-related tasks, general self-efficacy, epistemic certainty beliefs, alternation bias, or gender.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision Threshold Beads Task Versus Original Beads Task</head><p>There are some similarities between the DTBT and the original beads task, but there are also clear differences. Both instruments revealed that the children in this study were rather liberal in their acceptance of hypotheses. The DTBT measured a mean decision threshold of M = 67.02% for all participating children, a level that is far below what healthy adults show (81% -93%, <ref type="bibr">Moritz et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moritz et al, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moritz et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Veckenstedt et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>The original beads task measured a mean of M = 5.32 draws to decision in the participating children. This finding is similar to the lower end of healthy adult populations that have shown between 2.60 and 11.19 draws to decision (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Garety et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huq et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">So &amp; Kwok, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ward et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The DTBT might be more reliable than the original beads task because the DTBT is assessed with 24 items instead of only two items or, in many cases, only one item <ref type="bibr">(Moritz et al., 2012)</ref>. In a previous study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Moritz et al. (2013</ref><ref type="bibr">Moritz et al. ( , 2017</ref> found a 4-week test-retest reliability for the classical beads task of only r = .20. However, the test-retest reliability of the DTBT has yet to be determined and should be a topic of future research.</p><p>The draws to decision measure from the original beads task can be used to show the JTC bias when participants draw only one or a few beads. More draws to decision are usually considered to reflect a smaller JTC bias. However, there is no clear rule on when participants might be too cautious. The decision threshold from the DTBT can be interpreted more easily, as the certainty needed is depicted as a probability value. From the perspective of science, a decision threshold of 95% might be appropriate, as the common alpha level is 5%. However, the ability to determine which probability values are appropriate might depend on the situation and the person. In some situations, people might have more pressure to make a decision, for instance, when there is time pressure. Or they may already have a strong opinion on a topic and may thereby make their decision even when the current evidence suggests more caution. This might be the case when delusional conviction or conspiracy-related beliefs are involved. Future research should investigate which decision thresholds are appropriate or healthy in different situations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct Validity</head><p>We found a correlation between the decision threshold and the draws to decision measure. This association was expected because both measures are indicators of the JTC bias.</p><p>The measures shared around 25% of their variance. This finding shows that the measures are related but also capture distinct aspects of the construct they were designed to measure.</p><p>We expected positive relationships between the decision threshold and other cognitive biases, as cognitive biases can be viewed as misunderstandings of statistical concepts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ben-Zvi &amp; Garfield, 2008)</ref>. As expected, the confirmation bias was significantly correlated with the decision threshold and draws to decision. This association seems theoretically logical because the confirmation bias and the JTC bias both reflect overconfidence in one's own judgment. This finding is also in line with the previous finding that the JTC bias is related to the bias against disconfirming evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Balzan et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">McLean et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moritz et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Veckenstedt et al., 2011)</ref>. Whereas the JTC bias reflects an underestimation of variability, the confirmation bias reflects the cherry-picking of data points to reduce variability in favor of pre-existing beliefs. However, the alternation bias was not significantly related to the decision threshold or draws to decision. This bias reflects the expectation of certain patterns in the variability of random data. Thus, not all cognitive biases in this study can be linked to the understanding of variability in the same way. However, the alternation bias might not be connected to other variables because of the low internal consistency of the measurement instrument we developed.</p><p>Next, we expected positive relationships between the decision threshold and cognitive outcome variables. There were no significant relationships with epistemic certainty beliefs, even though more sophisticated epistemic certainty beliefs are described by lower beliefs in the certainty of knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Conley et al., 2004)</ref>. Therefore, we expected a positive relationship with the decision threshold. Maybe epistemic certainty beliefs were not assessed validly, as their internal consistency was rather low. However, a higher decision threshold was associated with better math grades. A previous study had already found a connection between people's ability to understand and use odds and draws to decision <ref type="bibr">(McLean et al., 2020)</ref>, and mathematical competency is positively connected to statistical literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lai et al., 2011)</ref>. Also, in a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Stark et al., 2025)</ref>, we found that an extracurricular statistics intervention enhanced talented third-and fourth-graders' draws to decision. Hence, future studies should investigate how the understanding of certain statistical concepts (e.g., the law of large numbers)</p><p>is linked to the decision threshold.</p><p>We expected the decision threshold to be positively related to self-concept in datarelated tasks but not to general self-efficacy. However, both of these relationships were nonsignificant. Therefore, the decision threshold is not related to these motivational beliefs.</p><p>We expected that self-concept in data-related tasks would be related to the decision threshold, as performance and motivation in a domain are usually correlated <ref type="bibr">(Möller et al., 2020)</ref>. Thus, the decision threshold might not be a good indicator of performance in the domain of statistics.</p><p>Alternatively, the way self-concept was measured might not have been accurate, as it showed weak reliability, which could mean that the children did not fully understand what data-related tasks involve. Nonetheless, general self-efficacy was not related to the decision threshold as expected because a previous study showed no link between the JTC bias and self-esteem <ref type="bibr">(Moritz et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Lastly, we expected the decision threshold to be related to age and grade level, and we explored its relationship with gender. As age and grade level were positively correlated with the decision threshold, we can conclude that the decision threshold increases during the years children spend in primary school. However, our study was cross-sectional, and evidence from longitudinal studies is needed to support our conclusion. In addition, no significant relationship was found between the decision threshold and gender. This lack of association supports the idea that there are no gender differences in how the decision threshold was assessed or in the decision threshold itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and Limitations</head><p>As a first strength, this study extends the understanding of the decision threshold to children. Previous research has focused primarily on adult populations. But it is essential to study children in order to understand how the JTC bias develops and to determine how to implement early interventions, a need highlighted by <ref type="bibr">Gregersen et al. (2022)</ref>.</p><p>Second, our sample of N = 299 primary school children was relatively large and included participants with diverse backgrounds. However, these children were also all from an extracurricular enrichment program for talented primary school children in Germany, thereby limiting the generalizability of the findings to other age groups and children with different abilities or from different educational and cultural settings. Whereas the task was designed for children, future research could explore its applicability to other populations, such as adolescents and adults.</p><p>Third, using SDT <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Green &amp; Swets, 1966)</ref> in this study provided an objective framework for measuring decision-making under uncertainty, and such a framework is essential for accurately assessing the decision threshold in primary school children. Unlike previous approaches that relied on subjective probability estimates, this SDT approach takes objective probability measures into account, potentially enhancing the reliability and validity of the findings. However, the objective probabilities ranged only from 50% to 99.9%. It might be possible that some people's decision thresholds are so far below 50% that the instrument cannot detect them. Nevertheless, in the context of the beads task and when choosing between two possible options, the range from 50% to 99% was plausible.</p><p>Fourth, we used a wide range of variables and assessed their relationships with the decision threshold. This approach offered the opportunity to explore the nomological net around the decision threshold. However, several related constructs (confirmation bias, alternation bias, and epistemic certainty beliefs) exhibited low internal consistencies, thus limiting the reliability of these measures and potentially affecting the validity of the conclusions drawn about their relationships with the decision threshold. Also, it would have been useful to assess additional constructs, such as superstitious, conspiracy-related, and delusional beliefs, which have previously been found to be related to the decision threshold and the JTC bias (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Georgiou et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kuhn et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moritz et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sanchez &amp; Dunning, 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this study, we introduced and validated a new measurement instrument-the DTBT-for assessing the decision threshold in primary school children. It demonstrated strong accuracy and meaningful correlations with key variables. By employing SDT and using objective probabilities as a basis, the DTBT offers a reliable and innovative approach to understanding decision-making processes and the early development of the JTC bias. Whereas limitations such as limited generalizability and low internal consistencies in some constructs remain, they present valuable opportunities for refinement and future research to enhance educational and psychological applications.</p></div>

Children were recruited via the program's online learning platform, where children could access various educational activities. To incentivize participation, the children were informed they could win one of 15 card games valued at around 10€ each. The survey began with a child-friendly introduction. In the story, the website's mascot Hasel went to a friend's house and found a note saying that their friend had gone to the forest and Hasel could join them. By assessing the numbers of hazelnuts and walnuts left behind by the friend, Hasel had to answer the question of whether he had enough information to decide whether his friend had gone to the forest with more hazelnut trees or the one with more walnut trees. This problemintroduced the children to the topic of decision-making under uncertainty. Data collection took place from December 12, 2022, to January 13, 2023. A total of N = 299 children from first to fourth grade voluntarily participated in the study with informed consent from a parent or legal guardian. The sample included children from diverse backgrounds, representing different age groups (M = 8.69; SD = 1.04; Range: 6.30-12.13), grade levels (nfirst = 12; nsecond = 112; nthird = 92, nfourth = 76; nmissing = 7), gender groups (55.18%boys, 44.48% girls; 0.33% missing), and mother tongues (83.61% only German; 11.37%</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
