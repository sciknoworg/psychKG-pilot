			<abstract>
				<p>The present study examined the role of aging in participants between 18 and 87years of age on open-mindedness in the Actively Open-minded Thinking (AOT) scale and the Actively Open-minded Thinking about Evidence (AOT-E) scale. Method: The amalgamated data from 12 Amazon Mechanical Turk™ studies was analysed. This included a total of 9010 participants (age: M = 37.30, SD = 14.13 / sex: 4191 males, 4734 females and 85 who did not wish to state their sex). All participants completed the 7-item Actively Open-minded Thinking (AOT) scale, of these participants four-hundred and ninetyone also completed the 8-item Actively Open-minded Thinking about Evidence (AOT-E) scale (age: M = 33.27, SD = 5.78 / sex: 2317 males, 2512 females and 62 who did not wish to state their sex). Results: AOT score positively correlated with AOT-E score (r = 0.27). Age negatively correlated with AOT score (r =-0.11) and AOT-E score (r =-0.13). There was a statistical difference in AOT score between the age ranges of participants (18-28, 29-38, 39-48, 49-58, 59-68 and 69-87 years of age). There was also a difference in AOT-E score between the age ranges of participants too. Discussion: The results showed that open-mindedness as measured by the AOT and AOT-E decreased as a function of aging. In an aging population were more adults work into later age the decrease in open-mindedness could influence many areas of judgments of decision-making.</p>

For most babies born in the 21 st century life expectancies are projected to increase from approximately 80-years of age to around 100-years of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mata et al., 2011)</ref>. These rising life expectancies will likely cause an increase in longer working lives with a greater need for decision-making under uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Peeters et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>As life expectancy continues to grow, more decisions need to be made into older age, including decisions regarding finance (e.g., which mortgage or pension to choose), medical treatments (e.g., which medical treatment to choose) and politics (e.g., which party to vote for).</p><p>An active aging population will be influenced by age-related changes in healthy brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Berry et al., 2018)</ref> and developmental changes in decision-making strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McGillivray et al., 2012)</ref>. As the healthy brain ages there are naturally occurring atrophic changes to the prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cabeza, 2001)</ref> and dopamine system <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bäckman et al., 2006)</ref>. Since the prefrontal cortex has a functional role in the cognitive functions that are associated with decision-making, for example, executive functions (EFs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Funahashi &amp; Andreau, 2013)</ref> and working-memory (WM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Curtis &amp; D'Esposito, 2003)</ref>, it is reasonable that these changes would impact all areas of decision-making. For the healthy aging brain, cognitive processes that are reliant on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) region and orbitofrontal cortex regions (OFC) (e.g., EFs and WM) are negatively affected during aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Levine et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lamar &amp; Resnick, 2004)</ref>. Conversely, processes that are reliant on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr">(vmPFC)</ref> region (e.g., emotional regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(MacPherson et al., 2002)</ref>) are impacted by atrophy to a lesser extent. Moreover, other age-related changes in the healthy brain influence the dopaminergic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Shohamy &amp; Adcock, 2010)</ref>. Since dopamine is associated with many of the cognitive processes that are involved in decision-making, for example, reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kim et al., 2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">WM (D'Ardenne et al., 2012)</ref>, it is expected that changes at this level would impact decision making. Importantly, as an individual ages there are systematic losses of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gantz et al., 2018)</ref> and dopamine receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Karrer et al., 2017)</ref>. Neuroimaging studies reliably find evidence for the changes in the dopaminergic system in the healthy brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bäckman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Karrer et al., 2017)</ref>. The extent of any atrophy and reduction in dopamine vary considerably across healthy adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akiyama et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Karrer et al., 2017)</ref>. As the functionality of the dopamine systems decline at substantially different rates across individuals it follows that the associated cognitive processes would also deteriorate at different rates.</p><p>Intraindividual and interindividual variability in the cognitive processes for the aging individual influences all associated domains of decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McGillivray et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Wiesiolek et al., 2014)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr">Beitz and colleagues (2014)</ref> found age-related changes in decision-making performance for the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), in participants between the ages of 5 and 89-years of age. The older adults in their study exhibited performance deficits on the IGT compared to younger participants. The authors suggested that age-related cognitive changes as a function of intraindividual and interindividual variability resulted in the poorer performance in older adults. Moreover, age-related differences in reasoning and decisionmaking has also been reported in novel gambling tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Denburg &amp; Bechara, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Denburg and Bechara (2005)</ref> examined interindividual variability in an attempt to explain their findings that a subset of the older adults in their study (aged 56 to 85) manifested impairments in their gambling task compared to the younger adults (aged 26 to 55). Although all participants in the study were neurologically healthy interindividual variability in education and gender could not explain their results. Denburg and Bechara concluded that disproportionate aging of the vmPFC across participants may explain the deficits in reasoning and decision-making.</p><p>The age-related change in cognition can be explained by considering the thinking disposition literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Epstein et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Haran et al., 2013)</ref>. Thinking dispositions posit that we all have a tendency toward particular recognisable patterns of thinking that can underpin our decision-making outcomes. One such thinking disposition is 'open-mindedness' <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baron, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Haran et al., 2013)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baron (1993)</ref> found that attempting to view an issue from a multitude of perspectives (rather than just one perspective alone) predicted the avoidance of the myside bias (also called the confirmation bias) during 'good thinking'. Importantly, individuals who did not consider an issue from a multitude of perspectives used the myside bias by seeking to confirm the own beliefs when reading information about the issue.</p><p>Consequently, open-mindedness has often been used as a proxy for rational thinking when operationalised in the Actively Open-minded Thinking (AOT) scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Toplak et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Haran et al., 2013)</ref>. Performance on the AOT correlates positively with reflective thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Toplak et al., 2011)</ref>, crystalized intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Toplak et al., 2014)</ref> and syllogistic reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Toplak et al., 2014)</ref>. It also consistently correlates negatively with religiosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pennycook et al., 2014)</ref>, beliefs in conspiracy theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Swami et al., 2014)</ref> and superstitious thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Toplak et al., 2014)</ref>. Although the original form of the AOT consisted of 41-items <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Stanovich &amp; West, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, 2007</ref> a revised version of the AOT contains 7-items <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Haran et al., 2013)</ref>. In this paper, the short-form, 7-item version of the AOT was administered across all 12 studies. The data from these 12 studies were amalgamated into a single dataset.</p><p>Although the AOT has its merits in that it is a good predictor of both 'good <ref type="bibr">' and 'bad' thinking,</ref> in recent years there has been questions about whether AOT is a unitary phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Svedholm-Häkkinen &amp; Lindeman, 2018)</ref>. Critics of the AOT argue that the AOT scale does not measure a single phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Svedholm-Häkkinen &amp; Lindeman, 2018)</ref>. They note that since the items that are included in the AOT scale were drawn from a variety of scales that are said to measure flexible thinking, absolutism, categorical thinking, dogmatism, belief identification, counterfactual thinking, openness-ideas and openness-values the composite score (i.e., AOT score) actually describes these selected items <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Svedholm-Häkkinen &amp; Lindeman, 2018)</ref>. This resulting score assesses cognitive flexibility, the willingness to perspective-switch, epistemological absolutism, and resistance to belief change. Given the origins of the items that are included in the AOT scale it is feasible to assume that the AOT measures a multidimensional phenomenon. One such way in which the multiple dimensions of the AOT could be assessed is to consider the AOT as measuring three associated functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baron, 2019)</ref>. The first function is as a measure of norms, or standards, for the evaluation of A second revision of the AOT called the actively open-minded thinking about experience (AOT-E) scale was used across five studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pennycook et al., 2019)</ref> in the amalgamated dataset in this paper. This revised version of the AOT was created by <ref type="bibr">Pennycook and colleagues (2019)</ref> to examine the role of open-mindedness in the evaluation of evidence. In part this thinking about evidence can be mapped on to the third of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baron's (2019)</ref> functions, during which the thinker must evaluate the trustworthiness of the source of the evidence. Such thinking is crucial for the dismissal of counterfactual thinking about conspiracist ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pennycook et al., 2019)</ref> and paranormal thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pennycook et al., 2019)</ref>. High performance on the AOT-E correlates negatively with beliefs in conspiracy theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pennycook et al., 2019)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Haran et al., 2013)</ref> and open-mindedness about evidence as measured by the AOT-E scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pennycook et al., 2019)</ref>. Importantly and crucially, this paper addresses whether judgment and decision-making changes as a function of age in population were important decisions are increasingly made into the later years of life.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The data for 9010 unique participants from across 12 Amazon Mechanical Turk™ studies was amalgamated. All data was collected from studies between 2019 and 2020. All participants reported no neurological or psychiatric problems and were between 18 and 87-years of age (4191 males, 4734 females and 85 who did not wish to state their sex). All participants completed the AOT, and 4891 participants (2317 males, 2512 females and 62 who did not wish to state their sex) completed the AOT-E only. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the participant demographics for individuals divided into the six age groups <ref type="bibr">(18-28, 29-38, 39-48, 49-58, 59-68, and 69-87)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Actively Open-minded Thinking (AOT) scale. The short-form 7-item AOT <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Haran et al., 2013</ref>) was administered to measure an operationalised version of the concept of 'openmindedness'. This concept was originally conceived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baron (1993)</ref> as a single principle that defines the propensity to engage in good thinking from a multitude of perspectives. This scale consists of 7 short statements to which a participant replies on a Likert scale from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree). There is a maximum score of forty-nine for this scale with  <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pennycook et al., 2019)</ref>. This scale focuses on one specific aspect of the AOT scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Haran et al., 2013)</ref>, that being that our thinking should change in response to evidenced beliefs, value and opinions that contract with our own. This scale consists of 8 short statements to which the participant replies on a Likert scale from 1 (I strongly disagree) to 6 (I strongly agree). There is a maximum score of fifty-three for this scale with high scores denoting high open-mindedness for evidence and low scores suggesting closed-mindedness for evidence. For example… It is possible for someone to convince me to change my mind.</p></div>

As risk-taking propensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Weafer et al., 2013)</ref>, executive functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Toplak et al., 2014)</ref> and open-mindedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Toplak et al., 2014)</ref> reliably correlate with each other in the literature it is likely that the changes in these processes are driven by changes in the related underlying neurophysiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alvarez &amp; Emory, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lara &amp; Wallis, 2015)</ref>. These processes are all associated with activation in the prefrontal cortex, specifically the DLPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rypma &amp; D'Esposito, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alvarez &amp; Emory, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The prefrontal theories of cognitive aging can explain why there is a decrease in openmindedness as the healthy brain ages <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McGillivray et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mather, 2016)</ref>. The prefrontal regions are more susceptible to age-related atrophic changes than other regions of the healthy brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gunning-Dixon et al., 2009)</ref>. In particular, although there are atrophic changes in all areas of the prefrontal regions, for example, as in the OFC and vmPFC this decrease in brain volume is more pronounced in the DLPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mather, 2016)</ref>. The findings from <ref type="bibr">Fjell and colleagues (2009)</ref> support the rates of decline across the prefrontal cortex. In a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) study <ref type="bibr">Fjell and colleagues (2009)</ref> aggregated a large sample of eight hundred and three participants from across 6 different smaller samples. The age of the participants in their samples ranged from 18 to 94-years of age. The comparative rates of decline for prefrontal region brain volume revealed that the DLPFC significantly declined in volume more than any other prefrontal region.</p><p>Subsequent findings that performance on tasks reliant on DLPFC function (e.g., <ref type="bibr">EFs &amp; WM)</ref> decline at a greater rate than tasks reliant on vmPFC performance (e.g., social conduct regulation and emotional processing) provide a compelling case for the role of the DLPFC in the reduction of open-mindedness in older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McGillivray et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tranel et al., 2002)</ref>.</p><p>In particular, tasks associated with the DLPFC such as EF <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(MacPherson et al., 2002)</ref> and WM <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balconi, 2013)</ref> seem to be most negatively affected by normal aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McGillivray et al., 2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of Aging on Cognition</head><p>A number of theories have been proposed in attempts to explain the change in cognition as a function of aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McGillivray et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">West, 1996)</ref>. Each of these theories focus on possible mechanisms for driving age-related change in cognition during healthy aging. As health care improves and the retirement age increases it is increasingly important to consider these theories when individuals are working into older age <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Peeters et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The first of these theories, the general slowing theory posits that there is a reduction in the speed of cognitive processing as the individual ages <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Eusop et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Verhaegen &amp; Poncelet, 2013</ref>). The increased latency for these cognitive processes account for the age-related decline in cognitive performance when scores are compared between older adults and younger adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Verhaegen &amp; Poncelet, 2013)</ref>. For example, in object naming tasks participants in their 50s</p><p>show slower naming latencies compared to younger persons, and participants in their 60s and 70s show further increases in latencies and decreases in accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Verhaegen &amp; Poncelet, 2013)</ref>. Accordingly, the reduced speed in cognitive processing is thought to result from the slowing of cognitive language processes that are crucial for the understanding of most cognitive tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Verhaegen &amp; Poncelet, 2013)</ref>. As language processing latencies increase the time needed to perform these cognitive operations become restricted. Therein if a task or judgment requires the use of competing responses, as in the AOT <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Haran et al., 2013)</ref> were an individual must consider opposing views on a statement some of these responses may be lost by the time of the completed processing. Crucially, this could go part way to explaining some of the reduction in AOT <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Haran et al., 2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">AOT-E (Pennycook et al., 2019)</ref> performance in older participants compared to the younger participants in this paper. However, the question of whether cognitive slowing remains constraint across all cognitive tasks remains controversial and unclear.</p><p>The second cognitive theory of aging on cognition is the reduced resource theory which proposes that the decline in cognitive performance results from the reduced accessibility and availability to the allocation of attentional resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hartley &amp; Little, 1999)</ref>. Such attentional resources are necessary for the efficient performance of cognitive tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hartley &amp; Little, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">McGillivray et al., 2012)</ref>. For example, when an individual is required to divide their attention between multiple stimuli there is a detrimental impact on the processing of both stimuli. Accordingly, as an individual ages their capacity to allocate attentional resources decreases to the extent that the reduction in available attentional resources make it difficult for an older adult to engage in cognitively demanding tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McGillivray et al., 2012)</ref>. Importantly, this could also in part explain the reduction in open-mindedness as a result of aging. If older participants have less access to attentional resources then they will not be able to hold opposing views on a particular statement in mind whilst evaluating and preparing a response.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Open-mindedness and Aging</head><p>The decrease in open-mindedness and open-mindedness about evidence as a function of aging in the large sample of 9010 participants in this paper provide evidence for the detrimental impact of aging on open-mindedness. As scores for the AOT scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Haran et al., 2013)</ref> and the AOT-E scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pennycook et al., 2019)</ref> decline from younger participants to older participants it is expected that this result is driven by age-related change in the healthy brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(MacPherson et al., 2002)</ref> and associated cognitive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McGillivray et al., 2012)</ref>. Since rational judgments, decisions and actions require open-mindedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Toplak et al., 2011;</ref> it is crucial that the interindividual variability in these processes be examined in future research. Importantly, lower levels of open-mindedness in older adults compared to younger persons can be explained by the findings in the psychology literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kokis et al., 2002)</ref>. Older age is associated with high levels of superstitious thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kokis et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Toplak et al., 2011)</ref> and religiosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Pennycook et al., 2012)</ref> both factors that are lower in thinkers who are younger and who value evidence over personal feeling. Each of these cognitive factors are in turn associated with low scores on measures of open-mindedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kokis et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Svedholm-Häkkinen &amp; Lindeman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Toplak et al., 2011)</ref>. Crucially, although some studies report positive correlations between age and open-mindedness a closer inspection of the age range of participants can explain these results <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Haran et al., 2013)</ref>. For example, where <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Haran et al., (2013)</ref>  with each other in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Haran et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Toplak et al., 2014)</ref> and here other factors can influence the association between aging and open-mindedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baron, 2019)</ref>. For example, the formal education level of the thinker can impact how open-minded the thinker is <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baron, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Haran et al., 2013)</ref>. Other factors that can influence the interaction between age and open-mindedness may include intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Toplak et al., 2011)</ref>, expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baron, 1993)</ref>, scepticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pennycook et al., 2019)</ref>, and political ideology <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pennycook et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications and Limitations</head><p>The current study has some practical implications for judgment and decision-making in older age. This has particular implications for an aging population in which a greater number of adults choose to work at an age in which they would traditionally retire. These decisions that could be influenced by this age-related reduction in open-mindedness compared to younger peers could include, but are not limited to financial decisions (e.g., mortgage and retirement plans), medical decisions (e.g., to accept a medical treatment or not), legal decisions (e.g., to pursue legal proceedings or not) and political decisions (e.g., to vote for one candidate or party or not). Interventions to protect against 'closed-minded' decision-making could include training thinkers about how their beliefs can impact decision-making and introducing these thinkers to people with other views and perspectives on an event or topic (e.g., to 'leave' or 'remain' in the Brexit vote). A discussion with individuals who have opposing views could cause the thinker to re-evaluate their own views, perspectives and decisions on a topic. For instance, by trying to understand how other thinkers form their own decisions the thinker may choose to view the topic from multiple perspectives and become more open-minded. As they become more open-minded, they could opt to make a different decision about which way to vote.</p><p>These results should be considered alongside the limitations and implications of this research.</p><p>Firstly, the participants in this paper were all computer literate. A replication study may find that individuals who are not computer literate may choose to be more or less open-minded.</p><p>Secondly, the data collection for this paper included participants across the Amazon Mechanical Turk participation pool, replications should aim to collect further data from a wider source of participants.</p><p>In summary, this study extends the previous research on open-mindedness by examining the impact of aging on judgment and decision-making in a large amalgamated dataset. The agerelated decline in open-mindedness was evident for both the AOT and AOT-E scales. These results suggest that it is important to consider why a thinker makes a decision when important judgments and decisions are made into later age. <ref type="table">Table captions   Table 1</ref>.

At its most basic level the concept of open-mindedness proposes that some people are 'open-minded' whilst others are 'closed-minded'. An open-minded person is willing to consider information that contradicts with their personally held beliefs, whilst a closed-minded person would dismiss this information without any consideration of its content. The origin of open-mindedness in the psychology literature comes from the early work of Baron (1993) who sought to examine what the central principles of 'good thinking' in decision-making are. In this work,</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>thinking. As a norm of evaluative thinking the open-minded thinker assesses whether a statement is socially permissible. The second function is as a set of evaluative thinking dispositions for considering other people's thinking. Here the open-minded thinker considers another person's ideas in comparison to their own views and perspectives. For the third function, the individual examines the trustworthiness of the sources that claim authority. Future research is needed to assess the exact functions of the AOT scale and whether the AOT is a multidimensional or unitary phenomenon. In this paper the AOT was used to examine the influence of aging on open-mindedness as measured by the AOT scale.</figDesc></figure>

The authors of the eight-item AOT-E sourced the items from existing scales that measure belief identification, openness-value, and dogmatism.From a multidimensional perspective it is reasonable to suggest that although the AOT-E measures open-minded thinking about evidence it also measures the factors that are assessed by the sourced items that were compiled in to create the AOT-E. As with the AOT scale the AOT-E scale was administered in to examine the influence of age of open-minded thinking about evidence. The current paper addresses some of the previous limitations in literature by examining the role of aging in judgment and decision-making. In particular, the role of aging for open-mindedness and open-mindedness about evidence are examined. Firstly, this addresses one source of interindividual variability that is crucial to an aging population, namely aging. The role of aging on decision-making is often overlooked in the decision-making literature due to small sample sizes and access to participants. Here the amalgamation of data from twelve studies into a large dataset that consisted of nine hundred and ten participants addresses this issue. Secondly, any variation in performance across two particular types of decision-making are assessed -openmindedness as measured by the AOT scale</figDesc></figure>

The results suggest that open-mindedness as measured by the AOT and AOT-E scales<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Haran et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pennycook et al., 2019)</ref> change as a function of aging. Performance on measures of open-mindedness and open-mindedness about experience both decreased in a linear manner as age increases. These results were supported by strong negative correlations between age and AOT performance, and age and AOT-E performance. Whereas AOT performance and AOT-E performance positively correlated. The Role of Aging on the Healthy Brain The central focus of this paper was to examine the contribution of the aging brain on openmindedness in healthy participants. The results suggest that performance on measures of openmindedness decreases as individuals age. On average older adults had lower performance scores on both measures of open-mindedness compared to younger adults. These findings are</figDesc></figure>

This is likely the case for most studies for which the authors do not explicitly aim to examine a large age range of participants. By specifically recruiting participants with a large age range, as in this paper, with participants from 18 to 87years of age an accurate representation of the developmental trajectory of open-mindedness can be achieved. An important caveat is that although aging and open-mindedness reliably correlate positively</figDesc></figure>
