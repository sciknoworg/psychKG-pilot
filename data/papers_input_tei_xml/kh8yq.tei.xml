			<abstract>
				<p>Effort is a critical component of daily goal pursuit, both as the work invested in achieving a goal and as the subjective experience that accompanies it. While the roles of work and reward have been extensively studied in decision-making, relatively little is known about the influence of other cognitive and motor contributors when selecting between actions. Progress feedback, i.e., information on one&apos;s progress towards a goal, has been suggested to be intrinsically valuable. In this pre-registered study, we tested whether people preferred physical work involving progress feedback, even when it was accompanied by more work. We further examined whether preference for progress feedback could be explained by lower perceived effort, improved effort exertion characteristics, or mental health factors. Participants (n=114) performed an online effort-based decision-making task, choosing between options with progress feedback (PF+) or with no progress feedback (PF-). We recorded continuous movements during effort exertion with mouse-tracking. Overall, participants preferred to receive progress feedback. Preference for progress was positively associated with social motivation, as measured using the Apathy Motivation Index, but not with traits previously linked to information seeking. At a group-level, participants did not rate PF+ trials as less effortful compared to PF-. Progress feedback did not improve effort exertion efficiency, as movements in PF+ were more variable and less smooth than movements in PF-. These results suggest that progress feedback is innately valuable despite its potential costs. The correlation with social motivation highlights a potential link to external validation, which warrants testing in future studies.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Effort accompanies the pursuit of our goals. It is often defined as the work invested in an action, while the experience of effort is the subjective experience that accompanies this work <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wolpe et al., 2024)</ref>. Excessive effort avoidance and distorted experiences of effort, as well as reduced effort exertion, have been linked to symptoms of apathy and anhedonia (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bonnelle et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cléry-Melin et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jurgelis et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Le Heron et al., 2019)</ref>, which are seen across psychiatric and neurological conditions, such as major depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Culbreth et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Husain &amp; Roiser, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Treadway et al., 2012)</ref>. Thus, there are important clinical implications for understanding effort and motivation.</p><p>Feedback about the progress towards a goal boosts motivation. Progress feedback reduces avoidance of effortful tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Devine &amp; Otto, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Norbury et al., 2024)</ref> and increases effort expenditure <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Emanuel et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Katzir et al., 2020</ref>). Yet, it is unknown as to what makes progress feedback effective in modulating effort, or who finds progress information most valuable. Answering these questions may help design more specific treatments for individuals who are averse to effort, and identify individuals who might benefit the most from using progress feedback to facilitate motivation and alleviate apathy.</p><p>Effort processing involves multiple components that may be independently affected by progress feedback, and each can be measured independently. The preference for effort can be measured through decision-making tasks, where the effort cost is often weighed against reward (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Norbury et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Treadway et al., 2009)</ref>; these decisions reflect the anticipatory component of effort processing. The experience of effort is often indexed through self-report ratings upon completion of the workload (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cléry-Melin et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pooresmaeili et al., 2015)</ref>. Finally, effort exertion itself can vary in vigour, which is often indexed with reaction time in cognitive tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Frömer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Guitart-Masip et al., 2011)</ref>, or with grip force in physical effort tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bonnelle et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>How might progress feedback affect the valuation of effort costs, effort perception, and effort exertion? First, progress feedback may possess sufficient intrinsic value that can overcome the cost of effort, and thus reduce effort avoidance in the absence of monetary incentives or primary rewards. This has been shown in the cognitive effort domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Devine &amp; Otto, 2022)</ref>, but it is unclear whether this effect extends to physical effort. Furthermore, the study did not examine why some individuals may find progress information more valuable than others. Although people generally prefer to seek information <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bennett et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gottlieb &amp; Oudeyer, 2018)</ref>, this tendency varies, and is stronger in individuals who are more anxious, higher in emotional volatility, and higher in compulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bennett et al., 2021)</ref>. However, the link between information-seeking traits and preference for progress feedback has not been tested.</p><p>Second, in terms of subjective experience, progress feedback can reduce the experience of fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Katzir et al., 2020)</ref>, which is closely related to the experience of effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wolpe et al., 2024)</ref>. Although, existing studies often involve sustained effort exertion over relatively long timescales (e.g., across 75 trials of a cognitive task, or across multiple trials of mouse clicking). It is unknown whether the effects of progress information generalise to tasks on a shorter time scale (e.g., seconds), where the "opportunity cost" theorised to drive effort experience and fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kurzban et al., 2013</ref>) is likely lower.</p><p>Third, in terms of effort exertion, progress feedback increases action vigour despite reduced fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Devine et al., 2024</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Devine et al., , 2025</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Emanuel et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Katzir et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, continuous feedback can improve the efficiency of effort exertion. For example, feedback can reduce movement variability in certain contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cullins et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tang et al., 2022)</ref>. It is thus possible that progress feedback is valuable because it improves the efficiency of effort exertion. Mouse-tracking is uniquely positioned to measure any effects on efficiency, since it can capture continuous movement data that allows us to assess movement smoothness and movement variability.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to examine the value of progress feedback and its possible contributors in a pre-registered physical effort experiment <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. We tested whether progress feedback would be valuable in a physical effort task, and investigated potential contributors to this value. To this end, we developed an online physical effort task that can quantify the value of progress feedback for each individual, measure the subjective experience of effort, and obtain continuous movement features during effort exertion. We hypothesised that progress feedback would be valuable to participants and lead them to choose more effortful options to obtain progress feedback. We also hypothesised that the degree of preference for progress feedback could be explained by individual differences in information seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bennett et al., 2021</ref>). Moreover, we tested whether the value of progress feedback could be explained by reduced effort perception and by more effective effort exertion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-registration</head><p>The study, including methods and hypotheses, were pre-registered at aspredicted.org (https://aspredicted.org/4t26-7wg9.pdf).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>To obtain a power of 95% to detect a correlation of r = 0.3 for our hypothesis on interindividual differences, we aimed for n=120 post-exclusion. We therefore recruited 139 participants online via Prolific <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Palan &amp; Schitter, 2018)</ref>, with the inclusion criteria being age 18~80, no ongoing mental health conditions, and no neurological conditions (e.g., dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or multiple sclerosis). Two participants with an implausibly low maximal pulling capacity (see below) of less than 1 pull per second were asked to return the study submission and did not proceed to complete the main task, leaving a total of 137 participants who successfully completed the task (age range 18~72, M = 35 years, SD = 11 years, 34% female). The study was approved by the Tel Aviv University local ethics committee <ref type="table">(Ref: IRB</ref> 0003132-2), and all participants provided (anonymised) informed consent before participation. Every participant was given a base payment of approximately £8.00 per hour, with a bonus payment of up to £1.2 based on task performance. Amongst the 137 participants, two participants had incomplete data due to a technical error and could not be analysed; 15 participants were excluded from the main analyses based on the pre-registered exclusion criteria (see Quality control checks); six more participants were excluded from the main analysis due to an unexpected issue that resulted in a deviation from the pre-registration (see Quality control checks). The remaining n=114 (age range 18~72, M = 36 years, SD = 12 years, 34% female) retained 95% power to detect the pre-registered effect size of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ore mining task</head><p>We developed a new online physical effort task, the "Ore Mining Task", designed to measure continuous movements and button clicks <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>. This gamified task operationalises effort through the alternating clicking of two vertically offset buttons using a mouse or a trackpad. Participants engage with a virtual "pulley" system to simulate pulling ore from deep underground, which needs to be completed within a time limit of 15 seconds, after which the ore would "oxidise" and lose its value. To lift the ore, participants alternately click on the two buttons, with each set of clicks representing a single "pull". The pulley was deliberately depicted as damaged, shown by a zigzagged wheel, meaning that not every pull would lead to moving the ore upward. The depth of the ore, marked by a red line, indicated the effort level associated with each option, and the number of required pulls at each effort level was individually calibrated based on each participant's maximum pulling capacity <ref type="bibr">(MPC)</ref> within 15 seconds, obtained at the start of the task (for details, see <ref type="figure">Supplementary    Methods</ref>). The task had three phases: decision phase, effort exertion phase ("pulling"), and effort rating phase. In the decision phase, participants chose between two stations: withprogress-feedback (PF+) and no-progress-feedback (PF-). In PF+, participants could observe the ore moving up towards the surface with their pulling, while in PF-, the ore mining station was hidden behind a black rectangle, occluding visual feedback on current progress. The effort levels offered in PF-were adjusted through a fixed oneup/one-down staircase procedure, such that choosing the PF-resulted in the effort level offered on the next trial to increase by 5% of the MPC, and choosing the PF+ decreased the effort level for PF-by 5%. Three interleaved staircases were used to conceal the nature of adaptation, with the PF+ effort levels fixed at 70%, 85%, or 100% of each participant's MPC (specific levels chosen through piloting).</p><p>After selecting one of the two stations, the chosen station appeared at the centre of the screen, which indicated the start of the effort exertion phase. To introduce uncertainty in progress, not all pulls resulted in the ore moving upward. The number of "stuck" pulls was fixed at 30% of each participant's MPC throughout the experiment, randomly distributed across the required pulls. Participants had 15 seconds to lift the ore to the surface. If the required number of pulls was completed, the buttons turned green, and participants gained a fixed reward of 10 points. If time was up before completing the required number of pulls, the buttons turned red, and participants did not gain any points. Participants were told that at the end of game, they would receive an extra bonus payment, based on the number of points they earned. Finally, after completing effort exertion, in the effort rating phase, participants were asked to rate "How effortful did the last trial feel?". Participants used a visual analogue scale ranging from 0, "Not at all effortful", to 100, "Maximally effortful".</p><p>We set each staircase to include 15 trials, and 45 trials in total in the task, which ensured adequate parameter recovery for the computational model (see S3: Details on computational modelling). Participants familiarised themselves with exerting effort under the PF-and PF+ through six practice trials, with effort levels of 70%, 85%, and 100%. To mitigate fatigue, we reminded participants that they could rest on every choice screen, and, after the half-way point, we recommended a further rest of at least one minute. The experiment was written in jsPsych 7.3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Leeuw et al., 2023)</ref>, with custom-written plugins for the effort exertion phase, and ran on a server with Just Another Tool for Online Studies (JATOS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lange et al., 2015)</ref> backend.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaires</head><p>We included the following self-report questionnaires: the Apathy Motivation Index (AMI), which measures three facets of apathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ang et al., 2017)</ref>; the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), for symptoms of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kroenke et al., 2001)</ref>; the intolerance of uncertainty scale (IUS-12), as an additional measure of aversion to the uncertainty that accompanies the absence of progress feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carleton et al., 2007)</ref>; and 12 items from the Energy level, Anxiety, and Emotional Volatility facets of the next Big Five Inventory (BFI-2; Soto &amp; John, 2017). The BFI-2 was chosen because openly available data in a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bennett et al., 2021)</ref> suggested that the four-item Emotional Volatility subscale had the strongest positive correlation with the cost a person is willing to pay for information; we tested whether this relationship extends to the willingness to exchange effort cost with progress information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational model of choice</head><p>To test whether participants preferred progress feedback, we fitted variants of logit choice models to each participant's decisions to estimate the subjective value of progress feedback (SVPF+):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ℎ +) = 1 − 1 + !" * (△&amp;''()* ! ,-!"# ) + 2</formula><p>This model assumes that choices are driven by the difference in effort levels between PF+ and PF-(△effort), as well as the individual SVPF+, which is the subjective value a person assigns to progress feedback (equivalent to the Point of Subjective Equivalence in psychometric models; a positive subjective value can offset △effort to make PF+ more preferable). The inverse temperature, β, controls the slope of this relationship, and is expected to be negative. The lapse parameter aims to capture a fixed rate of random choices that occur irrespective of the effort difference. We compared models where the lapse rate was fixed to zero or allowed to vary, and where SVPF+ was fixed to zero or allowed to vary. A model with SVPF+ fixed to zero corresponds to the hypothesis that all participants preferred the option with the lower effort level, with no additional preference for progress information. As a control model, we also included a choice kernel model, where participants have a fixed tendency to select the previously chosen option with no consideration for the effort levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Wilson &amp; Collins, 2019)</ref>. The models were fitted with maximum likelihood estimation using fmincon in MATLAB R2020a (Mathworks, MA), and the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) were calculated for each participant as an approximation of model evidence. Model comparison was performed on the mean BIC across participants. For the winning model, a one sample t-test was used to test whether SVPF+ across participants was significantly greater than zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis for effort ratings</head><p>We fitted linear mixed-effects models to the trial-by-trial effort rating data. We used the lme4 package <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref>, as well as lmerTest for the Satterthwaite's method of approximating the degrees of freedom <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kuznetsova et al., 2017)</ref>. The analysis was run in R version 4.2.3. As per pre-registration, fixed effects were the effort levels (%MPC) and effort type (PF+ vs. PF-), as well as alternative models with or without corresponding random slopes. We used BIC to select the best-fitting model.</p><p>As the task involved a staircase procedure, participants experienced different trial numbers for the different conditions. Moreover, participants occasionally failed to complete the effortful task. As pre-registered, a more stringent exclusion criteria were applied to ensure that the results were not driven by these instances. Thus, only participants who have experienced a range of conditions and have multiple repeated measurements within these conditions were included in the confirmatory analysis (see section 6 of https://aspredicted.org/4t26-7wg9.pdf), with n=88. Importantly, as per pre-registration, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis without the additional criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of continuous cursor movement</head><p>During effort exertion, we recorded cursor movement data (mouse or trackpad). To analyse continuous movement trajectories, we pre-processed the position and velocity data recorded during the task. For each participant and trial, the raw data included time-stamped x and y coordinates of the cursor movement. Cursor velocities in the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions were computed as the first derivative of position with respect to time. To reduce high-frequency noise occurring due to occasional device sampling errors, the resulting velocity signals were smoothed using a moving mean filter. As the raw sampling frequency was approximately 75 Hz for most devices, we chose a window size of six samples which effectively minimized noise while preserving the integrity of the signal.</p><p>Outlier velocities in the vertical direction were identified using an absolute Z-score threshold of 3 and replaced via linear interpolation. The cleaned velocity signals were then used to derive trial-by-trial movement features. Specifically, we extracted the maximum velocity and variance of velocities in both the x and y directions, as well as the cumulative path length, computed as the sum of Euclidean distances between consecutive positions. Path variability was quantified as the variance in normalised x and y positions, scaled relative to the task window size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality control checks</head><p>To ensure data quality, we included attention checks with infrequency items in the questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Zorowitz et al., 2023)</ref>, and included a quiz on task instructions that participants must answer correctly before proceeding. As per our pre-registered exclusion criteria, we excluded 1) two participants who failed to complete the required physical work on 22 out of 45 trials or more; 2) eight participants who failed two or more attention check questions, out of a total of five questions; 3) seven participants who exhibited a right/left station bias, choosing stations on the same side of the screen for 70% or more trials (two of them were among the eight who failed attention checks). Considering overlaps in exclusion criteria for some participants, 15 out of 137 participants were excluded in total using these criteria.</p><p>After fitting the choice models to obtain the SVPF+, we identified participants whose SVPF+ fell outside of the range permitted by the bounds of our staircase procedure (i.e., 0.5 and -0.5). Their SVPF+ values were outside of the 95% and 5% quantiles and were likely outliers. We therefore excluded these participants from the main analyses, although we did not pre-register this exclusion as we had not anticipated this issue, leaving a total of n=114. For the relevant pre-registered hypothesis, we also conducted sensitivity analysis to show that the results were not affected by this deviation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pilot study</head><p>The results of the pilot study showed the task was well tolerated, and allowed us to record choice and continuous cursor movements. The results also showed people tended to prefer PF+ over PF-(see Supplementary Information S2: Pilot Study). We replicated this in the main pre-registered study, which we report next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preference for progress feedback in a physically effortful task</head><p>Participants were sensitive to the effort levels when deciding between the options <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>. To assess the preference for progress feedback, we first fitted a mixed-effects logistic regression model for trials with equal effort levels for PF+ and PF-(△effort = 0). As predicted for H1a, participants were significantly more likely to choose the PF+ option when the effort levels were equal (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = [2.4, 5.1], p = 1.51e-11). There were individual differences in preference, since, at the participant level, most participants chose PF+ on the majority of trials, but a sub-group of 22% of participants chose the PF-for the majority of the trials ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A</ref>).</p><p>We next examined choice preference for PF+ and PF-at different △effort (H1b; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.    2B</ref>). To this end, we fitted computational models of choice to individual participant's data. We fitted different models, and the key parameter was the subjective value of progress feedback (SVPF+; see S3 for more information about model comparison and model validation procedures). SVPF+ was coded such that the higher the SVPF+, the greater the preference for PF+. We included models where SVPF+ was a free parameter and models where it was fixed to zero. We found that the best fitting model had SVPF+ as a free parameter, with lapse rate fixed to zero. The BIC difference between a model with SVPF+ = 0 across all participants and the winning model was 5.34, providing positive evidence for variable SVPF+. To test for the overall tendency in preferences across the whole group, we conducted a one-sample t-test of the SVPF+ against zero, as pre-registered ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>). There was a significant preference for progress feedback across the group ( (113) = 2.30, = .012). The effect remained significant when we including participants with SVPF+ values outside the range of -0.5 to 0.5 ( (119) = 2.37, = .010), or when we using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test to account for deviation from normality in SVPF+ (for n=114: = 4,715.00, = 2.42e-05; for n=120: = 4,715.00, = 5.93e-06). We note that although the group average SVPF+ was small (M = 0.02, 95%</p><p>bootstrapped CI [0.003, 0.034]), almost a quarter (24%) of participants had SVPF+ greater than or equal to 0.05, which was the smallest detectable △effort in our task.</p><p>These results suggest that overall, participants were willing to undertake more effort in exchange for receiving progress information. This preference could not be explained by differences in failure rate, as a mixedeffects logistic regression showed there was no significant effect of effort type (PF+ vs PF-) on the probability of failing ( ? = −0.11, 95% CI [−0.34,0.12], = 0.93, = .354). We next tested whether the preference for progress feedback was explained by individual differences in mental health factors; by differences in perceived effort levels; or by differences in effort exertion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preference for progress feedback and mental health factors</head><p>We first tested whether some of the individual variability in progress feedback could be explained by mental health factors. As per our pre-registration (H3), we hypothesised that emotional volatility would be positively associated with SVPF+: that is, that people with higher emotional volatility would show greater preference for PF+. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A</ref>, contrary to our prediction, there was no significant correlation between the BFI-2 facet score of emotional volatility and SVPF+ ( = −.02, = .585; with non-parametric statistics, Spearman's rank correlation: = −.03, = .620). Further non-pre-registered analyses with other self-report questionnaires revealed one significant (FDR-corrected) correlation between the social motivation subscale of AMI and SVPF+ ( = −.28, /01 = .024; see <ref type="table">Table S3</ref> for full results). For social motivation, the correlation was negative ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3B</ref>),</p><p>suggesting that more socially motivated individuals showed higher preference for progress feedback. Adjusting for age and failure rate in a sensitivity analysis did not affect these results (Supplementary S4). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preference for progress feedback and experienced effort</head><p>We next investigated whether preference for progress feedback was due to differences in experienced effort. After completing the effort exertion phase on each trial, participants provided a subjective rating of how effortful they found the trial. We compared these ratings across effort types (PF+ and PF-).</p><p>As per our pre-registration, we fit a set of linear mixed-effects models to investigate the relationship between preference for progress feedback and subjective effort rating <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5</ref>). Model comparison indicated that the best-fitting model included fixed effects for effort level and effort type (PF+ vs. PF-), as well as random slopes for both variables, without any interaction effects (see <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>.1 and S4.2 for model comparison). Fixed effects are summarised in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. As predicted, effort rating was significantly influenced by the chosen effort level. However, contrary to our pre-registered hypothesis H2, there was no significant effect of effort type on effort rating. In a preregistered sensitivity analysis with a less stringent exclusion criteria, we observed a small but significant negative effect of PF-on effort rating ( ? = −0.01, 95% CI [−0.02,0.00], (113.62) = −2.16, = .033). This negative association suggests that participants experienced the task as more effortful in trials with progress feedback. The association remained significant when including trial success/failure as a covariate (full results in <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>).</p><p>While there were mixed results for the relationship between effort type and rating at group-level, model comparison provided strong evidence in favour of the inclusion of effort type in the model. Removing the random slopes for effort type resulted in a BIC increase of 50, and the removal of effort type as both a fixed-and random-effect led to a BIC increase of 38.1 (see <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>.2 for full results). These results suggest there were substantial individual differences in how effort was experienced with or without progress feedback; the overall tendency was, if any, for individuals to experience PF+ as more, rather than less effortful. Thus, at the group level, the preference for progress feedback cannot be explained by a reduction in perceived effort when progress feedback is present. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of progress feedback on effort exertion</head><p>Lastly, we investigated whether overall preference for progress feedback may have resulted from its influence on movement characteristics. To this end, we analysed continuous cursor movement data from the task and tested whether there were differences in movement features as a function of progress feedback. Before this analysis, however, we first confirmed that movement features measured in our online study using different devices provided meaningful measures by validating their relationship to effort rating.</p><p>We fitted a set of linear mixed-effect models, testing for movement predictors of effort rating, over and above effort level. The winning model included a random slope for both effort level and effort type (BIC=8184) compared to a model with only effort level as random slopes (BIC=8300) or no random slopes (BIC=9092). Trial-by-trial predictors of effort rating included total path length, maximum velocity in both x and y, variance of velocity in both x and y, as well as effort level, effort type, and whether the trial was successful. The winning model included random slopes for effort level and effort type, and the results are summarised in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. As expected, increased velocity in task-relevant direction y was associated with increased effort rating, as well as total path length. Within-trial variance in y velocity, on the other hand, was inversely related to effort rating, suggesting that smoother and less-variable movements were related to reduced effort. Together, the results suggest movement features extracted from the task reflected meaningful variations in participant's performance in the task. We next used these features to examine differences in effort exertion between PF+ and PF-.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Continuous movement features predicting effort rating.</p><p>Compared to PF-, PF+ showed an increased variance of velocity in the task-relevant y direction (t(5397)=3.144, p=0.002) and in total path length (t(5397)=2.138, p=0.030).</p><p>This was accompanied by an increase in maximum y velocity (t(5397)=4.075, p=4.68e-5). Together, the results suggest that PF+ was characterised by more variable movements, suggesting that preference for progress feedback could not be explained by more efficient effort exertion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Using a gamified decision-making task with a novel mouse movement manipulation of physical work, we investigated the effects of progress feedback on the preference, experience, and exertion of effort with several pre-registered hypotheses. We found that progress feedback was preferred overall across participants, especially in individuals with high social motivation. However, progress feedback did not consistently reduce effort perception or improve the efficiency of effort exertion.</p><p>These results suggest that progress feedback is innately valuable despite its potential costs.</p><p>While effort is generally considered aversive, there is growing interest in delineating the situations in which a more effortful task is preferred <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Devine &amp; Otto, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Inzlicht et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wu et al., 2023)</ref>. Here, we extend the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Devine &amp; Otto (2022)</ref>, who showed that progress information reduces the avoidance of cognitive effort, to the physical effort domain. Our computational model aimed to quantify the value each participant ascribed to progress information, and showed an overall tendency to favour progress information, even at the expense of increased effort level.</p><p>However, the nature of this value remains elusive: does it provide additional value that offsets the effort cost? With respect to the value of progress information, Devine &amp; Otto (2022) deliberated on whether this value is "intrinsic", or could be related to the resolution of uncertainty. We sought to expand on the latter idea by examining self-report measures previously associated with information seeking and/or uncertainty reduction.</p><p>Contrary to our predictions, the degree of progress preference was not significantly associated with traits such as emotional volatility or the intolerance of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bennett et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carleton et al., 2007)</ref>. One possible explanation for the discrepancy between studies is methodological. Our task involved a trade-off between progress feedback and additional physical work, while the uncertain outcomes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bennett et al. (2021)</ref> were monetary rewards. It is possible that the cost-benefit computations were not generalisable across the paradigms, or that the reduction of uncertainty in the PF+ condition was not sufficiently large to influence decisionmaking. Alternatively, uncertainty and information seeking may not be the primary mechanism through which progress feedback attains motivational value <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Devine et al., 2025)</ref>. Future studies could directly manipulate both reward and effort, or to introduce uncertainty in the amount of effort when progress feedback is unavailable.</p><p>Our exploratory analysis did identify an effect of social motivation on progress preference, where participants who displayed more social motivation were more progress-seeking. Speculatively, the ability to find social activities intrinsically valuable could share a common mechanism with deriving value from progressing in an effortful task <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Inzlicht &amp; Campbell, 2022)</ref>. Similarly, the association suggests there might be a link between the value of progress feedback and, more generally, the need to seek external validation. External validation, whether from others or from feedback, can serve as a source of motivation and reinforcement for goal-directed behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fishbach &amp; Finkelstein, 2012)</ref>. Future research could investigate this hypothesis in a clinical group, such as patients with schizophrenia, to test whether social apathy is also related to a diminished value of progress feedback.</p><p>For other contributors to the value of progress feedback, we chose to investigate the effect of progress feedback on effort rating, given its clinical relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cléry-Melin et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wolpe et al., 2024)</ref>. We found that progress feedback did not reduce the subjective experience of effort in our physical effort task. These results contrast previous studies reporting that progress feedback reduces fatigue ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Katzir et al., 2020</ref>) or self-reported task demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Devine &amp; Otto, 2022)</ref>. While the experience of fatigue may be strongly correlated with the experience of effort, these concepts are different <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Borg, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Halperin &amp; Emanuel, 2020</ref>). Nevertheless, model comparison suggested that effort type (PF+ vs. PF-) should be included as an explanatory variable for effort ratings, which may indicate that the effect of progress feedback is different in directionality for different participants, but consistent within each participant.</p><p>We employed mouse-tracking as a novel method for measuring continuous effort exertion in an online experiment. Assessment of peak velocity indicated that movements were more vigorous under progress feedback, consistent with previous findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Emanuel et al., 2022)</ref>. Importantly, we found that movements with progress feedback were less smooth in terms of their variability, suggesting that progress feedback cannot be explained by more effective effort exertion in our task.</p><p>Previous studies have reported reduced movement variability when visual feedback was available, compared to when feedback was absent <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baweja et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Khan et al., 2006)</ref>, though this may depend on the context and type of feedback provided <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cullins et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tang et al., 2022)</ref>. Movements with progress feedback in our task required participants to attend to both the buttons and the moving ore. Progress feedback attracts attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Devine et al., 2025)</ref>, and the focus of attention can indeed differentially affect movement variability: an internal focus of attention (on body mechanics) tends to reduce variability in movements, as for example, a study on golfers found that attended movements have low variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Carson et al., 2014)</ref>. By contrast, an external focus of attention (on the effects of one's actions), as in our task, can increase trial-by-trial movement variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lohse et al., 2014)</ref>. Within this context, future studies using eye-tracking can investigate whether attention to the movement (cursor) or outcome of movement (ore) can explain changes in movement variability.</p><p>The fact that subjective experience of effort was not lower for actions with progress feedback could also be related to the efficiency of movement. Our results suggest that effort rating increased with movement variability. At first glance, this effect seems at odds with the view that reducing movement variability would incur greater cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Manohar et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Manohar et al., , 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Summerside et al., 2018)</ref>. However, our study is distinct in its emphasis on trial-by-trial fluctuations in movement variability, with movement on some trials appearing "noisier" than others. The subjective experience of effort could be useful for monitoring the level of noise; as such, when noise increases, the effort rating would also increase.</p><p>We are the first study to investigate individual differences in progress preference, and our task could comprehensively map effects relating to decision-making, effort experience, and effort exertion. In addition, our novel mouse-tracking design advanced the measurement of effort exertion beyond simple reaction times, capturing rich data on continuous movements. However, there are several limitations to our study. First, our task design was optimised for estimating decision-making parameters with few trials, at the expense of collecting balanced data on subjective effort ratings.</p><p>The effect of progress feedback may be stronger and more variable for longer and more effortful tasks, and future work could use trials with only effort decisions but not effort exertion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berwian et al., 2020)</ref>, to achieve a balance between increasing effort exertion duration and minimising overall task length. Second, the staircase procedure could introduce dependencies between participant preferences and the effort levels available for rating, even though we sought to mitigate this in our mixedeffects modelling, by applying a set of stringent pre-registered exclusion criteria that focused on participants with sufficient trial numbers across multiple task conditions.</p><p>Finally, the variability in progress preference, as indicated by the SVPF+ parameter, was not as large as we anticipated, which undermines the utility of our task in titrating fine-grained inter-individual differences. This issue could be due to the "low resolution" of our paradigm, with the minimal effort level difference being 5% of the MPC; future studies may wish to include longer effort exertion phases, and extend the current paradigm with force dynamometers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Is progress feedback valuable for physically effortful tasks, and why? We find that progress feedback motivates people to pursue a physically more effortful task (supporting our pre-registered hypotheses H1a and H1b). Interestingly, progress feedback did make the task feel less effortful (contrasting our pre-registered hypothesis H2); it did not lead to more successes in the task, nor did it lead to more efficient effort exertion. Similarly, preference for progress feedback was not associated with individual differences in emotional volatility (contrasting our preregistered hypothesis H3), but an exploratory analysis showed an association with social motivation, suggesting a link between the value of external progress feedback and external validation seeking. Future research could investigate the emerging hypotheses from this study in clinical groups or with manipulations of reward, to better understand the psychological underpinnings of progress feedback preference.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effort calibration and effort levels</head><p>To compute each participant's MPC, before starting the main task, we asked participants to complete as many pulls as possible within a 15 s time window. To motivate participants and to conceal the purpose of the MPC calculation, we framed these trials as practice and set a high initial goal of 30 pumps in 15 seconds, which was thereafter adjusted dynamically based on the number of pulls completed by the participant. The MPC was the maximum number of pulls completed across four trials.</p><p>For the three staircases, effort levels of the PF+ were fixed at 100%, 85%, and 70% of the MPC respectively. If the next PF-effort level exceeded 100% MPC or dropped below 50% MPC, a new initial value for that staircase was selected from the set {50%, 60%, or 70%} of the MPC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S2: Pilot Study</head><p>For the pilot study, we collected data from 30 participants on Prolific (age range 23~68, M = 43 years, SD = 12 years, 33% female). The key differences between the pilot and the main study were:</p><p>1. Effort exertion ("pulling") involved a time limit of 8 seconds, rather than 15 seconds.</p><p>2. The step size of the staircase procedure was 10% MPC rather than 5%.</p><p>3. We included four interleaved staircase chains, with a total of 60 trials per participant.</p><p>4. The PF+ effort levels fixed at 70%, 80%, 90% or 100%.</p><p>At △effort = 0, the participants were more likely to choose PF+ than PF-(OR=5.37, 95% CI = [2.06, 14.0], p = 5.88e-04). The best-fitting choice model had lapse rate fixed at 0 and had variable SVPF+; the BIC difference between a model with SVPF+=0 and the winning model was 12.0, which provided strong evidence for individually varying SVPF+. Based on the SVPF+, there was also a significant preference for progress feedback ( (29) = 2.49, = .009), with mean SVPF+ = 0.11. Based on these results, we decided to run the main experiment with more fine-grained △effort levels (i.e., step size of 5% rather than 10%), to better measure inter-individual differences in SVPF+.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S3: Details on computational modelling</head><p>For parameter recovery, we created 1000 simulated participants and fitted the winning model to the simulated data. By examining the correlation between the parameters used for data simulation and the fitted parameters, we can establish whether the number of trials in the task was sufficiently "powered" to reliably estimate the parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Wilson &amp; Collins, 2019)</ref>. We restricted the range of SVPF+ to a range between -0.5~0.5, given that only values within this range were plausible for the staircase procedure. The SVPF+ values used for simulations were drawn from a uniform distribution. The inverse temperature parameter was drawn from an exponential distribution-the sign of which was reversed after sampling, as inverse temperature is negative for effort-averse decisions. The mean of the exponential distribution was 30, which was the median of the fitted parameters. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2</ref> illustrates the recovery results.  For model comparison, we calculated the mean Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)</p><p>for each model, and took △BIC as the difference between each model and the winning model (additive_nolps). The formula for BIC for each participant is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= −2 * log( ℎ ) + * log ( 2345267 )</formula><p>Where k is the number of parameters, and nchoices is 45 for all participants.</p><p>Given the deviation from pre-registration, we reported the model comparison results for both the n=114 sample and the n=120 sample, as shown in <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>. Recovered log(-beta) <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>. Models and model comparison results, including the parameter ranges allowed for each model in fmincon.</p><p>Model validation aims to assess whether simulated data from the fitted model could qualitatively capture the basic behavioral patterns and individual differences seen in the experiment. We decided to use the sequence of trials experienced by each participant when simulating their choices, rather than using the staircase procedure, to avoid further deviations from the actual data due to stochasticity in the trial generation process. We created five simulated datasets. For simplicity, the results shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2</ref> are from one single simulation.</p><p>Across all five datasets, there was a moderate to strong positive correlation between the actual proportion of PF+ choices and the simulated proportion (Pearson's r = 0.67~0.73; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S2A</ref>). For choices at trials with △effort = 0, i.e., those analyzed for the pre-registered H1a, there was a strong positive correlation between the simulations and the actual data (Pearson's r = 0.84~0.88), although not all choice probabilities were well-predicted ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S2B</ref>). These results indicate that the model could broadly reproduce individual differences in effort preference. When averaging across participants, the simulated choice probabilities at each △effort had confidence intervals that mostly overlapped with actual choice probabilities <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. S2C</ref>). Deviation from a sigmoidal choice function with large confidence intervals is likely due to the staircase procedure, since some △effort were only experienced for one trial in one participant, as a result of random sampling. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S4: Supplementary results for exploratory analysis on the preference for progress feedback</head><p>This analysis aims to explore the origin of inter-individual differences in the preference for progress feedback, as indexed by SVPF+. Here, we report the zerothorder correlations between SVPF+ and questionnaires collected for exploratory purposes. FDR correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.  To check whether the effects could be confounded by age and failure rates during the task, we computed partial Spearman's correlation coefficients adjusting for the two variables. Consistent with the main results, there was no significant association between SVPF+ and emotional volatility (partial = −0.01, = .952), while there was a significant negative association between SVPF+ and social motivation subscale of AMI ( = −.25, = .007).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S5: Full model comparison results for mixed-effects models on the subjective experience of effort</head><p>As indicated in the pre-registration, we had an a priori hypothesis about the effect of progress feedback on effort ratings, but we did not have any strong a prior hypothesis about the structure of random effects or about the interaction between progress feedback and effort level. In our pre-registration, we decided to address the latter issue by a model comparison approach, using the difference in BIC to determine whether random slopes and/or interaction effects should be included.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="table">Table S4</ref> Given that there was no significant effect of effort type on rating in the main analysis in m2, we decided to conduct a non-preregistered follow-up analysis, in which we excluded effort type from the model, as we aimed to assess the explanatory power of the variable itself <ref type="table">(Table S4.</ref>2). Overall, there was strong evidence in favour of including effort type as an explanatory variable for trial-by-trial changes in effort ratings. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S6: Sensitivity analysis for the subjective experience of effort</head><p>Following our pre-registration, we decided to use a set of additional exclusion criteria to identify individuals with effort rating data that was present across a wider range of experiment conditions. These are:</p><p>1. Excluding trials where participants do not complete the physical work <ref type="bibr">("failure" trials)</ref>. This way, we effectively removed trials where the chosen effort levels diverged from the number of pulls (i.e., the actual amount of physical work completed).</p><p>2. A participant must have at least six trials for PF+ and six trials for PF-condition, and the remaining trials should cover at least two levels of physical work with a minimum of three data points in each. This criterion was created to ensure that, in the full mixed-effects model, when separate slopes were fitted for each participant in the PF+ and PF-conditions, there would be sufficient data to inform the slopes at the lowest level of the model.</p><p>We also pre-registered a sensitivity analysis to check whether the results would be heavily influenced by the exclusion criteria. We were concerned that the stringent criteria would lead to a larger proportion of excluded participants, which was indeed the case (n=26 excluded), which would in turn lead to a loss of power and external validity. Additionally, due to the staircase procedure we used, the second criterion could exclude participants based on their effort preferences, and a sensitivity analysis would thus help identify any bias introduced by this procedure. The sensitivity analysis included failure as a fixed effect with corresponding random slopes, as per the pre-registration.</p><p>Our model space spanned 45 models, all of which including the fixed effects of effort level, effort type, and failure, while differing on whether there were interaction effects between any or all of the three variables, and whether random slopes were included for each variable. The winning model was:</p><p>Rating ~ effort level + effort type + failure + (1 | id) + (0 + effort level | id) + (0 + effort type | id) + (0 + failure | id)</p><p>There was strong evidence in favour of this model over the second-best model (△BIC = -7.0), which additionally included an interaction term between effort level and failure.</p><p>The fixed effects of the winning model are reported in <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>.  <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>: Sensitivity analysis for the linear mixed-effects model on effort rating, with failure included as a fixed effect with corresponding random slopes, and with the full n=114 sample included. Effort type is coded such that 1 is PF-, and 0 is PF+. Failure was coded such that 0 is when the goal was reached for exerting physical effort, and 1 when the goal was not reached.</p><p>Similar to the main results <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>, there was still a significant increase in effort rating as effort level increased. For effort type, there was a small but significant negative association with the rating, indicating that seeing progress feedback made some participants experience the same effort level as more effortful. Interestingly, when participants failed to meet the goal, there was a significant increase in effort ratings. On these trials, the number of pulls completed by the participant were fewer than successful trials under the same effort level. Hence, this particular effect was opposite to what one would expect from effort rating being purely reflective of the amount of physical work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Schematics of a single trial in the Ore Mining Task.</figDesc></figure>
