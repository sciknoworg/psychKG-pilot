<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Everyday life is characterized by decisions in which individuals must evaluate the costs versus benefits of various actions. One frequently encountered form of cost comes from the exertion of physical effort. This might be required to attain a positive reward or to avoid a negative outcome. For example, someone might ask themselves if the effort required to go to a party is worth the reward of enjoying it, or whether avoiding a dangerous neighborhood is worth walking some distance out of their way. Individuals vary in how much physical effort they are willing to exert in pursuit or avoidance of specific outcomes, and aberrant willingness to exert effort has been associated with a variety of psychopathological conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> .</p><p>A large body of work in rodents has established a relationship between depressive phenotypes and reduced willingness to exert effort in pursuit of reward. Effortful reward pursuit in such paradigms typically entails physical lever presses to gain a desirable food and involves choice selection between a low effort/low reward option and a high effort/high reward option <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . Findings link depressive phenotypes to low levels of high effort/high reward choice selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> ; with this behavior being normalized by the administration of antidepressant agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</p><p>In humans, effortful reward pursuit is usually studied with rewards consisting of monetary gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> . A human analog of the rodent task described above, the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , which pits a low effort/low reward option against a high effort/high reward option, has been used in studies of patients with depressive disorders. Findings from these studies have been broadly consistent with the animal literature, with patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) showing lower selection of high effort/high reward options than healthy control participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> . Among medicated MDD patients in remission from depression, reduced high effort/high reward choice selection has also been shown to be predictive of future depressive relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</p><p>In addition to the use of binary psychiatric diagnoses such as MDD, researchers have used wellvalidated standardized questionnaires to examine the relationship between continuous measures of depressive symptomatology and effortful reward pursuit. Elevated levels of both apathy and anhedonia have been associated with reduced effortful reward pursuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . However, it remains unclear whether these dimensions of depressive symptomatology influence effortful reward pursuit via common or distinct mechanisms. In an important step towards addressing this, Bonnelle and colleagues devised a task that orthogonally manipulated the levels of required effort and levels of possible reward (referred to as 'stake') that might be obtained, enabling individual differences in effort cost valuation versus reward sensitivity to be teased apart. The authors focused on behavioral apathy, finding it to be linked to increased subjective effort costs at the lowest levels of reward in one study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and elevated sensitivity to increases in the level of required effort in a second <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</p><p>Scores on self-report measures of different aspects of depressive symptomatology, such as anhedonia and apathy, tend to be highly correlated with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , while scores on measures of depression are themselves highly correlated with scores on self-report measures of anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . This raises the question of whether the findings reported to date are specific to anhedonia or apathy, linked to a broader depressive phenotype, or even common to both depression and anxiety. Husain and colleagues controlled for anhedonia and depressive symptoms in their apathy analyses but did not fully report findings for these other symptom dimensions. Further, despite the high comorbidity between anxiety and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> , there has been little human research investigating the relationship of anxiety with individual differences in effortful reward pursuit. This contrasts with the widespread use of instrumental avoidance paradigms in human anxiety research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> ; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> for a review). These studies build on the extensive basic neuroscience literature on the instrumental avoidance of threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> . Here, however, effort costs are typically not manipulated.</p><p>Intriguingly, research conducted in rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> suggests that willingness to exert physical effort to avoid threat in a forced swim test (FST) paradigm may differentiate animals with anxious versus depressive phenotypes. The FST involves the placement of rodent subjects into a body of water with no rest platforms or exits, and measures the amount of time the animal spends exerting initially vigorous physical effort in pursuit of escape. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> Rodents showing anxiety-like behavior, either as a result of 5HT1a receptor knockout <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> or induced alcohol withdrawal <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> , have been found to maintain vigorous effort exertion in pursuit of escape in the FST for significantly longer than controls. Further, this behavior can be normalized by administration of anxiolytic agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> . This contrasts with classical findings that rodents with depressive phenotypes typically show reduced duration of vigorous effort exertion in the FST <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> , with this being reversed by administration of antidepressant agents (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> for a review). The forced swim task is not an ideal measure of effort exertion; nevertheless, these findings prompt us to ask whether anxiety and depression might differentially impact effortful avoidance of threat in human decision-making. We aimed to address this in the study reported here.</p><p>Specifically, we sought to characterize fully the relationship between common and unique components of anxious and depressive affect and alterations, or biases, in the computations underlying effort-based decision-making. To achieve this, we used bifactor modeling of item-level questionnaire responses together with a hierarchical Bayesian modelling framework, to examine the influences of latent subdimensions of depression and anxiety upon effortful pursuit of reward and avoidance of punishment. The reward version of the effort-based decision-making (EBDM) task used was closely based on the task developed by Bonnelle and colleagues to facilitate dissociation of subjective valuation of required effort from subjective valuation of potential reward. To investigate participants' willingness to expend effort to avoid aversive outcomes, we created a structurally equivalent task using electrical stimulation of different levels as the aversive outcome. Our specific aims were as follows: First, we sought to investigate whether distinct latent subdimensions of depression impact the same or different component mechanisms of decisionmaking involved in effortful reward pursuit. Second, given the more modest literature on the influence of anxiety on effortful decision-making, we sought to determine whether cognitive or physiological symptoms of anxiety are associated with differences in effortful decision-making, and if so, whether this varies between effortful reward pursuit and effortful threat avoidance. Finally, we sought to determine whether effortful decision-making in either, or both, pursuit of reward and avoidance of threat differentiates individuals with elevated anxious versus depressive symptomatology.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bifactor modeling of latent sub-dimensions of negative affect</head><p>Bifactor modeling of questionnaire item responses can be used to tease apart symptom variance common to anxiety and depression from that unique to lower-level dimensions capturing more specific aspects of anxiety or depressive symptoms. Previous research has shown that such bifactor modeling provides a valuable characterization of shared versus unique variance in internalizing psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> . To date, there has been limited use of bifactor modeling of internalizing symptoms within the field of computational psychiatry <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> .</p><p>In the current study, we broadened an anxiety and depression questionnaire battery we previously used <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> (see Methods) to include measures of anticipatory anhedonia (the Temporal Experience of Pleasure anticipatory hedonia subscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> ) and apathy (the Apathy and Motivation Index behavioral subscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> ). We collected separate online data sets for exploratory (n=453) and confirmatory (n=252) factor analyses. The winning bifactor model was then applied to the same item responses from participants who completed the in-person EBDM task sessions (n=50).</p><p>Multiple exploratory bifactor analyses were performed specifying one general factor and varying the numbers of specific factors from two through seven. A comparison of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51</ref> , which assesses model fit while attempting to penalize for complexity, showed continued improvement in exploratory model fit as additional specific factors were included up to the maximum seven specific factors considered ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a)</ref>. We assessed the fit of each resulting model to the confirmatory data set using comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis measure of fit <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1b</ref> and Methods). Increasing the number of specific factors above five resulted in suboptimal confirmatory fit in the held-out data set, indicating that more complicated models were potentially overfit to the exploratory data.</p><p>The bifactor model with five specific factors (BF5) provided the best combination of exploratory model fit (BIC=4468.38) while maintaining a CFI above 0.95 in the held-out data (CFI = 0.953, RMSE = 0.101). See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for fit indices and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table S1</ref> for full item-level loadings. of item-level questionnaire data. a) Bifactor models with 1 to 7 specific factors were fit to item-level questionnaire responses using the exploratory dataset. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, arbitrary units) for each model is presented; this reveals that model fit improves as the number of specific factors increases. b) The comparative fit of each bifactor model was further assessed using the confirmatory dataset via both the confirmatory fit index (CFI) and the Tucker-Lewis measure of fit. This revealed a highly credible fit (&gt; 0.95) for models with five or fewer specific factors. Consideration of both exploratory and confirmatory model fit indices led us to select the bifactor model with five specific factors. c) Item loadings for the winning bifactor model (BF5) with one general and five specific factors. Questionnaires from left to right: Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> anxious arousal (AA) and anhedonic depression (AD) subscales; Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52</ref> ; the State Trait Anxiety Inventory -Trait version (STAI-T) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53</ref> anxiety (Anx.) and depression (Dep.) subscales <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54</ref> ; the Beck Depression Inventory 55 somatic (Som.) and cognitive (Cog.) subscales; Apathy Motivation Index 23 behavioral subscale (AMI Beh.); Temporal Experience of Pleasure 50 anticipatory anhedonia subscale (TEPS Ant.).</p><p>The item loadings of the winning bifactor model (BF5) were used to calculate factor scores for each participant in the exploratory data set (see Methods). We examined the correlation of participants' scores for each factor from the winning model with their summary scores for the standardized questionnaire scales (or subscales) to provide additional insight into factor interpretation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, left panel). As anticipated, we observed strong correlations between scores </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>c)</head><p>on the general factor and summary scores for most of the scales (noting that the TEPS anticipatory hedonia scale is coded oppositely from the other scales, such that a higher TEPS score indicates greater positive affect). In addition, scores on each specific factor were strongly correlated with summary scores for one or more questionnaire scales. We performed the same correlational analysis between scale summary scores and BF 5 model factor scores for the in-lab behavioral participants who completed the EBDM tasks to ensure consistency in factor interpretation. The correlations for the in-lab behavioral group <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref>, right panel) showed notable similarities to those observed for the EFA group. Based upon the item loadings and correlations with questionnaire scores, we characterized the five specific factors from the BF5 model as follows: Factor 1: Mixed anxiety and depression; Factor 2: Anhedonic depression; Factor 3: Worry; Factor 4: Apathy; Factor 5: Anticipatory hedonia. These labels are subjective and are intended to reflect the predominant symptom variance captured by each specific factor ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>). Unlike the other scales, higher scores on TEPS indicate greater positive affect. For consistency, we reversed participant scores on F5 (F5-reversed) for all subsequent analyses such that higher scores on F5reversed indexed greater anticipatory anhedonia. The left-hand matrix shows correlations between factor scores and questionnaire summary scores for online participants whose data were used in the exploratory factor analyses (n=453); the right-hand matrix shows correlations for in-lab participants who completed the effort-based decision-making tasks (n=50). Summary scores (x axis) were calculated for the same questionnaire subscales as reported in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The y axis specifies each of the factors from the winning BF5 bifactor model (G is the general factor, F1 to F5 are the five specific factors). MASQ AA: MASQ anxious arousal subscale; MASQ AD: MASQ anhedonic depression subscale; STAI-T Anx.: STAI-T anxiety subscale; STAI-T Dep.: STAI-T depression subscale); BDI Som: BDI somatic subscale; BDI Cog: BDI cognitive subscale; TEPS Ant.: TEPS anticipatory hedonia subscale; AMI Beh.: AMI behavioral subscale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effort -based decision-making (EBDM) task performance</head><p>In-lab participants (n=50) completed the questionnaire battery and performed reward and aversive versions of the EBDM task in counterbalanced sessions conducted on different days (see Methods). We adapted a previously used "apple-picking" task <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> which translates effort exerted through squeezing a dynamometer (handgrip) into visually "climbing" a tree in real time as force is exerted ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). In the reward version, a successful outcome entails obtaining the trees' apples. <ref type="figure">(Figure 3a</ref>). In our new structurally equivalent aversive version of the task, participants avoid "bear traps" by climbing the tree <ref type="figure">(Figure 3a,b</ref>). Here a successful outcome entails avoiding electrical stimulation. 99</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3:</head><p>The effort-based decision-making (EBDM) task. (a) On each of the 156 trials, a tree illustrated the level of required effort (ladder rungs) and stake (apples to be retrieved or bear traps to be avoided, respectively). There were five levels of both required effort and stake. For effort, levels were represented by ladder rungs, with the highest level calibrated to 85% of each individual's maximum force grip (sustainable maximal voluntary contraction; see Methods). Stake level was represented by an increase in the number of apples or bear traps and converted to magnitude of financial gain (for the reward version) or level of electrical stimulation (for the aversive version). See Methods for details. (b) On each trial, participants decided whether or not to "climb" the tree (i.e. to engage with the trial) or to forfeit the potential reward (on the reward version of the EBDM task) or receive the electrical stimulation (on the aversive version of the EBDM task). If participants chose to engage, they were given 5 seconds to exert the required force via a handgrip dynamometer. To be successful, the required force had to be reached and maintained for a minimum of 500ms. At the end of each trial the outcome was immediately presented (points added following successful effort exertion on the reward task version; electrical stimulation administered following non-engagement or unsuccessful effort exertion on the aversive task version). See Methods for further details.</p><p>The number of apples or bear traps, respectively, indicated the relative magnitude of monetary gain or electrical stimulation for the trial, while the red ladder rung on each trial <ref type="figure">(Figure 3a</ref>) indicated the effort required to succeed. There were five levels of stake and five levels of effort in each task version with six total trials at every stake by effort combination (plus six additional trials, see Methods). Objective effort requirements and electrical stimulation intensities were calibrated for each participant; see Methods for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Logistic regression analyses of participant choice behavior</head><p>We performed a simple logistic regression analysis of participants' choices to engage in effortful trials. For both the reward and aversive EBDM task versions, choices were significantly modulated by trial-wise stake and effort level, with increasing stake levels increasing the probability of choosing to attempt to "climb" the tree (i.e. to engage with the trial.); reward pursuit: stake level coefficient = 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI)= [1.075,1.186], <ref type="figure">Figure 4a</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1a</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1g</ref>. These choice patterns are consistent with those reported in prior studies of EBDM using the original reward task version <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Behavioral choices on the reward and aversive versions of the EBDM task as made by participants and as simulated using the winning computational model. a) This 3d plot shows participants' mean group-level behavior (probability of trial engagement, i.e. 'yes' choice) for the reward version of the effort-based decision-making (EBDM) task as a function of effort level and stake (financial reward) level. b) This 3d plot shows simulated choice behavior (probability of trial engagement) on the reward version of the EBDM task as generated by the winning computational model (Model #6). c) This 3d plot shows participants' mean group-level behavior (probability of trial engagement) on the aversive version of the EBDM task as a function of effort level and stake (electrical stimulation) level. d) This 3d plot shows simulated choice behavior (probability of trial engagement) on the aversive version of the EBDM task as generated by the winning computational model (Model #6). See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref> for additional 2d plots of simulated choice behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational modeling of EBDM task performance.</head><p>We used subjective value-based computational modeling to explore the influence of specific predictors on participants' choices. We considered six alternative models of choice, fitting each model in a hierarchical Bayesian framework (see Methods), and assessed the fit of each model to the data using the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criteria (WAIC, also known as the Widely Applicable Information Criteria) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">56</ref> . The different models attempted to capture participants' likelihood of engaging in a trial using distinct parametrizations of the underlying computations (see Methods for details and Table S2 for model comparison). The model which provided the best fit to the data (Model #6; WAIC = 5709.68, se = 119.71) included parameters for linear ( ) and nonlinear ( ) scaling of stake level; linear scaling ( ) of required effort level; baseline bias against effort exertion (b); a stake per effort interaction parameter ( ); the effect of decreasing engagement over the course of the task ( ); a parameter to account for probability of success at a given level of effort (r); and a parameter to characterize a participant's tendency to perseverate (i.e., to repeat the previous response regardless of changes in stake or effort level, sometimes referred to as 'sticky choice') (h). Separate parameter distributions were inferred for reward pursuit versus threat avoidance choices. For the winning model (Model #6), the subjective net value (SNV) of the offer on trial t was calculated as a function of the tradeoff between stake (i.e. reward or threat level) and effort as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">SNVt = (Staket) -(Effortt) + (Staket/Effortt) 2(a)</formula><p>The probability that a participant would engage on a given trial t was calculated as a logistic function of the SNV while also allowing other factors (see above and Methods) to bias choice to engage as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P(Engage)t = (1 + exp(-[SNVt -(Trialt) + r(Psuccesst,e) + h(Choicet-1)-b])) -1 2(b)</formula><p>To examine how participants' scores on latent dimensions of anxious and depressive symptoms (as described earlier, see <ref type="bibr">Figures 1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref> impacted their choice behavior, we included an "offset" grouplevel parameter for each factor from the winning bifactor model (BF5) on each choice parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> . This allowed us to estimate directly the strength of the trait effects on choice by jointly inferring posterior distributions for each along with the choice model parameters. A 95% highest density interval (HDI) of the posterior distribution for a given parameter which excluded 0 indicated a significant influence of the factor scores associated with that on the choice parameter; see Methods for further details.</p><p>Simulated data from the generative inversion of the winning model (Model #6) accurately reproduced participant behavior (see <ref type="figure">Figures 4b, 4d</ref> and S1, and Methods). We confirmed that parameter values were recoverable for the winning model by simulating data using participant posterior mean parameter values and fitting the simulated data with the model. True parameter values were recovered within the 95% posterior highest density interval (HDI) of the fit parameters &gt;=94% of the time for each parameter ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S2</ref>). We performed model recovery analysis to confirm that the winning model (Model #6) was distinguishable from other models of interest (see Methods and <ref type="figure">Figure S3</ref>). We also examined the collinearity of participant-level parameter posterior means. For the reward version of the EBDM task, there were no 2 parameters for which shared variance in values (across participants) exceeded 20%. The highest correlation observed was between the stake per effort interaction parameter and the probability of success parameter (rho = 0.43, p &lt;0.01; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure S4</ref>). For the aversive version of the EBDM task, the highest amount of shared variance between two parameters (across participants) was 21%, between the linear scaling of effort level parameter and the stake per effort interaction parameter (rho = 0.46, p &lt; 0.001; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure S4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group-level results</head><p>Before examining the effect of latent factors tapping anxiety and depression on task performance, we assessed group-level model-based results across the reward and aversive versions of the EBDM task. We also examined the relationship between individual differences in EBDM performance across the two versions of the task. . To assess the relationship between reward and threat baseline bias for individual participants, we correlated individual level posterior means for the baseline bias parameter from the reward and aversive task versions, respectively. There was a significant positive relationship between baseline bias parameter values for the two task versions across individuals (rho(48) = 0.441, p = 0.001), indicating that heightened willingness to engage in reward pursuit was also linked to heightened willingness to engage in threat avoidance, even if at a group-level participants were less willing to exert effort for the latter, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5a</ref>).</p><p>Mean parameter values for linear scaling of stake level were not significantly different between reward pursuit and threat avoidance at the group distribution level ( #$&amp;%#' : =17.82, 95% HDI= <ref type="bibr">[15.71,20.11]</ref>; !"#$%! : =17.07, 95% HDI= <ref type="bibr">[13.90,20.38]</ref>; reward -threat difference calculated across n=8,000 joint posterior samples: 95% HDI= <ref type="bibr">[-2.92,4.64]</ref>).

Of note, the difference between stake per effort interaction parameter posterior means for reward pursuit versus threat avoidance did not reach significance (reward -threat difference calculated across n=8,000 joint posterior samples: 95% HDI=[-1.08,0.36]). Additionally, individual posterior mean parameter values were not significantly correlated across reward pursuit and threat avoidance, confirming a lack of consistency in contribution of the stake per effort parameter across task versions at an individual level (rho(48) = -0.098, p &gt; 0.4; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S5</ref>).</p><p>The winning model (Model #6) also included a parameter capturing nonlinearity in the subjective valuation of stake ( ).

There was also no significant difference between reward pursuit and threat avoidance parameter means at the group level (reward -threat difference calculated across n=8,000 joint posterior samples: 95% HDI=[-0.14,0.61]).

At an individual level, there was only a trend-level relationship between posterior distribution means for reward pursuit and threat avoidance task versions (rho(48)=0.268, p=0.06; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5d</ref>).

Elevated scores on factors capturing heightened behavioral apathy (F4) and anticipatory anhedonia (F5_reversed) were significantly associated with reduced effortful reward pursuit, in line with previous findings. However, each operated on distinct mechanistic components of decision-making. show posterior means and 95% highest density intervals (HDI) for the effect of each of the five specific factors from the bifactor analysis of anxious and depressed affect, upon parameter posterior values obtained by fitting the winning model (Model #6) to performance on the reward version of the EBDM task. (a) Specific latent factor F4 (behavioral apathy) was the only factor to modulate parameter values for baseline bias (b), with higher F4 scores being linked to a greater general tendency to decline to exert effort across all effort and stake (reward) levels. (b) Modulation of group-level posterior parameter values for the linear effect of stake ( ). Scores on specific factor F5 (reverse scored; anticipatory anhedonia) were associated with greater sensitivity to stake level. A similar effect was also observed for specific latent factor F1 (mixed anxiety and depression). (c) Scores on both specific factor F4 (behavioral apathy) and F3 (worry) were associated with reduced willingness to exert effort as the task progressed. Note, none of the latent specific factors significantly modulated the effect of level of required effort; this was however modulated by scores on the general factor ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S5</ref>). Specifically, we found that higher scores on the factor capturing behavioral apathy (F4) were associated with a significantly greater bias against engaging in effortful reward pursuit (βF4_baseline_reward: = 2.48, 95% posterior HDI=[0.572, 4.681]; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6a</ref>). Higher scores on F4 were also associated with a significantly larger drop in effortful engagement over time on task as indexed by trial number (β_F4_timeontask_reward: = 0.398; 95% posterior HDI = [0.073, 0.735]; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig  6c)</ref>. Of note, there was not a significant effect of participant scores on this apathy factor (F4) on parameter estimates capturing sensitivity to the level of stake (βF4_stakescale_reward : = 1.06, 95% posterior HDI=[-1.158, 3.457]; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6b</ref>) or the level of effort required (βF4_effortscale_reward : = -0.47, 95% posterior HDI=[-1.636, 0.666]; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S5</ref>).</p><p>In contrast to scores on the specific factor capturing apathy, elevated scores on the specific factor capturing anticipatory anhedonia (F5_reversed) showed no  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6b</ref>). This was associated with a pattern in which individuals with higher scores on F5_reversed (i.e., higher anticipatory anhedonia as captured by this specific factor) were less willing to engage in effortful pursuit than those with low anhedonia for low stakes, but equivalently so when the reward was greater (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure S7a</ref> for illustration). Jointly, these results indicate distinct mechanisms of operation for different latent dimensions of depressive symptoms upon effortful reward pursuit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influences of anxious affect on effortful reward pursuit</head><p>Higher scores on the specific factor tapping worry (F3) were associated with a significantly larger drop in effortful engagement over time (β_F3_timeontask_reward: = 0.464, 95% posterior HDI=[0.123, 0.801]; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6c</ref>). This acts to offset the non-significant baseline tendency of individuals with higher scores on F3 to choose to exert effort across all effort and stake levels ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6a</ref>). This contrasts with the effects of the factor tapping behavioral apathy (F4), where a baseline bias to decline to exert effort is compounded by an effect in the same direction of time on task.</p><p>Finally, we also found that higher scores on F1, which captures mixed symptoms of somatic anxiety and depression, were significantly associated with heightened sensitivity to stake (reward) level (β_F1_stakescale_reward: = 2.06, 95% posterior HDI=[0.038, 4.267]; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6b</ref>). This may suggest that mixed anxiety and depressive symptoms, which can be associated with greater overall symptom severity, are particularly linked to requiring larger magnitude rewards to exert effort as observed for F5_reversed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effortful avoidance of threat: heightened bias but reduced sensitivity in worriers</head><p>We next examined the influence of participant factor scores on group-level parameter estimates for data from the aversive version of the EBDM task ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>). In line with the hypothesis that anxiety-related components of negative affect might be associated with increased willingness to exert effort to avoid threat, elevated scores on the latent specific factor associated with worry (F3) were significantly associated with a decreased baseline bias against engaging in effortful avoidance of shock receipt (β_F3_baseline_threat: = -2.304, 95% posterior HDI = [-4.585, -0.198]), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7a</ref>.

Thus, in the mirror image of the effect of anhedonia in the case of reward, individuals with high worry scores were more willing to engage in effortful avoidance than those with lower worry for low stakes, but equivalently so when the threatened punishment level was high (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S6b</ref> for illustration).</p><p>No other latent dimension of negative affect modulated any of the computations involved in effortful threat avoidance as assessed by our winning model ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S5</ref>). show posterior means and 95% highest density intervals (HDI) for the effect of each of the five specific factors from the bifactor analysis of anxious and depressed affect, upon parameter posterior values obtained by fitting the winning model (Model #6) to performance on the threat version of the EBDM task.

(b) Modulation of group-level posterior parameter values for the linear effect of stake ( ). Scores on specific factor F3 were also associated with reduced sensitivity to stake (threat) level when deciding whether to exert effort.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>To date, human studies examining the relationship between internalizing psychopathology and effort-based decision-making have largely focused upon depression, associated dimensional measures of apathy and anhedonia, and the pursuit of reward. It is difficult to be certain as to the specificity of the reported associations given the lack of work on effortful avoidance of threat, the high comorbidity between anxiety and depression and the substantial shared variance between participants' scores on scales tapping anhedonia and apathy. We sought to address this in the work reported here.</p><p>To address specificity with regards to domain (reward or threat), we created parallel versions of an EBDM task and fit a common computational model to participants' performance on both task versions to capture the impact of underlying computational processes on choice. To address specificity with regards to different sub-dimensions of internalizing symptoms, we fit a bifactor model to item-level responses from questionnaire measures of anxiety and depression. This enabled us to separate common variance linked to a higher-level 'general' factor from that uniquely captured by lower-level specific factors, including, crucially, ones capturing apathy, anhedonia, and worry with shared symptom variance removed. Finally, we brought this together by performing hierarchical Bayesian inference jointly over decision-making parameters and the parameterized effects of individual differences in factor scores.</p><p>Our first aim was to determine whether different subdimensions of depressive affect act via common or unique computational mechanisms in their influence upon effortful pursuit of reward.</p><p>We found that elevated scores on latent factor F4, associated with behavioral apathy, were linked to an increased baseline bias towards declining effortful reward pursuit as well as a greater diminishment of effortful reward pursuit over the course of the task. In contrast, elevated scores on latent factor F5_reversed, associated with anticipatory anhedonia, were linked to heightened sensitivity to increases in stake level, which reflected a reduced willingness to engage in effortful trials for rewards of low magnitude that was overcome at higher reward levels <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 7a</ref>). These findings support the contention that distinct latent dimensions of depressive affect can influence effortful reward pursuit through different computational mechanisms. Given that anhedonia and apathy occur together in many, though not all, individuals with depressive disorders, this might lead to a compound effect in such individuals of both a reluctance to engage in effortful reward pursuit in general that increases with the time spent on the pursuit in hand and reduced willingness to pursue rewarding activities unless the reward magnitude is perceived to be of especially high subjective value.</p><p>Identifying the specific component mechanisms impacted by different subdimensions of depressive affect might help in the development of personalized interventions. For example, the current findings may suggest that an individual with high anticipatory anhedonia might benefit most from encouragement to revalue activities seen as of low reward value or to test how they feel after engaging in such activities. In addition, establishing the extent to which pharmacological interventions increase baseline willingness to engage in effortful pursuit of reward, decrease the drop off in willingness to engage across time or alter the change in weight given to activities seen as mildly, moderately or extremely pleasurable would also be of value.</p><p>Our second main aim was to determine whether anxiety-specific affect is associated with differences in effortful decision-making, and if so whether this varies between effortful reward pursuit and effortful threat avoidance. In the effortful threat avoidance task, the latent factor with high loadings on worry-related questionnaire items (F3), was the only latent factor to modulate parameter values significantly. Scores on this factor were associated both with an increased baseline willingness to exert effort to avoid threat, and decreased sensitivity to increases in threat level, suggesting that individuals with high levels of anxiety-specific affect show willingness to exert effort to avoid even low levels of threat. Here, our work extends and complements findings from studies using instrumental threat avoidance paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58</ref> ; by novelly examining the extent to which anxious individuals' avoidance of threat is modulated by the level of effort required to engage in avoidance or by the severity of the threat to be avoided.</p><p>The influence of F3 scores on parameter values for the reward variant of the EBDM task showed a notably different pattern. There was no significant modulation by F3 scores of either baseline bias to engage in effortful pursuit of reward or sensitivity to increases in reward level ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S5</ref>) and elevated F3 scores were actually associated with greater diminishment of effortful reward pursuit over the course of the task. This reveals a distinct and opposing relationship between high anxious affect and propensity to exert effort in avoidance of threat versus pursuit of reward. The reward and threat versions of the EBDM tasks were completed on different days so there is unlikely to be a direct trade-off in effort exertion between the two tasks; instead, this could potentially reflect a more trait-like preference as to under which circumstances to exert effort.</p><p>Our third aim was to determine whether anxious versus depressive affect differentially modulate effortful decision-making in reward pursuit and threat avoidance. Our initial hypotheses were informed by the rodent literature where anxious phenotypes have showed reduced inertia on the forced swim task, in contrast to depressive phenotypes, which showed increased inertia. Our findings for increased willingness to exert effort in avoidance of threat in individuals with high anxious affect (F3 scores) fall in line with these rodent findings. However, in contrast to our predictions, there was no significant effect of any of the depression-related specific factors on effortful avoidance of threat ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S6</ref>). Here, one possibility is that due to the ethical constraints in the levels of electrical stimulation used in our task with humans (where participants select the highest level that they are willing to receive), our manipulation of threat did not sufficiently parallel the rodent experience in the forced swim test. When we consider the full picture across both effortful pursuit of reward and avoidance of threat, we do see clear differential influences of depression and anxiety-specific affect. High scores on latent dimensions tapping symptoms of apathy and anticipatory anhedonia were associated with different facets of reduced willingness to exert effort in pursuit of reward but did not modulate effortful avoidance of threat.</p><p>In contrast, elevated scores on the latent dimension tapping worry were linked with reduced effort in pursuit of reward as a function of time on task but increased effort in avoidance of threat.</p><p>A limitation of our current work is that we were not able to separate clearly the unique correlates of cognitive versus anxious affect. Items on the MASQ anxious arousal subscale loaded highly onto specific factor 1, along with items belonging to both somatic and cognitive subscales of the Beck Depression Inventory. Factor 1 hence seemed to capture mixed anxiety and depression symptoms, particularly those of a somatic nature. We were interested to find that scores on F1 were linked to increased sensitivity to stake level in the reward EBDM task, potentially reflecting reduced willingness to exert effort in pursuit of smaller sized rewards, in a similar pattern to that observed for the latent factor capturing anticipatory anhedonia ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>). The co-presence of anxious and depressed affect can be a proxy for symptom severity. Future work indexing not only symptom breadth but also level of functional impairment would be able to address this further and to examine the relationship between level of functional impairment and sensitivity to effort level, which was the one parameter impacted by scores on the general factor ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S6</ref>).</p><p>Another limitation is that our sample size was constrained by conducting the study in person as opposed to online to be able to examine EBDM in avoidance of threat as well as in pursuit of reward. In the hierarchical modeling framework used, the inference over the joint posterior automatically captures increased uncertainty due to the inclusion of multiple parameters and regressors of interest making it less likely to find statistically credible posterior 95% HDIs and reducing the likelihood of type I error <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59</ref> . Despite this, it would be of value to replicate the current results in a larger sample.</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that different subdimensions of depressed and anxious symptoms do indeed act via computationally distinct pathways in their influences on effortful decisionmaking in humans. This points to the value of computationally modeling performance on tasks tapping effortful avoidance of threat as well as effortful pursuit of reward to differentiating individuals with varying internalizing symptom profiles and to understanding the distinct computational processes that potentially give rise to common behavioral phenotypes. Currently, the majority of individuals presenting with anxiety and depressive disorders are treated through a trial-and-error approach with the same default first-line cognitive and pharmacological treatments of choice, despite potentially very different symptom profiles. More nuanced information about the relationship of specific symptom profiles with specific deficits in the computations underlying willingness to exert effort to pursue reward or avoid threat may allow for more theoretically driven approaches to be developed.</p></div>

Participants recruited through AMT were compensated $12. Participants through RPP were compensated with 1.5 psychology course credits. Each participant completed online informed consent prior to completion of the questionnaire battery; the study and consent process were approved by the UC Berkeley Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects.</p><p>The second dataset, used for confirmatory analysis, included n=252 participants recruited via AMT (comprising 97 male and 155 female participants, average age 42.8 +/-12.1 years) who participated in a separate online behavioral study conducted by our lab. This online behavioral study included the questionnaire battery used in the current study. These participants also completed an online behavioral learning task; however, only the relevant questionnaire data were used in the current study. Each participant completed online informed consent prior to participation in this study. The study and consent process were approved by the UC Berkeley Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects. Participants were compensated $20 for participating in the study, plus a $5 bonus to incentivize performance during the behavioral task (not analyzed here).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exclusions</head><p>Upon session completion, all participants recruited through AMT were directed to a final screen in which they were informed that they had completed the session and that their payment was guaranteed, and they were asked to respond honestly to three final questions to aid in the accuracy of our research (following 60 ). Participants were asked to confirm 1) whether they were physically located in the United States; 2) whether they had used cannabis in the previous two weeks; and 3) whether they thought we should include their data in our study based on their own judgment of their attentiveness and honesty. Responses to these questions indicating lack of attention, cannabis use or location outside the United States were used to exclude participants from later analysis. In addition, we embedded questionnaire attention checks throughout the online questionnaires for AMT participants (e.g., 'Select 'b' to show you are paying attention'); participants who failed these checks were also excluded. A total of n=86 participants were excluded from the EFA data and n=29 from the CFA data (resulting in the final post-exclusion counts reported above of n=453 for the EFA data set and n=252 for the CFA data set).</p></div>

We augmented a questionnaire battery used in previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref>  Bifactor modeling of questionnaire item-level responses Bifactor modeling of item-level responses was used to parse variance linked to a higher-order general factor from that linked to lower-level specific factors. This approach has shown considerable success in capturing symptom variance associated with psychopathological conditions such as depression and anxiety, which are characterized by both shared and unique symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> .</p><p>To account for the ordinal nature of the item responses, polychoric correlations were used in all analyses. Sampling adequacy was confirmed using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test, which yielded a sampling adequacy of 0.82 (values over 0.80 are considered adequate) on the polychoric item correlation matrix for the exploratory dataset. A parallel eigenvalue decomposition analysis, which uses resampling techniques to compare the covariance of item responses with identically sized matrices generated from random Gaussian noise indicated that up to 21 factors might be reliably distinguished from noise. This number of identifiable factors might reflect the large sample size and the associated possibility of overfitting.</p><p>We performed exploratory bifactor analyses, specifying one general factor and varying the numbers of specific factors, to compare model fit. Bifactor analysis was conducted in R using the psych package omega function. The Schmid-Leiman procedure 61 was used to transform an oblique factor analysis of the full item response data into a bifactor structure with orthogonality of the common and specific factors. Resulting factor loadings were thresholded to only include loadings &gt; 0.2.</p><p>A comparison of the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), which assesses model fit while penalizing for complexity, showed continued improvement in exploratory model fit as additional specific factors (up to seven, the maximum tested) were included. We next assessed the fit of each model to the confirmatory data set using both confirmatory fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis measure of fit. Confirmatory fit measures of 0.95 or higher are considered a strong fit. When more than five specific factors were included, the confirmatory fit metrics were less than 0.95, indicating that increasing the number of specific factors above five resulted in a worse fit in the confirmatory dataset, and suggesting that more complicated models were overfit to the exploratory data.</p><p>The bifactor model with five subfactors provided the best exploratory model fit (BIC = 4468, Cronbach's alpha = 0.96 and McDonald's omegatotal = 0.97) while maintaining a confirmatory fit index (CFI) above 0.95 in the confirmatory dataset. Additionally, this model provided greater factor interpretability than models with fewer specific factors. Importantly, this included specific factors that captured symptoms pertaining to apathy and anhedonia, allowing the correlates of these symptom dimensions to be separately investigated while accounting for, and removing, common symptom variance.</p><p>To check the face validity of the factors that comprised the winning bifactor model, we calculated a factor score for each participant whose data was included in the exploratory dataset using the Anderson-Rubin method, which preserves orthogonality of the general and specific scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62</ref> . We then assessed the correlation of these factor scores with participants' summary scores for the original questionnaire scales and subscales. The summary scores for most of the questionnaire scales showed significant correlations with the common factor 'G', indicating that this factor successfully captured variance common to the different anxiety and depression measures included in the study. Individual specific factors correlated with measures comprising their major features, as described in the main text.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants completed two in-lab sessions, each of a maximum 2 hours duration. Each participant provided written informed consent prior to participation in each study session. The sessions were scheduled to be completed on different days to ameliorate the effects of fatigue but were restricted to be within 5 days of each other. At the start of each session, after completing informed consent, participants were asked a series of questions to establish eligibility. Participants were informed of restrictions prior to recruitment and were not allowed to continue if they reported cannabis use within the previous 2 weeks, or if they were currently taking antidepressant or anxiolytic medications. Prior to the threat avoidance session, participants were also given a short medical screening to ensure that participants with a history of fainting, vasovagal syncope, or any heart condition or pacemaker-like devices did not participate (out of an abundance of caution). Session order was counterbalanced across participants.</p><p>The tasks, questionnaires, and consent processes were approved by the UC Berkeley Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects. Participants could choose whether to receive psychology course participation credit in the amount of 1 credit per hour as their main source of study compensation (UC Berkeley students only, credited in accordance with UC Berkeley RPP policies), or to receive cash compensation of $15 per hour for each of the two study sessions. Study sessions were scheduled and paid for a minimum of 2 hours each. All participants received a $2.50 bonus during each session to incentivize maximal effort during effort calibration. Participants also received a $15 bonus upon completing the second session to incentivize completion of both sessions. During the reward session, participants 'picked apples'; at the end of the session, the proportion of total possible apples successfully picked was converted pro-rata to a cash bonus of between $0 and $7.50. Participants were not informed in advance of how points collected would be converted to the bonus payment but were aware they would earn a greater bonus by collecting more apples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaires</head><p>The questionnaires were as described above. They were divided across the two sessions and administered prior to task performance. We used the factor loadings from the winning bifactor model described above to calculate factor scores for each participant using the same methodology as described above <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62</ref> . The correlation of these factor scores with in-lab participants' summary scores on the original questionnaire scales and subscales were highly congruent with the correlations found in the exploratory analysis (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calibration of effort</head><p>Participants exerted effort in both versions of the task by applying squeezing pressure to a dynamometer (hand grip) device from BioPac with their dominant hand. Following task instructions, but before any study trials, the maximum level of force to be used in the experiment was calibrated to be challenging but attainable to the individual participant. To perform the calibration, participants were shown an empty tree with a top ladder rung set to a very high difficultly level (no participants reached or exceeded the initial top rung difficulty level during calibration). Participants were told to squeeze with their maximal force while remaining comfortable, and that they might receive a bonus if they climbed high enough on the tree. Participants were then given two more such trials, with the instruction to see if they could exceed their previous height. All participants received the full bonus regardless of actual effort exerted during calibration.</p><p>The maximum force applied by a given participant during calibration was set as the Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . Since our task required participants to briefly sustain the required force for a period of at least 0.5 seconds, and since participants completed 6 blocks of trials, we set 85% of the MVC as the participant's "sustainable" MVC (SMVC). The highest level of effort required for the task was set equal to the SMVC, and each lower level of effort was reduced by 10% of the SMVC.</p><p>Participants performed the calibration at the beginning of each session to account for possible inter-day differences in grip strength. However, the SMVC on the second session was capped such that it did not vary by more than 15% from the initial session SVMC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calibration of electrical stimulation</head><p>In the threat avoidance version of the EBDM task, electrical stimulation was delivered via a DigiTimer constant current stimulator model DS7A. Prior to the start of the session, the electrode was sanitized and attached to the inside of the wrist of the participant's non-dominant hand using hypoallergenic medical tape. The experimenter adjusted the voltage to just above zero and administered single 2ms test pulses while increasing the voltage until the participant reported that they could feel a sensation similar to that of a small pinprick. This level of voltage was then set as the participant's baseline (level 1).</p><p>We next calibrated the maximum amount of stimulation that might be delivered to the participant during the task. Starting with a single level 1 pulse, we increased the number of level 1 pulses, asking the participant to rate each stimulation burst on a scale of 1 to 10, informing them that a subjective level 7 was the highest level we would ever administer. Participants were instructed that level 7 should be a level that they would wish to avoid, but which they found tolerable, and which would not cause them any lasting distress. Once a participant indicated that their level 7 had been reached, we randomly sampled 14 additional ratings by repeating various numbers of pulses between but not inclusive of levels 1 through 7 and asking the participant to rate each burst of stimulation. Previous literature has indicated a non-linear (sigmoidal) relationship between increasing numbers of electrical pulses and increased subjective ratings of stimulation aversiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63</ref> . Once ratings were complete, a sigmoid curve was fit to the ratings data between levels 1 and 7 (see <ref type="figure">Figure S8</ref>). Evenly spaced points on the curve were defined to represent the intermediate stimulation levels 2-6. In the rare case that a participant responded unreliably to the varying pulse numbers and a sigmoid curve could not be fit, the calibration procedure was repeated. Calibration was also repeated if a participant reached their subjective level 7 before 8 pulses had been delivered or did not reach their subjective level 7 by the time 32 pulses were delivered. Once the sigmoid curve had been successfully fit to the participant's final calibration data, the subjective ratings and corresponding number of pulses were used to determine the stimulation delivered in the threat avoidance version of the EBDM task (see below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The effort-based decision-making task: reward pursuit version</head><p>After instructions, calibration of force, and two practice trials, each participant completed 6 blocks of 26 trials each, with a 10-second rest period after every 5 trials, and a 30-second rest period after each block. Trials were designed such that each block contained one full set of orthogonally manipulated combinations of the 5 possible effort levels and 5 possible reward levels, plus one additional trial per block. Trials were pseudo-randomized and fixed across participants.</p><p>On each trial, an image of a tree was displayed. The trunk of the tree contained an empty vertical rectangle, intersected by 5 horizontal lines in the upper half of the rectangle representing "ladder rungs" to which the participant might be asked to climb. The top of the box (i.e., the top ladder rung) represented the participant's sustainable maximum voluntary contraction (SMVC), which was set according to the "calibration of force" section above. Each lower rung then represented a 10% reduction in force, with the rungs visually spaced linearly in the top half of the box to illustrate 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% of the SMVC.</p><p>On each trial, one of five possible levels of reward was offered by showing 1, 4, 8, 12, or 16 apples displayed in the tree. In addition, a ladder rung was highlighted to indicate the amount of force (60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% of the SMVC) that would be required to successfully climb the tree and gain the apples for that trial. A participant was given 5 seconds to decide whether or not to climb the tree to obtain the reward. If they declined a trial, they received 0 apples, and proceeded to the next trial. If they accepted the trial, they were given 5 seconds to climb to the appropriate ladder rung by applying a sufficient amount of grip force to the dynamometer. Real-time feedback of the grip was shown as a red color filling the rectangle displayed on the tree as the participant squeezed. If the participant held the force at or above the appropriate ladder rung for at least 0.5 seconds, they obtained the apples at the end of the trial and were shown a message that indicated they had added the specified number of apples to their basket. Otherwise, they gained zero apples, and a message was displayed indicating that they had not succeeded. Participants were informed that they would receive a bonus based on how many apples they collected during the task but were not informed of the conversion rate and were not shown their balance of apples already gathered over time. At the end of the task, the bonus was calculated by prorating the maximum bonus of $7.50 according to the number of apples successfully gathered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The effort-based decision-making task: threat avoidance version</head><p>The threat avoidance version of the EBDM task was structurally parallel to the reward pursuit version, but here participants chose whether to climb trees in order to escape varying numbers of bear traps around the base of the tree <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(1, 4, 8, 12</ref>, or 16 bear traps; no apples shown) which represented various levels of electrical stimulation. The trial structure, with five levels of effort level and five levels of stimulation was identical to that for reward pursuit. Participants were informed that their subjective calibration of electrical stimulation levels would be translated into the number of bear traps shown, and that higher numbers of bear traps indicated higher levels of stimulation but were not specifically informed of the conversion mapping. This mapping was set such that the 5 distinct numbers of bear traps corresponded to subjectively rated stimulation levels 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 for the given participant. Trial timings and force requirements were as described for the reward pursuit version of the EBDM task. If participants elected not to exert effort on a given trial or did not manage to maintain the required level of effort for 500ms they received the level of electrical stimulation associated with that trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational modeling of behavior</head><p>We modeled participants' performance on the reward pursuit and threat avoidance versions of the EBDM task using a class of subjective value (SV) models that capture participants' valuation of both stake (level of reward or threat) and effort. We began with a model which considered only stake level, effort level, and general proclivity to engage, or decline to engage, in effortful pursuit of reward or avoidance of threat, respectively (see Model 1, below). We then incrementally augmented the model with parameters of known behavioral/theoretical interest. At each stage of augmentation, we assessed model fit using the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criteria (WAIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">56</ref> , a method which assesses comparative model fit while penalizing for model complexity in a hierarchical Bayesian fitting framework. We retained parameters that improved model fit. To be able to test equivalent hypotheses for reward pursuit and threat avoidance we included separate parameters for reward and threat trials in a single joint model, and either kept or rejected a given parameter for both trial types based on change in model performance.</p><p>Since our main hypotheses concerned the effect of individual differences in latent dimensions of negative affect on effortful choice behavior, each model included parameters which assessed the influence of participant factor scores on each group-level model parameter distribution. Following 49 , these were formulated as parameterized offsets to each group level parameter mean based upon individual differences in factor scores. In addition, for each threat parameter, we modeled a group-level offset parameter for baseline level of shock defined by each participant as their "level 1" (denoted L1mV) to control for potential differences in baseline shock sensitivity (see Equation 3b below for an example).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation</head><p>We used a hierarchical Bayesian sampling approach to infer posterior distributions for model parameters at the individual and group level as well as to assess the effects of participant-wise scores on latent factors of negative affect. Models were fit using MCMC sampling using the rstan package <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64</ref> in R. For each model, four chains of posterior sampling were run, each with 5500 total iterations and 3500 "burn-in" iterations. Convergence of the sampling was determined by visual inspection of MCMC sampling chains and inspection of the Gelman-Rubin statistics for parameters. Gelman-Rubin statistics provide a measure of the consistency of parameter variance within sampling chains versus between sampling chains. Values very close to 1.0 are generally considered ideal as they indicate high reliability of variance sampling across independent Markov chains. 99.5% of Gelman-Rubin statistics across 936 measures of convergence were between 0.999 and 1.01 in our final model. 0.5% of the statistics were between 1.01 and 1.07, and none was above 1.07. All of the group-level ( ) parameters quantifying the influence of latent factors of negative affect on task performance which were used for testing our main hypotheses had Gelman-Rubin statistics between 1.000 and 1.006, indicating that all had high convergence reliability. The inclusion of the group-level ( ) parameters in the hierarchical inference allowed the uncertainty of each result to be directly quantified in the context of the entire joint posterior distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59</ref> .</p><p>Each participant-level parameter was assumed to be drawn from a Gaussian group-level distribution for that parameter described as ~Normal(µ, s 2 ). Latent dimension factor scores were parameterized as offsets to each group distribution mean to assess the impact of individual differences in these factor scores on model parameters capturing the computations underlying task performance (see 3a,b below). Hyperparameters were given uninformative priors of µ ~ Normal(0,10) and s ~ HalfNormal <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Latent dimension offset parameters were given uninformative priors of ~ Normal(0,10).</p><p>As an example, shown below is the fully expanded group-level distribution for the linear stakescale parameter. This example shows the separation of parameters for reward-pursuit and threatavoidance trials and the individual difference offset parameters ( ) for each factor score (and for baseline level of electrical stimulation for threat avoidance trial parameters).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3(b)</head><p>Model #1: SV Model For the simplest model (Model #1), participants' choices were assumed to be influenced by the level of stake on offer ( ) and the level of effort required ( ) for a given trial (t). We also included a baseline bias parameter (b) which captured individuals' general propensity to decline to exert effort; this was applied separately from subjective net value. Model #1 therefore included inference over 6 total participant-level parameters: 3 ( reward, reward, breward) for reward pursuit trials and a parallel 3 for threat avoidance trials ( threat, threat, bthreat). A logistic function was used to map each participant's valuation of the trial to a probability of trial acceptance, and the (yes/no) choice to engage on each trial was assumed to follow a Bernoulli distribution at that probability.</p><p>The subjective net value (SNV) for trial t for Model #1 was calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">SNVt = ( Staket ) -( Effortt ) 4(a)</formula><p>The probability that a participant chose to engage on the trial was then given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P(Engage)t = (1 + exp(-[ SNVt -b])) -1 4(b)</formula><p>Note that the placement of the parameters was a matter of chosen convention; for example, the baseline offset parameter b could be moved from the choice probability formula in 4b to the SNV calculation in 1a without changing the model in any way. We chose to characterize SNV as relating only to stake level and effort level for conceptual clarity.</p><p>The group-level mean and standard deviation for , and b were inferred jointly with the participant-level parameters. At the same time, parameter values were also inferred for group-level offsets applied to the group-level distributional means ( ) to capture the influence of participants' scores on each latent factor from the winning bifactor model (G, F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5_reversed). For the threat-avoidance version of the EBDM task, an additional group level offset was applied to each of the group-level distributional means ( ) to account for any influence of inter-subject differences in objective electrical stimulation level used for 'level 1' shock (L1mV). Model #1 therefore included inference over 51 group-level hyperparameters as follows: grouplevel and for each of the 6 participant-level parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>; group-level offsets for each BF5 factor score (G, F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5_reversed) applied to each group-level distributional mean <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(36)</ref>; and group level offsets for baseline electrical stimulation level (L1mV) applied to each threat avoidance parameter group-level distributional mean (3).</p><p>The WAIC for Model #1 was 7,237.58 with standard error (SE) = 127.64. This was used as a basis for comparison of model fit for subsequent models, with lower WAIC indicating better fit to the data. Following Model #1, we considered additional variables that might affect the subjective value computation, increasing the complexity by including one additional participant-level parameter for reward pursuit trials and the equivalent parameter for threat avoidance trials at each stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model #2: SVT Model</head><p>We next incorporated a parameter to account for decreasing engagement with time on task ( reward, threat). This parameter was tied to the (z-scored) current trial number.</p><p>The SNV for trial t for Model #2 was calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">SNVt = ( Staket ) -( Effortt ) 6(a)</formula><p>The probability that a participant chose to engage on the trial was then given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P(Engage)t = (1 + exp(-[ SNVt -• Trialt -b])) -1 6(b)</formula><p>This model provided a substantially better fit to the data over Model #1 (Model #2 WAIC=5,836.48), so the time-on-task parameter was carried forward to future models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model #3: SVTP Model</head><p>We next explored whether task performance would be better fit by allowing participants' valuation of stake to vary both linearly and nonlinearly, as suggested by utility theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">66</ref> . For this model we incorporated a participant-level nonlinearity parameter for stake in reward pursuit and threat avoidance trials ( reward, threat).</p><p>We parameterized this in our model by calculating SNV at trial t for Model #3 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">SNVt = ( Staket ) -( Effortt ) 7(a)</formula><p>The probability that a participant chose to engage on the trial was then given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P(Engage)t = (1 + exp(-[ SNVt -• Trialt -b])) -1 7(b)</formula><p>The addition of reward and threat improved model fit over Model #2 (Model #3 WAIC=5,741.09), so reward and threat were included in further models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model #4: SVTP SperE</head><p>Next, we evaluated a participant-level parameter that quantified the sensitivity of each participant to increases in stake per unit effort ( reward, threat) as follows:</p><p>First, SNV at trial t for Model #4 was calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">SNVt = ( Staket ) -( Effortt ) + ( Staket/Effortt ) 8(a)</formula><p>The probability that a participant chose to engage on the trial was then given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P(Engage)t = (1 + exp(-[ SNVt -• Trialt -b])) -1 8(b)</formula><p>Inclusion of reward and threat improved model fit over Model #3 (Model #4 WAIC=5,732.81), so the interaction term was included in further models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model #5: SVTP SperE Persev</head><p>We next assessed whether participants showed a tendency to perseverate in their choices (also referred to as "stickiness of choice"; hreward, hthreat) by including a parameter to capture the repetition of the previous choice made by the participant at each trial as follows. The probability that a participant chose to engage on the trial was then given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P(Engage)t = (1 + exp(-[ SNVt -• Trialt + h • Choicet-1 -b])) -1 9(b)</formula><p>This model improved fit to the data compared with Model #4 (Model #5 WAIC=5,717.80), so the parameter for perseveration was included in subsequent models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model #6: SVTP SperE Persev Psuccess</head><p>Our experimental paradigm was designed so that all levels of effort should be achievable by each individual. We calibrated each participant's highest possible required level of effort on any trial to be 85% of their maximum force demonstrated during effort calibration. However, possibly due to fatigue or fluctuation in ability or willingness to exert effort, some participants accepted some trials but still failed to achieve the level of effort required for success. We investigated whether an individual's running average within-session probability of success on trials at a given effort level influenced their choices at that effort level (rreward, rthreat). This was parameterized in the model as follows: This model provided an improved fit to the data over Model #5 (Model #6 WAIC=5,709.68), and therefore we included the parameterization of probability of success in the final model. Model #6 was the best-fitting model overall, and was used for all further hypothesis testing and inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model validation: simulated data</head><p>To validate the winning model, we simulated four data sets of 50 participants each based on the generative winning model using participant posterior mean parameter values and compared actual participant behavior to the final simulated data. This provides a test of whether the winning model can produce the pattern of choices by actual participants. The model-simulated data reproduced participant choice behavior and is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> of the main text (and in an alternative form in Supplements <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model validation: parameter recovery</head><p>We tested our ability to accurately recover parameter values by fitting the winning model (Model #6) to the simulated participant data sets described above. We then compared the true (known) parameter values to the model-fit (recovered) parameter values. In hierarchical Bayesian inference, a general goal for parameter recovery is that 95% of the recovered posterior parameter distributions include the true parameter value in their 95% highest density posterior interval. All parameters met or exceeded this criterion except the time-on-task parameter in reward pursuit, for which 94% of the recovered posterior distributions contained the true parameter value. See Supplemental <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S2</ref> for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model validation: model recovery</head><p>As a test of model recovery, we selected four models (the winning model, plus three of the nonwinning models) from among those that best fit task performance and simulated four separate data sets of 50 participants each for each of these models (using the participant posterior parameter means from each respective model): Model #2: SVT; Model #3: SVTP; Model #4: SVTP SperE; and the winning model SVTP SperE Persev Psuccess. Each of these 16 simulated data sets was then hierarchically fit by all four models, and we assessed which model fit each data set best based on the lowest WAIC measure across models for that data.

Each plot shows simulated participant data, with stake level on the x-axis, probability of trial engagement (decision to exert effort) on the y-axis, and data for each effort level plotted separately. Panel (a) shows simulated reward pursuit data using the posterior mean of participants' values for each parameter except for baseline bias (b) and linear stakescale ( ) parameters which were adjusted to reflect the mean across participants with above-median (dotted line) or belowmedian (solid line) scores on F5_reversed. Panel (b) shows an equivalent simulation for threat avoidance data with baseline bias (b) and linear stakescale ( ) parameters adjusted to reflect the mean across participants with abovemedian (dotted line) or below-median (solid line) scores on F3. We adjusted the baseline bias parameter, in addition to the stake parameter, given the significant relationship between F3 scores and baseline bias and to better capture the effect of the stake parameter with the baseline bias parameter included in the model. The simulations reveal that both anticipatory anhedonia (above median F5-reversed scores) and worry (above median F3 scores) primarily impact trial engagement at low stake levels, with anticipatory anhedonia being linked to reduced willingness to exert effort in pursuit of reward at low stake levels and worry to increased willingness to exert effort in avoidance of threat at low stake levels.
